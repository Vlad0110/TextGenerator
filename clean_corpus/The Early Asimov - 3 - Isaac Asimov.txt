death sentence     blind alley     no connection     the endochronic properties of  resublimated thiotimoline      the red queen s race      mother earth      introduction  after  time pussy   there followed a two month period during which i wrote nothing .   the reasons were twofold .  in the first place  pearl harbor put the united states in the war the day i wrote time pussy   and those first two months after the debacle were too disastrous and heartbreaking to allow much in the way of fiction composing .   if that in itself weren t enough  the time had come to try  once again  the qualifying examinations that would  or would not  grant me permission to do research .  i very much felt myself to be dangling over the abyss .  a second failure to pass would probably mean an end for me at columbia .  consequently  during those hours when i wasn t working in my father s candy store or hanging over the radio  i had to be studying .  there was time for nothing else at all .   hedging my bets rather desperately  i registered for graduate work at new york university  just in case i did not pass once again .  after i took my qualifying examinations  at the end of january       i actually attended a few classes at n . y . u .  while waiting for the results to be announced .    but i won t keep you in suspense .  on friday  the thirteenth of february  the results were announced .  i had passed  this time .   during the interval between the taking of the qualifying examinations and the annunciation  i managed to do  victory unintentional .   this was a positronic robot story that was a sequel to  not final .   which had not been a positronic robot story .  obviously i was trying to ride the series notion all i could  in the hope of surer sales .   i submitted it to campbell on february          and if i thought campbell would find himself unable to reject a series story  i was roundly disabused .  nor was he so impressed by  nightfall  and by my  foundation  series as to find himself incapable of making the rejection a severe one .   on february     the very day of my passing into the sacred list of those permitted to do research toward their ph . d .   my spirits were somewhat dashed when i received  victory unintentional  back with a cryptic rejection  which consisted of the   the last story in the early asimov  volume   .      following  in toto   chsc ch ch sh .   campbell very well knew that this was the formula for  butyl  mercaptan   which gives the skunk its smell  and i very well knew it  too  and campbell very well knew i knew .   oh  well .  i managed to sell it anyway  to super science stories under its post pohl editor  on march           and it appeared in the august      issue of that magazine .  though i did not include it in i  robot  i did include it  of necessity  in the rest of the robots .   after that  though  there came another dry period  the longest i was ever to experience .  once  victory unintentional  was finished  fourteen months   .   were to pass before i turned back to the typewriter .  it was not the conventional  writer s block   of course  for that i have never experienced .  rather  it was the coming of a vast  triple change in my life .   the first change was the fact that i was now beginning chemical research in earnest under professor charles r .  daw son .  research is a full time job and i still had to work it around  somehow  my duties in my father s candy store   . so there was bound to be very little time for writing .   then  as though that weren t enough  a second change took place simultaneously      in january      i joined an organization called  the brooklyn writers  club   which had sent me a postcard of invitation .  i took the invitation to be a recognition of my status as a  writer  and i couldn t possibly have refused .   the first meeting i attended was on january          .  it turned out to be rather pleasant .  i welcomed the chance to get my mind off the qualifying examinations and the war disasters  though i remember spending part of that first meeting discussing the possibility that new york might be bombed  .   most of the members of the club were no further advanced in the profession than i was  nor were any of them  aside from myself  science fiction writers .  the chief activity consisted of reading from our own manuscripts so that criticism from the others might be invited .  since it was quickly discovered that i read  with expression   i became chief reader  a role i enjoyed .   it was to be eight years yet before i discovered that i had a natural flair for the lecture platform .    on february          the third meeting i attended  there was present a young man  joseph goldberger  whom i had not met      before .  he was a couple of years older than i was .  i did most of the reading that day and goldberger was sufficiently impressed to suggest  after the meeting had adjourned  that the two of us  with our girls  go out on a double date and get to know each other .  embarrassed  i had to explain that i had no girl .  with an expansive gesture  he said he would get one for me .   and so he did .  on february            valentine s day and the day after i had passed my qualifying examinations  i met him at the astor hotel at   .    p . m .  with him was his girlfriend  and with her was her girl friend  gertrude blugerman  who was going to be my blind date .   i fell in love  and when i wasn t thinking of research i was thinking of her .   but there was also a third change  in a way the most drastic     with war  the job situation suddenly changed  technically trained men of all sorts were in demand .   robert heinlein  for instance  was an engineer who had been trained at annapolis .  his health had retired him from active service in the navy and had kept him retired  but his annapolis connections made it possible for him to work as a civilian engineer at the naval air experimental station of the u . s .  navy yard in philadelphia .  he cast about for other qualified people he might persuade to join him there  particularly among his fellow science fiction writers .   he got l .  sprague de camp to come to the n . a . e . s .   and on march           i received a letter from the navy yard asking if i would consider joining them .   i am rather single minded and  having labored toward my ph . d .  for a year and a half  i would not ordinarily have considered letting go for anything short of a major force .    but the major force was there .  i was in love and i wanted to get married even more than i wanted my degree .  it occurred to me that i could suspend work toward my ph . d .  with the full approval of the school  thanks to the war emergency  and that i could also get full permission to resume after the war .  and by taking a job and postponing   merely postponing   my research  i could get married .   i went down to philadelphia for an interview on april    and apparently met their requirements .  i took the iob  and on may     having left my father s candy store at last and  at least as a worker  forever  i moved to philadelphia .  fortu       nately  philadelphia was only an hour and a half from new york by train  in those days  i couldn t drive a car and  even if i could  i wouldn t have been able to get the gasoline because of rationing  .  i was therefore back in new york every weekend .   by the twenty fourth of the month i had persuaded gertrude to agree to marry me  and on july    we were married .   during those months it did not bother me that i was doing no writing .  i had too much to think of   first the war  then research  then the job  then the marriage .   besides  in the years up to early       i never thought of my writing as anything but a way to help out with my college tuition .  it was fun  it was exciting  and such success as i managed to achieve was deeply satisfying   but it had been done to serve a purpose and that purpose had been served .  i had no notion that writing could be my career  that it could ever possibly be my career .   my career was to be chemistry .  all the time i was writing and selling stories  i was also slaving away at columbia .  once i earned my ph . d .   i intended to make my living by doing chemical research for some large industry at some munificent salary such as a hundred dollars a week .   as the son of a candy store keeper  brought up in the depression  i suffered dizzy spells if i tried to think of more than a hundred dollars a week  so i confined my ambitions to that .    my philadelphia job  to be sure  paid me only fifty dollars a week at the beginning  but a young couple could live on that  those days  with taxes very small  with an apartment costing     .    a month and dinner for two at a restaurant coming to two dollars  including tip  .   it wasn t the height of my dreams  but it was only a temporary war job  after all .  once the war was over  i would go back to my research and get my ph . d .  and a better job .  meanwhile  even a salary of        a year seemed to make it unnecessary for me to write .  by my marriage day  i had written forty two stories  of which twenty eight had been sold  and three more were yet to sell  .  my total bachelor earnings over a space of four years had been        .    for those twenty eight stories .  this amounted to an average earning of just under    .    per week or     per story .   i never dreamed at that time that i could ever do much      better .  i had no intention of ever writing anything but science fiction or fantasy for the pulp magazines  which paid one cent a word at most   a cent and a quarter with bonus .   to make even the feeble fifty dollars a week that my job paid me would make it necessary for me to write and sell some forty stories a year  and  at that time  that didn t seem conceivable to me .   it had been all right to labor at the typewriter to pay my way through school  when i had no other source of income  but for what purpose ought i to be writing now .  and with a six day  fifty four hour week  and the excitement of a new marriage  who had time .   the very existence of science fiction seemed to fade .  i had left my magazine collection in new york  i no longer saw campbell regularly  or pohl  or any of my science fiction cronies .  i scarcely even read the current magazines as they came out .   i might have let science fiction die altogether  and my writing career with it  except that there were little reminders from the outside world  and little itchings inside me that meant  though i didn t know it at the time  that writing was a great deal more to me than just a handy device to make a little spare cash .   i had hardly begun to work at the n . a . e . s .   for instance  when the june      issue of astounding came out with my story  bridle and saddle .   and it made the cover .   it was quite beyond my power to resist the temptation to take a copy to work and show it around .  i couldn t help but feel the status i gained as a  writer .   later that summer and fall  three other stories were published   victory unintentional  and  the imaginary  in the post pohl super science stories and  the hazing  in thrilling wonder stories .  each kept the science fiction world alive for me .   and although my new york coterie of science fiction editors  writers and readers were gone  i was left not entirely bereft .   working with me at the n . a . e . s .  were robert heinlein and l .  sprague de camp  and i kept up a close social relationship with both .  to be sure  each had quit writing for the duration but they were far more successful writers than i was and i hero worshipped them .  in addition  john d .  clark  who was an ardent science fiction fan and who had written and published a      couple of stories in       was living in philadelphia at the time and we frequently saw one another .  all three kept the science fiction atmosphere about me .   it was on january          though  that the real trigger came .  on that day i received a letter from fred pohl to the effect that he was planning to rewrite  legal rites  and was going to try to sell it again .  that was exciting .  he wasn t to succeed in selling the story for six more years  but of course i had no way of telling that .  to me it seemed that another sale was in the offing and that i was an as yet active writer .   besides   legal rites  was a fantasy and i had never yet satisfied that long standing desire to write and sell a fantasy to unknown .  five times i had tried  and five times i had failed .   on january     quite suddenly  a week after the letter had come and fourteen months after my last written story  the urge overwhelmed me .  i sat down to write a fantasy called  author .  author .    quickly i found there was something lacking .  it was the first time i had ever tried to write something for campbell without conferences with him .  i missed the inspiration that invariably came through talks with him  i missed his encouragement .  in fact  i wasn t sure that i could write at all without him .  so the story limped and there were dry spells .  i didn t finish the first draft till march    and the final version wasn t ready for mailing till april         .   it had taken me nearly three months to write the story .  to be sure  it was twelve thousand words long  but  bridle and saddle   which was half again as long  had taken me only three weeks .   perhaps if  author .  author .   had been rejected  it might have been a long time before i would have had the courage to try again .  fortunately  that was never put to the test .  i mailed the story to campbell on april          the first time i ever mailed him a story instead of handing it to him   and on the twelfth the check of acceptance arrived .  there was not even a revision requested  and what s more  campbell paid me a bonus for the first time since  nightfall .   i received one and a quarter cents a word  or       in all .  my sixth try at unknown had succeeded .   it was the equivalent of three weeks  pay at the n . a . e . s .  for something that had taken me  off and on  three months .  however  the three months  work on  author .  author .   had been      of a totally different kind than the three weeks  work at the n . a . e . s .  would have been  and the receipt of the      check was infinitely more exciting than picking up a similar check  or even a larger . one  earned in the course of a punch the time clock job .   yes  indeed  i punched a time clock at the n . a . e . s .    as it happened though  the happy excitement with which i greeted the sale was premature .  i had scaled the heights of unknown too late  and though i had the money  i didn t have the magazine .  robert heinlein brought me the sad news on august    less than four months after the sale .   unknown had been having a difficult time of it .  sales weren t high enough  and after its first two years of operation it had had to switch from monthly to bimonthly issues .  now the war had introduced a paper shortage and street   smith publications decided to save what paper it could receive for the more successful astounding and let unknown go .   at the time i made my sale  there were only three more issues of unknown fated to be issued and there was no room in any of them for  author .  author .   the story remained in the vaults of street   smith indefinitely  a story sold  but not published  and the      check was deprived of most of its fun as a result .   there is  however  a happy ending .  twenty years later  don bensen of pyramid publications was publishing a paperback anthology of stories from unknown  he asked me for an introduction .  with glad nostalgia i complied  writing it on january           almost twenty years to the day after i had started writing the only story i ever sold to the magazine .  in the course of the introduction  i referred to the sad story of my attempts to write for unknown .   the     s were not the     s .  in       the mere mention of an existing asimov story that had never been published produced excitement  and bensen wrote to me within three days  asking to see the story .  i dug out the manuscript  i saved them now  you see  even for twenty years  and sent it to him .   he asked permission to include it in a second anthology of unknown stories  pointing out that it had been accepted by the magazine  .  i explained he would also need permission from campbell and the publisher .  they very kindly granted the permission  and in january       twenty one years after it was written   author .  author .   was finally published and i finally   after a fashion  and glancingly   made unknown .           author .  author .   it occurred to graham dorn  and not for the first time  either  that there was one serious disadvantage in swearing you ll go through fire and water for a girl  however beloved .  sometimes she takes you at your miserable word .   this is one way of saying that he had been waylaid  shanghaied and dragooned by his fiancee into speaking at her maiden aunt s literary society .  don t laugh .  it s not funny from the speaker s rostrum .  some of the faces you have to look at .   to race through the details  graham dorn had been jerked onto a platform and forced upright .  he had read a speech on  the place of the mystery novel in american literature  in an appalled tone .  not even the fact that his own eternally precious june had written it  part of the bribe to get him to speak in the first place  could mask the fact that it was essentially tripe .   and then when he was weltering  figuratively speaking  in his own mental gore  the harpies closed in  for lo  it was time for the informal discussion and assorted feminine gush .       oh  mr .  dorn  do you work from inspiration .  i mean  do  you just sit down and then an idea strikes you   all at once .   and you must sit up all night and drink black coffee to keep  you awake till you get it down .      oh  yes .  certainly .   his working hours were two to four in the afternoon every other day  and he drank milk .        oh  mr .  dorn  you must do the most awful research to  get all those bizarre murders .  about how much must you do  before you can write a story .       about six months  usually .   the only reference books he ever used were a six volume encyclopedia and year before last s world almanac .    oh  mr .  dorn  did you make up your reginald de  meister from a real character .  you must have .  he s oh  so  convincing in his every detail .   he s modeled after a very dear boyhood chum of mine .    dorn had never known anyone like de meister  he lived in  the unknown    edited by d .  r .  bensen copyright         by isaac asimov      continual fear of meeting someone like him .  he had even a cunningly fashioned ring containing a subtle oriental poison for use just in case he did .  so much for de meister .    somewhere past the knot of women  june billings sat in her seat and smiled with sickening and proprietary pride .   graham passed a finger over his throat and went through the pantomime of choking to death as unobtrusively as possible .  june smiled  nodded  threw him a delicate kiss  and did nothing .   graham decided to pass a stern  lonely  woman less life and to have nothing but villainesses in his stories forever after .   he was answering in monosyllables  alternating yesses and noes .  yes  he did take cocaine on occasion .  he found it helped the creative urge .  no  he didn t think he could allow hollywood to take over de meister .  he thought movies weren t true expressions of real art .  besides  they were just a passing fad .  yes .  he would read miss cram s manuscripts if she brought them .  only too glad to .  reading amateur manuscripts was such fun  and editors are really such brutes .   and then refreshments were announced  and there was a sudden vacuum .  it took a split second for graham s head to clear .  the mass of femininity had coalesced into a single specimen .  she was four feet ten and about eighty five pounds in weight .  graham was six two and two hundred ten worth of brawn .  he could probably have handled her without difficulty  especially since both her arms were occupied with a pachyderm of a purse .  still  he felt a little delicate  to say nothing of queasy  about knocking her down .  it didn t seem quite the thing to do .   she was advancing  with admiration and fervor disgustingly clear in her eyes  and graham felt the wall behind him .  there was no doorway within armreach on either side .    oh  mr .  de meister   do  do please let me call you mr .  de meister .  your creation is so real to me  that i can t think of you as simply graham dorn .  you don t mind  do you .     no  no  of course not   gargled graham  as well as he could through thirty two teeth simultaneously set on edge .   i often think of myself as reginald in my more frivolous moments .     thank you .  you can have no idea  dear mr .  de meister  how i have looked forward to meeting you .  i have read all your works  and i think they are wonderful .     i m glad you think so .   he went automatically into the      modesty routine .   really nothing  you know .  ha  ha  ha .  like to please the readers  but lots of room for improvement .  ha  ha  ha .     but you really are  you know .   this was said with intense earnestness .   i mean good  really good .  i think it is wonderful to be an author like you .  it must be almost like being god .    graham stared blankly .   not to editors  sister .    sister didn t get the whisper .  she continued   to be able to create living characters out of nothing  to unfold souls to all the world  to put thoughts into words  to build pictures and create worlds .  i have often thought than an author was the most graciously gifted person in creation .  better an inspired author starving in a garret than a king upon his throne .  don t you think so .     definitely   lied graham .    what are the crass material goods of the world to the wonders of weaving emotions and deeds into a little world of its own .     what  indeed .     and posterity  think of posterity .     yes  yes .  i often do .    she seized his hand .  there s only one little request .  you might   she blushed faintly   you might give poor reginald   if you will allow me to call him that just once   a chance to marry letitia reynolds .  you make her just a little too cruel to him .  i m sure i weep over it for hours together sometimes .  but then he is too  too real to me .    and from somewhere  a lacy frill of handkerchief made its appearance  and went to her eyes .  she removed it  smiled bravely  and scurried away .  graham dorn inhaled  closed his eyes  and gently collapsed into june s arms .   his eyes opened with a jerk .   you may consider   he said severely   our engagement frazzled to the breaking point .  only my consideration for your poor  aged parents prevents your being known henceforward as the ex fiancee of graham dorn .     darling  you are so noble .   she massaged his sleeve with her cheeks .   come  i ll take you home and bathe your poor wounds .     all right  but you ll have to carry me .  has your precious  loveable aunt got an axe .     but why .     for one thing  she had the gall to introduce me as the brain       father  god help me  of the famous reginald de meister .     and aren t you .     let s get out of this creep joint .  and get this .  i m no relative by brain or otherwise  of that character .  i disown him .  i cast him into the darkness .  i spit upon him .  i declare him an illegitimate son  a foul degenerate  and the offspring of a hound  and i ll be damned if he ever pokes his lousy patrician nose into my typewriter again .    they were in the taxi  and june straightened his tie .   all right  sonny  let s see the letter .     what letter .    she held out her hand .   the one from the publishers .    graham snarled and flipped it out of his jacket pocket .   i ve thought of inviting myself to his house for tea  the damned flintheart .  he s got a rendezvous with a pinch of strychnine .     you may rave later .  what does he say .  hmm   uh huh   doesn t quite come up to what is expected   feel that de meister isn t in his usual form   a little revision perhaps towards   feel sure the novel can be adjusted   are returning under separate cover       she tossed it aside .   i told you you shouldn t have killed off sancha rodriguez .  she was what you needed .  you re getting skimpy on the love interest .     you write it .  i m through with de meister .  it s getting so club women call me mr .  de meister  and my picture is printed in newspapers with the caption mr .  de meister .  i have no individuality .  no one ever heard of graham dorn .  i m always  dorn  dorn  you know  the guy who writes the de meister stuff  you know .    june squealed   silly .  you re jealous of your own detective .     i am not jealous of my own character .  listen .  i hate detective stories .  i never read them after i got into the two syllable words .  i wrote the first as a clever  trenchant  biting satire .  it was to blast the entire false school of mystery writers .  that s why i invented this de meister .  he was the detective to end all detectives .  the compleat ass  by graham dorn .    so the public  along with snakes  vipers and ungrateful children takes this filth to its bosom .  i wrote mystery after mystery trying to convert the public       graham dorn drooped a little at the futility of it all .    oh  well .   he smiled wanly  and the great soul rose above adversity .   don t you see .  i ve got to write other things .  i can t      waste my life .  but who s going to read a serious novel by graham dorn  now that i m so thoroughly identified with de meister .     you can use a pseudonym .     i will not use a pseudonym .  i m proud of my name .     but you can t drop de meister .  be sensible  dear .     a normal fiancee   graham said bitterly   wou d want her future husband to write something really worthwhile and become a great name in literature .     well  i do want you to  graham .  but just a little de meister once in a while to pay the bills that accumulate .     ha .   graham knocked his hat over his eyes to hide the sufferings of a strong spirit in agony .   now you say that i can t reach prominence unless i prostitute my art to that unmentionable .  here s your place .  get out .  i m going home and write a good scorching letter on asbestos to our senile mr .  macdun lap .     do exactly as you want to  cookie   soothed june .   and tomorrow when you feel better  you ll come and cry on my shoulder  and we ll plan a revision of death on the third deck together  shall we .     the engagement   said graham  loftily   is broken .     yes  dear .  i ll be home tomorrow at eight .    that is of no possible interest to me .  good bye .    publishers and editors are untouchables  of course .  theirs is a heritage of the outstretched hand and the well toothed smile  the nod of the head and the slap of the back .   but perhaps somewhere  in the privacy of the holes to which authors scurry when the night falls  a private revenge it taken .  there  phrases may be uttered where no one can overhear  and letters may be written that need not be mailed  and perhaps a picture of an editor  smiling pensively  is enshrined above the typewriter to act the part of bulls eye in an occasional game of darts .   such a picture of macdunlap  so used  enlightened graham dorn s room .  and graham dora himself  in his usual writing costume  street clothes and typewriter   scowled at the fifth sheet of paper in his typewriter .  the other four were draped over the edge of the waste basket  condemned for their milk and watery mildness .   he began        dear sir      and added slowly and viciously   or madam  as the case may be .    he typed furiously as the inspiration caught him  disregarding the faint wisp of smoke curling upward from the overheated keys    you say you don t think much of de meister in this story .  well  i don t think much of de meister  period .  you can handcuff your slimy carcass to his and jump off the brooklyn bridge .  and i hope they drain the east river just before you jump .    from now on  my works will be aimed higher than your scurvy press .  and the day will come when i can look back on this period of my career with the loathing that is its just       someone had been tapping graham on the shoulder during the last paragraph .  graham twitched it angrily and ineffectively at intervals .   now he stopped  turned around  and addressed the stranger in his room courteously   who the devilish damnation are you .  and you can leave without bothering to answer .  i won t think you rude .    the newcomer smiled graciously .  his nod wafted the delicate aroma of some unobtrusive hair oil toward graham .  his lean  hard bitten jaw stood out keenly  and he said in a well modulated voice    de meister is the name .  reginald de meister .    graham rocked to his mental foundations and heard them creak .    glub   he said .    pardon .    graham recovered .   i said   glub   a little code word meaning which de meister .     the de meister   explained de meister  kindly .    my character .   my detective .    de meister helped himself to a seat  and his finely chiseled features assumed that air of well bred boredom so admired in the best circles .  he lit a turkish cigarette  which graham at once recognized as his detective s favorite brand  tapping it slowly and carefully against the back of his hand first  a mannerism equally characteristic .    really  old man   said de meister .   this is really excruciat inly funny .  i suppose i am your character  y know  but let s not work on that basis .  it would be so devastatin ly awkward .         glub   said graham again  by way of a rejoinder .   his mind was feverishly setting up alternatives .  he didn t drink  more  at the moment  was the pity  so he wasn t drunk .  he had a chrome steel digestion and he wasn t overheated  so it wasn t a hallucination .  he never dreamed  and his imagination   as befitted a paying commodity   was under strict control .  and since  like all authors  he was widely considered more than half a screwball  insanity was out of the question .   which left de meister simply an impossibility  and graham felt relieved .  it s a very poor author indeed who hasn t learned the fine art of ignoring impossibilities in writing a book .   he said smoothly   i have here a volume of my latest work .  do you mind naming your page and crawling back into it .  i m a busy man and god knows i have enough of you in the tripe i write .     but i m here on business  old chap .  i ve got to come to a friendly arrangement with you first .  things are deucedly uncomfortable as they are .     look  do you know you re bothering me .  i m not in the habit of talking to mythical characters .  as a general thing  i don t pal around with them .  beside which  it s time your mother told you that you really don t exist .     my dear fellow  i always existed .  existence is such a subjective thing .  what a mind thinks exists  does exist .  i existed in your mind  for instance  ever since you first thought of me .    graham shuddered .   but the question is  what are you doing out of my mind .  getting a little narrow for you .  want elbow room .     not at all .  rather satisfact ry mind in its way  but i achieved a more concrete existence only this afternoon  and so i seize the opportunity to engage you face to face in the aforementioned business conversation .  you see  that thin  sentimental lady of your society        what society .   questioned graham hollowly .  it was all awfully clear to him now .    the one at which you made a speech    de meister shuddered in his turn    on the detective novel .  she believed in my existence  so naturally  i exist .    he finished his cigarette and flicked it out with a negligent twist of the wrist .    the logic   declared graham   is inescapable .  now  what do      you want and the answer is no .     do you realize  old man  that if you stop writing de meister stories  my existence will become that dull  wraithlike one of all superannuated fictional detectives .  i d have to gibber through the gray mists of limbo with holmes  lecocoq and dupin .     a very fascinating thought  i think .  a very fitting fate .   reginald de meister s eyes turned icy  and graham suddenly remembered the passage on page     of the case of the broken ashtray   his eyes  hitherto lazy and unattentive  hardened into twin pools of blue ice and transfixed the butler  who staggered back  a stifled cry on his lips   evidently  de meister lost none of his characteristics out of the novels he adorned .   graham staggered back  a stifled cry on his lips .   de meister said menacingly   it would be better for you if the de meister mysteries continue .  do you understand .    graham recovered and summoned a feeble indignation .   now  wait a while .  you re getting out of hand .  remember  in a way  i m your father .  that s right .  your mental father .  you can t hand me ultimatums or make threats .  it isn t filial .  it s lacking in the proper respect and love .     and another thing .   said de meister  unmoved .   we ve got to straighten out this business of letitia reynolds .  it s gettin  deucedly borin   y know .     now you re getting silly .  my love scenes have been widely heralded as miracles of tenderness and sentiment not found in one murder mystery out of a thousand .    wait  i ll get you a few reviews .  i don t mind your attempts to dictate my actions so much  but i m damned if you ll criticize my writing .     forget the reviews .  tenderness and all that rot is what i don t want .  i ve been driftin  after the fair lady for five volumes now  and behavin  the most insufferable ass .  this has got to stop .     in what way .     i ve got to marry her in your present story .  either that  or make her a good  respectable mistress .  and you ll have to stop making me so damned victorian and gentlemanly towards ladies .  i m only human  old man .         impossible .   said graham   and that includes your last remark .    de meister grew severe .   really  old chap  for an author  you display the most appallio  lack of concern for the well bein  of a character who has supported you for a good many years .    graham choked eloquently .   supported me .  in other words  you think i couldn t sell real novels  hey .  well  i ll show you .  i wouldn t write another de meister story for a million dollars .  not even for a fifty percent royalty and all television rights .  how s that .    de meister frowned and uttered those words that had been the sound of doom to so many criminals   we shall see  but yon are not yet done with me .    with firmly jutting jaw  he vanished .   graham s twisted face straightened out  and slowly   very slowly   he brought his hands up to his cranium and felt carefully .   for the first time in a long and reasonably ribald mental life  he felt that his enemies were right and that a good dry cleaning would not hurt his mind at all .   the things that existed in it .   graham dorn shoved the doorbell with his elbow a second time .  he distinctly remembered her saying she would be home at eight .   the peep hole shoved open .   hello .     hello .    silence .   graham said plaintively   it s raining outside .  can t i come in to dry .     i don t know .  are we engaged  mr .  dorn .     if i m not   was the stiff reply   then i ve been turning down the frenzied advances of a hundred passion stricken girls  beautiful ones  all of them   for no apparent reason .     yesterday  you said        ah  but who listens to what i say .  i m just quaint that way .  look  i brought you posies .   he flourished roses before the peep hole .   june opened the door .   roses .  how plebeian .  come in  cookie  and sully the sofa .  whoa  whoa  before you move a step  what have you got under the other arm .  not the manu       script of death on the third deck .     correct .  not that excrescence of a manuscript .  this is something different .    june s tone chilled .   that isn t your precious novel  is it .    graham flung his head up   how did you know about it .     you slobbered the plot all over me at macdunlap s silver anniversary party .     i did not .  i couldn t unless i were drunk .     oh  but you were .  stinking is the term .  and on two cocktails too .     well  if i was drunk  i couldn t have told you the right plot .     is the setting a coal mine district .      uh yes .     and are the people concerned real  earthy  unartificial  down to earth characters  speaking and thinking just like you and me .  is it a story of basic economic forces .  are the human characters lifted up and thrown down and whirled around  all at the mercy of the coal mine and mechanized industry of today .      uh yes .    she nodded her head retrospectively .   i remember distinctly .  first  you got drunk and were sick .  then you got better  and told me the first few chapters .  then i got sick .    she approached the glowering author .   graham .   she leant her golden head upon his shoulder and cooed softly .   why don t you continue with the de meister stories .  you get such pretty checks out of them .    graham writhed out of her grasp .   you are a mercenary wretch  incapable of understanding an author s soul .  you may consider our engagement broken .    he sat down hard on the sofa  and folded his arms .   unless you will consent to read the script of my novel and give me the usual story analysis .     may i give you my analysis of death on the third deck first .     no .     good .  in the first place  your love interest is becoming sickening .     it is not .   graham pointed his finger indignantly .   it breathes a sweet and sentimental fragrance  as of an older day .  i ve got the review here that says it .   he fumbled in his wallet .        oh  bullfeathers .  are you going to start quoting that guy in the pillsboro  okla .   clarion .  he s probably your second cousin .  you know that your last two novels were completely below par in royalties .  and third deck isn t even being sold .     so much the better   ow .   he rubbed his head violently .   what did you do that for .     because the only place i could hit as hard as i wanted to  without disabling you  was your head .  listen .  the public is tired of your corny letitia reynolds .  why don t you let her soak her  gleaming golden crown of hair  in kerosene and get familiar with a match .     but june  that character is drawn from life .  from you .     graham dorn .  i am not here to listen to insults .  the mystery market today is swinging toward action and hot  honest love and you re still in the sweet  sentimental stickiness of five years ago .     but that s reginald de meister s character .     well  change his character .  listen .  you introduce sancha rodriguez .  that s fine .  i approve of her .  she s mexican  flaming  passionate  sultry and in love with him .  so what do you do .  first he behaves the impeccable gentleman  and then you kill her off in the middle of the story .     hmm  i see     you really think it would improve things to have de meister forget himself .  a kiss or so       june clenched her lovely teeth and her lovely fists .   oh  darling  how glad i am love is blind .  if it ever peeked one tiny little bit  i couldn t stand it .  look  you squirrel s blue plate special  you re going to have de meister and rodriguez fall in love .  they re going to have an affair through the entire book and you can put your horrible letitia into a nunnery .  she would probably be happier there from the way you make her sound .     that s all you know about it  my sweet .  it so happens that reginald de meister is in love wifh letitia reynolds and wants her  not this rodriguez person .     and what makes you think that .     he told me so .     who told you so .     reginald de meister .     what reginald de meister .     my reginald de meister .     what do you mean  your reginald de meister .         my character  reginald de meister .    june got up  indulged in some deep breathing and then said in a very calm voice   let s start all over .    she disappeared for a moment and returned with an aspirin .   your reginald de meister  from your books  told you  in person  he was in love with letitia reynolds .     that s right .    june swallowed the aspirin .    well  i ll explain  june  the way he explained it to me .  all characters really exist   at least  in the minds of the authors .  but when people really begin to believe in them  they begin to exist in reality  because what people believe in  is  so far as they re concerned  and what is existence anyway .    june s lips trembled .   oh  gramie  please don t .  mother will never let me marry you if they put you in an asylum .     don t call me gramie  june  for god s sake .  i tell you he was there  trying to tell me what to write and how to write it .  he was almost as bad as you .  aw  come on  baby  don t cry .     i can t help it .  i always thought you were crazy  but i never thought you were crazy .     all right  what s the difference .  let s not talk about it any more .  i m never going to write another mystery novel .  after all     he indulged in a bit of indignation     when it gets so that my own character   my own character   tries to tell me what to do  it s going too far .    june looked over her handkerchief .   how do you know it was really de meister .     oh  golly .  as soon as he tapped his turkish cigarette on the back of his hand and started dropping g s like snowflakes in a blizzard  i knew the worst had come .    the telephone rang .  june leaped up .   don t answer  graham .  it s probably from the asylum .  i ll tell them you re not here .  hello .  hello .  oh  mr .  macdunlap .   she heaved a sigh of relief  then covered the mouthpiece and whispered hoarsely   it might be a trap .     hello  mr .  macdunlap .   .  .  .  no  he s not here yes  i  think i can get in touch with him at martin s tomorrow   noon .  .  .  .  i ll tell him  .  .  .  with who .   .  .  .  with who .  .  .   she hung up suddenly .    graham  you re to lunch with macdunlap tomorrow     at his expense .  only at his expense .     her great blue eyes got greater and bluer   and reginald de      meister is to dine with you .     what reginald de meister .     your reginald de meister .     my reg       oh  gramie  don t .   her eyes misted   don t you see  gramie  now they ll put us both in an insane asylum   and mr .  macdunlap  too .  and they ll probably put us all in the same padded cell .  oh  gramie  three is such a dreadful crowd .    and her face crumpled into tears .   grew s .  macdunlap  that the s .  stands for  some  is a vile untruth spread by his enemies  was alone at the table when graham dorn entered .  out of this fact  graham extracted a few fleeting drops of pleasure .   it was not so much  you understand  the presence of macdunlap that did it  as the absence of de meister .   macdunlap looked at him over his spectacles and swallowed a liver pill  his favorite sweetmeat .    aha .  you re here .  what is this corny joke you re putting over on me .  you had no right to mix me up with a person like de meister without warning me he was real .  i might have taken precautions .  i could have hired a bodyguard .  i could have bought a revolver .     he s not real .  god damn it .  half of him was your idea .    that   returned macdunlap with heat   is libel .  and what do you mean  he s not real .  when he introduced himself  i took three liver pills at once and he didn t disappear .  do you know what three pills are .  three pills  the kind i ve got  the doctor should only drop dead   could make an elephant disappear   if he weren t real .  i know .    graham said wearily   just the same  he exists only in my mind .     in your mind  i know he exists .  your mind should be investigated by the pure food and drugs act .    the several polite rejoinders that occurred simultaneously to graham were dismissed almost immediately as containing too great a proportion of pithy anglo saxon expletives .  after all  ha  ha   a publisher is a publisher however anglo saxony he may be .   graham said   the question arises  then  how we re to get rid of de meister .     get rid of de meister .   macdunlap jerked the glasses off     his nose in his sudden start  and caught them in one hand .  his voice thickened with emotion .   who wants to get rid of him .     do you want him around .     god forbid   macdunlap said between shudders .   next to him  my brother in law is an angel .     he has no business outside my books .     for my part  he has no business inside them .  since i started reading your manuscripts  my doctor added kidney pills and cough syrups to my medicines .   he looked at his watch  and took a kidney pill .   my worst enemy should be a book publisher only a year .     then why   asked graham patiently   don t you want to get rid of de meister .     because he is publicity .    graham stared blankly .    look .  what other writer has a real detective .  all the others are fictional .  everyone knows that .  but yours   yours is real .  we can let him solve cases and have big newspaper write ups .  he ll make the police department look silly .  he ll make        that   interrupted graham  categorically   is by all odds the most obscene proposal i have ever had my ears manured with .     it will make money .     money isn t everything .     name one thing it isn t shh .   he kicked a near fracture  into graham s left ankle and rose to his feet with a convulsive smile   mr .  de meister .     sorry  old dear   came a lethargic voice .   cou dn t quite make it  you know .  loads of engagements .  must have been most borin  for you .    graham dom s ears quivered spasmodically .  he looked over his shoulder and reeled backward as far as a person could reel while in a sitting position .  reginald de meister had sprouted a monocle since his last visitation  and his monocular glance was calculated to freeze blood .   de meister s greeting was casual .   my dear watson .  so glad to meet you .  overjoyed deucedly .     why don t you go to hell .   graham asked curiously .    my dear fellow .  oh  my dear fellow .    macdunlap crackled   that s what i like .  jokes .  fun .  makes everything pleasant to start with .  now shall we get down to business .         certainly .  the dinner is on the way  i trust .  then i ll just order a bottle of wine .  the usual  henry .   the waiter ceased hovering  flew away  and skimmed back with a bottle that opened and gurgled into a glass .   de meister sipped delicately   so nice of you  old chap  to make me a habitue of this place in your stories .  it holds true even now  and it is most convenient .  the waiters all know me .  mr .  macdunlap  i take it you have convinced mr .  dorn of the necessity of continuing the de meister stories .     yes   said macdunlap .    no   said graham .    don t mind him   said macdunlap .   he s temperamental .  you know these authors .     don t mind him   said graham .   he s microcephalic .  you know these publishers .     look  old chappie .  i take it macdunlap hasn t pointed out to you the unpleasanter side of acting stubborn .     for instance what  old stinkie .   asked graham  courteously .    well  have you ever been haunted .     like coming behind me and saying  boo .     my dear fellow  i say .  i m much more subtle than that .  i can really haunt one in modern  up to date methods .  for instance  have you ever had your individuality submerged .    he snickered .   there was something familiar about that snicker .  graham suddenly remembered .  it was on page     of murder rides the range   his lazy eyelids flicked down and up .  he laughed lightly and melodiously  and though he said not a word  hank marslowe cowered .  there was hidden menace and hidden power in that light laugh  and somehow the burly rancher did not dare reach for his guns .   to graham it still sounded like a nasty snicker  but he cowered  and did not dare reach for his guns .   macdunlap plunged through the hole the momentary silence had created .    you see  graham .  why play around with ghosts .  ghosts aren t reasonable things .  they re not human .  if it s more royalties  you want           graham fired up .   will you refrain from speaking of money .  from now on  i write only great novels of tearing human emotions .    macdunlap s flushed face changed suddenly .    no   he said .    in fact  to change the subject just a moment    and graham s tone became surpassingly sweet  as the words got all sticky with maple syrup    i have a manuscript here for you to look at .    he grasped the perspiring macdunlap by the lapel firmly .   it is a novel that is the work of five years .  a novel that will grip you with its intensity .  a novel that will shake you to the core of your being .  a novel that will open a new world .  a novel that will        no   said macdunlap .    a novel that will blast the falseness of this world .  a novel that pierces to the truth .  a novel      macdunlap  being able to stretch his hand no higher  took the manuscript .    no   he said .    why the bloody hell don t you read it .   inquired graham .    now .     well  start it .     look  supposing i read it tomorrow  or even the next day .  i have to take my cough syrup now .     you haven t coughed once since i got here .     i ll let you know immediately        this   said graham   is the first page .  why don t you begin  it .  it will grip you instantly .    macdunlap read two paragraphs and said   is this laid in a coal mining town .     yes .     then i can t read it .  i m allergic to coal dust .     but it s not real coal dust  macldiot .     that   pointed out macdunlap   is what you said about de meister .    reginald de meister tapped a cigarette carefully on the back of his hand in a subtle manner which graham immediately recognized as betokening a sudden decision .    that is all devastatin ly borin   you know .  not quite gettin  to the point  you might say .  go ahead  macdunlap  this is no time for half measures .        macdunlap girded his spiritual loins and said   all right mister dorn  with you it s no use being nice .  instead of de meister  i m getting coal dust .  instead of the best publicity in fifty years  i m getting social significance .  all right  mister smartaleck dorn  if in one week you don t come to terms with me  good terms  you will be blacklisted in every reputable publishing firm in the united states and foreign parts .   he shook his finger and added in a shout   including scandinavian .    graham dorn laughed lightly   pish   he said   tush .  i happen to be an officer of the author s union  and if you try to push me around i ll have you blacklisted .  how do you like that .     i like it fine .  because supposing i can prove you re a plagiarist .     me   gasped graham  recovering narrowly from merry suffocation .   me  the most original writer of the decade .     is that so .  and maybe you don t remember that in each case you write up  you casually mention de meister s notebooks on previous cases .     so what .     so he has them .  reginald  my boy  show mister dorn your notebook of your last case .    you see that .  that s mystery of the milestones and it has  in detail  every incident in your book   and dated the year before the book was published .  very authentic .     again so what .     have you maybe got the right to copy his notebook and call it an original murder mystery .     why  you case of mental poliomyelitis  that notebook is my invention .     who says so .  it s de meister s handwriting  as any expert can prove .  and maybe you have a piece of paper  some little contract or agreement  you know  that gives you the right to use his notebooks .     how can i have an agreement with a mythical personage .     what mythical personage .     you and i know de meister doesn t exist .     ah  but does the jury know .  when i testify that i took three strong liver pills and he didn t disappear  what twelve men will say he doesn t exist .     this is blackmail .     certainly .  i ll give you a week .  or in other words  seven days .        graham dorn turned desperately to de meister .   you re in on this  too .  in my books i give you the keenest sense of honor .  is this honorable .    de meister shrugged .   my dear fellow .  all this   and haunting  too .    graham rose .    where are you going .     home to write you a letter .   graham s brows beetled defiantly .   and this time i ll mail it .  i m not giving in .  i ll fight to the last ditch .  and  de meister  you let loose with one single little haunt and i ll rip your head out of its socket and spurt the blood all over macdunlap s new suit .    he stalked out  and as he disappeared through the door  de meister disappeared through nothing at all .   macdunlap let out a soft yelp and then took a liver pill  a kidney pill  and a tablespoon of cough syrup in rapid succession .   graham dorn sat in june s front parlor  and having long since consumed his fingernails  was starting on the first knuckles .   june  at the moment  was not present  and this  graham felt  was just as well .  a dear girl  in fact  a dear  sweet girl .  but his mind was not on her .   it was concerned instead with a miasmic series of flashbacks over the preceding six days   say  graham  i met your side kick at the club yesterday .   you know  de meister .  got an awful shock .  i always had the  idea he was a sort of sherlock holmes that didn t exist .  that s  one on me  boy .  didn t know     hey  where are you going .   hey  dorn  i hear your boss de meister is back in town .   ought to have material for more stories soon .  you re lucky  you ve got someone to grind out your plots ready made      huh .  well  good bye .   why  graham  darling  wherever were you last night .   ann s affair didn t get anywhere without you  or at least  it  wouldn t have  if it hadn t been for reggie de meister .  he  asked after you  but then  i guess he felt lost without his wat  son .  it must feel wonderful to watson for such    mister  dorn .  and the same to you  sir .   you put one over on me .  i thought you made up those  wild things .  well  truth is stranger than fiction  ha  ha .   police officials deny that the famous amateur crimin       ologist reginald tie meister has interested himself in this case .  mr .  de meister himself could not be reached by our reporters for comment .  mr .  de meister is best known to the public for his brilliant solutions to over a dozen crimes  as chronicled in fiction form by his so called  watson   mr .  grayle doone .   graham quivered and his arms trembled in an awful desire for blood .  de meister was haunting him   but good .  he was losing his individuality  exactly as had been threatened .   it gradually dawned upon graham that the monotonous ringing noise he heard was not in his head  but  on the contrary  from the front door .   such seemed likewise the opinion of miss june billings  whose piercing call shot down the stairs and biffed graham a sharp uppercut to the ear drums .    hey  dope  see who s at the front door  before the vibration tears the house down .  i ll be down in half an hour .     yes  dear .    graham shuffled his way to the front door and opened it .    ah  there .  greetin s   said de meister  and brushed past .    . graham s dull eyes stared  and then fired high  as an animal snarl burst from his lips .  he took up that gorilla posture  so comforting to red blooded american males at moments like this  and circled the slightly confused detective .    my dear fellow  are you ill .     i   explained graham   am not ill  but you will soon be past all interest in that  for i am going to bathe my hands in your heart s reddest blood .     but i say  you ll only have to wash them afterwards .  it would be such an obvious clue  wouldn t it .     enough of this gay banter .  have you any last words .     not particularly .     it s just as well .  i m not interested in your last words .    he thundered into action  bearing down upon the unfortunate de meister like a bull elephant .  de meister faded to the left  shot out an arm and a foot  and graham described a parabolic arc that ended in the total destruction of an end table  a vase of flowers  a fish bowl  and a five foot section of wall .   graham blinked  and brushed away a curious goldfish from his left eyebrow .    my dear fellow   murmured de meister   oh  my dear fellow .       too late  graham remembered that passage in pistol parade   de meister s arms were whipcord lightning  as with sure  rapid thrusts  he rendered the two thugs helpless .  not by brute force  but by his expert knowledge of judo  he defeated them easily without hastening his breath .  the thugs groaned in pain .   graham groaned in pain .   he lifted his right thigh an inch or so to let his femur slip back into place .    hadn t you better get up  old chap .     i will stay here   said graham with dignity   and contemplate the floor in profile view  until such time as it suits me or until such time as i find myself capable of moving a muscle .  i don t care which .  and now  before i proceed to take further measures with you  what the hell do you want .    reginald de meister adjusted his monocle to a nicety .   you know  i suppose  that macdunlap s ultimatum expires tomorrow .     and you and he with it  i trust .     you will not reconsider .     ha .     really   de meister sighed   this is borin  no end .  you have made things comfortable for me in this world .  after all  in your books you ve made me well known in all the clubs and better restaurants  the bosom friend  y know  of the mayor and commissioner of police  the owner of a park avenue penthouse and a magnificent art collection .  and it all lingers over  old chap .  really quite affectin  .     it is remarkable   mused graham   the intensity with which i am not listening and the distinctness with which i do not hear a word you say .     still   said de meister   there is no denyin  my book world suits me better .  it is somehow more fascinatin   freer from dull logic  more apart from the necessities of the world .  in short  i must go back  and to active participation .  you have till tomorrow .     graham hummed a gay little tune with flat little notes .    is this a new threat  de meister .     it is the old threat intensified .  i m going to rob you of every vestige of your personality .  and eventually public oninion will force you to write as  to paraphrase you  de meister s com       pleat stooge .  did you see the name the newspaper chappies pinned on you today  old man .     yes  mr .  filthy de meister  and did you read a half column item on page ten in the same paper .  i ll read it for you   noted criminologist in   a .  will be inducted shortly draft board says .     for a moment  de meister said and did nothing .  and then  one after another  he did the following things  removed his monocle slowly  sat down heavily  rubbed his chin abstractedly  and lit a cigarette after long and careful tamping .  each of these  graham dorn s trained authorial eye recognized as singly representing perturbation and distress on the part of his character .   and never  in any of his books  did graham remember a time when de meister had gone through all four consecutively .   finally  de meister spoke .   why you had to bring up draft registrations in your last book  i really don t know .  this urge to be topical  this fiendish desire to be up to the minute with the news is the curse of the mystery novel .  a true mystery is timeless  should have no relation to current events  should       there is one way   said graham   to escape induction        you might at least have mentioned a deferred classification on some vital ground .    there is one way   said graham   to escape induction        criminal negligence   said de meister .    look .  go back to the books and you ll never be filled with lead .     write them and i ll do it .     think of the war .     think of your ego .    two strong men stood face to face  or would have  if graham weren t still horizontal  and neither flinched .   impasse .   and the sweet  feminine voice of june billings interrupted and snapped the tension    may i ask  graham dorn  what you are doing on the floor .  it s been swept today and you re not complimenting me by attempting to improve the job .     i am not sweeping the floor .  if you looked carefully   replied graham gently   you would see that your own adored fiance is lying here a mass of bruises and a hotbed of pains and aches .         you ve ruined my end table .     i ve broken my leg .     and my best lamp .     and two ribs .     and my fishbowl .     and my adam s apple .     and you haven t introduced your friend     and my cervical verte    what friend .     this friend .     friend .  ha .   and a mist came over his eyes .  she was so young  so fragile to come into contact with hard  brutal facts of life .   this   he muttered brokenly   is reginald de meister .    de meister at this point broke a cigarette sharply in two  a gesture pregnant with the deepest emotion .   june said slowly .   why   why  you re different from what i had thought .     how had you expected me to look .   asked de meister  in soft  thrilling tones .    i don t know .  differently than you do   from the stories i heard .     you remind me  somehow  miss billings  of letitia reynolds .     i think so .  graham said he drew her from me .     a very poor imitation  miss billings .  devastatin ly poor .    they were six inches apart now  eyes fixed with a mutual glue  and graham yelled sharply .  he sprang upright as memory smote him a nasty smite on the forehead .   a passage from case of the muddy overshoe occurred to him .  likewise one from the primrose murders .  also one from the tragedy of hartley manor  death of a hunter  white scorpion and  to put it in a small nutshell  from every one of the others .   the passage read   there was a certain fascination about de meister that appealed irresistibly to women .   and june billings was   as it had often  in graham s idler moments  occurred to him   a woman .   and fascination simply gooed out of her ears and coated the floor six inches deep .    get out of this room  june   he ordered .        i will not .     there is something i must discuss with mr .  de meister  man to man .  i demand that you leave this room .     please go  miss billings   said de meister .   june hesitated  and in a very small voice said   very well .     hold on   shouted graham .   don t let him order you about  i demand that you stay .    she closed the door very gently behind her .   the two men faced each other .  there was that in either pair of eyes that indicated a strong man brought to bay .  there was stubborn  undying antagonism  no quarter  no compromise .  it was exactly the sort of situation graham dorn always presented his readers with  when two strong men fought for one hand  one heart  one girl .   the two said simultaneously   let s make a deal .    graham said   you have convinced me  reggie .  our public needs us .  tomorrow i shall begin another de meister story .  let us shake hands and forget the past .    de meister struggled with his emotion .  he laid his hand on graham s lapel   my dear fellow  it is i who have been convinced by your logic .  i can t allow you to sacrifice yourself for me .  there are great things in you that must be brought out .  write your coal mining novels .  they count  not i .     i couldn t  old chap .  not after all you ve done for me  and all you ve meant to me .  tomorrow we start anew .     graham  my   my spiritual father  i couldn t allow it .  do you think i have no feelings  filial feelings  in a spiritual sort of way .     but the war  think of the war .  mangled limbs .  blood .  all that .     i must stay .  my country needs me .     but if i stop writing  eventually you will stop existing .  i can t allow that    oh  that .   de meister laughed with a careless elegance .   things have changed since .  so many people believe in my existence now that my grip upon actual existence has become too firm to be broken .  i don t have to worry about limbo any more .     oh .   graham clenched his teeth and spoke in searing sibilants   so that s your scheme  you snake .  do you suppose i don t see you re stuck on june .     look here  old chap   said de meister haughtily .   i can t      permit you to speak slightingly of a true and honest love .  i love june and she loves me  i know it .  and if you re going to be stuffy and victorian about it  you can swallow some nitroglycerine and tap yourself with a hammer .     i ll nitro glycerine you .  because i m going home tonight and beginning another de meister story .  you ll be part of it and you ll get back into it  and what do you think of that .     nothing  because you can t write another de meister story .  i m too real now  and you can t control me just like that .  and what do you think of that .    it took graham dorn a week to make up his mind what to think of that  and then his thoughts were completely and start lingly unprintable .   in fact  it was impossible to write .   that is  startling ideas occurred to him for great novels  emotional dramas  epic poems  brilliant essays   but he couldn t write anything about reginald de meister .   the typewriter was simply fresh out of capital r s .   graham wept  cursed  tore his hair  and anointed his finger tips with liniment .  he tried typewriter  pen  pencil  crayon  charcoal and blood .   he could not write .   the doorbell rang  and graham threw it open .   macdunlap stumbled in  falling over the first drifts of torn paper directly into graham s arms .   graham let him drop .   ha .   he said  with frozen dignity .    my heart .   said macdunlap  and fumbled for his liver pills .    don t die there   suggested graham  courteously .   the management won t permit me to drop human flesh into the incinerator .     graham  my boy   macdunlap said  emotionally   no more ultimatums .  no more threats .  i come now to appeal to your finer feelings  graham    he went through a slight choking interlude    i love you like a son .  this skunk de meister must disappear .  you must write more de meister stories for my sake .  graham   i will tell you something in private .  my wife is in love with this detective .  she tells me i am not romantic .  i .  not romantic .  can you understand it .     i can   was the tragic response .   he fascinates all women .     with that face .  with that monocle .     it says so in all my books .    macdunlap stiffened .   ah ha .  you again .  dope .  if only you      ever stopped long enough to let your mind know what your typewriter was saying .     you insisted .  feminine trade .   graham didn t care any more .  women .  he snickered bitterly .  nothing wrong with any of them that a block buster wouldn t fix .   macdunlap hemmed .   well  feminine trade .  very necessary .    but graham  what shall i do .  it s not only my wife .  she owns fifty shares in macdunlap  inc .  in her own name .  if she leaves me  i lose control .  think of it  graham .  the catastrophe to the publishing world .     grew  old chap   graham sighed a sigh so deep  his toenails quivered sympathetically .   i might as well tell you .  june  my fiancee  you know  loves this worm .  and he loves her because she is the prototype of letitia reynolds .     the what of letitia .   asked macdunlap  vaguely suspecting an insult .    never mind .  my life is ruined .   he smiled bravely and choked back the unmanly tears  after the first two had dripped off the end of his nose .    my poor boy .   the two gripped hands convulsively .    caught in a vise by this foul monster   said graham .    trapped like a german in russia   said macdunlap .    victim of an inhuman fiend   said graham .    exactly   said macdunlap .  he wrung graham s hand as if he were milking a cow .   you ve got to write de meister stories and get him back where  next to hell  he most belongs .  right .     right .  but there s one little catch .     what .     i can t write .  he s so real now  i can t put him into a book .    macdunlap caught the significance of the massed drifts of used paper on the floor .  he held his head and groaned   my corporation .  my wife .     there s always the army   said graham .   macdunlap looked up .   what about death on the third deck  the novel i rejected three weeks ago .     that doesn t count .  it s past history .  it s already affected him .     without being published .     sure .  that s the story i mentioned his draft board in .  the one that put him in    a .     i could think of better places to put him .     macdunlap .   graham dorn jumped up  and grappled mac       dunlap s lapel .   maybe it can be revised .    macdunlap coughed hackingly  and stifled out a dim grunt .    we can put anything we want into it .    macdunlap choked a bit .    we can fix things up .    macdunlap turned blue in the face .   graham shook the lapel and everything thereto attached   say something  won t you .    macdunlap wrenched away and took a tablespoon of cough syrup .  he held his hand over his heart and patted it a bit .  he shook his head and gestured with his eyebrows .   graham shrugged .   well  if you just want to be sullen  go ahead .  i ll revise it without you .    he located the manuscript and tried his fingers gingerly on the typewriter .  they went smoothly  with practically no creaking at the joints .  he put on speed  more speed  and then went into his usual race  with the portable jouncing along merrily under the accustomed head of steam .    it s working   he shouted .   i can t write new stories  but i can revise old  unpublished ones .    macdunlap watched over his shoulder .  he breathed only at odd moments .    faster   said macdunlap   faster .     faster than thirty five .   said graham  sternly .   opa  forbid .  five more minutes .     will he be there .     he s always there .  he s been at her house every evening this week .   he spat out the fine ivory dust into which he had ground the last inch of his incisors .   but god help you if your secretary falls down on the job .     my boy  on my secretary you can depend .     she s got to read that revision by nine .     if she doesn t drop dead .     with my luck  she will .  will she believe it .     every word .  she s seen de meister .  she knows he exists .    brakes screeched  and graham s soul cringed in sympathy with every molecule of rubber frictioned off the tires .   he bounded up the stairs  macdunlap hobbling after .   he rang the bell and burst in at the door .  reginald de    the office of price administration was in charge of gasoline rationing at this period .  remember  a  stickers .  d . r . b .       meister standing directly inside received the full impact of a pointing finger  and only a rapid backward movement of the head kept him from becoming a one eyed mythical character .   june billings stood aside  silent and uncomfortable .    reginald de meister   growled graham  in sinister tones   prepare to meet your doom .     oh  boy   said macdunlap   are you going to get it .     and to what   asked de meister   am i indebted for your dramatic but unilluminatin  statement .  confusin   don t you know .   he lit a cigarette with a fine gesture and smiled .    hello  gramie   said june  tearfully .    scram  vile woman .    june sniffed .  she felt like a heroine out of a book  torn by her own emotions .  naturally  she was having the time of her life .   so she let the tears dribble and looked forlorn .   to return to the subject  what is this all about .   asked de meister  wearily .    i have rewritten death on the third deck .     well .     the revision   continued graham   is at present in the hands of macdunlap s secretary  a girl on the style of miss billings  my fiancee that was .  that is  she is a girl who aspires to the status of a moron  but has not yet quite attained it .  she ll believe every word .     well .    graham s voice grew ominous   you remember  perhaps  sancha rodriguez .    for the first time  reginald de meister shuddered .  he caught his cigarette as it dropped .   she was killed by sam blake in the sixth chapter .  she was in love with me .  really  old fellow  what messes you get me into .     not half the mess you re in now  old chap .  sancha rodriguez did not die in the revision .     die .   came a sharp  but clear female voice .   i ll show him if i died .  and where have you been this last month  you two crosser .    de meister did not catch his cigarette this time .  he didn t even try .  he recognized the apparition .  to an unprejudiced observer  it might have been merely a svelte latin girl equipped with dark  flashing eyes  and long  glittering fingernails  but to de meister  it was sancha rodriguez   undead .       macdunlap s secretary had read and believed .    miss rodriguez   throbbed de meister  charmingly   how fascinatin  to see you .     mrs .  de meister to you  you double timer  you two crosser  you scum of the ground  you scorpion of the grass .  and who is this woman .    june retreated with dignity behind the nearest chair .    mrs .  de meister   said reginald pleadingly  and turned helplessly to graham dorn .    oh  you have forgotten  have you  you smooth talker  you low dog .  i ll show you what it means to deceive a weak woman .  i ll make you mince meat with my fingernails .    de meister back pedaled furiously .   but darling        don t you make sweet talk .  what are you doing with this woman .     but  darling        don t give me any explanation .  what are you doing with this woman .     but darling       shut up .  what are you doing with this woman .    reginald de meister was up in a corner  and mrs .  de meister shook her fists at him .   answer me .    de meister disappeared .   mrs .  de meister disappeared right after him .   june billings collapsed into real tears .   graham dorn folded his arms and looked sternly at her .   macdunlap rubbed his hands and took a kidney pill .    it wasn t my fault  gramie   said june .   you said in your books he fascinated all women  so i couldn t help it .  deep inside  i hated him all along .  you believe me  don t you .     a likely story .   said graham  sitting down next to her on the sofa .   a likely story .  but i forgive you  maybe .    macdunlap said tremulously   my boy  you have saved my stocks .  also  my wife  of course .  and remember   you promised me one de meister story each year .    graham gritted   just one  and i ll henpeck him to death  and keep one unpublished story forever on hand  just in case .  and you re publishing my novel  aren t you  grew  old boy .     glug   said macdunlap .    aren t you .     yes  graham .  of course  graham .  definitely  graham .  positively  graham .        then leave us now .  there are matters of importance i must discuss with my fiancee .    macdunlap smiled and tiptoed out the door .   ah  love  love  he mused  as he took a liver pill and followed it up by a cough syrup chaser .   the end  i might make two points about  author .  author .   it seems to me that i was rather easier about handling romance in this story than in any previous one .  perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that it was the first story i ever wrote as a married man .   secondly  there are the very dated references to rationing  the draft  and other social phenomena much on the mind of anyone living through worjd war ii .  i had warned bensen of the existence of these references and of the inability of getting them out of the story by revision since they were integral to the plot .  bensen  however  shrugged them off and in his short introduction to the story said to  . the readers   and don t worry about the references to the op a and selective service   consider them as part of the historical setting  just as you would a bodkin or a furbelow in a story of an earlier time .    and i second that statement here .   had i rested on the pink cloud of gratification that came with the sale of  author .  author .   for a few months  the death of unknown might have disheartened me .  it might have seemed to prove that i was not fated to reign ite my career after all  and perhaps   again   everything would have turned out differently .   however  within three weeks of the sale i was at the typewriter again .  the new story was  death sentence  and it was science fiction .  writing was still slow work  seven weeks to do a       word story .  on june           however  i sent it off to campbell  and on july    it was accepted   one and a quarter cents per word again .   this meant that when the news of unknown s demise arrived  it was cushioned by the fact that i already had another story written and sold .           death sentence  brand gorla smiled uncomfortably   these things exaggerate  you know .     no  no  no .   the little man s albino pink eyes snapped .   dorlis was great when no human had ever entered the vegan system .  it was the capital of a galactic confederation greater than ours .     well  then  let s say it was an ancient capital .  i ll admit that and leave the rest to an archaeologist .     archaeologists are no use .  what i ve discovered needs a specialist in its own field .  and you re on the board .    brand gorla looked doubtful .  he remembered theo realo in senior year   a little white misfit of a human who skulked somewhere in the background of his reminiscences .  it had been a long time ago  but the albino had been queer .  that was easy to remember .  and he was still queer .    i ll try to help   brand said   if you ll tell me what you want .    theor watched intently   i want you to place certain facts before the board .  will you promise that .    brand hedged   even if i help you along  theor  i ll have to remind you that i m junior member of the psychological board .  i haven t much influence .     you must do your best .  the facts will speak for themselves .   the albino s hands were trembling .    go ahead .   brand resigned himself .  the man was an old school fellow .  you couldn t be too arbitrary about things .   brand gorla leaned back and relaxed .  the light of arcturus shone through the ceiling high windows  diffused and mellowed by the polarizing glass .  even this diluted version of sunlight was too much for the pink eyes of the other  and he shaded his eyes as he spoke .    i ve lived on dorlis twenty five years  brand   he said   i ve poked into places no one today knew existed  and i ve found things .  dorlis was the scientific and cultural capital of a civilization greater than ours .  yes it was  and particularly in psychology .    astounding science fiction  november       copyright         by street and smith publications  inc .   copyright renewed         by isaac asimov       things in the past always seem greater .   brand condescended a smile .   there is a theorem to that effect which you ll find in any elementary text .  freshmen invariably call it the  god theorem .   stands for  good old days   you know .  but go on .    theor frowned at the digression .  he hid the beginning of a sneer   you can always dismiss an uncomfortable fact by pinning a dowdy label to it .  but tell me this .  what do you know of psychological engineering .    brand shrugged   no such thing .  anyway  not in the strict mathematical sense .  all propaganda and advertising is a crude form of hit and miss psych engineering   and pretty effective sometimes .  maybe that s what you mean .     not at all .  i mean actual experimentation  with masses of people  under controlled conditions  and over a period of years .     such things have been discussed .  it s not feasible in practice .  our social structure couldn t stand much of it  and we don t know enough to set up effective controls .    theor suppressed excitement   but the ancients did know enough .  and they did set up controls .    brand considered phlegmatically   startling and interesting  but how do you know .     because i found the documents relating to it .   he paused breathlessly .   an entire planet  brand .  a complete world picked to suit  peopled with beings under strict control from every angle .  studied  and charted  and experimented upon .  don t you get the picture .    brand noted none of the usual stigmata of mental uncon trol .  a closer investigation  perhaps      he said evenly   you must have been misled .  it s thoroughly impossible .  you can t control humans like that .  too many variables .     and that s the point  brand .  they weren t humans .     what .     they were robots  positronic robots .  a whole world of them  brand  with nothing to do but live and react and be observed by a set of psychologists that were real psychologists .    that s mad .     i have proof   because that robot world still exists .  the first confederation went to pieces  but that robot world kept on going .  it still exists .         and how do you know .    theor realo stood up .   because i ve been there these last twenty five years .    the board master threw his formal red edged gown aside and reached into a pocket for a long  gnarled and decidedly unofficial cigar .    preposterous   he grunted   and thoroughly insane .     exactly   said brand   and i can t spring it on the board just like that .  they wouldn t listen .  i ve got to get this across to you first  and then  if you can put your authority behind it        oh  nuts .  i never heard anything as     who is the fellow .    brand sighed   a crank  i ll admit that .  he was in my class at arcturus u .  and a crack pot albino even then .  maladjusted as the devil  hipped on ancient history  and just the kind that gets an idea and goes through with it by plain  dumb plugging .  he s poked about in dorlis for twenty five years  he says .  he s got the complete records of practically an entire civilization .    the board master puffed furiously .   yeah  i know .  in the telestat serials  the brilliant amateur always uncovers the great things .  the free lance .  the lone wolf .  nuts .  have you consulted the department of archaeology .     certainly .  and the result was interesting .  no one bothers with dorlis .  this isn t just ancient history  you see .  it s a matter of fifteen thousand years .  it s practically myth .  reputable archaeologists don t waste too much time with it .  it s just the thing a book struck layman with a single track mind would uncover .  after this  of course  if the business turns out right  dorlis will become an archaeologist s paradise .    the board master screwed his homely face into an appalling grimace .   it s very unflattering to the ego .  if there s any truth in all this  the so called first confederation must have had a grasp of psychology so far past ours  as to make us out to be blithering imbeciles .  too  they d have to build positronic robots that would be about seventy five orders of magnitude above anything we ve even blueprinted .  galaxy .  think of the mathematics involved .     look  sir  i ve consulted just about everybody .  i wouldn t bring this thing to you if i weren t certain that i had every angle checked .  i went to blak just about the first thing  and he s consultant mathematician to united robots .  he says there s no limit to these things .  given the time  the money  and      the advance in psychology   get that   robots like that could be built right now .     what proof has he .     who  blak .     no  no .  your friend .  the albino .  you said he had papers .     he has .  i ve got them here .  he s got documents   and there s no denying their antiquity .  i ve had that checked every way from sunday .  i can t read them  of course .  i don t know if anyone can  except theor realo .     that s stacking the deck  isn t it .  we have to take his say so .     yes  in a way .  but he doesn t claim to be able to decipher more than portions .  he says it is related to ancient centaurian  and i ve put linguists to work on it .  it can be cracked and if his translation isn t accurate  we ll know about it .     all right .  let s see it .    brand gorla brought out the plastic mounted documents .  the board master tossed them aside and reached for the translation .  smoke billowed as he read .    humph   was his comment .   further details are on dorlis  i suppose .     theor claims that there are some hundred to two hundred tons of blueprints altogether  on the brain plan of the posi tronic robots alone .  they re still there in the original vault .  but that s the least of it .  he s been on the robot world itself .  he s got photocasts  teletype recordings  all sorts of details .  they re not integrated  and obviously the work of a layman who knows next to nothing about psychology .  even so  he s managed to get enough data to prove pretty conclusively that the world he was on wasn t .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  natural .     you ve got that with you  too .     all of it .  most of it s on microfilm  but i ve brought the projector .  here are your eyepieces .    an hour later  the board master said   i ll call a board meeting tomorrow and push this through .    brand gorla grinned tightly   we ll send a commission to dorlis .     when   said the board master dryly   and if we can get an appropriation out of the university for such an affair .  leave this material with me for the while  please .  i want to study it a  little more .        theoretically  the governmental department of science and technology exercises administrative control over all scientific investigation .  actually  however  the pure research groups of the large universities are thoroughly autonomous bodies  and  as a general rule  the government does not care to dispute that .  but a general rule is not necessarily a universal rule .   and so  although the board master scowled and fumed and swore  there was no way of refusing wynne murry an interview .  to give murry his complete title  he was under secretary in charge of psychology  psychopathy and mental technology .  and he was a pretty fair psychologist in his own right .   so the board master might glare  but that was all .   secretary murry ignored the glare cheerfully .  he rubbed his long chin against the grain and said   it amounts to a case of insufficient information .  shall we put it that way .    the board master said frigidly   i don t see what information you want .  the government s say in university appropriations is purely advisory  and in this case  i might say  the advice is unwelcome .    murry shrugged   i have no quarrel with the appropriation .  but you re not going to leave the planet without government permit .  that s where the insufficient information comes in .     there is no information other than we ve given you .     but things have leaked out .  all this is childish and rather unnecessary secrecy .    the old psychologist flushed .   secrecy .  if you don t know the academic way of life  i can t help you .  investigations  especially those of major importance  aren t  and can t be  made public  until definite progress has been made .  when we get back  we ll send you copies of whatever papers we publish .    murry shook his head   uh uh .  not enough .  you re going to dorlis  aren t you .     we ve informed the department of science of that .     why .     why do you want to know .     because it s big  or the board master wouldn t go himself  what s this about an older civilization and a world of robots .     well  then  you know .     only vague notions we ve been able to scrabble up .  i want the details .    there are none that we know now .  we won t know until      we re on dorlis .     then i m going with you .     what .     you see  i want the details  too .     why .     ah   murry unfolded his legs and stood up   now you re asking the questions .  it s no use  now .  i know that the universities aren t keen on government supervision  and i know that i can expect no willing help from any academic source .  but  by arcturus  i m going to get help this time  and i don t care how you fight it .  your expedition is going nowhere  unless i go with you   representing the government .    dorlis  as a world  is not impressive .  it s importance to galactic economy is nil  its position far off the great trade routes  its natives backward and unenlightened  its history obscure .  and yet somewhere in the heaps of rubble that clutter an ancient world  there is obscure evidence of an influx of flame and destruction that destroyed the dorlis of an earlier day  the greater capital of a greater federation .   and somewhere in that rubble  men of a newer world poked and probed and tried to understand .   the board master shook his head and then pushed back his grizzling hair .  he hadn t shaved in a week .    the trouble is   he said   that we have no point of reference .  the language can be broken  i suppose  but nothing can be done with the notation .     i think a great deal has been done .     stabs in the dark .  guessing games based on the translations of your albino friend .  i won t base any hopes on that .    brand said   nuts .  you spent two years on the nimian anomaly  and so far only two months on this  which happens to be a hundred thousand times the job .  it s something else that s getting you .   he smiled grimly .   it doesn t take a psychologist to see that the government man is in your hair .    the board master bit the end off a cigar and spat it four feet .  he said slowly   there are three things about the mule headed idiot that make me sore .  first  i don t like government interference .  second  i don t like a stranger sniffing about when we re on top of the biggest thing in the history of psychology .  third  what in the galaxy does he want .  what is he after .         i don t know .     what should he be after .  have you thought of it at all .     no .  frankly  i don t care .  i d ignore him if i were you .     you would   said the board master violently .   you would .  you think the government s entrance into this affair need only be ignored .  i suppose you know that this murry calls himself a psychologist .     i know that .     and i suppose you know he s been displaying a devouring interest in all that we ve been doing .    that  i should say  would be natural .     oh .  and you know further     his voice dropped with startling suddenness .   all right  murry s at the door .  take it easy .    wynne murry grinned a greeting  but the board master nodded unsmilingly .    well  sir   said murry bluffly   do you know i ve been on my feet for forty eight hours .  you ve got something here .  something big .     thank you .     no  no .  i m serious .  the robot world exists .     did you think it didn t .    the secretary shrugged amiably .   one has a certain natural skepticism .  what are your future plans .     why do you ask .   the board master grunted his words as if they were being squeezed out singly .   to see if they jibe with my own .     and what are your own .     the secretary smiled .   no  no .  you take precedence .  how long do you intend staying here .     as long as it takes to make a fair beginning on the documents involved .     that s no answer .  what do you mean by a fair beginning .     i haven t the slightest idea .  it might take years .     oh  damnation .    the board master raised his eyebrows and said nothing .   the secretary looked at his nails .   i take it you know the location of this robot world .     naturally .  theor realo was there .  his information up to now has proven very accurate .     that s right .  the albino .  well  why not go there .     go there .  impossible .         may i ask why .     look   said the board master with restrained impatience   you re not here by our invitation  and we re not asking you to dictate our course of actions  but just to show you that i m not looking for a fight  i ll give you a little metaphorical treatment of our case .  suppose we were presented with a huge and complicated machine  composed of principles and materials of which we knew next to nothing .  it is so vast we can t even make out the relationship of the parts  let alone the purpose of the whole .  now  would you advise me to begin attacking the delicate mysterious moving parts of the machine with a detonating ray before i know what it s all about .     i see your point  of course  but you re becoming a mystic .  the metaphor is farfetched .     not at all .  these positronic robots were constructed along lines we know nothing of as yet and were intended to follow lines with which we are entirely unacquainted .  about the only thing we know is that the robots were put aside in complete isolation  to work out their destiny by themselves .  to ruin that isolation would be to ruin the experiment .  if we go there in a body  introducing new  unforeseen factors  inducing unintended reactions  everything is ruined .  the littlest disturbance        poppycock .  theor realo has already gone there .    the board master lost his temper suddenly .   don t you suppose i know that .  do you suppose it would ever have happened if that cursed albino hadn t been an ignorant fanatic without any knowledge of psychology at all .  galaxy knows what the idiot has done in the way of damage .    there was a silence .  the secretary clicked his teeth with a  thoughtful fingernail .   i don t know .  .  .  .  i don t know .  but i ve  got to find out .  and i can t wait years .    he left  and the board master turned seethingly to brand   and how are we going to stop him from going to the robot world if he wants to .     i don t see how he can go if we don t let him .  he doesn t head the expedition .     oh  doesn t he .  that s what i was about to tell you just before he came in .  ten ships of the fleet have landed on dorlis since we arrived .     what .     just that .         but what for .     that  my boy  is what i don t understand  either .     mind if i drop in .   said wynne murry  pleasantly  and theor realo looked up in sudden anxiety from the papers that lay in hopeless disarray on the desk before him .    come in .  i ll clear off a seat for you .   the albino hustled the mess off one of the two chairs in a state of twittering nerves .   murry sat down and swung one long leg over the other .   are you assigned a job here  too .   he nodded at the desk .   theor shook his head and smiled feebly .  almost automatically  he brushed the papers together in a heap and turned them face down .   in the months since he had returned to dorlis with a hundred psychologists of various degrees of renown  he had felt himself pushed farther and farther from the center of things .  there was room for him no longer .  except to answer questions on the actual state of things upon the robot world  which he alone had visited  he played no part .  and even there he detected  or seemed to detect  anger that he should have gone  and not a competent scientist .   it was a thing to be resented .  yet  somehow  it had always been like that .    pardon me .   he had let murry s next remark slip .   the secretary repeated   i say it s surprising you re not put to work  then .  you made the original discovery  didn t you .     yes   the albino brightened .   but it went out of my hands .  it got beyond me .     you were on the robot world  though .    that was a mistake  they tell me .  i might have ruined everything .    murry grimaced .   what really gets them  i guess  is that you ve got a lot of first hand dope that they didn t .  don t let their fancy titles fool you into thinking you re a nobody .  a layman with common sense is better than a blind specialist .  you and i   i m a layman  too  you know   have to stand up for our rights .  here  have a cigarette .     i don t sm    i ll take one  thank you .   the albino felt himself warming to the long bodied man opposite .  he turned the papers face upward again  and lit up  bravely but uncertainly .    twenty five years .   theor spoke carefully  skirting around urgent coughs .        would you answer a few questions about the world .     i suppose so .  that s all they ever ask me about .  but hadn t you better ask them .  they ve probably got it all worked out now .   he blew the smoke as far from himself as possible .   hurry said   frankly  they haven t even begun  and i want the information without benefit of confusing psychological translation .  first of all .  what kind of people   or things   are these robots .  you haven t a photocast of one of them  have you .     well  no .  i didn t like to take  casts of them .  but they re not things .  they re people .     no .  do they look like   people .     yes   mostly .  outside  anyway .  i brought some microscopic studies of the cellular structure that i got hold of .  the board master has them .  they re different inside  you know  greatly simplified .  but you d never know that .  they re interesting  and nice .     are they simpler than the other life of the planet .     oh  no .  it s a very primitive planet .  and  .  .  .  and   he was interrupted by a spasm of coughing and crushed the cigarette to death as unobtrusively as possible .   they ve got a protoplasmic base  you know .  i don t think they have the slightest idea they re robots .     no .  i don t suppose they would have .  what about their science .     i don t know .  i never got a chance to see .  and everything was so different .  i guess it would take an expert to understand .     did they have machines .    the albino looked surprised .   well  of course .  a good many  of all sorts .     large cities .     yes .    the secretary s eyes grew thoughtful .   and you like them .  why .    theor realo was brought up sharply .   i don t know .  they were just likable .  we got along .  they didn t bother me so .  it s nothing i can put my finger on .  maybe it s because i have it so hard getting along back home  and they weren t as difficult as real people .     they were more friendly .     n no .  can t say so .  they never quite accepted me .  i was a stranger  didn t know their language at first   all that .  but    he     looked up with sudden brightness    i understood them better .  i could tell what they were thinking better .  i    but i don t know why .     hm m m .  well   another cigarette .  no .  i ve got to be walloping the pillow now .  it s getting late .  how about a twosome at golf tomorrow .  i ve worked up a little course .  it ll do .  come on out .  the exercise will put hair on your chest .    he grinned and left .   he mumbled one sentence to himself   it looks like a death sentence    and whistled thoughtfully as he passed along to his own quarters .   he repeated the phrase to himself when he faced the board master the next day  with the sash of office about his waist .  he did not sit down .    again .   said the board master  wearily .    again .   assented the secretary .   but real business this time .  i may have to take over direction of your expedition .     what .  impossible  sir .  i will listen to no such proposition .     i have my authority .   wynne murry presented the metalloid cylinder that snapped open at a flick of the thumb .   i have full powers and full discretion as to their use .  it is signed  as you will observe  by the chairman of the congress of the federation .     so    but why .   the board master  by an effort  breathed normally .   short of arbitrary tyranny  is there a reason .     a very good one  sir .  all along  we have viewed this expedition from different angles .  the department of science and technology views the robot world not from the point of view of a scientific curiosity  but from the standpoint of its interference with the peace of the federation .  i don t think you ve ever stopped to consider the danger inherent in this robot world .     none that i can see .  it is thoroughly isolated and thoroughly harmless .     how can you know .     from the very nature of the experiment   shouted the board master angrily .   the original planners wanted as nearly a completely closed system as possible .  here they are  just as far off the trade routes as possible  in a thinly populated region of space .  the whole idea was to have the robots develop free of interference .        murry smiled .   i disagree with you there .  look  the whole trouble with you is that you re a theoretical man .  you look at things the way they ought to be and i  a practical man  look at things as they are .  no experiment can be set up and allowed to run indefinitely under its own power .  it is taken for granted that somewhere there is at least an observer who watches and modifies as circumstances warrant .     well .   said the board master stolidly .    well  the observers in this experiment  the original psychologists of dorlis  passed away with the first confederation  and for fifteen thousand years the experiment has proceeded by itself .  little errors have added up and become big ones and introduced alien factors which induced still other errors .  it s a geometric progression .  and there s been no one to halt it .     pure hypothesis .     maybe .  but you re interested only in the robot world  and i ve got to think of the entire federation .     and just what possible danger can the robot world be to the federation .  i don t know what in arcturus you re driving at  man .    murry sighed .   i ll be simple  but don t blame me if i sound melodramatic .  the federation hasn t had any internal warfare for centuries .  what will happen if we come into contact with these robots .     are you afraid of one world .     could be .  what about their science .  robots can do funny things sometimes .     what science can they have .  they re not metal electricity supermen .  they re weak protoplasmic creatures  a poor imitation of actual humanity  built around a positronic brain adjusted to a set of simplified human psychological laws .  if the word  robot  is scaring you        no  it isn t  but i ve talked to theor realo .  he s the only one who s seen them  you know .    the board master cursed silently and fluently .  it came of letting a weak minded freak of a layman get underfoot where he could babble and do harm .   he said   we ve got realo s full story  and we ve evaluated it fully and capably .  i assure you  no harm exists in them .  the experiment is so thoroughly academic  i wouldn t spend two days on it if it weren t for the broad scope of the thing .  from what we see  the whole idea was to build up a positronic brain     containing modifications of one or two of the fundamental axioms .  we haven t worked out the details  but they must be minor  as it was the first experiment of this nature ever tried  and even the great mythical psychologists of that day had to progress stepwise .  those robots  i tell you  are neither supermen nor beasts .  i assure you   as a psychologist .     sorry .  i m a psychologist  too .  a little more rule of thumb  i m afraid .  that s all .  but even little modifications .  take the general spirit of combativeness .  that isn t the scientific term  but i ve no patience for that .  you know what i mean .  we humans used to be combative .  but it s being bred out of us .  a stable political and economic system doesn t encourage the waste energy of combat .  it s not a survival factor .  but suppose the robots are combative .  suppose as the result of a wrong turn during the millennia they ve been unwatched  they ve become far more combative than ever their first makers intended .  they d be uncomfortable things to be with .     and suppose all the stars in the galaxy became novae at the same time .  let s really start worry ing .     and there s another point .   murry ignored the other s heavy sarcasm .   theor realo liked those robots .  he liked robots better than he likes real people .  he felt that he fitted there  and we all know he s been a bad misfit in his own world .     and what   asked the board master   is the significance of that .     you don t see it .   wynne murry lifted his eyebrows .   theor realo likes those robots because he is like them  obviously .  i ll guarantee right now that a complete psychic analysis of theor realo will show a modification of several fundamental axioms  and the same ones as in the robots .    and   the secretary drove on without a pause   theor realo worked for a quarter of a century to prove a point  when all science would have laughed him to death if they had known about it .  there s fanaticism there  good  honest  inhuman perseverance .  those robots are probably like that .     you re advancing no logic .  you re arguing like a maniac  like a moon struck idiot .     i don t need strict mathematical proof .  reasonable doubt is sufficient .  i ve got to protect the federation .  look  it is reasonable  you know .  the psychologists of dorlis weren t as super as all that .  they had to advance stepwise  as you yourself      pointed out .  their humanoids   let s not call them robots  were only imitations of human beings and they could be good ones .  humans possess certain very  very complicated reaction systems   things like social consciousness  and a tendency toward the establishment of ethical systems  and more ordinary things like chivalry  generosity  fair play and so on  that simply can t possibly be duplicated .  i don t think those humanoids can have them .  but they must have perseverance  which practically implies stubbornness and combativeness  if my notion on theor realo holds good .  well  if their science is anywhere at all  then i don t want to have them running loose in the galaxy  if our numbers are a thousand or million times theirs .  and i don t intend to permit them to do so .    the board master s face was rigid .   what are your immediate intentions .     as yet undecided .  but i think i am going to organize a small scale landing on the planet .     now  wait .   the old psychologist was up and around the desk .  he seized the secretary s elbow .   are you quite certain you know what you re doing .  the potentialities in this massive experiment are beyond any possible precalculation by you or me .  you can t know what you re destroying .     i know .  do you think i enjoy what i m doing .  this isn t a hero s job .  i m enough of a psychologist to want to know what s going on  but i ve been sent here to protect the federation  and to the best of my ability i intend doing it   and a dirty job it is .  but i can t help it .     you can t have thought it out .  what can you know of the insight it will give us into the basic ideas of psychology .  this will amount to a fusion of two galactic systems  that will send us to heights that will make up in knowledge and power a million times the amount of harm the robots could ever do  if they were metal electricity supermen .    the secretary shrugged .   now you re the one that is playing with faint possibilities .     listen  i ll make a deal .  blockade them .  isolate them with your ships .  mount guards .  but don t touch them .  give us more time .  give us a chance .  you must .     i ve thought of that .  but i would have to get congress to agree to that .  it would be expensive  you know .    the board master flung himself into his chair in wild impatience .   what kind of expense are you talking about .  do      you realize the nature of the repayment if we succeed .    murry considered  then  with a half smile   what if they develop interstellar travel .    the board master said quickly   then i ll withdraw my objections .   the secretary rose   i ll have it out with congress .    brand gorla s face was carefully emotionless as he watched the board master s stooped back .  the cheerful pep talks to the available members of the expedition lacked meat  and he listened to them impatiently .   he said   what are we going to do now .    the board master s shoulders twitched and he didn t turn .   i ve sent for theor realo .  that little fool left for the eastern continent last week        why .    the older man blazed at the interruption .   how can i understand anything that freak does .  don t you see that murry s right .  he s a psychic abnormality .  we had no business leaving him unwatched .  if i had ever thought of looking at him twice  i wouldn t have .  he s coming back now  though  and he s going to stay back .   his voice fell to a mumble .   should have been back two hours ago .     it s an impossible position  sir   said brand  flatly .    think so .     well    do you think congress will stand for an indefinite patrol off the robot world .  it runs into money  and average galactic citizens aren t going to see it as worth the taxes .  the psychological equations degenerate into the axioms of common sense .  in fact  i don t see why murry agreed to consult congress .     don t you .   the board master finally faced his junior .   well  the fool considers himself a psychologist  galaxy help us  and that s his weak point .  he flatters himself that he doesn t want to destroy the robot world in his heart  but that it s the good of the federation that requires it .  and he ll jump at any reasonable compromise .  congress won t agree to it indefinitely  you don t have to point that out to me .   he was talking quietly  patiently .   but i will ask for ten years  two years  six months  as much as i can get .  i ll get something .  in that time  we ll learn new facts about the world .  somehow we ll strengthen our case and renew the agreement when it expires .  we ll save the      project yet .    there was a short silence and the board master added slowly and bitterly   and that s where theor realo plays a vital part .    brand gorla watched silently  and waited .  the board master said   on that one point  murry saw what we didn t .  realo is a psychological cripple  and is our real clue to the whole affair .  if we study him  we ll have a rough picture of what the robot is like  distorted of course  since his environment has been a hostile  unfriendly one .  but we ca  make allowance for that  estimate his nature in a    ahh  i m tired of the whole subject .    the signal box flashed  and the board master sighed .   well  he s here .  all right  gorla  sit down  you make me nervous .  let s take a look at him .    theor realo came through the door like a comet and brought himself to a panting halt in the middle of the floor .  he looked from one to the other with weak  peering eyes .    how did all this happen .     all what .   said the board master coldly .   sit down .  i want to ask you some questions .     no .  you first answer me     sit down .    realo sat .  his eyes were brimming .   they re going to destroy the robot world .     don t worry about that .     but you said they could if the robots discovered interstellar travel .  you said so .  you fool .  don t you see      he was choking .   the board master frowned uneasily .   will you calm down and talk sense .    the albino gritted his teeth and forced the words out .   but they ll have interstellar travel before long .    and the two psychologists shot toward the little man .    what .  .     well  .  .  .  well  what do you think .   realo sprang upward with all the fury of desperation .   did you think i landed in a desert or in the middle of an ocean and explored a world all by myself .  do you think life is a storybook .  i was captured as soon as i landed and taken to the big city .  at least  i think it was a big city .  it was different from our kind .  it had     but i      won t tell you .     never mind the city   shrieked the board master .   you were captured .  go ahead .     they studied me .  they studied my machine .  and then  one night  i left  to tell the federation .  they didn t know i left .  they didn t want me to leave .   his voice broke .   and i would have stayed as soon as not  but the federation had to know .     did you tell them anything about your ship .     how could i .  i m no mechanic .  i don t know the theory or construction .  but i showed them how to work the controls and let them look at the motors .  that s all .    brand gorla said  to himself mostly   then they ll never get it .  that isn t enough .    the albino s voice raised itself in sudden shrieking triumph .   oh  yes  they will .  i know them .  they re machines  you know .  they ll work on that problem .  and they ll work .  and they ll work .  and they ll never quit .  and they ll get it .  they got enough out of me .  i ll bet they got enough .    the board master looked long  and turned away   wearily .   why didn t you tell us .     because you took my world away from me .  i discovered it  by myself   all by myself .  and after i had done all the real work  and invited you in  you threw me out .  all you had for me was complaints that i had landed on the world and might have ruined everything by interference .  why should i tell you .  find out for yourselves if you re so wise  that you could afford to kick me around .    the board master thought bitterly   misfit .  inferiority complex .  persecution mania .  nice .  it all fits in  now that we ve bothered to take our eyes off the horizon and see what was under our nose .  and now it s all ruined .    he said   all right  realo  we all lose .  go away .    brand gorla said tightly   all over .  really all over .    the board master answered   really all over .  the original experiment  as such  is over .  the distortions created by realo s visit will easily be large enough to make the plans we are studying here a dead language .  and besides   murry is right .  if they have interstellar travel  they re dangerous .    realo was shouting   but you re not going to destroy them .  you can t destroy them .  they haven t hurt anyone .    there was no answer  and he raved on   i m going back .  i ll warn them .  they ll be prepared .  i ll warn them .        he was backing toward the door  his thin  white hair bristling  his red rimmed eyes bulging .   the board master did not move to stop him when he dashed out .    let him go .  it was his lifetime .  i don t care any more .    theor realo smashed toward the robot world at an acceleration that was half choking him .   somewhere ahead was the dustspeck of an isolated world with artificial imitations of humanity struggling along in an experiment that had died .  struggling blindly toward a new goal of interstellar travel that was to be their death sentence .   he was heading toward that world  toward the same city in which he had been  studied  the first time .  he remembered it well .  its name was the first words of their language he had learned .   new york .   the end  on july           which was a monday  i had one of the rare days off i could take during wartime .   it was  after all  my first wedding anniversary .   i was in new york that day  and i visited campbell just as in the good old days .  i discussed with him another story in the  foundation  series  as well as another in the  positronic robot  series .  from then on  i always saw campbell on the rare days when i was in new york on a weekday  and of course we corresponded regularly .   i was definitely back at writing .  output was low  but during the remaining war years i wrote two positronic robot stories   catch that rabbit  and  paradoxical escape   which appeared in the february      and august      issues of astounding  respectively .  both were eventually included in i  robot .   the latter story appears in    robot under the title of  escape .   the word  paradoxical  had been added by campbell in one of his few title changes  and i didn t like it .    i also wrote no less than four stories of the  foundation  series during those same years .  these were  the big and the little    the wedge    dead hand  and  the mule .   all appeared in astounding  of course  the first three in the august       october       and april      issues  respectively .    the mule  set several records for me .  it was the longest story i had ever written up to that time   fifty thousand words      long .  yet even so  and despite the fact that i had to work on it in small scraps of time left over from job and marriage  i managed to complete it in three and a half months .  it was submitted on may           and was accepted on the twenty ninth .   indeed  throughout the war i never got a single rejection  or even a delayed acceptance .  nor did i submit to anyone but campbell .    what s more  at the beginning of      campbell raised his basic rate to one and a half cents a word and some months later to a cent and three quarters .  for  the mule  i received a check at the higher rate  for      .  it was by far the largest check i ever received for a single story .  by the end of the war  in fact  i was making half as much money writing in my spare time as i was making at my n . a . e . s .  job  even though i had been promoted and was receiving sixty dollars a week by the end of the war .   then  too   the mule  was the first story i ever had published as a serial .  it appeared in two parts in the november and december      issues of astounding .   of the wartime  foundation  stories   the big and the little  and  the wedge  are included in foundation  while  dead hand  and  the mule   together  make up all of foundation and empire .   during the two years between mid      and mid       i wrote only one story that was neither one of the  foundation  series nor one of the  positronic robot  series  and that one was inspired directly by the n . a . e . s .  this story was  blind alley   which was written during september and early october of      .  it was submitted to campbell on october     and accepted on the twentieth .           blind alley  only once in galactic history was an intelligent race of non humans discovered      essays on history .   by ligurn vier   i   from  bureau for the outer provinces  to  loodun antyok  chief public administrator  a    subject  civilian supervisor of cepheus     administrative position as  references   act of council       of the year     of the galactic  empire  entitled   appointment of officials of the administra  tive service  methods for  revision of .    imperial directive  ja       dated         g . e .   by authorization of reference  a   you are hereby ap  pointed to the subject position .  the authority of said position  as civilian supervisor of cepheus    will extend over non   human subjects of the emperor living upon the planet under  the terms of autonomy set forth in reference  b  .   the duties of the subject position shall comprise the gen  eral supervision of all non human internal affairs  co ordina  tion of authorized government investigating and reporting  committees  and the preparation of semiannual reports on all  phases of non human affairs .   c .  morily  chief  buouprov         g . e .   loodun antyok had listened carefully  and now he shook his round head mildly   friend  i d like to help you  but you ve grabbed the wrong dog by the ears .  you d better take this up with the bureau .    tomor zammo flung himself back into his chair  rubbed his beak of a nose fiercely  thought better of whatever he was  astounding science fiction  march       copyright         by street and smith publications  inc .       going to say  and answered quietly   logical  but not practical .  i can t make a trip to trantor now .  you re the bureau s representative on cepheus    .  are you entirely helpless .     well  even as civilian supervisor  i ve got to work within the limits of bureau policy .     good   zammo cried   then  tell me what bureau policy is .  i head a scientific investigating committee  under direct imperial authorization with  supposedly  the widest powers  yet at every angle in the road i am pulled up short by the civilian authorities with only the parrot shriek of  bureau policy  to justify themselves .  what is bureau policy .  i haven t received a decent definition yet .    antyok s gaze was level and unruffled .  he said   as i see it  and this is not official  so you can t hold me to it   bureau policy consists in treating the non humans as decently as possible .     then  what authority have they        ssh .  no use raising your voice .  as a matter of fact  his imperial majesty is a humanitarian and a disciple of the philosophy of aurelion .  i can tell you quietly that it is pretty well known that it is the emperor himself who first suggested that this world be established .  you can bet that bureau policy will stick pretty close to imperial notions .  and you can bet that i can t paddle my way against that sort of current .     well  m boy   the physiologist s fleshy eyelids quivered   if you take that sort of attitude  you re going to lose your job .  no  i won t have you kicked out .  that s not what i mean at all .  your job will just fade out from under you  because nothing is going to be accomplished here .     really .  why .   antyok was short  pink  and pudgy  and his plump cheeked face usually found it difficult to put on display any expression other than one of bland and cheerful politeness   but it looked grave now .    you haven t been here long .  i have .   zammo scowled .   mind if i smoke .   the cigar in his hand was gnarled and strong and was puffed to life carelessly .   he continued roughly   there s no place here for humani tarianism  administrator .  you re treating non humans as if they were humans  and it won t work .  in fact  i don t like the word  non human .   they re animals .     they re intelligent   interjected antyok  softly .    well  intelligent animals  then .  i presume the two terms are      not mutually exclusive .  alien intelligences mingling in the same space won t work  anyway .     do you propose killing them off .     galaxy  no .   he gestured with his cigar .   i propose we look upon them as objects for study  and only that .  we could learn a good deal from these animals if we were allowed to .  knowledge  i might point out  that would be used for the immediate benefit of the human race .  there s humanity for you .  there s the good of the masses  if it s this spineless cult of aurelion that interests you .     what  for instance  do you refer to .     to take the most obvious     you have heard of their chemistry  i take it .     yes   antyok admitted .   i have leafed through most of the reports on the non humans published in the last ten years .  i expect to go through more .     hmp .  well    then  all i need say is that their chemical therapy is extremely thorough .  for instance  i have witnessed personally the healing of a broken bone   what passes for a broken bone with them  i mean   by the use of a pill .  the bone was whole in fifteen minutes .  naturally  none of their drugs are any earthly use on humans .  most would kill quickly .  but if we found out how they worked on the non humans   on the animals       yes  yes .  i see the significance .     oh  you do .  come  that s gratifying .  a second point is that these animals communicate hi an unknown manner .    telepathy .    the scientist s mouth twisted  as he ground out   telepathy .  telepathy .  telepathy .  might as well say by witch brew .  nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name .  what is the mechanism of telepathy .  what is the physiology and the physics of it .  i would like to find out  but i can t .  bureau policy  if i listen to you  forbids .    antyok s little mouth pursed itself .   but     pardon me  doctor  but i don t follow you .  how are you prevented .  surely the civil administration has made no attempt to hamper scientific investigation of these non humans .  i cannot speak for my predecessor entirely  of course  but i myself        no direct interference has occurred .  i don t speak of that .  but by the galaxy  administrator  we re hampered by the spirit of the entire set up .  you re making us deal with humans .  you      allow them their own leader and internal autonomy .  you pamper them and give them what aurelion s philosophy would call  rights .   i can t deal with their leader .     why not .     because he refuses to allow me a free hand .  he refuses to allow experiments on any subject without the subject s own consent .  the two or three volunteers we get are not too bright .  it s an impossible arrangement .    antyok shrugged helplessly .   zammo continued   in addition  it is obviously impossible to learn anything of value concerning the brains  physiology and chemistry of these animals without dissection  dietary experiments and drugs .  you know  administrator  scientific investigation is a hard game .  humanity hasn t much place in it .    loodun antyok tapped his chin with a doubtful finger   must it be quite so hard .  these are harmless creatures  these non humans .  surely  dissection     perhaps  if you were to approach them a bit differently   i have the idea that you antagonize them .  your attitude might be somewhat overbearing .     overbearing .  i am not one of these whining social psychologists who are all the fad these days .  i don t believe you can solve a problem that requires dissection by approaching it with what is called the  correct personal attitude  in the cant of the times .     i m sorry you think so .  sociopsychological training is required of all administrators above the grade of a   .    zammo withdrew his cud of a cigar from his mouth and replaced it after a suitably contemptuous interval .   then you d better use a bit of your technique on the bureau .  you know  i do have friends at the imperial court .     well  now  i can t take the matter up with them  not baldly .  basic policy does not fall within my cognizance  and such things can only be initiated by the bureau .  but  you know  we might try an indirect approach on this .   he smiled faintly   strategy .     what sort .    antyok pointed a sudden finger  while his other hand fell lightly on the rows of gray bound reports upon the floor just next his chair   now  look  i ve gone through most of these .  they re dull  but contain some facts .  for instance  when was the last non human infant born on cepheus    .    zammo spent little time in consideration .   don t know .  don t care either .         but the bureau would .  there s never been a non human infant born on cepheus      not in the two years the world has been established .  do you know the reason .    the physiologist shrugged   too many possible factors .  it would take study .     all right  then .  suppose you write a report        reports .  i ve written twenty .     write another .  stress the unsolved problems .  tell them you must change your methods .  harp on the birth rate problem .  the bureau doesn t dare ignore that .  if the non humans die out  someone will have to answer to the emperor .  you see       zammo stared  his eyes dark   that will swing it .     i ve been working for the bureau for twenty seven years .  i know its ways .     i ll think about it .   zammo rose and stalked out of the office .  the door slammed behind him .   it was later that zammo said to a co worker   he s a bureaucrat  in the first place .  he won t abandon the orthodoxies of paper work and he won t risk sticking his neck out .  he ll accomplish little by himself  yet maybe more than a little if we work through him .    from  administrative headquarters  cepheus     to  buouprov  subject  outer

changes in pre  sent buouprov policy with regard to non humans with a view  to facilitating physical and chemical investigations at present  proceeding under authorization of reference  a   it is brought to the attention of the buouprov that refer  ence  b  has already discussed possible changes in investigating      methods and that it remains the opinion of adhq cephl  that such changes are as yet premature .  it is nevertheless suggested that the question of non human birth rate be made the subject of a buouprov project assigned to adhq cephl  in view of the importance attached by scigroup    to the problem  as evidenced in section v of enclosure   .   l .  antyok  superv .  adhq cephls           from  buouprov to  adhq cephls  subject  outer province project        scientific investigations of non humans of cepheus     co ordination of  reference   a  adhq cephls letr .  aa la mn  dated         g . e .   in response to the suggestion contained in paragraph   of  reference  a   it is considered that the question of the non   human birth rate does not fall within the cognizance of adhq   ceph    .  in view of the fact that scigroup    has reported  said sterility to be probably due to a chemical deficiency in the  food supply  all investigations in the field are relegated to sci  group    as the proper authority .   investigating procedures by the various scigroups shall  continue according to current directives on the subject .  no  changes in policy are envisaged .   c .  morily  chief  buouprov          g . e .    ii   there was a loose jointed gauntness about the news reporter which made him appear somberly tall .  he was gustiv ban nerd  with whose reputation was combined ability   two things which do not invariably go together despite the maxims of elementary morality .   loodum antyok took his measure doubtfully and said   there s no use denying that you re right .  but the sci group report was confidential .  i don t understand how       it leaked   said bannerd  callously .   everything leaks .   antyok was obviously baffled  and his pink face furrowed slightly  then i ll just have to plug the leak here .  i can t pass your story .  all references to scigroup complaints have to come out .  you see that  don t you .         no .   bannerd was calm enough .   it s important  and i have my rights under the imperial directive .  i think the empire should know what s going on .     but it isn t going on   said antyok  despairingly .   your claims are all wrong .  the bureau isn t going to change its policy .  i showed you the letters .     you think you can stand up against zammo when he puts the pressure on .   the newsman asked derisively .    i will   if i think he s wrong .     if .   stated bannerd flatly .  then  in a sudden fervor   antyok  the empire has something great here  something greater by a good deal than the government apparently realizes .  they re destroying it .  they re treating these creatures like animals .     really     began antyok  weakly .    don t talk about cepheus    .  it s a zoo .  it s a high class zoo  with your petrified scientists teasing those poor creatures with their sticks poking through the bars .  you throw them chunks of meat  but you cage them up .  i know .  i ve been writing about them for two years now .  i ve almost been living with them .     zammo says        zammo .   this with hard contempt .    zammo says   insisted antyok with worried firmness   that we treat them too like humans as it is .    the newsman s straight  long cheeks were rigid   zammo is rather animallike in his own right .  he is a science worshiper .  we can do with less of them .  have you read aureh on s works .   the last was suddenly posed .    umm .  yes .  i understand the emperor        the emperor tends towards us .  that is good   better than the hounding of the last reign .     i don t see where you re heading .    these aliens have much to teach us .  you understand .  it is nothing that zammo and his sci group can use  no chemistry  no telepathy .  it s a way of life  a way of thinking .  the aliens have no crime  no misfits .  what effort is being made to study their philosophy .  or to set them up as a problem in social engineering .    antyok grew thoughtful  and his plump face smoothed out   it is an interesting consideration .  it would be a matter for psychologists        no good .  most of them are quacks .  psychologists point out problems  but their solutions are fallacious .  we need men of aurelion .  men of the philosophy            but look here  we can t turn cepheus    into  .  .  .  into a metaphysical study .     why not .  it can be done easily .     how .     forget your puny test tube peerings .  allow the aliens to set up a society free of humans .  give them an untrammeled independence and allow an intermingling of philosophies       antyok s nervous response came  that can t be done in a day .     we can start in a day .    the administrator said slowly   well  i can t prevent you from trying to start .   he grew confidential  his mild eyes thoughtful   you ll ruin your own game  though  if you publish scigroup    s report and denounce it on humanitarian grounds .  the scientists are powerful .     and we of the philosophy as well .     yes  but there s an easy way .  you needn t rave .  simply point out that the scigroup is not solving its problems .  do so unemotionally and let the readers think out your point of view for  themselves .  take the birth rate problem  for instance .  there s something for you .  in a generation  the non humans might die out  for all science can do .  point out that a more philosophical approach is required .  or pick some other obvious point .  use your judgment  eh .    antyok smiled ingratiatingly as he arose   but  for the galaxy s sake  don t stir up a bad smell .    bannerd was stiff and unresponsive   you may be right .    it was later that bannerd wrote in a capsule message to a friend   he is not clever  by any means .  he is confused and has no guiding line through life .  certainly utterly incompetent in his job .  but he s a cutter and a trimmer  compromises his way around difficulties  and will yield concessions rather than risk a hard stand .  he may prove valuable in that .  yours in aurelion .    from  adhq cephl  to  buouprov  subject

rate phenomena mentioned in  references  a  and  b  .  a project is therefore set up  entitled    birth rate of non humans on cepheus     investigation of  to  which  in view of the crucial importance of the subject  a  priority of aa is given .   the number assigned to the subject project is       and all  expenses incidental to it shall be assigned to appropriation  number       .   c  morily  chief  buouproy          g . e .    iii   if tomor zammo s ill humor lessened within the grounds of scigroup    experimental station  his friendliness had not thereby increased .  antyok found himself standing alone at the viewing window into the main field laboratory .   the main field laboratory was a broad court set at the en     vironmental conditions of cepheus    itself for the discomfort of the experimenters and the convenience of the experimem tees .  through the burning sand  and the dry  oxygen rich air  there sparkled the hard brilliance of hot  white sunlight .  and under the blaze  the brick red non humans  wrinkled of skin and wiry of build  huddled in their squatting positions of ease  by ones and twos .   zammo emerged from the laboratory .  he paused to drink water thirstily .  he looked up  moisture gleaming on his upper lip   like to step in there .    antyok shook his head definitely   no  thank you .  what s the temperature right now .     a hundred twenty  if there were shade .  and they complain of the cold .  it s drinking time now .  want to watch them drink .    a spray of water shot upward from the fountain in the center of the court  and the little alien figures swayed to their feet and hopped eagerly forward in a queer  springy half run .  they milled about the water  jostling one another .  the centers of their faces were suddenly disfigured by the projection of a long and flexible fleshy tube  which thrust forward into the spray and was withdrawn dripping .   it continued for long minutes .  the bodies swelled and the wrinkles disappeared .  they retreated slowly  backing away  with the drinking tube flicking in and out  before receding finally into a pink  wrinkled mass above a wide  lipless mouth .  they went to sleep in groups in the shaded angles  plump and sated .    animals .   said zammo  with contempt .    how often do they drink .   asked antyok .    as often as they want .  they can go a week if they have to .  we water them every day .  they store it under their skin .  they eat in the evenings .  vegetarians  you know .    antyok smiled chubbily   it s nice to get a bit of firsthand information occasionally .  can t read reports all the time .     yes .     noncommittally .  then   what s new .  what about the lacy pants boys on trantor .    antyok shrugged dubiously   you can t get the bureau to commit itself  unfortunately .  with the emperor sympathetic to the aurelionists  humanitarianism is the order of the day .  you know that .    there was a pause in which the administrator chewed his lip uncertainly .   but there s this birth rate problem now .  it s finally      been assigned to adhq  you know   and double a priority  too .    zammo muttered wordlessly .   antyok said   you may not realize it  but that project will now take precedence over all other work proceeding on ceph eus    .  it s important .    he turned back to the viewing window and said thoughtfully with a bald lack of preamble .   do you think those creatures might be unhappy .     unhappy .   the word was an explosion .    well  then   antyok corrected hastily   maladjusted .  you understand .  it s difficult to adjust an environment to a race we know so little of .     say   did you ever see the world we took them from .     i ve read the reports       reports .     infinite contempt .   i ve seen it .  this may look like desert out there to you  but it s a watery paradise to those devils .  they have all the food and water they can get .  they have a world to themselves with vegetation and natural water flow  instead of a lump of silica and granite where fungi were force grown in caves and water had to be steamed out of gypsum rock .  in ten years  they would have been dead to the last beast  and we saved them .  unhappy .  ga a ah  if they are  they haven t the decency of most animals .     well  perhaps .  yet i have a notion .     a notion .  what is your notion .   zammo reached for one of his cigars .    it s something that might help you .  why not study the creatures in a more integrated fashion .  let them use their initiative .  after all  they did have a highly developed science .  your reports speak of it continually .  give them problems to solve .    such as .     oh  .  .  .  oh   antyok waved his hands helplessly .   whatever you think might help most .  for instance  spaceships .  get them into the control room and study their reactions .    why .   asked zammo with dry bluntness .   because the reaction of their minds to tools and controls adjusted to the human temperament can teach you a lot .  in addition  it will make a more effective bribe  it seems to me  than anything you ve yet tried .  you ll get more volunteers if they think they ll be doing something interesting .    that s your psychology coming out .  hm m m .  sounds bet       ter than it probably is .  i ll sleep on it .  and where would i get permission  in any case  to let them handle spaceships .  i ve none at my disposal  and it would take a good deal longer than it was worth to follow down the line of red tape to get one assigned to us .    antyok pondered  and his forehead creased lightly   it doesn t have to be spaceships .  but even so   if you would write up another report and make the suggestion yourself   strongly  you understand   i might figure out some way of tying it up with my birth rate project .  a double a priority can get practically anything  you know  without questions .    zammo s interest lacked a bit even of mildness   well  maybe .  meanwhile  i ve some basal metabolism tests in progress  and it s getting late .  i ll think about it .  it s got its points .    from  adhq cephl   to  buouprov  subject  outer province project

for use in investigation of non humans on  cepheus    with respect to the subject project and other  authorized ouprov projects  as requested in enclosure   to  reference  a  .   it is urgently requested that work on the subject project be  expedited by all available means .   c .  morily  head  buouprov         g . e .    iv   the little  bricky creature must have been more uncomfortable than his bearing would admit to .  he was carefully wrapped in a temperature already adjusted to the point where his human companions steamed in their open shirts .   his speech was high pitched and careful   i find it damp  but not unbearably so at this low temperature .    antyok smiled   it was nice of you to come .  i had planned to visit you .  but a trial run in your atmosphere out there     the smile had become rueful .    it doesn t matter .  you other worldlings have done more for us than ever we were able to do for ourselves .  it is an obligation that is but imperfectly returned by the endurance on my part of a trifling discomfort .   his speech seemed always indirect  as if he approached his thoughts sidelong  or as if it were against all etiquette to be blunt .   gustiv bannerd  seated in an angle of the room  with one long leg crossing the other  scrawled nimbly and said   you don t mind if i record all this .    the cepheid non human glanced briefly at the journalist   i have no objection .    antyok s apologetics persisted .  this is not a purely social affair  sir .  i would not have forced discomfort on you for that .  there are important questions to be considered  and you are the leader of your people .    the cepheid nodded   i am satisfied your purposes are kindly .  please proceed .    the administrator almost wriggled in his difficulty in putting thoughts into words .   it is a subject   he said   of delicacy  and one i wou d never bring up if it weren t for the overwhelming importance of the  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  question .  i am only the spokesman of my government           my people consider the otherworld government a kindly one .     well  yes  they are kindly .  for that reason  they are disturbed over the fact that your people no longer breed .    antyok paused  and waited with worry for a reaction that did not come .  the cepheid s face was motionless except for the soft  trembling motion of the wrinkled area that was ms deflated drinking tube .   antyok continued   it is a question we have hesitated to bring up because of its extremely personal angles .  noninterference is my government s prime aim  and we have done our best to investigate the problem quietly and without disturbing your people .  but  frankly  we        have failed .   finished the cepheid  at the other s pause .    yes .  or at least  we have not discovered a concrete failure to reproduce the exact environment of your original world  with  of course  the necessary modification to make it more livable .  naturally  it is thought there is some chemical shortcoming .  and so i ask your voluntary help in the matter .  your people are advanced in the study of your own biochemistry .  if you do not choose  or would rather not        no  no  i can help .   the cepheid seemed cheerful about it .  the smooth flat planes of his loose skinned  hairless skull wrinkled in an alien response to an uncertain emotion .   it is not a matter that any of us would have thought would have disturbed you other worldlings .  that it does is but another indication of your well meaning kindness .  this wor d we find congenial  a paradise in comparison to our o . d .  it lacks in nothing .  conditions such as now prevail belong in our legends of the golden age .     well       but there is a something  a something you may not understand .  we cannot expect different intelligences to think alike .     i shall try to understand .    the cepheid s voice had grown soft  its liquid undertones more pronounced   we were dying on our native world  but we were fighting .  our science  developed through a history older than yours  was losing  but it had not yet lost .  perhans it was because our science was fundamentally biological .  rather than physical as yours is .  your people discovered new forms of energy and reached the stars .  our people d scovered new truths of psychology and psychiatry and built up a working society free of disease and crime .        there is no need to question which of the two angles of approach was the more laudable  but there is no uncertainty as to which proved more successful in the end .  in our dying world  without the means of life or sources of power  our biological science could but make the dying easier .    and yet we fought .  for centuries past  we had been groping toward the elements of atomic power  and slowly the spark of hope had glimmered that we might break through the two dimensional limits of our planetary surface and reach the stars .  there were no other planets in our system to serve as stepping stones .  nothing but some twenty light years to the nearest star  without the knowledge of the possibility of the existence of other planetary systems  but rather of the contrary .    but there is something in all life that insists on striving  even on useless striving .  there were only five thousand of us left in the last days .  only five thousand .  and our first ship was ready .  it was experimental .  it would probably have been a failure .  but already we had all the principles of propulsion and navigation correctly worked out .    there was a long pause  and the cepheid s small black eyes seemed glazed in retrospect .   the newspaperman put in suddenly  from his corner   and then we came .     and then you came   the cepheid agreed simply .   it changed everything .  energy was ours for the asking .  a new world  congenial and  indeed  ideal  was ours even without asking .  if our problems of society had long been solved by ourselves  our more difficult problems of environment were suddenly solved for us  no less completely .     well .   urged antyok .    well   it was somehow not well .  for centuries  our ancestors had fought toward the stars  and now the stars suddenly proved to be the property of others .  we had fought for life  and it had become a present handed to us by others .  there is no longer any reason to fight .  there is no longer anything to attain .  all the universe is the property of your race .     this world is yours   said antyok  gently .    by sufferance .  it is a gift .  it is not ours by right    you have earned it  in my opinion .    and now the cepheid s eyes were sharply fixed on the other s countenance   you mean well  but i doubt that you understand .  we have nowhere to go  save this gift of a world .      we are in a blind alley .  the function of life is striving  and that is taken from us .  life can no longer interest us .  we have no offspring   voluntarily .  it is our way of removing ourselves from your way .    absent mindedly  antyok had removed the fluoro globe from the window seat  and spun it on its base .  its gaudy surface reflected light as it spun  and its three foot high bulk floated with incongruous grace and lightness in the air .   antyok said   is that your only solution .  sterility .     we might escape still   whispered the cepheid   but where in the galaxy is there place for us .  it is all yours .     yes  there is no place for you nearer than the magellame clouds if you wished independence .  the magellanic clouds        and you would not let us go of yourselves .  you mean kindly  i know .     yes  we mean kindly   but we could not let you go .     it is a mistaken kindness .     perhaps  but could you not reconcile yourselves .  you have a world .     it is something past complete explanations .  your mind is different .  we could not reconcile ourselves .  i believe  administrator  that you have thought of all this before .  the concept of the blind alley we find ourselves trapped in is not new to you .    antyok looked up  startled  and one hand steadied the fluoro globe   can you read my mind .     it is just a guess .  a good one  i think .     yes   but can you read my mind .  the minds of humans in general  i mean .  it is an interesting point .  the scientists say you cannot  but sometimes i wonder if it is that you simply will not .  could you answer that .  i am detaining you  unduly  perhaps .     no  .  .  .  no      but the little cepheid drew his enveloping robe closer  and buried his face in the electrically heated pad at the collar for a moment .   you other worldlings speak of reading minds .  it is not so at all  but it is assuredly hopeless to explain .    antyok mumbled the old proverb   one cannot explain sight to a man blind from birth .     yes  just so .  this sense which you call  mind reading   quite erroneously  cannot be applied to us .  it is not that we cannot receive the proper sensations  it is that your people do not transmit them  and we have no way of explaining to you how      to go about it .     hm m m .     there are times  of course  of great concentration or emotional tension on the part of an other worldling when some of us who are more expert in this sense  more sharp eyed  so to speak  detect vaguely something .  it is uncertain  yet i myself have at times wondered       carefully  antyok began spinning the fluoro globe once more .  his pink face was set in thought  and his eyes were fixed upon the cepheid .  gustiv bannerd stretched his fingers and reread his notes  his lips moving silently .   the fluoro globe spun  and slowly the cepheid seemed to grow tense as well  as his eyes shifted to the colorful sheen of the globe s fragile surface .   the cepheid said   what is that .    antyok started  and his face smoothed into an almost chuckling placidity   this .  a galactic fad of three years ago  which means that it is a hopelessly old fashioned relic this year .  it is a useless device but it looks pretty .  bannerd  could you adjust the windows to non transmission .    there was the soft click of a contact  and the windows became curved regions of darkness  while in the center of the room  the fluoro globe was suddenly the focus of a rosy effulgence that seemed to leap outward in streamers .  antyok  a scarlet figure in a scarlet room  placed it upon the table and spun it with a hand that dripped red .  as it spun  the colors changed with a slowly increasing rapidity  blended and fell apart into more extreme contrasts .   antyok was speaking in an eerie atmosphere of molten  shifting rainbow   the surface is of a material that exhibits variable fluorescence .  it is almost weightless  extremely fragile  but gyroscopically balanced so that it rarely falls  with ordinary care .  it is rather pretty  don t you think .    from somewhere the cepheid s voice came   extremely pretty .     but it has outworn its welcome  outlived its fashionable existence .    the cepheid s voice was abstracted   it is very pretty .    bannerd restored the light at a gesture  and the colors faded .   the cepheid said   that is something my people would enjoy .   he stared at the globe with fascination .       and now antyok rose .   you had better go .  if you stay longer  the atmosphere may have bad effects .  i thank you humbly for your kindness .     i thank you humbly for yours .   the cepheid had also risen .   antyok said   most of your people  by the way  have accepted our offers to them to study the make up of our modern spaceships .  you understand  i suppose  that the purpose was to study the reactions of your people to our technology .  i trust that conforms with your sense of propriety .     you need not apologize .  i  myself  have now the makings of a human pilot .  it was most interesting .  it recalls our own efforts   and reminds us of how nearly on the right track we were .    the cepheid left  and antyok sat  frowning .    well   he said to bannerd  a little sharply .   you remember our agreement  i hope .  this interview can t be published .    bannerd shrugged   very well .    antyok was at his seat  and his fingers fumbled with the small metal figurine upon his desk   what do you think of all this  bannerd .     i am sorry for them .  i think i understand how they feel .  we must educate them out of it .  the philosophy can do it .     you think so .     yes .     we can t let them go  of course .     oh  no .  out of the question .  we have too much to learn from them .  this feeling of theirs is only a passing stage .  they ll think differently  especially when we allow them the completest independence .     maybe .  what do you think of the fluoro globes  bannerd .  he liked them .  it might be a gesture of the right sort to order several thousand of them .  the galaxy knows  they re a drug on the market right now  and cheap enough .     sounds like a good idea   said bannerd .    the bureau would never agree  though .  i know them .    the newsman s eyes narrowed   but it might be just the thing .  they need new interests .     yes .  well  we could do something .  i could include your transcript of the interview as part of a report and just emphasize the matter of the globes a bit .  after all  you re a member of the philosophy and might have influence with important people  whose word with the bureau might carry much more      weight than mine .  you understand    .    yes   mused bannerd .   yes .

was over  the wine had been brought in and the cigars were out .  the groups of talkers had formed  and the captain of the merchant fleet was the center of the largest .  his brilliant white uniform quite outsparkled his listeners .   he was almost complacent in his speech  the trip was nothing .  i ve had more than three hundred ships under me before this .  still  i ve never had a cargo quite like this .  what do you want with five thousand fluoro globes on this desert  by the galaxy .    loodun antyok laughed gently .  he shrugged   for the non humans .  it wasn t a difficult cargo  i hope .     no  not difficult .  but bulky .  they re fragile  and i couldn t carry more than twenty to a ship  with all the government regulations concerning packing and precautions against breakage .  but it s the government s money  i suppose .    zammo smiled grimly .   is this your first experience with government methods  captain .     galaxy  no   exploded the spaceman .   i try to avoid it  of course  but you can t help getting entangled on occasion .  and it s an abhorrent thing when you are  and that s the truth .  the red tape .  the paper work .  it s enough to stunt your growth and curdle your circulation .  it s a tumor  a cancerous growth on the galaxy .  i d wipe out the whole mess .    antyok said   you re unfair  captain .  you don t understand .     yes .  well  now  as one of these bureaucrats   and he smiled amiably at the word   suppose you explain your side of the situation  administrator .     well  now   antyok seemed confused   government is a serious and complicated business .  we ve got thousands of planets to worry about in this empire of ours and billions of people .  it s almost past human ability to supervise the business of governing without the tightest sort of organization .  i think there are something like four hundred million men today in the imperial administrative service alone  and in order to coordinate their efforts and to pool their knowledge  you must have what you call red tape and paper work .  every bit of it  senseless though it may seem  annoying though it may be  has its uses .  every piece of paper is a thread binding the labors of four hundred million humans .  abolish the administrative service and you abolish the empire  and with it  interstellar peace       order and civilization .     come      said the captain .    no .  i mean it .   antyok was earnestly breathless .   the rules and system of the administrative set up must be sufficiently all embracing and rigid so that in case of incompetent officials  and sometimes one is appointed   you may laugh  but there are incompetent scientists  and newsmen  and captains  too   in case of incompetent officials  i say  little harm will be done .  for  at the worst  the system can move by itself .     yes   grunted the captain  sourly   and if a capable administrator should be appointed .  he is then caught by the same rigid web and is forced into mediocrity .     not at all   replied antyok  warmly .   a capable man can work within the limits of the rules and accomplish what he wishes .     how .   asked bannerd .    well  .  .  .  well      antyok was suddenly ill at ease .   one method is to get yourself an a priority project  or double a  if possible .    the captain leaned his head back for laughter  but never quite made it  for the door was flung open and frightened men were pouring in .  the shouts made no sense at first .  then    sir  the ships are gone .  these non humans have taken them by force .     what .  all .     every one .  ships and creatures       it was two hours later that the four were together again  alone in antyok s office now .   antyok said coldly   they ve made no mistakes .  there s not a ship left behind  not even your training ship  zammo .  and there isn t a government ship available in this entire half of the sector .  by the time we organize a pursuit they ll be out of the galaxy and halfway to the magellanic clouds .  captain  it was your responsibility to maintain an adequate guard .    the captain cried   it was our first day out of space .  who could have known       zammo interrupted fiercely   wait a while  captain .  i m beginning to understand .  antyok   his voice was hard   you engineered this .     i .   antyok s expression was strangely cool  almost indifferent .    you told us this evening that a clever administrator got an     a priority project assigned to accomplish what he wished .  you got such a project in order to help the non humans escape .      did .  i beg your pardon  but how could that be .  it was you yourself in one of your reports that brought up the problem of the failing birth rate .  it was bannerd  here  whose sensational articles frightened the bureau into making a double a priority project out of it .  i had nothing to do with it .     you suggested that i mention the birth rate   said zammo  violently .    did i .   said antyok  composedly .    and for that matter   roared bannerd  suddenly   you suggested that i mention the birth rate in my articles .    the three ringed him now and hemmed him in .  antyok leaned back in his chair and said easily   i don t know what you mean by suggestions .  if you are accusing me  please stick to evidence   legal evidence .  the laws of the empire go by written  filmed or transcribed material  or by witnessed statements .  all my letters as administrator are on file here  at the bureau  and at other places .  i never asked for an a priority project .  the bureau assigned it to me  and zammo and bannerd are responsible for that .  in print  at any rate .    zammo s voice was an almost inarticulate growl   you hoodwinked me into teaching the creatures how to handle a spaceship .     it was your suggestion .  i have your report proposing they be studied in their reaction to human tools on file .  so has the bureau .  the evidence   the legal evidence  is plain .  i had nothing to do with it .     nor with the globes .   demanded bannerd .   the captain howled suddenly   you had my ships brought here purposely .  five thousand globes .  you knew it would require hundreds of craft .     i never asked for globes   said antyok  coldly .   that was the bureau s idea  although i think bannerd s friends of the phil osphy helped that along .    bannerd fairly choked .  he spat out   you were asking that cepheid leader if he could read minds .  you were telling him to express interest in the globes .     come  now .  you prepared the transcript of the conversation yourself  and that  too  is on file .  you can t prove it .   he stood up   you ll have to excuse me .  i must prepare a report for the bureau .    at the door  antyok turned   in a way  the problem of the      non humans is solved  even if only to their own satisfaction .  they ll breed now  and have a world they ve earned themselves .  it s what they wanted .    another thing .  don t accuse me of silly things .  i ve been in the service for twenty seven years  and i assure you that my paper work is proof enough that i have been thoroughly correct in everything i have done .  and captain  i ll be glad to continue our discussion of earlier this evening at your convenience and explain how a capable administrator can work through red tape and still get what he wants .    it was remarkable that such a round  smooth baby face could wear a smile quite so sardonic .   from  buouprov  to  loodun antyok  chief public administrator  a    subject  administrative service  standing in .   reference    a  adserv court decision       q  dated        g . e .     .  in view of the favorable opinion handed down in reference  a  you are hereby absolved of all responsibility for the flight of non humans on cepheus    .  it is requested that you hold yourself in readiness for your next appointment .   r .  horpritt .  chief  adserv         g . e .   the end  the letters that form a major part of this story  which contains one of my rare examples of extraterrestrial intelligences  are  you will be glad to know  based on the kind of material that routinely passed in and out of the n . a . e . s .   and  for all i know  still does  .  the turgid style is not my invention .  i couldn t invent it if i tried .   when the story appeared  l .  sprague de camp happily pointed out one flaw in the letter style  i had carelessly made someone in lower position  who was addressing someone in higher position  say   it is requested  instead of  it is suggested .   the underling can humbly suggest  but only an overling can harshly request .    blind alley  has one distinction i would like to mention .   after the war  there began that flood of science fiction anthologies that has been growing in width and depth ever since .  few  if any  science fiction writers have been antholo       gized as often as i have and the first one of my stories to be anthologized was not  nightfall  or a  positronic robot  story or a  foundation  story .  it was  blind alley .        in early      groff conklin was putting out the first of his many science fiction anthologies   one called  the best of science fiction    and there you will find  blind alley .   that story  for which campbell had paid      .     he a word  then earned another     .    qc a word  .  this meant that  blind alley  had earned me     c a word  which was a record high at the time .   strictly speaking  the money for the anthologization was paid to street   smith  but street   smith had the enlightened habit of turning such money over to the author   voluntarily and without legal compulsion .  and this was the first indication i ever received  by the way  that a story could earn more money than that which it earned at the time of its original sale .   on may          one week before  the mule  was completed  the war ended in europe .  naturally  there was at once a move to demobilize as many of the men who had been fighting in europe as possible  and to draft replacements from among those who had luxuriated at home .   all through the war  till then  i had been receiving regular draft deferments as a research chemist working in a position important to the war effort .  periodically  there were revisions of the draft rules  and it was a rare month in which it did not look at one time or another as though i might be drafted .   it kept me on my toes  i can tell you  but i did not feel particularly ill used .  my predominant feeling was that of a sneaking guilt at not being drafted and some shame that i was relieved at my deferment .    during       the uncertainty went so far that i was called in for a physical examination  and it at once turned out that my nearsightedness was so bad as to render me ineligible for the draft anyway .   after v e day  the navy yard was ordered to retain only some percentage of those of its deferred employees  allowing the remainder to be drafted .  presumably  the navy yard would select its most important employees to keep  but they knew a better trick  according to the tale we employees heard .  they retained all draftable employees who met the physical requirements  and removed protection from those who did not meet      them either because of age or physical defect .  in this way  they hoped to keep them all   those who were fit  because they were declared necessary  and those who were overage or unfit  because they were overage or unfit .   i  as an unfit employee  was one of those declared non essential .   and then  you guessed it  the army lowered its physical requirements .  the result was that those navy yard employees with bad eyes or other mild deficiencies were put in imminent peril of the draft  while others  who were in every way equivalent except that they were in good shape  were not .   you may well laugh .    for four months after v e day  it was up and down with me and the draft and i never knew  on one day  whether i might not receive my induction notice on the next .  while i waited  the atom bombs were dropping on hiroshima and nagasaki and the japanese formally surrendered on september   .   on september          i received my notice of induction .  i didn t enjoy it  of course  but i tried to be philosophical .  the war was over  and  whatever difficulties i might have during the two years i expected to be in  at least no one would be shooting at me .  i entered the army on november          as a buck private .   naturally  during all the fuss over the draft  culminating in my induction  i did no writing .  there was an eight month hiatus  in fact  the longest in three years .   on january          however  while i was still working my way through basic training in camp lee  virginia  i began another  positronic robot  story  called  evidence .   i made use of a typewriter in one of the administrative buildings .   naturally  it was slow work .  i didn t finish first draft till february     and then everything came to a halt when  the very next day  i discovered that i would be among those sent out to the south pacific to participate in  operation crossroads .   this was the first postwar atom bomb test  on the island of bikini  which later gave its name to a bathing suit so skimpy as to react on the male constitution   in theory   like an atom bomb  .  the fact that a week later i received my check for the anthologization of  blind alley  did little to raise my spirits .   we left on march          traveling by train and ship  and arrived in honolulu on march    .  there then began a long      wait before we could go on to bikini  the atom bomb test was postponed  of course  .  when time began to hang heavy enough  i returned to  evidence .   i persuaded a sympathetic librarian to lock me up in the building when it closed for lunch so that i had an hour each day absolutely alone at the typewriter .  i finished the story on april     and mailed it off to campbell the next day .   on april     i received word of its acceptance .  by that time  the word rate had reached two cents .   i never did go to bikini  by the way .  some administrative error back home ended the allotment being sent to my wife .  i was sent back to the united states on may    to inquire into the matter  it was all straightened out by the time i was back at camp lee .  as long as i was there  however  i applied for a  research discharge  on the ground that i was going back to my ph . d work .  i was out of the army  as a corporal  on july    .    evidence  was the only story i wrote while in uniform .   as soon as i got out of the army i made arrangements to return to columbia  after an absence of a little over four years  and to resume my work toward my ph . d .  under professor dawson .   there was still no question in my mind that chemistry was my career  and my only career .  in the four years of my marriage i had written nine science fiction stories and one fantasy and had sold them all   but all the sales had been to campbell .   since unknown had died  i was terribly conscious that astounding might die as well .  if that happened  or if campbell retired  i was not at all sure that i could continue selling .   the situation looked better postwar than prewar  to be sure .  during the first four years of my marriage  i had earned       as a writer  or an average of under     per week .  this was about half again as well as i had been doing in my bachelor days  even though i was writing fewer stories .   the word rate had doubled  you see  and there was even the hope of subsidiary rights   extra money for already sold stories .   blind alley  had already placed in an anthology  and on august           only a month after i got out of the army  i discovered that i had made a second such sale .  a new science fiction anthology   adventures in time and space   edited by raymond j .  healey and j .  francis mccomas  was to include  nightfall  and i was to receive     .    for that .       there was even more than anthologization sales .  in that same month of august  the september      issue of astounding hit the stands with  evidence   had i but known when writing it that by the time it was published i would be safely out of the army .   almost at once i received a telegram asking for the movie rights .  the gentleman interested turned out to be none other than orson welles .  in great excitement  i sold him the radio  television and movie rights to the story on september     and waited to become famous .   i couldn t become wealthy  because the entire payment in full was only      .    unfortunately  nothing happened .  to this day  mr .  welles has never used the story .  but the check was certainly useful toward paying my tuition .   despite everything  though  it still seemed quite out of the question that i could ever possibly depend on writing for a year in  year out living  especially now that i was married and hoped  eventually  to have children .   so back to school it was  with a small savings account to serve as a cushion  with some veterans  benefits supplied by the government  and  of course  with the hope that i would make a little extra cash writing .   in september i wrote still another  positronic robot  story   little lost robot   racing to complete it before the fall semester started and i grew immersed in my work .  campbell took it promptly and it appeared in the march      issue of astounding .  eventually  it and  evidence  were included in    robot .   once the semester started  it became difficult to find time to write .  toward the end of       i managed to begin another  foundation  story   now you see it    .   i finished it on february          and submitted it to campbell on the fourth .  by that time i was rather sick of the  foundation  series and i tried to write  now you see it      in such a way as to make it the last of the series .   campbell would have none of that .  i had to revise the ending to permit a sequel  and on the fourteenth he took it .  it appeared in the january      astounding and eventually made up the first third of my book second foundation .   in may      i wrote a story that  for the first time in over two years  was neither a  foundation  story nor a  positronic robot  story .  it was  no connection .   i submitted it to campbell on may     and it was accepted on the thirty first .           no connection  raph was a typical american of his times .  remarkably ugly  too  by american standards of our times .  the bony structure of his jaws was tremendous and the musculature suited it .  his nose was arched and wide and his black eyes were small and forced wide apart by the span of said nose .  his neck was thick  his body broad  his fingers spatulate  with strongly curved nails .   if he had stood erect  on thick legs with large  well padded feet  he would have topped two and a half yards .  standing or sitting  his mass neared a quarter of a ton .   yet his forehead rose in an unrestricted arc and his cranial capacity did not stint .  his enormous hand dealt delicately with a pen  and his mind droned comfortably on as he bent over his desk .   in fact  his wife and most of his fellow americans found him a fine looking fellow .   which shows the alchemy of a long displacement along the time axis .   raph  junior  was a smaller edition of our typical american .  he was adolescent and had not yet lost the hairy covering of childhood .  it spread in a dark  close curled mat across his chest and back  but it was already thinning and perhaps within the year he would first don the adult shirt that would cover the proudly naked skin of manhood .   but  meanwhile  he sat in breeches alone  and scratched idly at a favorite spot just above the diaphragm .  he felt curious and just a little bored .  it wasn t bad to come with his father to the museum when people were there .  today was a closed day  however  and the empty corridors rang lonesomely when he walked along them .   besides  he knew everything in it   mostly bones and stones .   junior said   what s that thing .     what thing .   raph lifted his head and looked over his shoulder .  then he looked pleased .   oh  that s something quite new .  that s a reconstruction of primate primeval .  it was sent to me from the north river grouping .  isn t it a nice job   astounding science fiction  june       copyright         by street   smith publications  inc .       though .   and he returned to his work  in the grip of a momentary twinge of pleasure .  primate primeval wasn t to go on exhibition for a week at least   not until he prepared an honorable place for it with suitable surroundings  but  for the moment  it was in his office and his own private darling .   raph looked at the  nice job  with quite other emotions  however .  what he saw was a spindly figure of contemptuous size  with thin legs and arms  hair covered and owning an ugly  small featured face with large  protruding eyes .   he said   well  what is it  pa .    raph stirred impatiently   it s a creature that lived many millions of years ago  we think .  that s the way we think it looks .     why .   insisted the youngster .   raph gave up .  apparently  he would have to root out the subject and do away with it .    well  for one thing we can tell about the muscles from the shape of the bones  and the positions where the tendons would fit and where some of the nerves would go .  from the teeth we can tell the type of digestive system the animal would have  and from the foot bones  what type of posture it would have .  for the rest  we go by the principle of analogy  that is  by the outside appearance of creatures that exist today that have the same kind of skeleton .  for instance  that s why he s covered with red hair .  most of the primates today   they re little insignificant creatures  practically extinct   are red haired  have bare callosities on the rump       junior scurried behind the figure and satisfied himself on that score .     have long  fleshy probosces  and short  shriveled ears .  their diets are unspecialized  hence the rather all purpose teeth  and they are nocturnal  hence the large eyes .  it s all simple  really .  now  does that dispose of you  younester .    and then junior  having thought and thought about it  came out with a disparaging   he looks just like a eekah to me  though .  just like an ugly  old eekah .    raph stared at him .  apparently he had missed a point   an eekah .   he said   what s an eekah .  is that an imaginary creature you ve been reading about .     imaginary .  say  pa  don t you ever stop at the recorder s .    this was an embarrassing question to answer  for  pa  never did  or at least  never since his maturity .  as a child  the re       corder  as custodian of the world s spoken  written and recorded fiction  had  of course  had an unfailing fascination .  but he had grown up      he said  tolerantly   are there new stories about eekahs .  i remember none when i was young .     you don t get it  pa .   one would almost suppose that the young raph was on the very verge of an exasperation he was too cautious to express .  he explained in wounded fashion   the eekahs are real things .  they come from the other world .  haven t you heard about that .  we ve been hearing about it in school  even  and in the group magazine .  they stand upside down in their country  only they don t know it  and they look just like ol  primeval there .    raph collected his astonished wits .  he felt the incongruity of cross examining his half grown child for archaeological data and he hesitated a moment .  after all  he had heard some things .  there had been word of vast continents existing on the other hemisphere of earth .  it seemed to him that there were reports of life on them .  it was all hazy   perhaps it wasn t always wise to stick so closely to the field of one s own interest .   he asked junior   are there eekahs here among the groupings .    junior nodded rapidly   the recorder says they can think as good as us .  they got machines that go through the air .  that s how they got here .     junior .   said raph severely .    i ain t lying   junior cried with aggrieved virtue .   you ask the recorder and see what he says .    raph slowly gathered his papers together .  it was closed day  but he could find the recorder at his home  no doubt .   the recorder was an elderly member of the red river gur row grouping and few alive could remember a time when he was not .  he had succeeded to the post by general consent and filled it well  for he was recorder for the same reason that raph was curator of the museum .  he liked to be  he wanted to be  and he could conceive no other life .   the social pattern of the gurrow grouping is difficult to grasp unless born into it  but there was a looseness about it that almost made the word  pattern  incongruous .  the individual gurrow took whatever job he felt an aptitude for  and such      work as was left over and needed to be done was done either in common  or consecutively by each according to an order determined by lot .  put so  it sounds too simple to work  but actually the traditions that had gathered with the five thousand years since the first voluntary grouping of gurrahs was supposed to have been established  made the system complicated  flexible   and workable .   the recorder was  as raph had anticipated  at his home  and there was the embarrassment of renewing an old and unjustly neglected acquaintanceship .  he had made use of the recorder s reference library  of course  but always indirectly  yet he had once been a child  an intimate learner at the feet of accumulated wisdom  and he had let the intimacy lapse .   the room he now entered was more or less choked with recordings and  to a lesser degree  with printed material .  the recorder interspersed greetings with apologies .    shipments have come from some of the other groupings   he said .   it needs time for cataloguing  you know  and i can t seem to find the time i used to .   he lit a pipe and puffed strongly .   seems to me i ll have to find a full time assistant .  what about your son  raph .  he clusters about here the way you did twenty years ago .     you remember those times .     better than you do  i think .  think your son would like that .     suppose you talk to him .  he might like to .  i can t honestly say he s fascinated by archaeology .   raph picked up a recording at random and looked at the identification tag   um m m   from the joquin valley grouping .  that s a long way from here .     a long way .   the recorder nodded .   i have sent them some of ours  of course .  the works of our own grouping are highly regarded throughout the continent   he said  with proprietary pride .   in fact    he pointed the stem of his pipe at the other   your own treatise on extinct primates has been distributed everywhere .  i ve sent out two thousand copies and there are still requests .  that s pretty good   for archaeology .     well  archaeology is why i am here   that and what my son says you ve been telling him .   raph had a little trouble starting   it seems you have spoken of creatures called eekahs from the antipodes  and i would like to have such information as you have on them .        the recorder looked thoughtful   well  i could tell you what i know offhand  or we could go to the library and look up the references .     don t bother opening the library for me .  it s a closed day .  just give me some notion of things and i ll search the references later .    the recorder bit at his pipe  shoved his chair back against the wall and de focused his eyes thoughtfully .   well   he said   i suppose it starts with the discovery of the continents on the other side .  that was five years ago .  you know about that  perhaps .     only the fact of it .  i know the continents exist  as everyone does now .  i remember once speculating on what a shining new field it would be for archaeological research  but that is all .     ah  then there is much else to tell you of .  the new continents were never discovered by us directly  you know .  it was five years ago that a group of non gurrow creatures arrived at the east harbor grouping in a machine that flew   by definite scientific principles  we found out later  based essentially on the buoyancy of air .  they spoke a language  were obviously intelligent  and called themselves eekahs .  the gurrows  of the east harbor grouping  learned their language   a simple one though full of unpronounceable sounds   and i have a grammar of it  if you re interested       raph waved that away .   the recorder continued  the gurrows of the grouping  with the aid of those of the iron mountain grouping   which specialize in steel works  you know   built duplicates of the flying machine .  a flight was made across the ocean  and i should say there are several dozens of volumes on all that  volumes on the flying machine  on a new science called aerodynamics  new geographies  even a new system of philosophy based on the plurality of intelligences .  all produced at the east harbor and iron mountain groupings .  remarkable work for only five years  and all are available here .     but the eekahs   are they still at the east harbor groupings .     um m m .  i m pretty certain they are .  they refused to return to their own continents .  they call themselves  political refugees .     toliti  .  .  .  what .     it s their own language   said the recorder   and it s the      only translation available .     well  why political refugees .  why not geological refugees  or oompah refugees .  i should think a translation ought to make sense .    the recorder shrugged   i refer you to the books .  they re not criminals  they claim .  i know only what i tell you .     well  then  what do they look like .  do you have pictures .     at the library .     did you read my  principles of archaeology .      i looked through it .     do you remember the drawings of primate primeval .    tm afraid not .     then  look  let s go down to the library  after all .     well  sure .   the recorder grunted as he rose .   the administrator of the red river gurrow grouping held a position in no way different in essentials from that of the museum curator  the recorder or any other voluntary job holder .  to expect a difference is to assume a society in which executive ability is rare .   actually  all jobs in a gurrow grouping   where a  job  is defined as regular work  the fruits of which adhere to others in addition to the worker himself   are divided into two classes  one  voluntary jobs  and the other  involuntary or community jobs .  all of the first classification are equal .  if a gurrow enjoys the digging of useful ditches  his bent is to be respected and his job to be honored .  if no one enjoys such burrowing and yet it is found necessary for comfort  it becomes a community job  done by lot or rotation according to convenience   annoying but unavoidable .   and so it was that the administrator lived in a house no more ample and luxurious than others  sat at the head of no tables  had no particular title other than the name of his job  and was neither envied  hated  nor adored .   he liked to arrange inter group trade  to supervise the common finances of the group  and to judge the infrequent disagreements that arose .  of course  he received no additional food or energy privileges for doing what he liked .   it was not  therefore  to obtain permission  but to place his accounts in decent order  that raph stopped in to see the administrator .  the closed day had not yet ended .  the administrator sat peacefully in his after dinner armchair  with an      after dinner cigar in his mouth  and an after dinner book in his hand .  although there was something rather timeless about six children and a wife  even they had an after dinner air about them .   raph received a multiple greeting upon entering  and raised two hands to his ears  for if the various administratelets  only applicable title .  author .   had a job  it was noisemaking .  certainly  it was what they liked to do  and certainly others reaped most of the fruits therefrom  for their own eardrums were apparently impervious .   the administrator shooed them .   raph accepted a cigar .    i intend leaving the grouping for a time  lahr   he said .   my job necessitates it .     we won t enjoy your going  raph .  i hope it will not be for long .     i hope not .  what have we in common units .     oh  ample for your purposes  i m sure .  where do you intend going .     to the east harbor grouping .    the administrator nodded and blew out a thoughtful puff of smoke   unfortunately  east harbor has a surplus in their favor registered in our books   i can verify that  if you wish  but the common units of exchange on hand will take care of transportation and necessary expenses .     well  that s fine .  but tell me  what is my status on the community job roster .     um m m   i ll have to get the rolls .  you ll excuse me a moment .   he trundled away  heaving his great weight across the room and out into the hallway .  raph paused to poke at the youngest of the children who rolled up to him  growling in mock ferocity with gleaming teeth   a black little bundle of thick fur  with the long  childish snout that had not yet broadened away from the shape of the animal ancestry of half a million years earlier .   the administrator returned with a heavy ledger and large spectacles .  he opened the ledger meticulously  riffled the pages to the proper place and then drew a careful finger down the columns .   he said  there s only the question of water supply  raph .  you re due on the maintenance gang for this next week .  there s nothing else due for at least two months .         i ll be back before then .  is there any chance of someone subbing for me on the water maintenance .     um m m     i ll get someone .  i can always send my oldest .  he s getting to job age and he might as well taste everything .  he may like working on the dam .     yes .  you tell me if he does  then .  he can replace me  regularly .    the administrator smiled gently   don t plan on that  raph .  if he can figure out a way of making sleeping useful to all of us  he ll certainly take it up as a job .  and why are you going to east harbor grouping  by the way  if it s something you care to talk about .     you ll laugh  perhaps  but i have just found out that there exist such things as eekahs .     eekahs .  yes  i know .   the administrator pointed a finger .   creatures from across the sea .  right .     right .  but that s not all .  i ve come from the library .  i ve seen trimensional reproductions  lahr  and they re primate primeval  or almost .  they re primates  anyway  intelligent primates .  they ve got small eyes  flat noses and completely different jawbones   but they re at least second cousins .  i ve got to see them  lahr .    the administrator shrugged .  he felt no interest in the matter himself .   why .  i ask out of ignorance  raph .  does it matter  your seeing them .     matter .   raph was obviously appalled at the question .   don t you know what s been going on these last years .  have you read my archaeology book .     no   said the administrator  definitely   i wouldn t read it to save myself a turn at garbage disposal .    raph said   which probably proves you more suited to garbage disposal than archaeology .  but never mind .  i ve been fighting single handed for nearly ten years in favor of my theory that primate primeval was an intelligent creature with a developed civilization .  i have nothing on my side so far but logical necessity  which is the last thing most archaeologists will accept .  they want something solid .  they want the remains of a grouping  or artifacts  structures  books   get it .  all i can give them is a skeleton with a huge brain pan .  stars above  lahr  what do they expect to survive in ten million years .  metal dies .  paper dies .  film dies .    only stone lasts  lahr .  and bone that s turned to stone .  i ve      got that .  a skull with room for a brain .  and stone  too  old sharpened knives .  ground flints .     well   said lahr   there are your artifacts .     those are called eoliths  dawn stones .  they won t accept them .  they call them natural products  fortuitously shaped by erosion into the shapes they have  the idiots .    then he grinned with a scientific ferocity   but if the eekahs are intelligent primates  i ve practically proven my case .    raph had traveled before  but never eastward  and the decline of agriculture on the road impressed him .  in early history  the gurrow groupings had been entirely unspecialized .  each had been self sufficient  and trade was a gesture of friendliness rather than a matter of necessity .   and so it was still in most groupings .  his own grouping  the red river  was perhaps typical .  some five hundred miles inland  set in lush farm land  agriculture remained centric .  the river yielded some fish and there was a well developed dairy industry .  in fact  it was food exports that provided cause for the healthy state of the store of common units .   as they traveled eastward  however  the groupings through which they passed paid less and less mind to the shallowing soil and more and more to the smoking factory structures .   in the east harbor grouping  raph found a trading center which depended for its prosperity primarily upon ships .  it was a more populous grouping than the average  more densely packed  with houses  on occasion  within a hundred yards of each other .   raph felt an uncomfortable prickling at the thought of living in such close quarters .  the docks were even worse  with gurrows engaged at the huge community jobs of loading and unloading .   the administrator of this east harbor grouping was a young man  new at his job  overwhelmed with the joy of his work  and beside himself with the pleasure of welcoming a distinguished stranger .   raph sat through an excellent meal  and was treated to a long discourse as to the exact derivation of each dish .  to his provincial ears  beef from the prairie grouping  potatoes from the northeast woods grouping  coffee from the isthmus      grouping  wine from the pacific grouping  and fruit from the central lakes grouping were something strange and wonderful .   over the cigars   south island grouping   he brought up the subject of the eekahs .  the east harbor administrator grew solemn and a little uneasy .    the man you want to see is lernin .  he ll be glad to help you all he can .  you say you know something of these eekahs .     i say i would like to know something .  they resemble an extinct species of animal i am familiar with .     then that is your field of interest .  i see .     perhaps you can tell me some of the details of their arrival  administrator   suggested raph  politely .    i was not administrator at the time  friend  so that i lack first hand information  but the records are plain .  this group of eekahs that arrived in their flying machine  .  .  .  you ve heard about these aeronautical devices .     yes  yes .     yes .  well .  .  .   . apparently they were fugitives .     so i have heard .  yet they claim not to be criminals .  isn t that so .     yes .  queer  isn t it .  they admitted that they had been condemned   this was after long and skillful questioning  once we had learned their language   but denied that they were evildoers .  apparently  they had disagreed with their administrator on principles of policy .    raph nodded his head knowingly   ah  and refused to abide by the common decision .  is that it .     more confusing than that .  they insist there was no common decision .  they claim that the administrator decided on policy of his own accord .     and was not replaced .     apparently those who believe he should are considered criminals   as these were .    there was a frank pause of disbelief .  then raph said   does that sound reasonable to you .     no  i merely relay to you their words .  of course  the eekah language is quite a barrier .  some of the sounds can t be pronounced   words have different meanings according to position in the sentence and according to tiny differences in inflection .  and it happens often that eekah words even when best trans        lated are a complete puzzle .     they must have heen surprised to find gurrows here   suggested raph   if they are members of a different genus .     surprised .   the administrator s voice sank   i ll say they were surprised .  now  this information has not been generally published for obvious reasons  so i hope you remember that it s confidential .  these eekahs killed five gurrows before they could be disarmed .  they had an instrument that expelled metal pellets at high speed by means of controlled explosive chemical reaction .  we have duplicated it since .  naturally  under the circumstances  we are not branding them criminals  for it is reasonable to assume that they did not realize we were intelligent beings .  apparently   and the administrator smiled ruefully   we resemble certain animals in their world .  or so they say .    but raph was galvanized into a sudden enthusiasm   stars above .  they said that  did they .  did they go into details .  what kind of animals .    the administrator was taken back   well  i don t know .  they give names in their language .  what meaning has that .  they called us giant  bears .      giant what .     bears .  i haven t the slightest idea what they are  except presumably that they look like us .  i know of no such in america .     bears .  bears .   raph stumbled over the word .   that s interesting .  it s more than interesting .  it s stupendous .  do you know  administrator  that there is a great dispute among us as to the ancestry of gurrows .  living animals related to gurrow sapiens would be of immense importance .   raph rubbed his huge hands with pleasure .   the administrator was pleased at the sensation he had caused .  he said   and a puzzling thing in addition is that they call themselves by two names .    two names .     yes .  no one knows the distinction yet  no matter how much the eekahs explain it to us  except that one is a more general name  and one a more specific .  the basis of the difference escapes us .     i see .  which is  eekah  .     that is the specific one .  the general one is    the administrator stumbled slowly over the harsh syllables    chim pan        zee .  there  that s it .  there are a group called eekahs and there are other groups with other names .  but they are all called chim  .  .  .  what i said before .    the administrator sought through his mind for other juicy items of miscellany with which he was acquainted  but raph interrupted him .    may i see lemin tomorrow .     of course .     then i shall do so .  thank you for your courtesy  administrator .    lernin was a slight individual .  it is doubtful if he weighed more than two hundred and fifty .  there was also an imperfection in his walk  a slight lameness .  but neither of these facts made much of an impression on raph once the conversation had begun  for lernin was a thinker who could impose his vigor upon others .   it was raph whose eagerness dominated the first half of the conversation  and lernin s comments were as luminous and as brief as lightning flashes .  and then  there was a sudden whirl of the center of gravity  and lernin took over .    you will excuse me  learned friend   lernin said with a characteristic stiffness that he could make so amiable   if i find your problem unimportant .  no  no    he lifted a long fingered hand    not  in the uncomplicated talk of the times  merely unimportant to myself because my interest lies elsewhere  but unimportant to the grouping of all the groupings   to every single gurrow from end to end of the world .    the concept was staggering .  for a moment  raph was offended  offended deep in his sense of individuality .  it showed in his face .   lernin added quickly   it may sound impolite  crude  uncivilized .  but i must explain .  i must explain because you are primarily a social scientist and will understand   perhaps better than we ourselves .     my life interest   said raph angrily   is important to myself .  i cannot assume those of others in preference .     what i talk about should be the life interest of all   if only because it may be the means of saving the lives of all of us .    raph was beginning to suspect all sorts of things from a queer form of joking to the unbalance of mind that sometimes came with age .  yet lemin was not old .       lernin said  with an impressive fervor   the eekahs of the other world are a danger to us  for they are iiot friendly to us .    and raph replied naturally   how do you know .     no one other than myself  my friend  has lived more closely with these eekahs who have arrived here  and i find them people with minds of emotional content strange to us .  i have collected queer facts which we find difficult to interpret  but which point  at any rate  in disquieting directions .    i ll list a few  eekahs in organized groups kill one another periodically for obscure reasons .  eekahs find it impossible to live in manner other than those of ants   that is  in huge conglomerate societies   yet find it impossible to allow for the presence of one another .  or  to use the terminology of the social scientists  they are gregarious without being social  just as we gurrows are social without being gregarious .  they have elaborate codes of behavior  which  we are told  are taught to the young  but which are disobeyed in universal practice  for reasons obscure to us .  et cetera .  et cetera .  et cetera .     i am an archaeologist   said raph  stiffly .   these eekahs are of interest to me biologically only .  if the curvature of the thigh bone is known to me  i care little for the curvature of their cultural processes .  if i can follow the shape of the skull  it is immaterial to me that the shape of their ethics is mysterious .     you don t think that their insanities may affect us here .     we are six thousand miles apart  or more  along either ocean   said raph .   we have our world .  they have theirs .  there is no connection between us .     no connection   mused lernin   so others have said .  no connection at all .  yet eekahs have reached us  and others may follow .  we are told that the other world is dominated by a few  who are in turn dominated by their queer need for security which they confuse with an eekah word called  power   which  apparently  means the prevailing of one s own will over the sum of the will of the community .  what if this  power  should extend to us .    raph bent his mind to the task .  the matter was utterly ridiculous .  it seemed impossible to picture the strange concepts .   lernin said   these eekahs say that their world and ours in the long past were closer together .  they say that there is a well known scientific hypothesis in their world of a continental       drift .  that may interest you  since otherwise you might find it difficult to reconcile the existence of fossils of primate primeval closely related to living eekahs six thousand miles away .    and the mists cleared from the archaeologist s brain as he glanced up with a live interest untroubled by insanities   ah  you should have said this sooner .     i say it now as an example of what you may achieve for yourself by joining us and helping us .  there is another thing .  these eekahs are physical scientists  like ourselves here in east harbor  but with a difference dictated by their own cultural pattern .  since they live in hives  they think in hives  and their science is the result of an ant society .  individually  they are slow and unimaginative  collectively  each supplies a crumb different from that supplied by his fellow   so that a vast structure is erected quickly .  here the individual is infinitely brighter  but he works alone .  you  for instance  know nothing of chemistry  i imagine .     a few of the fundamentals  but nothing else   admitted raph .   i leave that  naturally  to the chemist .     yes  naturally .  but i am a chemist .  yet these eekahs  though my mental inferiors  and no chemists in their own world  know more chemistry than i .  for instance  did you know that there exist elements that spontaneously disintegrate .     impossible   exploded raph .   elements are eternal  changeless      lernin laughed   so you have been taught .  so i have been taught .  so i taught others .  yet the eekahs are right  for in my laboratories i have checked them  and in every detail they are right .  uranium gives rise to a spontaneous radiation .  you ve heard of uranium  of course .  and furthermore  i have detected radiations of energy beyond that produced by uranium which must be due to traces of elements unknown to us but described by the eekahs .  and these missing elements fit well into the so called periodic tables some chemists have tried to foist upon the science .  though i do wrong to use the word  foist  now     well   said raph   why do you tell me this .  does this  too  help me in my problem .     perhaps   said lernin  ironically   you will yet find it a royal bribe .  you see  the energy production of uranium is absolutely constant .  no known outward change in environment can       affect it   and as a result of the loss in energy  uranium slowly turns to lead at an absolutely constant rate .  a group of our men is even now using this fact as a basis for a method of determining the age of the earth .  you see  to determine the age of a stratum of rock in     the earth  then  it is but necessary to discover a region in it containing a trace of uranium   a widely spread element   and to determine about it the quantity of lead   and i might here add that the lead produced from uranium differs from ordinary lead and can be easily characterized  and it is then simple to determine the length of time in which that stratum has been solid .  and of course  if a fossil is found in that stratum  it is of the same age  am i not correct .     stars above   and raph rose to his feet in a tremble   you do not deceive me .  it is really possible to do this .     it is possible .  it is even easy .  i tell you that our great defense  even at this late date  is co operation in science .  we are a group now of many  my friend  from many groupings  and we want you among us .  if you join us  it would be a simple matter to extend our earthage project to such regions as you may indicate   regions rich in fossils .  what do you say .     i will help you .    it is doubtful if the gurrow groupings had ever before seen a community venture of such breadth as now took place .  east harbor grouping  as has been remarked  was a shipping center  and certainly a trans atlantic vessel was not beyond the capacity of a grouping that traded along the full lengths of both coasts of the americas .  what was unusual was the vast ness of the co operation of gurrows from many groupings  gurrows of many interests .   not that they were all happy .   raph  for instance  on the particular morning that now concerns us  six months from the date of his first arrival in east harbor  was searching anxiously for lernin .   lernin  for his part  was searching for nothing but greater speed .   they met on the docks  where lernin  biting the end off a cigar and leading the way to a region where smoking was permitted  said   and you  my friend  seem concerned .  not  certainly  about the progress of our ocean liner .     i am concerned   said raph  gravely   about the reports i have received of the expedition testing the age of the rocks .          oh     and you are unhappy about it .     unhappy .   exploded raph .   have you seen them .     i have received a copy .  i have looked at it .  i have even read parts of it .  but i have had little time and most of it bounced off .  will you please enlighten me .     certainly .  in the last several months  three of the regions i have indicated as being fossiliferous have been tested .  the first region was in the area of east harbor grouping itself .  another was in the pacific bay grouping  and a third in the central lakes grouping .  i purposely asked that those be done first because they are the richest areas and because they are widely separated .  do you know  for instance  what age they tell me the rocks upon which we stand are .    two billion years  i think  is the oldest figure i noticed .     and that s the figure for the oldest rocks   the basic igneous stratum of basalt .  the upper strata  however     the recent sedimentary layers containing dozens of fossils of primate primeval   how old do you think these are supposed to be .  five  hundred   trillion   years .  how is that .  do you understand .    trillion .   lernin squinted upwards and shook his head .   that s strange .     i ll add to it .  the pacific coast grouping is one hundred trillion years old   so i am told   and central lakes almost eighty trillion years old .    lernin said   and the other measurements .  the ones that did not involve your strata .     that is the most peculiar thing of all .  most of the chosen investigations were carried on in strata that were not particularly fossiliferous .  they had their own criteria of choice based on geological reasoning   and they got consistent results   one million to two billion years depending upon the depth and geological history of the particular region tested .  only my areas give these strange and impossible vagaries .    and lernin said   but what do the geologists say about all this .  can there be some error .     undoubtedly .  but they have fifty decent  reasonable measurements .  for themselves  they have proved the method and are happy .  there are three anomalies  to be sure  but they view them with equanimity as involving some unknown factors .  i don t see it that way .  these three measurements mean everything .   raph interrupted himself fiercely   how sure are you that radioactivity is an absolute constant .          sure .  can one ever be sure .  nothing we know of so far affects it  and such is likewise the definite testimony of our eekahs .  besides  my friend  if you are implying that radioactivity was more extensive in the past than in the present  why only in your fossil regions .  why not everywhere .     why  indeed .  it s another aspect of a problem which is growing more important daily .  consider .  we have regions which show a past of abnormal radioactivity .  we have regions which show abnormal fossil frequencies .  why should these regions coincide  lernin .     one obvious answer suggests itself  my friend .  if your primate primeval existed at a time when certain regions were highly radioactive  certain individuals would wander into them and die .  radioactive radiation is deadly in excess  of course .  radioactivity and fossils  there you are .     why not other creatures   demanded raph .   only primate primeval occurs in excess  and he was intelligent .  he would not be trapped by dangerous radiation .     perhaps he was not intelligent .  that is  after all  only your theory and not a proven fact .     certainly  then  he was more intelligent than his small brained contemporaries .     perhaps not even that .  you romanticize too much .     perhaps i do .   raph spoke in half a whisper .   it seems to me that i can conjure up visions of a great civilization of a million years back   or more .  a great power  a great intelligence   that has vanished completely  except for the tiny whispers of ossified bones which retain that huge cavity in which a brain once existed  and a bony five fingered hand curving into slender signs of manipulative skill   with an opposing thumb .  they must have been intelligent .    then  what killed them .   lernin shrugged   several million species of living things have survived .    raph looked up  half in anger   i cannot accompany your group  lernin  on a voluntary basis .  to go to the other world would be useful  yes  if i could engage in my own studies .  for your purposes  it can be only a community job to me .  i cannot give my heart to it .    but lernin s jaw was set   that arrangement would not be fair .  there are many of us  my friend  who are sacrificing our own interests .  if we all placed them first and investigated       the other world in terms of our own particular provincialisms only  our great purpose would be destroyed .  my friend  there is not one of our men that we can spare .  we must all work as if our lives depended on our instant solution of the eekah problem  which  believe me  it does .    raph s jaws twisted in distaste .   on your side  you have a vague apprehension of these weak  stupid little creatures .  on my side i have a definite problem of great intellectual attraction to myself .  and between the two i can see no connection  no possible connection at all .     nor can i .  but listen to me a moment .  a small group of our most trusted men returned last week from a visit to the other world .  it was not official  as ours will be .  it made no contacts .  it was a frank piece of espionage  which i am telling you about now .  i ask your discretion on the matter .     naturally .     our men possessed themselves of eekah event sheets .     pardon me .     it is a created name to describe the objects .  printed records are issued daily in the various centers of eekah population of events and occurrences of the day  and what passes for literary efforts as well .    raph was momentarily interested   it strikes me as an excellent idea .     yes  in its essence .  the eekah notion of interesting events  however  appears to consist entirely of antisocial events .  however  leave that be .  my point is that the existence of the americas is well known there these days   and it is universally spoken of as a  new land of opportunity .   the various divisions of eekahs eye it with a universal desire .  the eekahs are many  they are crowded  their economy is irrational .  they want new land  and that is what this is to them   new and empty land .     not empty   pointed out raph  mildly .    empty to them   insisted lernin terribly .   that is the vast danger .  lands occupied by gurrows are to them empty and they mean to take it  all the more so since they have often enough striven to take the lands of one another .    raph shrugged   even so  they        yes .  they are weak and stupid .  you said that  and so they are .  but only singly .  they will unite for a purpose .  to be sure  they will fall apart when the purpose is done   but momentar        ily they will join and become strong  which we perhaps cannot do  witness yourself .  and their weapons of war have been keened in the fire of conflict .  their flying machines  for instance  are superb war weapons .     but we have duplicated it        in quantity .  we have also duplicated their chemical explosives  but only in the laboratory  and their firing tubes and armored vehicles  but only in experimental plants .  and yet there is more   something developed within the last five years  for our own eekahs know nothing about it .     and what is that .     we don t know .  their event sheets speak of it   the names applied to it mean nothing to us   but the context implies the terror of it  even on the part of these kill mad eekahs .  there seems no evidence that it has been used  or that all the eekah groups have it   but it is used as a supreme threat .  it will perhaps be clearer to you when all the evidence is presented once our voyage is under way .     but what is it .  you talk of it as if it were a bogey .     why  they talk of it as if it were a bogey .  and what could be a bogey to an eekah .  that is the most frightening aspect of it .  so far  we know only that it involves the bombardment of an element they call plutonium   of which we have never heard and of which our own eekahs have never heard either   by objects called neutrons  which our eekahs say are subatomic particles without charge  which seems to us completely ridiculous .     and that is all .     all .  will you suspend judgment till we show you the sheets .    raph nodded reluctantly   very well .    raph s leaden thoughts revolved in their worn groove as he stood there alone .   eekahs and primate primeval .  a living creature of erratic habits and a dead creature that must have aspired to heights .  a sordid present of explosives and neutron bombardments and a glorious  mysterious past      no connection .  no connection .   the end       by june      i had already been working on my ph . d .  research with near total concentration  i was no longer working in the candy store  my younger brother  stanley  had taken over  for nearly a year .  i was in the home stretch and beginning to think forward to writing my ph . d .  dissertation .  i rather dreaded that  since the obligatory style of dissertations is turgid in the extreme  and i had by now spent nine years trying to write well and was afraid i simply might not be able to write badly enough to qualify for my degree .   the experiments i was doing at the time required me  periodically  to dissolve a compound called catechol in water .  the catechol existed in fine  feathery  fluffy needles that dissolved very readily in water .  in fact  when i sprinkled catechol into the beaker of water  the individual needles dissolved as soon as they struck the water surface .  idly  it occurred to me that if the catechol were any more soluble than it was  it would dissolve before it struck the water surface .   naturally  i thought at once that this notion might be the basis for an amusing story .  it occurred to me  however  that instead of writing an actual story based on the idea  i might write up a fake research paper on the subject and get a little practice in turgid writing .   i did the job on june          even giving it the kind of long winded title that research papers so often have    the endo chronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline    and added tables  graphs and fake references to non existent journals .   i was not at all sure that thiotimoline   no use trying to quote the entire name every time  was publishable .  astounding  however  ran serious articles on scientific subjects of particular interest to science fiction readers and i thought it just possible campbell might be interested in a gag article that would be on the borders of science fiction .   i brought it in to him on the tenth  and he took it almost at once .            the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline  the correlation of the structure of organic molecules with their various properties  physical and chemical  has in recent years afforded much insight into the mechanism of organic reactions  notably in the theories of resonance and mesomer ism as developed in the last decade .  the solubilities of organic compounds in various solvents has become of particular interest in this connection through the recent discovery of the endochronic nature of thiotimoline .   it has been long known that the solubility of organic compounds in polar solvents such as water is enhanced by the presence upon the hydrocarbon nucleus of hydrophilic   i . e .   water loving   groups  such as the hydroxy   oh   amino   nh    or sulfonic acid  so h  groups .  where the physical characteristics of two given compounds   particularly the degree of subdivision of the material   are equal  then the time of solution   expressed in seconds per gram of material per milli liter of solvent   decreases with the number of hydrophilic groups present .  catechol  for instance  with two hydroxy groups on the benzene nucleus  dissolves considerably more quickly than does phenol  with only one hydroxy group on the nucleus .  feinschreiber and hravlek in their studies on the problem have contended that with increasing hydrophilism  the time of solution approaches zero .  that this analysis is not entirely correct was shown when it was discovered that the compound thiotimoline will dissolve in water   in the proportions of   gm .  ml .    in minus   .    seconds .  that is  it will dissolve before the water is added .   previous communications from these laboratories indicated thiotimoline to contain at least fourteen hydroxy groups  two amino groups and one sulfonic acid group .  the presence of a nitro group   no   in addition has not yet been confirmed  and no evidence as yet exists as to the nature of the hydrocarbon nucleus  though an at least partly aromatic structure seems certain .   the endochronometer   first attempts to measure the time  astounding science fiction  march       copyright         by street   smith publications  inc .   ill  of solution of thiotimoline quantitatively met with considerable difficulty because of the very negative nature of the value .  the fact that the chemical dissolved prior to the addition of the water made the attempt natural to withdraw the water after solution and before addition .  this  fortunately for the law of conservation of mass energy  never succeeded  since solution never took place unless the water was eventually added .  the question is  of course  instantly raised as to how the thiotimoline can  know  in advance whether the water will ultimately be added or not .  though this is not properly within our province as physical chemists  much recent material has been published within the last year upon the psychological and philosophical problems thereby posed .   nevertheless  the chemical difficulties involved rest in the fact that the time of solution varies enormously with the exact mental state of the experimenter .  a period of even slight hesitation in adding the water reduces the negative time of solution  not infrequently wiping it out below the limits of detection .  to avoid this  a mechanical device has been constructed  the essential design of which has already been reported in a previous communication .   this device  termed the endochronometer  consists of a cell   cubic centimeters in size into which a desired weight of thiotimoline is placed  making certain that a small hollow extension at the bottom of the solution cell     millimeter in internal diameter   is filled .  to the cell is attached an automatic pressure micro pipette containing a specific volume of the solvent concerned .  five seconds after the circuit is closed  this solvent is automatically delivered into the cell containing the thiotimoline .  during the time of action  a ray of light is focused upon the small cell extension described above  and at the instant of solution  the transmission of this light will no longer be impeded by the presence of solid thiotimoline .  both the instant of solution   at which time the transmission of light is recorded by a photoelectric device   and the instant of solvent addition can be determined with an accuracy of better than   .      .  if the first value is subtracted from the second  the time of solution  t  can be determined .   the entire process is conducted in a thermostat maintained at    .      c .    to an accuracy of   .       c .   thiotimoline purity   the extreme sensitivity of this method       highlights the deviations resulting from trifling impurities present in thiotimoline .   since no method of laboratory synthesis of the substance has been devised  it may be practically obtained only through tedious isolation from its natural source  the bark of the shrub rosacea karlsbadensis rugo .   great efforts were therefore made to purify the material through repeated recrystallizations from conductivity water   twice redistilled in an all tin apparatus   and through final sublimations .  a comparison of the solution times  t  at various stages of the purification process is shown in table i .   table i   averaee  t   purification stage     observations   t  extremes   error  as isolated     .        .        .        .    first recrystallization     .        .        .       .

   .        .        .       .    second resublimation     .         .        .       .    it is obvious from table i that for truly quantitative significance  thiotimoline purified as described must be used .  after the second resublimation  for instance  the error involved in an even dozen determinations is less than   .     with the extreme values being      .     seconds and      .     seconds .   in all experiments described subsequently in this study  thiotimoline so purified has been used .   time of solution and volume of solvent   as would seem reasonable  experiments have shown that increasing the volume of solvent enables the thiotimoline to dissolve more quickly   i . e .   with an increasingly negative time of solution .  from figure    however  we can see that this increase in endo chronic properties levels off rapidly after a volume of solvent of approximately   .    ml .  this interesting plateau effect has appeared with varying volume of solvent for all varieties of solvents used in these laboratories  just as in all cases the time of solution approaches zero with decreasing volume of solvent .   time of solution and concentration of a given ion   in figure    the results are given of the effect of the time of       time of solution  sec .      .      .      .      .    volume of solvent  ml .   figure    timeofsolutioncsec .      .      .      .      .     volume of solvent  ml .   figure         solution  t  of varying the volume of solvent  where the solvent consists of varying concentrations of sodium chloride solution .  it can be seen that  although in each case the volume at which this plateau is reached differs markedly with the concentration  the heights of the plateau are constant  i . e .       .     .  the volume at which it is reached  hereinafter termed the plateau volume  pv   decreases with decreasing concentration of sodium chloride  approaching the pv for water as the nacl concentration approaches zero .  it is  therefore  obvious that a sodium chloride solution of unknown concentration can be quite accurately characterized by the  determination of its pv  where other salts are absent .   time of solution sec .      .      .      .      .      .     volume op solvent ml .    figure    this usefulness of pv extends to other ions as well .  figure   gives the endochronic curves for   .     molar solutions of sodium chloride  sodium bromide and potassium chloride .  here  the pv in each case is equal within the limits of experimental error   since the concentrations in each case are equal   but the plateau heights  ph  are different .   a tentative conclusion that might be reached from this ex        perimental data is that the ph is characteristic of the nature of the ions present in solution  whereas the pv is characteristic of the concentration of these ions .  table ii gives the values of plateau height and plateau volume for a wide variety of salts in equal concentrations  when present alone .   the most interesting variation to be noted in table ii is that of the pv with the valence type of the salt present .  in the case of salts containing pairs of singly charged ions   i . e .   sodium chloride  potassium chloride and sodium bromide   the pv is constant for all .  this holds also for those salts containing one singly charged ion and one double charged ion   i . e .  sodium sulphate  calcium chloride and magnesium chloride   where the pv  though equal among the three  varies markedly from those of the first set .  the pv is  therefore  apparently a function of the ionic strength of the solution .   this effect also exists in connection with the plateau height  though less regularly .  in the case of singly charged ions  such as in the first three salts listed in table ii  the ph is fairly close to that of water itself .  it falls considerably where doubly charged ions  such as sulphate or calcium  are present .  and when the triply charged phosphate ion or ferric ion is present  the value sinks to merely a quarter of its value in water .   table ii  solvent  salt solutions in       m concentration   plateau height plateau volume  ph  seconds  pv  milliliters  water

 .     time of solution and mixtures of ions   experiments currently in progress in these laboratories are concerned with the extremely important question of the variation of these endo chronic properties of thiotimoline in the presence of mixtures of ions .  the state of our data at present does not warrant very      general conclusions  but even our preliminary work gives hope of the further development of the endochronic methods of analysis .  thus  in figure    we have the endochronic curve where a mixture of   .    m sodium chloride and   .    m ferric chloride solutions is the solvent .  here  two sharp changes in slope can be seen  the first at a solution time of      .     and the second at      .     these being the ph s characteristic of fer   timeofsolut  n  sec .    volume of solvent  ml .   figure    ric chloride and sodium chloride respectively   see table ii .  the ph for a given salt would thus appear not to be affected by the presence of other salts .   this is definitely not the case  however  for the pv  and it is to a quantitative elucidation of the variation of pv with impurities in the solvent that our major efforts are now directed .   summary   investigations of the endochronic qualities of thiotimoline have shown that   a   careful purification of the material is necessary for obtaining quantitative results .   b   increasing the volume of solvent results in increasing the negative time of solution to a constant value known as the       plateau height  ph   at a volume of solvent known as the plateau volume  pv  .   c   the value of the ph is characteristic of the nature of the ions present in the solvent  varying with the ionic strength of the solution and not varying with the addition of other ions .   d   the value of the pv is characteristic of the concentration of the ions present in the solvent  being constant for different ions in solution of equal ionic strength  but varying markedly with the admixtures of second varieties of ions .   as a result of all this  it is suggested that endochronic methods offer a means of rapid     minutes or less   and accurate   within   .     at least   analysis of inorganic  water soluble materials .   bibliography   p .  krum and l .  eshkin .  journal of chemical solubilities                       concerning the anomalous solubility of thiotimoline .    e .  j .

examinations    the last hurdle on the path to my ph . d .  i didn t want any austere member of the examining board to decide i was making fun of chemical research and to be sufficiently offended to vote against me on the grounds that i wasn t temperamentally suited to the high honor of the doctorate .    so i asked campbell to run it under a pseudonym .   when the magazine with the article finally reached the newsstands  in mid february       i was appalled to discover that campbell had utterly forgotten the matter of the pseudonym .  the article appeared under my own name and i was scheduled to have my orals within three months .  my nervousness was increased when  almost at once  copies of the magazine began circulating in the chemistry department .   on may            had my orals .  the examining board had seen the article .  after i had been on the grill for an hour and twenty minutes  the last question  asked by professor ralph s .  halford  was   mr .  asimov  tell us something about the thermo dynamic properties of the compound thiotimoline .    i broke into hysterical laughter put of sheer relief  for it struck me instantly that they wouldn t play good natured jokes with me  professor halford sounded jovial and everyone else was smiling  if they were going to flunk me .  i was led out  still laughing  and after a twenty minute wait  the examiners emerged  shook my hand  and said   congratulations  dr .  asimov .    my fellow students insisted on forcing five manhattans down my throat that afternoon and  since i am a teetotaler under normal conditions and have no tolerance for alcohol  i was royally drunk at once .  it took them three hours to sober me up .   after the official ceremonies  on june          i was isaac asimov  ph . d .   as it turned out  campbell s non use of a pseudonym  and i bet he did it deliberately  because he was smarter than i was  was a lucky break indeed .  not only did the examining board not take it amiss  but the article became  in a minor way  famous  and i with it .   although  thiotimoline  appeared in astounding  as did all       my stories of the time  it received circulation far outside the ordinary science fiction world .  it passed from chemist to chemist  by way of the magazine itself  or by reprints in small trade journals  or by copies pirated and mimeographed  even by word of mouth .  people who had never heard of me at all as a science fiction writer  heard of thiotimoline .  it was the very first time my fame transcended the field .   what s more  although  thiotimoline  was essentially a work of fantasy  the form was that of non fiction .  viewed from that standpoint   thiotimoline  was the first piece of non fiction i had ever published professionally   the harbinger of a vast amount to come .   but what amused me most was that a surprising number of readers actually took the article seriously .  i was told that in the weeks after its appearance the librarians at the new york public library were driven out of their minds by hordes of eager youngsters who demanded to see copies of the fake journals i had used as pseudo references .   but back to the summer of           over a period of five years i had sold fourteen stories  every one of them to campbell .  this didn t mean that he was the only editor in the field  at all .  almost all the magazines that had been published before the war still existed  although only astounding was really doing well  and would have welcomed submissions from me .  had campbell rejected any of the stories i had submitted to him  i would certainly have tried one of those other magazines .    but he didn t  so i didn t .   the magazine startling stories  in which i had published  christmas on ganymede  five and a half years before  published a forty thousand word  short novel  in each issue .  it wasn t easy to get a publishable story of that length every month though  especially since startling s rate was only half that of astounding .   sometimes it was necessary  therefore  for the editor of the magazine  who at that time was sam merwin  jr .   to canvass those authors known to be capable of turning out such a story .  about the time i was doing  thiotimoline   merwin approached me with a suggestion that i write a lead short novel .   startling  he explained  had always published stories with the accent on adventure  but  in imitation of astounding s success  he had persuaded the publisher to try the experiment of pub      listing stories with a heavier accent on science .  would i consider  then  doing a lead for startling .   i was terribly flattered .  also  as i said earlier  i was nervous about having become a one editor author and would have welcomed a chance to prove to myself that i could write beyond campbell s protective shadow .  i agreed  therefore  and a good part of the summer of       when i wasn t engaged in preparing my experimental data for the upcoming ph . d .  dissertation  was spent in preparing a story i called  grow old with me .     by august   i had completed first draft .  on august     i had the first part of it in final copy and submitted that to merwin .  he approved .  on september    the entire story was submitted and i had no doubt  whatever  of its acceptance .  on october           however  merwin told me that  alas  startling had decided not to go for heavy science  after all  but for adventure  and that  grow old with me  would have to be completely rewritten with no guarantee of acceptance after that .   i suppose it is an indication of how things had advanced when i tell you it was the first time that i did not accept a request for revision philosophically .  quite otherwise .  it had been five years and more since even campbell had rejected one of my stories  how  then  dare a comparative nonentity like merwin do so .  particularly since he had approached me for the story .   i made no effort to hide my annoyance .  in fact  i seized the manuscript and stalked out of the office  and in an obvious rage .    i submitted the story to campbell  giving him a full account of events .    i have always made it a practice to tell any editor to whom i submit a story of any rejection it has previously received .  there is no necessity to do this  it is not  as far as i know  an ethical requirement for a writer .  i just do    this was inspired by robert browning s poem rabbi ben ezra and was a misquotation   which shows you the level of my culture .  the first line of the poem is  grow old along with me .      years afterwards  as a result of the subsequent history of that story  merwin took to apologizing for that rejection every time he met me   but he didn t have to  and i kept telling him so .  he was editor  and he was completely within his rights to reject the story  and i was being pettily temperamental to be angry about it .  i have made every effort  since  to avoid evident anger at any rejection  however unjustified it might seem at the time  and i think i have succeeded .        it  and it has not  again as far as i know  ever cost me an acceptance .   as it happened  campbell rejected the story  but not  i m sure  because it had been somewhere else first .  he told me enough things wrong with the story to make me feel that perhaps merwin had not been so arbitrary in rejecting it .  i thrust the story in the drawer in disgust and thought no more about it for nearly two years .   the rejection came at a bad time .  more and more  i was wrapped up in trying to complete my research  in writing my dissertation  and  most of all  in anxiously looking for a job .  there wasn t much time to write  and the rejection had sufficiently disheartened and humiliated me so that i withdrew from writing for nearly a year .  this was the third long withdrawal of my writing career  and  to this date  the last .   i did not find a job  my expected ph . d .  degree was no passport to affluence  after all .  that was humiliating  too .   i accepted an offer from professor robert c .  elderfield to do a year s postdoctoral research for him for         working on anti malarial drugs  i accepted  though not with great enthusiasm  and started work for him on june          the day after i had officially gained my ph . d .    at least it would give me another year to find a job .   by the next month  i had settled down sufficiently to consider writing a science fiction story   the red queen s race .   on july    it was finished and i submitted it to campbell .  it was accepted on the sixteenth and once again i was back in business .            the red queen s race  here s a puzzle for you  if you like .  is it a crime to translate a chemistry textbook into greek .   or let s put it another way .  if one of the country s largest atomic power plants is completely ruined in an unauthorized experiment  is an admitted accessory to that act a criminal .   these problems only developed with time  of course .  we started with the atomic power plant   drained .  i really mean drained .  i don t know exactly how large the fissionable power source was   but in two flashing microseconds  it had all fissioned .   no explosion .  no undue gamma ray density .  it was merely that every moving part in the entire structure was fused .  the entire main building was mildly hot .  just a dead  useless building which later on took a hundred million dollars to replace .   it happened about three in the morning  and they found elmer tywood alone in the central source chamber .  the findings of twenty four close packed hours can be summarized quickly .   elmer tywood   ph . d .   sc . d .   fellow of this and hon  orary that  one time youthful participant of the original man  hattan project  and now full professor of nuclear physics    was no interloper .  he had a class a pass   unlimited .  but no  record could be found as to his purpose in being there just  then .  a table on casters contained equipment which had not  been made on any recorded requisition .  it  too  was a single  fused mass   not quite too hot to touch .   elmer tywood was dead .  he lay next to the table  his face  congested  nearly black .  no radiation effect .  no external force  of any sort .  the doctor said apoplexy .   in elmer tywood s office safe were found two puzzling  items  i . e .  twenty foolscap sheets of apparent mathematics   and a bound folio in a foreign language which turned out to be  greek  the subject matter  on translation  turning out to be  chemistry .   the secrecy which poured over the whole mess was some   astounding science fiction  january       copyright         by street   smith publications  inc .        thing so terrific as to make everything that touched it  dead .  it s the only word that can describe it .  twenty seven men and women  all told  including the secretary of defense  the secretary of science and two or three others so top notch that they were completely unknown to the public  entered the power plant during the period of investigation .  all who had been in the plant that night  the physicist who had identified tywood  the doctor who had examined him  were retired into virtual home arrest .   no newspaper ever got the story .  no inside dopester got it .  a few members of congress got part of it .   and naturally so .  anyone or any group or any country that could suck all the available energy out of the equivalent of perhaps fifty to a hundred pounds of plutonium without exploding it  had america s industry and america s defense so snugly in the palm of the hand that the light and life of one hundred sixty million people could be turned off between yawns .   was it tywood .  or tywood and others .  or just others  through tywood .   and my job .  i was decoy  or front man  if you like .  someone has to hang around the university and ask questions about tywood .  after all  he was missing .  it could be amnesia  a holdup  a kidnapping  a killing  a runaway  insanity  accident   i could busy myself with that for five years and collect black looks  and maybe divert attention .  to be sure  it didn t work out that way .   but don t think i was in on the whole case at the start .  i wasn t one of the twenty seven men i mentioned a while back  though my boss was .  but i knew a little   enough to get started .   professor john keyser was also in physics .  i didn t get to him right away .  there was a good deal of routine to cover first in as conscientious a way as i could .  quite meaningless .  quite necessary .  but i was in keyser s office now .   professors  offices are distinctive .  nobody dusts them except some tired cleaning woman who hobbles in and out at eight in the morning  and the professor never notices the dust anyway .  lots of books without much arrangement .  the ones close to the desk are used a lot   lectures are copied out of them .  the ones out of reach are wherever a student put them back after borrowing them .  then there are professional journals that look       cheap and are darned expensive  which are waiting about and which may some day be read .  and plenty of paper on the desk  some of it scribbled on .   keyser was an elderly man   one of tywood s generation .  his nose was big and rather red  and he smoked a pipe .  he had that easy going and nonpredatory look in his eyes that goes with an academic job   either because that kind of job attracts that kind of man or because that kind of job makes that kind of man .   i said   what kind of work is professor tywood doing .     research physics .    answers like that bounce off me .  some years ago they used to get me mad .  now i just said   we know that  professor .  it s the details i m after .    and he twinkled at me tolerantly   surely the details can t help much unless you re a research physicist yourself .  does it matter   under the circumstances .     maybe not .  but he s gone .  if anything s happened to him in the way of   i gestured  and deliberately clinched    foul play  his work may have something to do with it   unless he s rich and the motive is money .    keyser chuckled dryly   college professors are never rich .  the commodity we peddle is but lightly considered  seeing how large the supply is .    i ignored that  too  because i know my looks are against me .  actually  i finished college with a  very good  translated into latin so that the college president could understand it  and never played in a football game in my life .  but i look rather the reverse .   i said   then we re left with his work to consider .     you mean spies .  international intrigue .     why not .  it s happened before .  after all  he s a nuclear physicist  isn t he .     he is .  but so are others .  so am i .     ah  but perhaps he knows something you don t .    there was a stiffening to the jaw .  when caught off guard  professors can act just like people .  he said  stiffly   as i recall offhand  tywood has published papers on the effect of liquid viscosity on the wings of the rayleigh line  on higher orbit field equations  and on spin orbit coupling of two nucleons  but his main work is on quadrupole moments .  i am quite competent in these matters .          is he working on quadrupole moments now .   i tried not to bat an eye  and i think i succeeded .    yes   in a way .   he almost sneered   he may be getting to the experimental stage finally .  he s spent most of his life   it seems  working out the mathematical consequences of a special theory of his own .     like this   and i tossed a sheet of foolscap at him .   the sheet was one of those in the safe in tywood s office .  the chances  of course  were that the bundle meant nothing  if only because it was a professor s safe .  that is  things are sometimes put in at the spur of the moment because the logical drawer was filled with unmarked exam papers .  and of course  nothing is ever taken out .  we had found in that safe dusty little vials of yellowish crystals with scarcely legible labels  some mimeographed booklets dating back to world war ii and marked  restricted   a copy of an old college yearbook  and some correspondence concerning a possible position as director of research for american electric  dated ten years back  and  of course  chemistry in greek .   the foolscap was there  too .  it was rolled up like a college diploma with a rubber band about it and had no label or descriptive title .  some twenty sheets were covered with ink marks  meticulous and small      i had one sheet of that foolscap .  i don t think any one man in the world had more than one sheet .  and i m sure that no man in the world but one knew that the loss of his particular sheet and of his particular life would be as nearly simultaneous as the government could make it .   so i tossed the sheet at keyser  as if it were something i d found blowing about the campus .   he stared at it and then looked at the back side  which was blank .  his eyes moved down from the top to the bottom  then jumped back to the top .    i don t know what this is about   he said  and the words seemed sour to his own taste .   i didn t say anything .  just folded the paper and shoved it back into the inside jacket pocket .   keyser added petulantly   it s a fallacy you laymen have that scientists can look at an equation and say   ah  yes     and go on to write a book about it .  mathematics has no existence of its own .  it is merely an arbitrary code devised to describe physical observations or philosophical concepts .  every       man can adapt it is to his own particular needs .  for instance no one can look at a symbol and be sure of what it means .  so far  science has used every letter in the alphabet  large  small and italic  each symbolizing many different things .  they have used bold faced letters  gothic type letters  greek letters  both capital and small  subscripts  superscripts  asterisks  even hebrew letters .  different scientists use different symbols for the same concept and the same symbol for different concepts .  so if you show a disconnected page like this to any man  without information as to the subject being investigated or the particular symbology used  he could absolutely not make sense out of it .    i interrupted   but you said he was working on quadrupole moments .  does that make this sensible .   and i tapped the spot on my chest where the foolscap had been slowly scorching a hole in my jacket for two days .    i can t tell .  i saw none of the standard relationships that i d expect to be involved .  at least i recognized none .  but i obviously can t commit myself .    there was a short silence  then he said  til tell you .  why don t you check with his students .    i lifted my eyebrows   you mean in his classes .    he seemed annoyed   no  for heaven s sake .  his research students .  his doctoral candidates .  they ve been working with him .  they ll know the details of that work better than i  or anyone in the faculty  could possibly know it .     it s an idea   i said  casually .  it was  too .  i don t know why  but i wouldn t have thought of it myself .  i guess it s because it s only natural to think that any professor knows more than any student .   keyser latched onto a lapel as i rose to leave .   and  besides   he said   i think you re on the wrong track .  this is in confidence  you understand  and i wouldn t say it except for the unusual circumstances  but tywood is not thought of too highly in the profession .  oh  he s an adequate teacher  i ll admit  but his research papers have never commanded respect .  there has always been a tendency toward vague theorizing  unsupported by experimental evidence .  that paper of yours is probably more of it .  no one could possibly want to  .  .  .  er kidnap him because of it .     is that so .  i see .  any ideas  yourself  as to why he s gone  or where he s gone .          nothing concrete   he said pursing his lips   but everyone knows he is a sick man .  he had a stroke two years ago that kept him out of classes for a semester .  he never did get well .  his left side was paralyzed for a while and he still limps .  another stroke would kill him .  it could come any time .     you think he s dead  then .     it s not impossible .     but where s the body  then .     well  really   that is your job  i think .    it was  and i left .   i interviewed each one of tywood s four research students in a volume of chaos called a research laboratory .  these student research laboratories usually have two hopefuls working therein  said two constituting a floating population  since every year or so they are alternately replaced .   consequently  the laboratory has its equipment stack in tiers .  on the laboratory benches is the equipment immediately being used  and in three or four of the handiest drawers are replacements or supplements which are likely to be used .  in the farther drawers  on the shelves reaching up to the ceiling  in odd corners  are fading remnants of the past student generations   oddments never used and never discarded .  it is claimed  in fact  that no research student ever knew all the contents of his laboratory .   all four of tywood s students were worried .  but three were worried mainly by their own status .  that is  by the possible effect the absence of tywood might have on the status of their  problem .   i dismissed those three   who all have their degrees now  i hope   and called back the fourth .   he had the most haggard look of all  and had been least communicative   which i considered a hopeful sign .   he now sat stiffly in the straight backed chair at the right of the desk  while i leaned back in a creaky old swivel chair and pushed my hat off my forehead .  his name was edwin howe and he did get his degree later on  i know that for sure  because he s a big wheel in the department of science now .   i said   you do the same work the other boys do  i suppose .     it s all nuclear work  in a way .     but it s not all exactly the same .    he shook his head slowly .   we take different angles .  you       have to have something clear cut  you know  or you won t be able to publish .  we ve got to get our degrees .    he said it exactly the way you or i might say   we ve got to make a living .   at that  maybe it s the same thing for them .   i said   all right .  what s your angle .    he said   i do the math .  i mean  with professor tywood .     what kind of math .    and he smiled a little  getting the same sort of atmosphere about him that i had noticed in professor keyset s case that morning .  a sort of   do you really think i can explain all my profound thoughts to stupid little you .   sort of atmosphere .   all he said aloud  however  was   that would be rather complicated to explain .     i ll help you   i said .   is that anything like it .   and i tossed the foolscap sheet at him .   he didn t give it any once over .  he just snatched it up and let out a thin wail   where d you get this .     from tywood s safe .     do you have the rest of it  too .     it s safe   i hedged .   he relaxed a little   just a little   you didn t show it to anybody  did you .    i showed it to professor keyser .    howe made an impolite sound with his lower lip and front teeth   that jackass .  what did he say .    i turned the palms of my hands upward and howe laughed .  then he said  in an offhand manner   well  that s the sort of stuff i do .     and what s it all about .  put it so i can understand it .    there was distinct hesitation .  he said   now  look .  this is confidential stuff .  even pop s other students don t know anything about it .  i don t even think i know all about it .  this isn t just a degree i m after  you know .  it s pop tywood s nobel prize  and it s going to be an assistant professorship for me at cal tech .  this has got to be published before it s talked about .    and i shook my head slowly and made my words very soft   no  son .  you have it twisted .  you ll have to talk about it before it s published  because tywood s gone and maybe he s dead and maybe he isn t .  and if he s dead  maybe he s murdered .  and when the department has a suspicion of murder  everybody talks .  now  it will look bad for you  kid  if you try to keep some secrets .         it worked .  i knew it would  because everyone reads murder mysteries and knows all the cliches .  he jumped out of his chair and rattled the words off as if he had a script in front of him .    surely   he said   you can t suspect me of  .  .  .  of anything like that .  why  .  .  .  why  my career       i shoved him back into his chair with the beginnings of a sweat on his forehead .  i went into the next line   i don t suspect anybody of anything yet .  and you won t be in any trouble  if you talk  chum .    he was ready to talk .   now this is all in strict confidence .    poor guy .  he didn t know the meaning of the word  strict  he was never out of eyeshot of an operator from that moment till the government decided to bury the whole case with the one final comment of   .   quote .  unquote .   i m not kidding .  to this day  the case is neither opened nor closed .  it s just   .     he said  dubiously   you know what time travel is  i suppose .    sure i knew what time travel was .  my oldest kid is twelve and he listens to the afternoon video programs till he swells up visibly with the junk he absorbs at the ears and eyes .    what about time travel .   i said .    in a sense  we can do it .  actually  it s only what you might call micro temporal translation       i almost lost my temper .  in fact  i think i did .  it seemed obvious that the squirt was trying to diddle me  and without subtlety .  i m used to having people think i look dumb  but not that dumb .   i said through the back of my throat   are you going to tell me that tywood is out somewhere in time   like ace rogers  the lone time ranger .    that was junior s favorite program ace rogers was stopping genghis khan single handed that week .    but he looked as disgusted as i mast have .   no   he yelled .   i don t know where pop is .  if you d listen to me   i said micro temporal translation .  now  this isn t a video show and it isn t magic  this happens to be science .  for instance  you know about matter energy equivalence  i suppose .    i nodded sourly .  everyone knows about that since hiroshima in the last war but one .    all right  then   he went on   that s good for a start .  now  if       you take a known mass of matter and apply temporal translation to it   you know  send it back in time   you are  in effect  creating matter at the point in time to which you are sending it .  to do that  you must use an amount of energy equivalent to the amount of matter you have created .  in other words  to send a gram   or  say  an ounce   of anything back in time  you have to disintegrate an ounce of matter completely  to furnish the energy required .     hm m m   i said   that s to create the ounce of matter in the past .  but aren t you destroying an ounce of matter by removing it from the present .  doesn t that create the equivalent amount of energy .    and he looked just about as annoyed as a fellow sitting on a bumblebee that wasn t quite dead .  apparently laymen are never supposed to question scientists .   he said   i was trying to simplify it so you would understand it .  actually  it s more complicated .  it would be very nice if we could use the energy of disappearance to cause it to appear  but that would be working in a circle  believe me .  the requirements of entropy would forbid it .  to put it more rigorously  the energy is required to overcome temporal inertia and it just works out so that the energy in ergs required to send back a mass  in grams  is equal to the mass times the square of the speed of light in centimeters per second .  which just happens to be the einstein mass energy equivalence equation .  i can give you the mathematics  you know .     i know   i waxed some of that misplaced eagerness back .   but was all this worked out experimentally .  or is it just on paper .    obviously  the thing was to keep him talking .   he had that queer light in his eye that every research student gets  i am told  when he is asked to discuss his problem .  he ll discuss it with anyone  even with a  dumb flatfoot   which was convenient at the moment .    you see   he said like a man slipping you the inside dope on a shady business deal   what started the whole thing was this neutrino business .  they ve been trying to find that neutrino since the late thirties and they haven t succeeded .  it s a subatomic particle which has no charge and has a mass much less than even an electron .  naturally  it s next to impossible to spot  and hasn t been spotted yet .  but they keep looking because  without assuming that a neutrino exists  the energetics       of some nuclear reactions can t be balanced .  so pop tywood got the idea about twenty years ago that some energy was disappearing  in the form of matter  back into time .  we got working on that   or he did   and i m the first student he s ever had tackle it along with him .    obviously  we had to work with tiny amounts of material and  .  .  .  well  it was just a stroke of genius on pop s part to think of using traces of artificial radioactive isotopes .  you could work with just a few micrograms of it  you know  by following its activity with counters .  the variation of activity with time should follow a very definite and simple law which  has never been altered by any laboratory condition known .    well  we d send a speck back fifteen minutes  say  and fifteen minutes before we did that   everything was arranged automatically  you see   the count jumped to nearly double what it should be  fell off normally  and then dropped sharply at the moment it was sent back below where it would have been normally .  the material overlapped itself in time  you see  and for fifteen minutes we counted the double material       i interrupted   you mean you had the same atoms existing in two places at the same time .     yes   he said  with mild surprise   why not .  that s why we use so much energy   the equivalent of creating those atoms .   and then he rushed on   now i ll tell you what my particular job is .  if you send back the material fifteen minutes  it is apparently sent back to the same spot relative to the earth despite the fact that in fifteen minutes  the earth moved sixteen thousand miles around the sun  and the sun itself moves more thousand miles and so on .  but there are certain tiny discrepancies which i ve analyzed and which turn out to be due  possibly  to two causes .    first  there is a factional effect   if you can use such a term   so the matter does drift a little with respect to the earth  depending on how far back in time it is sent  and on the nature of material .  then  too  some of the discrepancy can only be explained by the assumption that passage through time itself takes time .     how s that .   i said .    what i mean is that some of the radioactivity is evenly spread throughout the time of translation as if the material tested had been reacting during backward passage through time by a constant amount .  my figures show that   well  if you were       to be moved backward in time  you would age one day for every hundred years .  or  to put it another way  if you could watch a time dial which recorded the time outside a  time machine   your watch would move forward twenty four hours while the time dial moved back a hundred years .  that s a universal constant  i think  because the speed of light is a universal constant .  anyway  that s my work .    after a few minutes  in which i chewed all this  i asked   where did you get the energy needed for your experiments .     they ran out a special line from the power plant .  pop s a big shot there  and swung the deal .     hm m m .  what was the heaviest amount of material you sent into the past .     oh    he sent his eyes upwards    i think we shot back one hundredth of a milligram once .  that s ten micrograms .     ever try sending anything into the future .    that won t work   he put in quickly .   impossible .  you can t change signs like that  because the energy required becomes more than infinite .  it s a one way proposition .    i looked hard at my fingernails   how much material could you send back in time if you fissioned about  .  .  .  oh  say  one hundred pounds of plutonium .   things  i thought  were becoming  if anything  too obvious .   the answer came quickly   in plutonium fission   he said   not more than one or two percent of the mass is converted into energy .  therefore  one hundred pounds of plutonium when completely used up would send a pound or two back into time .     is that all .  but could you handle all that energy .  i mean  a hundred pounds of plutonium can make quite an explosion .     all relative   he said  a bit pompously .   if you took all that energy and let it loose a little at a time  you could handle it .  if you released it all at once  but used it just as fast as you released it  you could still handle it .  in sending back material through time  energy can be used much faster than it can possibly be released even through fission .  theoretically  anyway .     but how do you get rid of it .     it s spread through time  naturally .  of course  the minimum time through which material could be transferred would  therefore  depend on the mass of the material .  otherwise  you re liable to have the energy density with time too high .     all right  kid   i said .   i m calling up headquarters  and       they ll send a man here to take you home .  you ll stay there a while .     but   what for .     it won t be for long .    it wasn t   and it was made up to him afterwards .   i spent the evening at headquarters .  we had a library there   a very special kind of library .  the very morning after the explosion  two or three operators had drifted quietly into the chemistry and physics libraries of the university .  experts in their way .  they located every article tywood had ever published in any scientific journal and had snapped each page .  nothing was disturbed otherwise .   other men went through magazine files and through book lists .  it ended with a room at headquarters that represented a complete tywoodana .  nor was there a definite purpose in doing this .  it merely represented part of the thoroughness with which a problem of this sort is met .   i went through that library .  not the scientific papers .  i knew there d be nothing there that i wanted .  but he had written a series of articles for a magazine twenty years back  and i read those .  and i grabbed at every piece of private correspondence they had available .   after that  i just sat and thought   and got scared .   i got to bed about four in the morning and had nightmares .   but i was in the boss  private office at nine in the morning just the same .   he s a big man  the boss  with iron gray hair slicked down tight .  he doesn t smoke  but he keeps a box of cigars on his desk and when he doesn t want to say anything for a few seconds  he picks one up  rolls it about a little  smells it  then sticks it right into the middle of his mouth and lights it in a very careful way .  by that time  he either has something to say or doesn t have to say anything at all .  then he puts the cigar down and lets it burn to death .   he used up a box in about three weeks  and every christmas  half his gift wraps held boxes of cigars .   he wasn t reaching for any cigars now  though .  he just folded his big fists together on the desk and looked up at me from under a creased forehead .   what s boiling .    i told him .  slowly  because micro temporal translation doesn t sit well with anybody  especially when you call it time travel  which i did .  it s a sign of how serious things were that       he only asked me once if i were crazy .   then i was finished and we stared at each other .   he said   and you think he tried to send something back in time   something weighing a pound or two   and blew an entire plant doing it .     it fits in   i said .   i let him go for a while .  he was thinking and i wanted him to keep on thinking .  i wanted him  if possible  to think of the same thing i was thinking  so that i wouldn t have to tell him      because i hated to have to tell him      because it was nuts  for one thing .  and too horrible  for another .   so i kept quiet and he kept on thinking and every once in a while some of his thoughts came to the surface .   after a while  he said   assuming the student  howe  to have told the truth   and you d better check his notebooks  by the way  which i hope you ve impounded        the entire wing of that floor is out of bounds  sir .  edwards has the notebooks .    he went on   all right .  assuming he told us all the truth he knows  why did tywood jump from less than a milligram to a pound .    his eyes came down and they were hard   now you re concentrating on the time travel angle .  to you  i gather  that is the crucial point  with the energy involved as incidental  purely incidental .     yes  sir   i said grimly .   i think exactly that .     have you considered that you might be wrong .  that you might have matters inverted .     i don t quite get that .     well  look .  you say you ve read up on tywood .  all right .  he was one of that bunch of scientists after world war ii that fought the atom bomb  wanted a world state   you know about that  don t you .    i nodded .    he had a guilt complex   the boss said with energy .   he d helped work out the bomb  and he couldn t sleep nights thinking of what he d done .  he lived with that fear for years .  and even though the bomb wasn t used in world war iii  can you imagine what every day of uncertainty must have meant to him .  can you imagine the shriveling horror in his soul as he       waited for others to make the decision at every crucial moment till the final compromise of sixty five .    we have a complete psychiatric analysis of tywood and several others just like him  taken during the last war .  did you know that .     no  sir .     it s true .  we let up after sixty five  of course  because with the establishment of world control of atomic power  the scrapping of the atomic bomb stockpile in all countries  and the establishment of research liaison among the various spheres of influence on the planet  most of the ethical conflict in the scientific mind was removed .    but the findings at the time were serious .  in       tywood had a morbid subconscious hatred for the very concept of atomic power .  he began to make mistakes  serious ones .  eventually  we were forced to take him off research of any kind .  and several others as well  even though things were pretty bad at the time .  we had just lost india  if you remember .    considering that i was in india at the time  i remembered .  but i still wasn t seeing his point .    now  what   he continued   if dregs of that attitude remained buried in tywood to the very end .  don t you see that this time travel is a double edged sword .  why throw a pound of anything into the past  anyway .  for the sake of proving a point .  he had proved his case just as much when he sent back a fraction of a milligram .  that was good enough for the nobel prize  i suppose .    but there was one thing he could do with a pound of matter that he couldn t do with a milligram  and that was to drain a power plant .  so that was what he must have been after .  he had discovered a way of consuming inconceivable quantities of energy .  by sending back eighty pounds of dirt  he could remove all the existing plutonium in the world .  end atomic power for an indefinite period .    i was completely unimpressed  but i tried not to make that too  plain .  i just said   do you think he could possibly have thought he could get away with it more than once .     this is all based on the fact that he wasn t a normal man .  how do i know what he could imagine he could do .  besides  there may be men behind him   with less science and more brains   who are quite ready to continue onwards from this point .          have any of these men been found yet .  any evidence of such men .    a little wait  and his hand reached for the cigar box .  he stared at the cigar and turned it end for end .  just a little wait more .  i was patient .   then he put it down decisively without lighting it .    no   he said .   he looked at me  and clear through me and said   then  you still don t go for that .    i shrugged   well   it doesn t sound right .     do you have a notion of your own .     yes .  but i can t bring myself to talk about it .  if i m wrong  i m the wrongest man that ever was  but if i m right  i m the rightest .     i ll listen   he said  and he put his hand under the desk .   that was the pay off .  the room was armored  sound proof  and radiation proof to anything short of a nuclear explosion .  and with that little signal showing on his secretary s desk  the president of the united states couldn t have interrupted us .   i leaned back and said   chief  do you happen to remember how you met your wife .  was it a little thing .    he must have thought it a non sequitur .  what else could he have thought .  but he was giving me my head now  having his own reasons  i suppose .   he just smiled and said   i sneezed and she turned around .  it was at a street corner .     what made you be on that street corner just then .  what made her be .  do you remember just why you sneezed .  where you caught the cold .  or where the speck of dust came from .  imagine how many factors had to intersect in just the right place at just the right time for you to meet your wife     i suppose we would have met some other time  if not then .     but you can t know that .  how do you know whom you didn t meet  because once when you might have turned around  you didn t  because once when you might have been late  you weren t .  your life forks at every instant  and you go down one of the forks almost at random  and so does everyone else .  start twenty years ago  and the forks diverge further and further with time .    you sneezed  and met a girl  and not another .  as a consequence  you made certain decisions  and so did the girl  and so did the girl you didn t meet  and the man who did meet her  and the people you all met thereafter .  and your family  her       family  their family   and your children .    because you sneezed twenty years ago  five people  or fifty  or five hundred  might be dead now who would have been alive  or might be alive who would have been dead .  move it to two hundred years ago  two thousand years ago  and a sneeze   even by someone no history ever heard of   might have meant that no one now alive would have been alive .    the boss rubbed the back of his head   widening ripples .  i read a story once        so did i .  it s not a new idea   but i want you to think about it for a while  because i want to read to you from an article by professor elmer tywood in a magazine twenty years old .  it was just before the last war .    i had copies of the film in my pocket and the white wall made a beautiful screen  which was what it was meant to do .  the boss made a motion to turn about  but i waved him back .    no  sir   i said .   i want to read this to you .  and i want you to listen to it .    he leaned back .    the article   i went on  is entitled   man s first great failure .   remember  this was just before the war  when the bitter disappointment at the final failure of the united nations was at its height .  what i will read are some excerpts from the first part of the article .  it goes like this      .  .  .  that man  with his technical perfection  has failed to solve the great sociological problems of today is only the second immense tragedy that has come to the race .  the first  and perhaps the greater  was that  once  these same great sociological problems  were solved  and yet these solutions were not permanent  because the technical perfection we have today did not then exist .     it was a case of having bread without butter  or butter without bread .  never both together .  .  .  .      consider the hellenic world  from which our philosophy   our mathematics  our ethics  our art  our literature   our entire  culture  in fact   stem  .  .  .  in the days of pericles  greece  like  our own world in microcosm  was a surprisingly modern pot  pourri of conflicting ideologies and ways of life .  but then  rome came  adopting the culture  but bestowing  and enforc  ing  peace .  to be sure  the pax romano lasted only two hun  dred years  but no like period has existed since     war was abolished .  nationalism did not exist .  the roman       citizen was empire wide .  paul of tarsus and flavius josephus were roman citizens .  spaniards  north africans  illyrians assumed the purple .  slavery existed  but it was an indiscriminate slavery  imposed as a punishment  incurred as the price of economic failure  brought on by the fortunes of war .  no man was a natural slave   because of the color of his skin or the place of his birth .     religious toleration was complete .  if an exception was  made early in the case of the christians  it was because they  refused to accept the principle of toleration  because they in  sisted that only they themselves knew truth   a principle ab  horrent to the civilized roman     with all of western culture under a single polis  with the cancer of religious and national particularism and exclusiv ism absent  with a high civilization in existence   why could not man hold his gains .      it was because  technologically  ancient hellenism remained backward .  it was because without a machine civilization  the price of leisure   and hence civilization and culture  for the few  was slavery for the many .  because the civilization could not find the means to bring comfort and ease to all the population .      therefore  the depressed classes turned to the other world  and to religions which spurned the material benefits of this world   so that science was made impossible in any true sense for over a millennium .  and further  as the initial impetus of hellenism waned  the empire lacked the technological powers to beat back the barbarians .  in fact  it was not till after a . d .       that war became sufficiently a function of the industrial resources of a nation to enable the settled people to defeat invading tribesmen and nomads with ease .  .  .  .     imagine  then  if somehow the ancient greeks had learned just a hint of modern chemistry and physics .  imagine if the growth of the empire had been accompanied by the growth of science  technology and industry .  imagine an empire in which machinery replaced slaves  in which all men had a decent share of the world s goods  in which the legion became the armored column against which no barbarians could stand .  imagine an empire which would therefore spread all over the world  without religious or national prejudices .     an empire of all men   all brothers   eventually all free .  .  .  .           if history could be changed .  if that first great failure could have been prevented        and i stopped at that point .    well .  said the boss .    well   i said   i think it isn t difficult to connect all that with the fact that tywood blew an entire power plant in his anxiety to send something back to the past  while in his office safe we found sections of a chemistry textbook translated into greek .    his face changed  while he considered .   then he said heavily   but nothing s happened .     i know .  but then i ve been told by tywood s student that it takes a day to move back a century in time .  assuming that ancient greece was the target area  we have twenty centuries  hence twenty days .     but can it be stopped .     i wouldn t know .  tywood might  but he s dead .    the enormity of it all hit me at once  deeper than it had the night before      all humanity was virtually under sentence of death .  and while that was merely horrible abstraction  the fact that reduced it to a thoroughly unbearable reality was that i was  too .  and my wife  and my kid .   further  it was a death without precedence .  a ceasing to exist  and no more .  the passing of a breath .  the vanishing of a dream .  the drift into eternal non space and non time of a shadow .  i would not be dead at all  in fact .  i would merely never have been born .   or would i .  would i exist   my individuality   my ego   my soul  if you like .  another life .  other circumstances .   i thought none of that in words then .  but if a cold knot in the stomach could ever speak under the circumstances  it would sound like that  i think .   the boss moved in on my thoughts   hard .    then  we have about two and a half weeks .  no time to lose .  come on .    i grinned with one side of my mouth   what do we do .  chase the book .     no   he replied coldly   but there are two courses of action we must follow .  first  you may be wrong   altogether .  all of this circumstantial reasoning may still represent a false lead  perhaps deliberately thrown before us  to cover up the real truth .  that must be checked .         secondly  you may be right   but there may be some way of stopping the book  other than chasing it in a time machine  i mean .  if so  we must find out how .     i would just like to say  sir  if this is a false lead  only a madman would consider it a believable one .  so suppose i m right  and suppose there s no way of stopping it .     then  young fellow  i m going to keep pretty busy for two and a half weeks  and i d advise you to do the same .  the time will pass more quickly that way .    of course he was right .    where do we start .   i asked .    the first thing we need is a list of all men and women on the government payroll under tywood .     why .     reasoning .  your specialty  you know .  tywood doesn t know greek  i think we can assume with fair safety  so someone else must have done the translating .  it isn t likely that anyone would do a job like that for nothing  and it isn t likely that tywood would pay out of his personal funds   not on a professor s salary .     he might   i pointed out   have been interested in more secrecy than a government payroll affords .     why .  where was the danger .  is it a crime to translate a chemistry textbook into greek .  who would ever deduce from that a plot such as you ve described .    it took us half an hour to turn up the name of mycroft james boulder  listed as  consultant   and to find out that he was mentioned in the university catalogue as assistant professor of philosophy and to check by telephone that among his many accomplishments was a thorough knowledge of attic greek .   which was a coincidence   because with the boss reaching for his hat  the interoffice teletype clicked away and it turned out that mycroft james boulder was in the anteroom  at the end of a two hour continuing insistence that he see the boss .   the boss put his hat back and opened his office door .   professor mycroft james boulder was a gray man .  his hair was gray and his eyes were gray .  his suit was gray  too .   but most of all  his expression was gray  gray with a tension that seemed to twist at the lines in his thin face .   boulder said  softly   i ve been trying for three days to get a hearing  sir  with a responsible man .  i can get no higher than       yourself .     i may be high enough   said the boss .   what s on your mind .     it is quite important that i be granted an interview with professor tywood .     do you know where he is .     i am quite certain that he is in government custody .     why .     because i know that he was planning an experiment which would entail the breaking of security regulations .  events since  as nearly as i can make them out  flow naturally from the supposition that security regulations have indeed been broken .  i can presume  then  that the experiment has at least been attempted .  i must discover whether it has been successfully concluded .     professor boulder   said the boss   i believe you can read greek .     yes  i can     coolly .    and have translated chemical texts for professor tywood on government money .     yes   as a legally employed consultant    yet such translation  under the circumstances  constitutes a crime  since it makes you an accessory to tywood s crime .     you can establish a connection .     can t you .  or haven t you heard of tywood s notion on time travel  or  .  .  .  what do you call it  .  .  .  micro temporal trahslation .     ah .   and boulder smiled a little .   he s told you  then .     no  he hasn t   said the boss  harshly .   professor tywood is dead .     what .   then    i don t believe you .     he died of apoplexy .  look at this .    he had one of the photographs taken that first night in his wall safe .  tywood s face was distorted but recognizable  sprawled and dead .   boulder s breath went in and out as if the gears were clogged .  he stared at the picture for three full minutes by the electric clock on the wall .   where is this place .   he asked .    the atomic power plant .     had he finished his experiment .    the boss shrugged  there s no way of telling .  he was dead when we found him .         boulder s lips were pinched and colorless .   that must be determined  somehow .  a commission of scientists must be established  and  if necessary  the experiment must be repeated       but the boss just looked at him  and reached for a cigar .  i ve never seen him take longer   and when he put it down  curled in its unused smoke  he said   tywood wrote an article for a magazine  twenty years ago        oh   and the professor s lips twisted   is that what gave you your clue .  you may ignore that .  the man is only a physical scientist and knows nothing of either history or sociology .  a schoolboy s dreams and nothing more .     then  you don t think sending your translation back will inaugurate a golden age  do you .     of course not .  do you think you can graft the developments of two thousand years of slow labor onto a child society not ready for it .  do you think a great invention or a great scientific principle is born full grown in the mind of a genius divorced from his cultural milieul newton s enunciation of the law of gravity was delayed for twenty years because the then current figure for the earth s diameter was wrong by ten percent .  archimedes almost discovered calculus  but failed because arabic numerals  invented by some nameless hindu or group of hindus  was unknown to him .    for that matter  the mere existence of a slave society in ancient greece and rome meant that machines could scarcely attract much attention   slaves being so much cheaper and more adaptable .  and men of true intellect could scarcely be expected to spend their energies on devices intended for manual labor .  even archimedes  the greatest engineer of antiquity  refused to publish any of his practical inventions   only mathematic abstractions .  and when a young man asked plato of what use geometry was  he was forthwith expelled from the academy as a man with a mean  unphilosophic soul .    science does not plunge forward   it inches along in the directions permitted by the greater forces that mold society and which are in turn molded by society .  and no great man advances but on the shoulders of the society that surrounds him      the boss interrupted him at that point .   suppose you tell us what your part in tywood s work was  then .  we ll take your word for it that history cannot be changed .          oh it can  but not purposefully   you see  when tywood first requested my services in the matter of translating certain textbook passages into greek  i agreed for the money involved .  but he wanted the translation on parchment  he insisted on the use of ancient greek terminology   the language of plato  to use his words   regardless of how i had to twist the literal significance of passages  and he wanted it hand written in rolls .    i was curious .  i  too  found his magazine article .  it was difficult for me to jump to the obvious conclusion  since the achievements of modern science transcend the imaginings of philosophy in so many ways .  but i learned the truth eventually  and it was at once obvious that tywood s theory of changing history was infantile .  there are twenty million variables for every instant of time  and no system of mathematics   no mathematic psychohistory  to coin a phrase   has yet been developed to handle that ocean of varying functions .    in short  any variation of events two thousand years ago would change all subsequent history  but in no predictable way .    the boss suggested  with a false quietness   like the pebble that starts the avalanche  right .     exactly .  you have some understanding of the situation  i see .  i thought deeply for weeks before i proceeded  and then i realized how i must act   must act .    there was a low roar .  the boss stood up and his chair went over backward .  he swung around his desk  and he had a hand on boulder s throat .  i was stepping out to stop him  but he waved me back      he was only tightening the necktie a  . little .  boulder could still breathe .  he had gone very white  and for all the time that the boss talked  he restricted himself to just that   breathing .   and the boss said   sure  i can see how you decided you must act .  i know that some of you brain sick philosophers think the world needs fixing .  you want to throw the dice again and see what turns up .  maybe you don t even care if you re alive in the new setup   or that no one can possibly know what you ve done .  but you re going to create  just the same .  you re going to give god another chance  so to speak .    maybe i just want to live   but the world could be worse .  in twenty million different ways  it could be worse .  a fellow named wilder once wrote a play called the skin of our teeth .  maybe you ve read it .  it s thesis was that mankind survived by      just that skin of their teeth .  no  i m not going to give you a speech about the ice age nearly wiping us out .  i don t know enough .  i m not even going to talk about the greeks winning at marathon  the arabs being defeated at tours  the mongols turning back at the last minute without even being defeated  because i m no historian .    but take the twentieth century .  the germans were stopped at the marne twice in world war i .  dunkirk happened in world war ii  and somehow the germans were stopped at moscow and stalingrad .  we could have used the atom bomb in the last war and we didn t  and just when it looked as if both sides would have to  the great compromise happened   just because general bruce was delayed in taking off from the ceylon airfield long enough to receive the message directly .  one after the other  just like that  all through history   lucky breaks .  for every  if  that didn t come true that would have made wonder men of all of us if it had  there were twenty  ifs  that didn t come true that would have brought disaster to all of us if they had .    you re gambling on that one in twenty chance   gambling every life on earth .  and you ve succeeded  too  because ty wood did send that text back .    he ground out that last sentence  and opened his fist  so that boulder could fall out and back into his chair .   and boulder laughed .    you fool   he gasped  bitterly   how close you can be and yet how widely you can miss the mark .  tywood did send his book back  then .  you are sure of that .     no chemical textbook in greek was found on the scene   said the boss  grimly   and millions of calories of energy had disappeared .  which doesn t change the fact  however  that we have two and a half weeks in which to   make things interesting for you .     oh  nonsense .  no foolish dramatics  please .  just listen to me  and try to understand .  there were greek philosophers once  named leucippus and democritus  who evolved an atomic theory .  all matter  they said  was composed of atoms .  varieties of atoms were distinct and changeless and by their different combinations with each other formed the various substances found in nature .  that theory was not the result of experiment or observation .  it came into being  somehow  full grown .         the didactic roman poet lucretius  in his  de rerum natura      on the nature of things    elaborated on that theory and throughout manages to sound startlingly modern .    in hellenistic times  hero built a steam engine and weapons of war became almost mechanized .  the period has been referred to as an abortive mechanical age  which came to nothing because  somehow  it neither grew out of nor fitted into its social and economic milieu .  alexandrian science was a queer and rather inexplicable phenomenon .    then one might mention the old roman legend about the books of the sibyl that contained mysterious information direct from the gods       in other words  gentlemen  while you are right that any change in the course of past events  however trifling  would have incalculable consequences  and while i also believe that you are right in supposing that any random change is much more likely to be for the worse than for the better  i must point out that you are nevertheless wrong in your final conclusions .    because this is the world in which the greek chemistry text was sent back .    this has been a red queen s race  if you remember your  through the looking glass .   in the red  queen s country  one had to run as fast as one could merely to stay in the same place .  and so it was in this case .  tywood may have thought he was creating a new world  but it was i who prepared the translations  and i took care that only such passages as would account for the queer scraps of knowledge the ancients apparently got from nowhere would be included .    and my only intention  for all my racing  was to stay in the same place .    three weeks passed  three months  three years .  nothing happened .  when nothing happens  you have no proof .  we gave up trying to explain  and we ended  the boss and i  by doubting it ourselves .   the case never ended .  boulder could not be considered a criminal without being considered a world savior as well  and vice versa .  he was ignored .  and in the end  the case was neither solved  nor closed out  merely put in a file all by itself  under the designation   .   and buried in the deepest vault in washington .   the boss is in washington now  a big wheel .  and i m regional head of the bureau .        boulder is still assistant professor  though .  promotions are slow at the university .   the end  the red queen s race   my fifty eighth story  was the first to be written by dr .  asimov .   in september i began another story   mother earth   and submitted it to campbell on october          .  after a comparatively small revision of the ending  he took that one  too .          mother earth   but can you be certain .  are you sure that even a professional historian can always distinguish between victory and defeat .    gustav stein  who delivered himself of that mocking question with a whiskered smile and a gentle wipe at the gray moustache from the neighborhood of which he had just removed an empty glass  was not an historian .  he was a physiologist .   but his companion was an historian  and he accepted the gentle thrust with a smile of his own .   stein s apartment was  for earth  quite luxurious .  it lacked the empty privacy of the outer worlds  of course  since from its window there stretched outward a phenomenon that belonged only to the home planet   a city .  a large city  full of people  rubbing shoulders  mingling sweat      nor was stein s apartment fitted with its own power and its own utility supply .  it lacked even the most elementary quota of positronic robots .  in short  it lacked the dignity of self sufficiency  and like all things on earth  it was merely part of a community  a pendant unit of a cluster  a portion of a mob .   but stein was an earthman by birth and used to it .  and after all  by earth standards the apartment was still luxurious .   it was just that looking outward through the same windows before which lay the city  one could see the stars and among them the outer worlds  where there were no cities but only gardens  where the lawns were streaks of emerald  where all human beings were kings  and where all good earthmen earnestly and vainly hoped to go some day .   except for a few who knew better   like gustav stein .   the friday evenings with edward field belonged to that class of ritual which comes with age and quiet life .  it broke the week pleasantly for two elderly bachelors  and gave them an innocuous reason to linger over the sherry and the stars .  it took them away from the crudities of life  and  most of all  it let them talk .   field  especially  as a lecturer  scholar and man of modest  astounding science fiction  may       copyright         by street   smith publications  inc .        means quoted chapter and verse from his still uncompleted  history of terrestrian empire      i wait for the last act   he explained .  then i can call it the  decline and fall of empire  and publish it .     you must expect the last act to come soon  then .     in a sense  it has come already .  it is just that it is best to wait for all to recognize that fact .  you see  there are three times when an empire or an economic system or a social institution falls  you skeptic       field paused for effect and waited patiently for stein to say   and those times are .     first   field ticked off a right forefinger   there is the time when just a little nub shows up that points an inexorable way to finality .  it can t be seen or recognized until the finality arrives  when the original nub becomes visible to hindsight .     and you can tell what that little nub is .     i think so  since i already have the advantage of a century and a half of hindsight .  it came when the sirian sector colony  aurora  first obtained permission of the central government at earth to introduce positronic robots into their community life .  obviously  looking back at it  the road was clear for the development of a thoroughly mechanized society based upon robot labor and not human labor .  and it is this mechanization that has been and will yet be the deciding factor in the struggle between the outer words and earth .     it is .   murmured the psychologist .   how infernally clever you historians are .  what and where is the second time the empire fell .    the second point in time   and fiejd gently bent his right middle finger backward   arrives when a signpost is raised for the expert so large and plain that it can be seen even without the aid of perspective .  and that point has been passed  too  with the first establishment of an immigration quota against earth by the outer worlds .  the fact that earth found itself unable to prevent an action so obviously detrimental to itself was a shout for all to hear  and that was fifty years ago .     better and better .  and the third point .    the third point .   down went the ring finger .  that is the least important .  that is when the signpost becomes a wall with a huge  the end  scrawled upon it .  the only requirement for knowing that the end has come  then  is neither perspective nor training  but merely the ability to listen to the video .          i take it that the third point in time has not yet come .     obviously not  or you would not need to ask .  yet it may come soon  for instance  if there is war .     do you think there will be .    field avoided commitment .   times are unsettled  and a good deal of futile emotion is sweeping earth on the immigration question .  and if there should be a war  earth would be defeated quickly and lastingly  and the wall would be erected .     can you be certain .  are you sure that even a professional historian can always distinguish between victory and defeat .    field smiled .  he said   you may know something i do not .  for instance  they talk about something called the  pacific project .      i never heard of it .   stein refilled the two glasses   let us speak of others things .    he held up his glass to the broad window so that the far stars flickered rosily in the clear liquid and said   to a happy ending to earth s troubles .    field held up his own   to the pacific project .    stein sipped gently and said   but we drink to two different things .     do we .    it is quite difficult to describe any of the outer worlds to a native earthman  since it is not so much a description of a world that is required as a description of a state of mind .  the outer worlds   some fifty of them  originally colonies  later domininions  later nations   differ extremely among themselves in a physical sense .  but the state of mind is somewhat the same throughout .   it is something that grows out of a world not originally congenial to mankind  yet populated by the cream of the difficult  the different  the daring  the deviant .   if it is to be expressed in a word  that word is  individuality .    there is the world of aurora  for instance  three parsecs from earth .  it was the first planet settled outside the solar system  and represented the dawn of interstellar travel .  hence its name .   it had air and water to start with  perhaps  but on earthly standards it was rocky and infertile .  the plant life that did exist  sustained by a yellow green pigment completely unrelated to chlorophyll and not as efficient  gave the compara        lively fertile regions a decidedly bilious and unpleasant appearance to unaccustomed eyes .  no animal life higher than unicellular  and the equivalent of bacteria as well  were present .  nothing dangerous  naturally  since the two biological systems  of earth and aurora  were chemically unrelated   aurora became  quite gradually  a patchwork .  grains and fruit trees came first  shrubs  flowers and grass afterward .  herds of livestock followed .  and  as if it were necessary to prevent too close a copy of the mother planet  positronic robots also came to build the mansions  carve the landscapes  lay the power units .  in short  to do the work  and turn the planet green and human .   there was the luxury of a new world and unlimited mineral resources .  there was the splendid excess of atomic power laid out on new foundations with merely thousands  or  at most  millions  not billions  to service .  there was the vast flowering of physical science  in worlds where there was room for it .   take the home of franklin maynard  for instance  who  with his wife  three children  and twenty seven robots  lived on an estate more than forty miles away  in distance  from the nearest neighbor .  yet by community wave he could  if he wished  share the living room of any of the seventy five million on aurora   with each singly  with all simultaneously .   maynard knew every inch of his valley .  he knew just where it ended  sharply  and gave way to the alien crags  along whose undesirable slopes the angular  sharp leaves of the native furze clung sullenly   as if in hatred of the softer matter that had usurped its place in the sun .   maynard did not have to leave that valley .  he was a deputy in the gathering  and a member of the foreign agents committee  but he could transact all business but the most extremely essential  by community wave  without ever sacrificing that precious privacy he had to have in a way no earthman could understand .   even the present business could be performed by community wave .  the man  for instance  who sat with him in his living room  was charles hijkman  and he  actually  was sitting in his own living room on an island in an artificial lake stocked with fifty varieties of fish  which happened to be twenty five miles distant  in space .   the connection was an illusion  of course .  if maynard were to reach out a hand  he could feel the invisible wall .        even the robots were quite accustomed to the paradox  and when hijkman raised a hand for a cigarette  maynard s robot made no move to satisfy the desire  though a half minute passed before hijkman s own robot could do so .   the two men spoke like outer worlders  that is  stiffly and in syllables too clipped to be friendly  and yet certainly not hostile .  merely undefmably lacking in the cream   however sour and thin at times   of human sociability which is so forced upon the inhabitants of earth s ant heaps .   maynard said   i have long wanted a private communion  hijkman .  my duties in the gathering  this year       quite .  that is understood .  you are welcome now  of course .  in fact  especially so  since i have heard of the superior nature of your grounds and landscaping .  is it true that your cattle are fed on imported grass .     i m afraid that is a slight exaggeration .  actually  certain of my best milkers feed on terrestrial imports during calving time  but such a procedure would be prohibitively expensive  i m afraid  if made general .  it yields quite extraordinary milk  however .  may i have the privilege of sending you a day s output .     it would be most kind of you .   hijkman bent his head  gravely .   you must receive some of my salmon in return .    to a terrestrial eye  the two men might have appeared much alike .  both were tall  though not unusually so for aurora  where the average height of the adult male is six feet one and one half inches .  both were blond and hard muscled  with sharp and pronounced features .  though neither was younger than forty  middle age as yet sat lightly upon them .   so much for amenities .  without a change in tone  maynard proceeded to the serious purpose of his call .   he said   the committee  you know  is now largely engaged with moreanu and his conservatives .  we would like to deal with them firmly  we of the independents  that is .  but before we can do so with the requisite calm and certainty  i would like to ask you certain questions .     why me .     because you are aurora s most important physicist .    modesty is an unnatural attitude  and one which is only with difficulty taught to children .  in an individualistic society it is useless and hijkman was  therefore  unencumbered with it .  he simply nodded objectively at maynard s last words .         and   continued maynard   as one of us .  you are an independent .     i am a member of the party .  dues paying  but not very active .     nevertheless safe .  now  tell me  have you heard of the pacific project .     the pacific project .   there was a polite inquiry in his words .    it is something which is taking place on earth .  the pacific is a terrestrial ocean  but the name itself probably has no significance .     i have never heard of it .     i am not surprised .  few have  even on earth .  our communion  by the way  is via tight beam and nothing must go further .     i understand .     whatever pacific project is   and our agents are extremely vague   it might conceivably be a menace .  many of those who on earth pass for scientists seem to be connected with it .  also  some of earth s more radical and foolish politicians .     hm m m .  there was once something called the manhattan project .     yes   urged maynard   what about it .     oh  it s an ancient thing .  it merely occurred to me because of the analogy in names .  the manhattan project was before the time of extra terrestrial travel .  some petty war in the dark ages occurred  and it was the name given to a group of scientists who developed atomic power .     ah   maynard s hand became a fist   and what do you think the pacific project can do  then .    hijkman considered .  then  softly   do you think earth is planning war .    on maynard s face there was a sudden expression of distaste .   six billion people .  six billion half apes  rather  jammed into one system to a near explosion point  facing only some millions of us  total .  don t you think it is a dangerous situation .     oh  numbers .     all right .  are we safe despite the numbers .  tell me .  i m only an administrator  and you re a physicist .  can earth win a war in any way .    hijkman sat solemnly in his chair and thought carefully and       slowly .  then he said   let us reason .  there are three broad classes of methods whereby an individual or group can gain his ends against opposition .  on an increasing level of subtlety  those three classes can be termed the physical  the biological and the psychological .    now  the physical can be easily eliminated .  earth does not have an industrial background .  it does not have a technical know how .  it has very limited resources .  it lacks even a single outstanding physical scientist .  so it is as impossible as anything in the galaxy can be that they can develop any form of physico chemical application that is not already known to the outer worlds .  provided  of course  that the conditions of the problem imply single handed opposition on the part of earth against any or all of the outer worlds .  i take it that none of the outer words intends leaguing with earth against us .    maynard indicated violent opposition even to the suggestion   no  no  no .  there is no question of that .  put it out of your mind .     then  ordinary physical surprise weapons are inconceivable .  it is useless to discuss it further .     then  what about your second class  the biological .    slowly  hijkman lifted his eyebrows   now  that is less certain .  some terrestrial biologists are quite competent  i am told .  naturally  since i am myself a physicist  i am not entirely qualified to judge this .  yet i believe that in certain restricted fields  they are still expert .  in agricultural science  of course  to give an obvious example .  and in bacteriology .  um m m       yes  what about bacteriological warfare .     a thought .  but no  no  quite inconceivable .  a teeming  constricted world such as earth cannot afford to fight an open latticework of fifty sparse worlds with germs .  they are infinitely more subject to epidemics  that is  to retaliation in kind .  in fact  i would say that given our living conditions here on aurora and on the other outer worlds  no contagious disease could really take hold .  no  maynard .  you can check with a bacteriologist  but i think he ll tell you the same .    maynard said   and the third class .     the psychological .  now  that is unpredictable .  and yet the outer worlds are intelligent and healthy communities and not amenable to ordinary propaganda  or for that matter to any form of unhealthy emotionalism .  now  i wonder        yes .          what if the pacific project is just that .  i mean  a huge device to keep us off balance .  something top secret  but meant to leak out in just the right fashion  so that the outer worlds yield a little to earth  simply in order to play safe .    there was a longish silence .    impossible   burst out maynard  angrily .    you react properly .  you hesitate .  but i don t seriously press the interpretation .  it is merely a thought .   a longer silence  then hijkman spoke again   are there any other questions .    maynard started out of a reverie   no  .  .  .  no       the wave broke off and a wall appeared where space had been a moment before .   slowly  with stubborn disbelief  franklin maynard shook his head .   ernest keilin mounted the stairs with a feeling for all the past centuries .  the building was old  cobwebbed with history .  it once housed the parliament of man  and from it words went out that clanged throughout the stars .   it was a tall building .  it soared   stretched   strained .  out and up to the stars  it reached  to the stars that had now turned away .   it no longer even housed the parliament of earth .  that had now been switched to a newer  neoclassical building  one that imperfectly aped the architectural stylisms of the ancient pre atomic age .   yet the older building still held its great name .  officially  it was still stellar house  but it only housed the functionaries of a shriveled bureaucracy now .   keilin got out at the twelfth floor  and the lift dropped quickly down behind him .  the radiant sign said smoothly and quietly  bureau of information .  he handed a letter to the receptionist .  he waited .  and eventually  he passed through the door which said   l .  z .  cellioni   secretary of information .    cellioni was little and dark .  his hair was thick and black  his mustache thin and black .  his teeth  when he smiled  were startlingly white and even   so he smiled often .   he was smiling now  as he rose and held out his hand .  keilin took it  then an offered seat  then an offered cigar .   cellioni said   i am very happy to see you  mr .  keilin .  it is kind of you to fly here from new york on such short notice .         keilin curved the corners of his lips down and made a tiny gesture with one hand  deprecating the whole business .    and now   continued cellioni   i presume you would like an explanation of all this .     i wouldn t refuse one   said keilin .    unfortunately  it is difficult to know exactly how to explain .  as secretary of information  my position is difficult .  i must safeguard the security and well being of earth and  at the same time  observe our traditional freedom of the press .  naturally  and fortunately  we have no censorship  but just as naturally  there are times when we could almost wish we did have .     is this   asked keilin   with reference to me .  about censorship  i mean .    cellioni did not answer directly .  instead  he smiled again  slowly  and with a remarkable absence of joviality .   he said   you  mr .  keilin  have one of the most widely heard and influential telecasts on the video .  therefore  you are of peculiar interest to the government .    the time is mine   said keilin  stubbornly .   i pay for it .  i pay taxes on the income i derive from it .  i adhere to all the common law rulings on taboos .  so i don t quite see of what interest i can be to the government .     oh  you misunderstand me .  it s my fault  i suppose  for not being clearer .  you have committed no crime  broken no laws .  i have only admiration for your journalistic ability .  what i refer to is your editorial attitude at times .     with respect to what .     with respect   said cellioni  with a sudden harshness about his thin lips   to our policy toward the outer worlds .     my editorial attitude represents what i feel and think  mr .  secretary .     i allow this .  you have your right to your feelings and your thoughts .  yet it is injudicious to spread them about nightly to an audience of half a billion .     injudicious  according to you  perhaps .  but legal  according to anybody .     it is sometimes necessary to place good of country above a strict and selfish interpretation of legality .    keilin tapped his foot twice and frowned blackly .    look   he said   put this frankly .  what is it you want .    the secretary of information spread his hands out before       him .   in a word   co operation .  really  mr .  keilin  we can t have you weakening the will of the people .  do you appreciate the position of earth .  six billions  and a declining food supply  .  it is insupportable .  and emigration is the only solution .  no patriotic earthman can fail to see the justice of our position .  no reasonable human being anywhere can fail to see the justice of it .    keilin said   i agree with your premise that the population problem is serious  but emigration is not the only solution .  in fact  emigration is the one sure way of hastening destruction .     really .  and why do you say that .     because the outer worlds will not permit emigration  and you can force their hand by war only .  and we cannot win a war .     tell me   said cellioni softly   have you ever tried emigrating .  it seems to me you could qualify .  you are quite tall  rather light haired  intelligent       the video man flushed .  he said  curtly   i have hay fever .     well   and the secretary smiled   then you must have good reason for disapproving their arbitrary genetic and racist policies .    keilin replied with heat   i won t be influenced by personal motives .  i would disapprove their policies  if i qualified perfectly for emigration .  but my disapproval would alter nothing .  their policies are their policies  and they can enforce them .  moreover  their policies have some reason even if wrong .  mankind is starting again on the outer worlds  and they   the ones who got there first   would like to eliminate some of the flaws of the human mechanism that have become obvious with time .  a hay fever sufferer is a bad egg   genetically .  a cancer prone even more so .  their prejudices against skin and hair colors are  of course  senseless  but i can grant that they are interested in uniformity and homogeneity .  and as for earth  we can do much even without the help of the outer worlds .     for instance  what .     positronic robots and hydroponic farming should be introduced  and   most of all   birth control must be instituted .  an intelligent birth control  that is  based on firm psychiatric principles intended to eliminate the psychotic trends  congenital infirmities        as they do in the outer worlds             not at all .  i have mentioned no racist principles .  i talk only of mental and physical infirmities that are held in common by all ethnic and racial groups .  and most of all  births must be held below deaths until a healthful equilibrium is reached .    cellioni said  grimly   we lack the industrial techniques and the resources to introduce a robot hydroponic technology in anything less than five centuries .  furthermore  the traditions of earth  as well as current ethical beliefs  forbid robot labor and false foods .  most of all  they forbid the slaughter of unborn children .  now  come  keilin  we can t have you pouring this out over video .  it won t work  it distracts the attention  it wakens the will .    keilin broke in  impatiently   mr .  secretary  do you want war .     do i want war .  that is an impudent question .     then  who are the policy makers in the government who do want war .  for instance  who is responsible for the calculated rumor of the pacific project .     the pacific project .  and where did you hear of that .     my sources are my secret .     then  i ll tell you .  you heard of this pacific project from moreanu of aurora on his recent trip to earth .  we know more about you than you suppose  mr .  keilin .     i believe that  but i do not admit that i received information from moreanu .  why do you think i could get information from him .  is it because he was deliberately allowed to learn of this piece of trumpery .    trumpery .     yes .  i think pacific project is a fake .  a fake meant to inspire confidence .  i think the government plans to let the so called secret leak out in order to strengthen its war policy .  it is part of a war of nerves on earth s own people  and it will be the ruin of earth in the end .     and i will take this theory of mine to the people .     you will not  mr .  keilin   said cellioni  quietly .    i will .     mr .  keilin  your friend  ion moreanu is having his troubles on aurora  perhaps for being too friendly with you .  take care that you do not have equal trouble for being too friendly with him .     i m not worried .   the video man laughed shortly  lunged to his feet and strode to the door .        keilin smiled very gently when he found the door blocked by two large men   you mean  i arn under arrest right now .    exactly   said cellioni .   on what charge .    we ll think ot some later .   kelin left   under escort  on aurora  the mirror image of the afore described events was taking place  and on a larger scale .   the foreign agents committee of the gathering had been meeting now for days   ever since the session of the gathering in which ion moreanu and his conservative party made their great bid to force a vote of no confidence .  that it had failed was in part due to the superior political generalship of the independents  and in some part due to the activity of this same foreign agents committee .   for months now  the evidence had been accumulating  and when the vote of confidence turned out to be sizably in favor of the independents  the committee was able to strike in its own way .   moreanu was subpoenaed in his own home  and placed under house arrest .  although this procedure of house arrest was not  under the circumstances  legal   a fact emphatically pointed out by moreanu   it was nevertheless successfully accomplished .   for three days moreanu was cross examined thoroughly  in polite  even tones that scarcely ever veered from unemotional curiosity .  the seven inquisitors of the committee took turns in questioning  but moreanu had respite only for ten minute intervals during the hours in which the committee sat .   after three days  he showed the effects .  he was hoarse with demanding that he be faced with his accusers  weary with insisting that he be informed of the exact nature of the charges  throat broken with shouting against the illegality of the procedure .   the committee finally read statements at him       is this true or not .  is this true or not .    moreanu could merely shake his head wearily as the structure spidered about him .   he challenged the competency of the evidence and was smoothly informed that the proceedings constituted a committee investigation and not a trial           the chairman clapped his gavel  finally .  he was a broad man of tremendous purpose .  he spoke for an hour in his final summing up of the results of the inquiry  but only a relatively short portion of it need be quoted .   he said   if you had merely conspired with others on aurora  we could understand you  even forgive you .  such a fault would have been held in common with many ambitious men in history .  it is not that at all .  what horrifies us and removes all pity is your eagerness to consort with the disease ridden  ignorant and subhuman remnants of earth .    you  the accused  stand here under a heavy weight of evidence showing you to have conspired with the worst elements of earth s mongrel population       the chairman was interrupted by an agonized cry from moreanu   but the motive .  what motive can you possibly attribute       the accused was pulled back into his seat .  the chairman pursed his lips and departed from the slow gravity of his prepared speech to improvise a bit .    it is not   he said   for this committee to go into your motives .  we have shown the facts of the case .  the committee does have evidence      he paused  and looked along the line of the members to the right and the left  then continued .   i think i may say that the committee has evidence that points to your intentions to use earth manpower to engineer a coup that would leave you dictator over aurora .  but since the evidence has not been used  i will go no further into that  except to say that such a consummation is not inconsistent with your character as displayed at these hearings .    he went back to his speech .  those of us who sit here have heard  i think  of something termed the  pacific project   which  according to rumors  represents an attempt on the part of earth to retrieve its lost dominions .    it is needless to emphasize here that any such attempt must be doomed to failure .  and yet defeat for us is not entirely inconceivable .  one thing can cause us to stumble  and that one thing is an unsuspected internal weakness .  genetics is  after all  still an imperfect science .  even with twenty generations behind us  undesirable traits may crop up at scattered points  and each represents a flaw in the steel shield of aurora s strength .    that is the pacific project   the use of our own criminals       and traitors against us  and if they can find such in our inner councils  the earthmen might even succeed .    the foreign agents committee exists to combat that threat .  in the accused  we touch the fringes of the web .  we must go on      the speech did  at any rate .   when it was concluded  moreanu  pale  wide eyed  pounded his fist   i demand my say        the accused may speak   said the chairman .   moreanu rose and looked about him for a long moment .  the room  fitted for an audience of seventy five million by community wave  was unattended .  there were the inquisitors  legal staff  official recorders   and with him  in the actual flesh  his guards .   he would have done better with an audience .  to whom could he otherwise appeal .  his glance fled hopelessly from each face it touched  but could find nothing better .    first   he said   i deny the legality of this meeting .  my constitutional rights of privacy and individuality have been denied .  i have been tried by a group without standing as a court  by individuals convinced  in advance  of my guilt .  i have been denied adequate opportunity to defend myself .  in fact  i have been treated throughout as an already convicted criminal requiring only sentence .    i deny  completely and without reservation  that i have been engaged in any activity detrimental to the state or tending to subvert any of its fundamental institutions .    i accuse  vigorously and unreservedly  this committee of deliberately using its powers to win political battles .  i am guilty not of treason  but of disagreement .  i disagree with a policy dedicated to the destruction of the larger part of the human race for reasons that are trivial and inhumane .    rather than destruction  we owe assistance to these men who are condemned to a harsh  unhappy life solely because it was our ancestors and not theirs who happened to reach the outer worlds first .  with our technology and resources  they can yet re create and redevelop       the chairman s voice rose above the intense near whisper of moreanu   you are out of order .  the committee is quite prepared to hear any remarks you make in your own defense  but a sermon on the rights of earthmen is outside the legitimate realm of the discussion .         the hearings were formally closed .  it was a great political victory for the independents  all would agree to that .  of the members of the committee  only franklin maynard was not completely satisfied .  a small  nagging doubt remained .   he wondered      should he try  one last time .  should he speak once more and then no more to that queer little monkey ambassador from earth .  he made his decision quickly and acted upon it instantly .  only a pause to arrange a witness  since even for himself an unwitnessed private communion with an earthman might be dangerous .   luiz moreno  ambassador to aurora from earth  was  to put not too fine a point on it  a miserable figure of a man .  and that wasn t exactly an accident .  on the whole  the foreign diplomats of earth tended to be dark  short  wizen  or weakly  or all four .   that was only self protection  since the outer worlds exerted strong attraction for any earthman .  diplomats exposed to the allure of aurora  for instance  could not but be exceedingly reluctant to return to earth .  worse  and more dangerous  exposure meant a growing sympathy with the demigods of the stars and a growing alienation from the slum dwellers of earth .   unless  of course  the ambassador found himself rejected .  unless he found himself somewhat despised .  and then  no more faithful servant of earth could be imagined  no man less subject to corruption .   the ambassador to earth was only five foot two  with a bald head and receding forehead  a pinkish affectation of beard and red rimmed eyes .  he was suffering from a slight cold  the occasional results whereof he smothered in a handkerchief .  and yet  withal  he was a man of intellect .   to franklin maynard  the sight and sound of the earthman was distressing .  he grew queasy at each cough and shuddered when the ambassador wiped his nose .   maynard said   your excellency  we commune at my request because i wish to inform you that the gathering has decided to ask your recall by your government .     that is kind of you  councilor .  i had an inkling of this .  and for what reason .     the reason is not within the bounds of discussion .  i believe       it is the prerogative of a sovereign state to decide for itself whether a foreign representative shall be persona grata or not .  nor do i think you really need enlightenment on this matter .     very well  then .   the ambassador paused to wield his handkerchief and murmur an apology .   is that all .    maynard said   not quite .  there are matters i would like to mention .  remain .    the ambassador s reddened nostrils flared a bit  but he smiled  and said   an honor .     your world  excellency   said maynard  superciliously   displays a certain belligerence of late that we on aurora find most annoying and unnecessary .  i trust that you will find your return to earth at this point a convenient opportunity to use your influence against further displays such as recently occurred in new york  where two aurorans were manhandled by a mob .  the payment of an indemnity may not be enough the next time .     but that is emotional overflow  councilor maynard .  surely  you cannot consider youngsters shouting in the streets to be adequate representations of belligerence .     it is backed by your government s actions in many ways .  the recent arrest of mr .  ernest keilin  for instance .     which is a purely domestic affair   said the ambassador  quietly .    but not one to demonstrate a reasonable spirit toward the outer worlds .  keilin was one of the few earthmen who until recently could yet make their voices heard .  he was intelligent enough to realize that no divine right protects the inferior man simply because he is inferior .    the ambassador arose   i am not interested in auroran theories on racial differences .     a moment .  your government may realize that much of their plans have gone awry with the arrest of your agent  moreanu .  stress the fact that we of aurora are much wiser than we have been prior to this arrest .  it may serve to give them pause .     is moreanu my agent .  really  councilor  if i am dis accredited  i shall leave .  but surely the loss of diplomatic immunity does not affect my personal immunity as an honest man from charges of espionage .     isn t that your job .     do aurorans take it for granted that espionage and diplom        acy are identical .  my government will be glad to hear it .  we shall take appropriate precautions .     then  you defend moreanu .  you deny that he has been working for earth .     i defend only myself .  as to moreanu  i am not stupid enough to say anything .     why stupid .    wouldn t a defense by myself be but another indictment against him .  i neither accuse nor defend him .  your government s quarrel with moreanu  like my government s with keilin   whom you  by the way  are most suspiciously eager to defend   is an internal affair .  i will leave now .    the communion broke  and almost instantly the wall faded again .  hijkman was looking thoughtfully at maynard .    what do you think of him .   asked maynard  grimly .    disgraceful that such a travesty of humanity should walk aurora  i think .     i agree with you  and yet .  .  .  and yet        well .     and yet i can almost find myself able to think that he is the master and that we dance to his piping .  you know of moreanu .     of course .    well  he will be convicted  sent to an asteroid .  his party will be broken .  offhand  anyone would say that such actions represent a horrible defeat for earth .     is there doubt in your mind that such is the case .     i m not sure .  committee chairman hond insisted on airing his theory that pacific project was the name earth gave to a device for using internal traitors on the outer worlds .  but i don t think so .  i m not sure the facts fit that .  for instance  where did we get our evidence against moreanu .     i certainly can t say .     our agents  in the first place .  but how did they get it .  the evidence was a little too convincing .  moreanu could have guarded himself better       maynard hesitated .  he seemed to be attempting a blush  and failing .  well  to put it quickly  i think it was the terrestrian ambassador who somehow presented us with the most evidence .  i think that he played on moreanu s sympathy for earth first to befriend him and then to betray him .    why .          i don t know .  to insure war  perhaps   with this pacific project waiting for us .     i don t believe it .     i know .  i have no proof .  nothing but suspicion .  the committee wouldn t believe me either .  it seemed to me  perhaps  that a last talk with the ambassador might reveal something  but his mere appearance antagonizes me  and i find i spend most of my time trying to remove him from my sight .     well  you are becoming emotional  my friend .  it is a disgusting weakness .  i hear that you have been appointed a delegate to the interplanetary gathering at hesperus .  i congratulate you .     thanks   said maynard  absently .   luiz moreno  ex ambassador to aurora  had been glad to return to earth .  he was away from the artificial landscapes that seemed to have no life of their own  but to exist only by virtue of the strong will of their possessors .  away from the too beautiful men and women and from their ubiquitous  brooding robots .   he was back to the hum of life and the shuffle of feet  the brushing of shoulders and the feeling of breath in the face .   not that he was able to enjoy these sensations entirely .  the first days had been spent in lively conferences with the heads of earth s government .   in fact  it was not till nearly a week had passed  that an hour came in which he could consider himself truly relaxed .   he was in the rarest of all appurtenances of terrestrial luxury   a roof garden .  with him was gustav stein  the quite obscure physiologist  who was  nevertheless  one of the prime movers of the plan  known to rumor as the pacific project .    the confirmatory tests   said moreno  with an almost dreadful satisfaction   all check so far  do they not .     so far .  only so far .  we have miles to go .     yet they will continue to go well .  to one who has lived on aurora for nearly a year  as i have  there can be no doubt but that we re on the right track .     um m m  nevertheless  i will go only by the laboratory reports .     and quite rightly .   his little body was almost stiff with gloating .   some day  it will be different .  stein  you have not met these men  these outer worlders .  you may have come       across the tourists  perhaps  in their special hotels  or riding through the streets in inclosed cars  equipped with the purest of private  air conditioned atmospheres for their well bred nostrils  observing the sights through a movable periscope and shuddering away from the touch of an earthman .    but you have not met them on their own world  secure in then  own sickly  rotting greatness .  go  stein  and be despised a while .  go  and find how well you can compete with their own trained lawns as something to be gently trod upon .    and yet  when i pulled the proper cords  ion moreanu fell   ion moreanu  the only man among them with the capacity to understand the workings of another s mind .  it is the crisis that we have passed now .  we front a smooth path now .    satisfaction .  satisfaction .    as for keiliri   he said suddenly  more to himself than to stein   he can be turned loose now .  there s little he can say  hereafter  that can endanger anything .  in fact  i have an idea .  the interplanetary conference opens on hesperus within the month .  he can be sent to report the meeting .  it will be an earnest of our friendliness   and keep him away for the summer .  i think it can be arranged .    it was .   of all the outer worlds  hesperus was the smallest  the latest settled  the furthest from earth .  hence the name .  in a physical sense  it was not best suited to a great diplomatic gathering  since its facilities were small .  for instance  the available community wave network could not possibly be stretched to cover all the delegates  secretarial staff  and administrators necessary in a convocation of fifty planets .  so meetings in person were arranged in buildings impressed for the purpose .   yet there was a symbolism in the choice of meeting place that escaped practically nobody .  hesperus  of all the worlds  was furthest removed from earth .  but the spatial distance  one hundred parsecs or more   was the least of it .  the important point was that hesperus had been colonized not by earthmen  but by men from the outer world of faunus .   it was therefore of the second generation  and so it had no  mother earth .   earth to it was but a vague grandmother  lost in the stars .   as is usual in all such gatherings  little work is actually done on the session floors .  that space is reserved for the official       soundings of whatever is primarily intended for home ears .  the actual swapping and horse trading takes place in the lobbies and at the lunch tables and many of irresolvable conflict has softened over the soup and vanished over the nuts .   and yet particular difficulties were present in this particular case .  not in all worlds was the community wave as paramount and all pervading as it was on aurora  but it was prominent in all .  it was  therefore  with a certain sense of outrage and loss that the tall  dignified men found it necessary to approach one another in the flesh  without the comforting privacy of the invisible wall between  without the warm knowledge of the breakswitch at their fingertips .   they faced one another in uneasy semi embarrassment and tried not to watch one another eat  tried not to shrink at the unmeant touch .  even robot service was rationed .   ernest keilin  the only accredited video representative from earth  was aware of some of these matters only in the vague way they are described here .  a more precise insight he could not have .  nor could anyone brought up in a society where human beings exist only in the plural  and where a house need only be deserted to be feared .   so it was that certain of the most subtle tensions escaped him at the formal dinner party given by the hesperian government during the third week of the conference .  other tensions  however  did not pass him by .   the gathering after the dinner naturally fell apart into little groups .  keilin joined the one that contained franklin may nard of aurora .  as the delegate of the largest of the worlds  he was naturally the most newsworthy .   maynard was speaking casually between sips at the tawny hesperian cocktail in his hand .  if his flesh crawled slightly at the closeness of the others  he masked the feeling masterfully .    earth   he said   is  in essence  helpless against us if we avoid unpredictable military adventures .  economic unity is actually a necessity  if we intend to avoid such adventures .  let earth realize to how great an extent her economy depends upon us  on the things that we alone can supply her  and there will be no more talk of living space .  and if we are united  earth would never dare attack .  she will exchange her barren longings for atomic motors   or not  as she pleases .    and he turned to regard keilin with a certain hauteur as the other found himself stung to comment         but your manufactured goods  councilor   i mean those you ship to earth   they are not given us .  they are exchanged for agricultural products .    maynard smiled silkily .   yes  i believe the delegate from tethys has mentioned that fact at length .  there is a delusion prevalent among some of us that only terrestrial seeds grow properly       he was interrupted calmly by another  who said   now  i am not from tethys  but what you mention is not a delusion .  i grow rye on rhea  and i have never yet been able to duplicate terrestrial bread .  it just hasn t got the same taste .   he addressed the audience in general   in fact  i imported half a dozen terrestrians five years back on agricultural laborer visas so they could oversee the robots .  now  they can do wonders with the land  you know .  where they spit  corn grows fifteen feet high .  well  that helped a little .  and using terrestrian seed helped .  but even if you grow terrestrian grain  its seed won t hold the next year .     has your soil been tested by your government s agricultural department .   asked maynard .   the rhean grew haughty in his turn   no better soil in the sector .  and the rye is top grade .  i even sent a hundredweight down to earth for nutritional clearance  and it came back with full marks .   he rubbed one side of his chin  thoughtfully   it s flavor i m talking about .  doesn t seem to have the right       maynard made an effort to dismiss him   flavor is dispensable temporarily .  they ll be coming to us on our terms  these little men hordes of earth  when they feel the pinch .  we give up only this mysterious flavor  but they will have to give up atom powered engines  farm machinery  and ground cars .  it wouldn t be a bad idea  in fact  to attempt to get along without the terrestrian flavors you are so concerned about .  let us appreciate the flavor of our home grown products instead  which could stand comparison if we gave it a chance .     that so .   the rhean smiled .   i notice you re smoking earth grown tobacco .     a habit i can break if i have to .     probably by giving up smoking .  i wouldn t use outer world tobacco for anything but killing mosquitoes .    he laughed a trifle too boisterously  and left the group .  maynard stared after him  a little pinch nosed .   to keilin  the little byplay over rye and tobacco brought a      certain satisfaction .  he regarded such personalities as the tiny reflection of certain galactopolitical realities .  tethys and rhea were the largest planets in the galactic south  as aurora was the largest in the galactic north .  all three planets were identically racist  identically exclusivist .  their views on earth were similar and completely compatible .  ordinarily  one would think that there was no room to quarrel .   but aurora was the oldest of the outer worlds  the most advanced  the strongest militarily   and  therefore  aspired to a sort of moral leadership of all the worlds .  that was sufficient in itself to arouse opposition  and rhea and tethys served as focal points for those who did not recognize auroran leadership .   keilin was somberly grateful for that situation .  if earth could but lean her weight properly  first in one direction  then in the other  an  ultimate spilt  or even fragmentation      he eyed maynard cautiously  almost furtively  and wondered what effect this would have on the next day s debate .  already  the auroran was more silent than was quite polite .   and then some under secretary or sub official threaded his way through the clusters of guests in finicking fashion  and beckoned to maynard .   keilin s following eyes watched the auroran retreat with the newcomer  watched him listen closely  mouth a startled  what .   that was quite visible to the eye  though too far off to be heard  and then reach for a paper that the other handed mm .   and as a result  the next day s session of the conference went entirely differently than keilin would have predicted .   keilin discovered the details in the evening video casts .  the terrestrian government  it seemed  had sent a note to all the governments attending the conference .  it warned each one bluntly that any agreement among them in military or economic affairs would be considered an unfriendly act against earth and that it would be met with appropriate counter measures .  the note denounced aurora  tethys and rhea all equally .  it accused them of being engaged in an imperialist conspiracy against earth  and so on   and on   and on .   tools .   gritted keilin  all but butting his head against the wall out of sheer chagrin .   fools .  fools .  fools .   and his voice died away still muttering that same  one word .        the next session of the conference was well and early attended by a set of angry delegates who were only too eager to grind into nothingness the disagreements still outstanding .  when it ended  all matters concerning trade between earth and the outer worlds had been placed in the hands of a commission with plenary powers .   not even aurora could have expected so complete and easy a victory  and keilin  on his way back to earth  longed for ms voice to reach the video  so that it could be to others  and not to himself only  that he could shout his disgust .   yet  on earth  some men smiled .   once back on earth  the voice of keilin slowly swirled under and down   lost in the noisier clamor that shouted for action .   his popularity sank in proportion as trade restrictions grew .  slowly  the outer worlds drew the noose tighter .  first  they instituted a strict application of a new system of export licensing .  secondly  they banned the export to earth of all materials capable of being  used in a war effort .   and finally they applied a very broad interpretation indeed of what could be considered usable in such a connection .   imported luxuries   and imported necessities  too  for that matter   vanished or priced themselves upwards out of the reach of all but the very few .   so the people marched  and the voices shouted and the banners swung about in the sunlight  and the stones flew at the consulates      keilin shouted hoarsely and felt as if he were going mad .   until  suddenly  luiz moreno  quite of his own accord  offered to appear on keilin s program and submit to unrestricted questioning in his capacity as ex ambassador to aurora and present secretary without portfolio .   to keilin it had had all the possibilities of a rebirth .  he knew moreno   no fool  he .  with moreno on his program  he was assured an audience as great as his greatest .  with moreno answering questions  certain misapprehensions might be removed  certain confusions might be straightened .  the mere fact that moreno wished to use his   his   program as sounding board might well mean that already a more pliant and sensible foreign policy might have been decided upon .  perhaps maynard was correct  and the pinch was being felt and was       working as predicted .   the list of questions had  of course  been submitted to moreno in advance  but the ex ambassador had indicated that he would answer all of them  and any follow up questions that might seem necessary .   it seemed quite ideal .  too ideal  perhaps  but only a criminal fool could worry over minutiae at this point .   there was an adequate ballyhoo   and when they faced one another across the little table  the red needle that indicated the number of video sets drawing power on that channel hovered well over the two hundred million mark .  and there was an average of   .   listeners per video set .  now the theme  the official introduction .   keilin rubbed his cheek slowly  as he waited for the signal .   then  he began   q .  secretary moreno  the question which interests all earth at the moment  concerns the possibility of war .  suppose we start with that .  do you think there will be war .   a .  if earth is the only planet to be considered  i say  no  definitely not .  in its history  earth has had too much war  and has learned many times over how little can be gained by it .   q .  you say   if earth is the only planet to be considered      do you imply that factors outside our control will bring war .   a .  i do not say  will   but i could say  may .   i cannot  of course speak for the outer worlds .  i cannot pretend to know their motivations and intentions at this critical moment in galactic history .  they may choose war .  i hope not .  if so be that they do  however  we will defend ourselves .  but in any case  we will never attack  we will not strike the first blow .   q .  am i right in saying  then  that in your opinion there are no basic differences between earth and the outer worlds  which cannot be solved by negotiation .   a .  you certainly are .  if the outer worlds were sincerely desirous of a solution  no disagreement between them and us could long exist .   q .  does that include the question of immigration .   a .  definitely .  our own role in the matter is clear and beyond reproach .  as matters stand  two hundred million human beings now occupy ninety five percent of the available land in the universe .  six billions   that is  ninety seven percent of all mankind   are squeezed into the other five percent .  such a situation is obviously unjust and  worse  unstable .  yet earth        in the face of such injustice  has always been willing to treat this problem as soluble by degrees .  it is still so willing .  we should agree to reasonable quotas and reasonable restrictions .  yet the outer worlds have refused to discuss this matter .  over a space of five decades  they have rebuffed all efforts on the part of earth to open negotiations .   q .  if such an attitude on the part of the outer worlds continues  do you then think there will be war .   a .  i cannot believe that this attitude will continue .  our government will not cease hoping that the outer worlds will eventually reconsider their stand on the matter  that their sense of justice and right is not dead  but only sleeping .   q .  mr .  secretary  let us pass on to another subject .  do you think that the united worlds commission set up by the outer worlds recently to control trade with earth represents a danger to peace .   a .  in the sense that its actions indicate a desire on the part of the outer worlds to isolate earth  and to weaken it economically  i can say that it does .   q .  to what actions do you refer  sir .   a .  to its actions in restricting interstellar trade with earth to the point where  in credit values  the total stands now at least than ten percent of what it did three months ago .   q .  but do such restrictions really represent an economic danger to earth .  for instance  it is not true that trade with the outer worlds represents an almost insignificant part of total terrestrian trade .  and is it not true that the importations from the outer worlds reach only a tiny minority of the population at best .   a .  your questions now are representative of a profound fallacy which is very common among our isolationists .  in credit values  it is true that interstellar trade represents only five percent of our total trade  but ninety five percent of our atomic engines are imported .  eighty percent of our thorium  sixty five percent of our cesium  sixty percent of our molybdenum and tin are imported .  the list can be extended almost indefinitely  and it is quite easy to see that the five percent is an extremely important  a vital  five percent .  furthermore  if a large manufacturer receives a shipment of atomic steel shapers from rhea  it does not follow that the benefit redounds only to him .  every man on earth who uses steel implements or objects manufactured by steel implements benefits .        q .  but is it not true that the current restrictions on earth s interstellar trade have cut our grain and cattle exports to almost nothing .  and far from harming earth  isn t this really a boon to our own hungry people .   a  this is another serious fallacy .  that earth s good food supply is tragically inadequate is true .  the government would be the last to deny it .  but our food exports do not represent any serious drain upon this supply .  less than one fifth of one percent of earth s food is exported  and in return we obtain  for instance  fertilizers and farm machinery which more than make up for that small loss by increasing agricultural efficiency .  therefore  by buying less food from us  the outer worlds are engaged  in effect  in cutting our already inadequate food supply .   q .  are you ready to admit  then  secretary moreno  that at least part of the blame for this situation should rest with earth itself .  in other words  we come to my next question  was it not a diplomatic blunder of the first magnitude for the government to issue its inflammatory note denouncing the intentions of the outer worlds before those intentions had been made clear at the interplanetary conference .   a .  i think those intentions were quite clear at the time .   q .  i beg pardon  sir  but i was at the conference .  at the time the note was issued  there was almost a stalemate among the outer world delegates .  those of rhea and tethys strongly opposed economic action against earth  and there was considerable chance that aurora and its block might have been defeated .  earth s note ended that possibility instantly .   a .  well  what is your question  mr .  keilin .   q .  in view of my statements  do you or do you not think earth s note to have been a criminal error of diplomacy which can now be made up only by a policy of intelligent conciliation .   a .  you use strong language .  however  i cannot answer the question directly  since i do not agree with your major premise .  i cannot believe that the delegates of the outer worlds could behave in the manner you describe .  in the first place  it is well known that the outer worlds are proud of their boast that the percentage of insanity  psychoses and even relatively minor maladjustments of personality are almost at the vanishing point in their society .  it is one of their strongest arguments against earth  that we have more psychiatrists than plumbers       and yet are more pinched for want of the former .  the delegates to the conference represented the best of this so stable society .  and now you would have me believe that these demigods would  in a moment of pique  have reversed their opinions and instituted a major change in the economic policy of fifty worlds .  i cannot believe them capable of such childish and perverse activity  and must therefore insist that any action they took was based not upon any note from earth  but upon motivations that go deeper .   q .  but i saw the effect upon them with my own eyes  sir .  remember  they were being scolded in what they considered to be insolent language from an inferior people .  there can be no doubt  sir  that as a whole  the men of the outer worlds are a remarkably stable people  despite your sarcasm  but their attitude toward earth represents a weak point in this stability .   a .  are you asking me questions  or are you defending the racist views and policies of the outer worlds .   q .  well  accepting your viewpoint that earth s note did no harm  what good could it have done .  why should it have been sent .   a .  i think we were justified in presenting our side of the question before the bar of galactic public opinion .  i believe we have exhausted the subject .  what is your next question  please .  it is the last  isn t it .   q .  it is .  it has recently been reported that the terrestrian government will take stern measures against those dealing in smuggling operations .  is this consistent with the government s view that lowered trade relations are detrimental to earth s welfare .   a .  our primary concern is peace  and not our own immediate welfare .  the outer worlds have adopted certain trade restrictions .  we disapprove of them  and consider them a great injustice .  nevertheless  we shall adhere to them  so that no planet may say that we have given the slightest pretext for hostilities .  for instance  i am privileged to announce here for the first time that in the past month  five ships  traveling under false earth registry  were stopped while being engaged in the smuggling of outer world materiel into earth .  their goods were confiscated and their personnel imprisoned .  this is an earnest of our good intentions .   q .  outer world ships .   a .  yes .  but traveling under false earth registry  remember .        q .  and the men imprisoned are citizens of the outer worlds .   a .  i believe so .  however  they were breaking not only our laws  but those of the outer worlds as well  and therefore doubly forfeited their interplanetary rights .  i think the interview had better close  now .   q .  but this      it was at this point that the broadcast came to a sudden end .  the conclusion of keilin s last sentence was never heard by anyone but moreno .  it ended like this      means war .    but luiz moreno was no longer on the air .  so as he drew on his gloves  he smiled and  with infinite meaning  shrugged his shoulders in a little gesture of indifference .   there were no witnesses to that shrug .   the gathering at aurora was still in session .  franklin may nard had dropped out for the moment in utter weariness .  he faced his son  whom he now saw for the first time in naval uniform .    at least you re sure of what will happen  aren t you .    in the young man s response  there was no weariness at all  no apprehension  nothing but utter satisfaction .   this is it  dad .     nothing bothers you  then .  you don t think we ve been maneuvered into this .     who cares if we have .  it s earth s funeral .    maynard shook his head   but you realize that we ve been put in the wrong .  the outer world citizens they hold are lawbreakers .  earth is within its rights .    his son frowned   i hope you re not going to make statements like that to the gathering  dad .  i don t see that earth is justified at all .  all right  what if smuggling was going on .  it was just because some outer worlders are willing to pay black market prices for terrestrial food .  if earth had any sense  she could look the other way  and everyone would benefit .  she makes enough noise about how she needs our trade  so why doesn t she do something about it .  anyway  i don t see that we ought to leave any good aurorans or other outer worlders in the hands of those apemen .  since they won t give them up  we ll make them .  otherwise  none of us will be safe next time .     i see that you ve adopted the popular opinions  anyway .          the opinions are my own .  if they re popular opinion also  it s because they make sense .  earth wants a war .  well  they ll get it .     but why do they want a war  eh .  why do they force our hands .  our entire economic policy of the past months was only intended to force a change in their attitude without war .    he was talking to himself  but his son answered with the final argument   i don t care why they wanted war .  they ve got it now  and we re going to smash them .    maynard returned to the gathering  but even as the drone of debate re filled the room  he thought  with a twinge  that there would be no terrestrian alfalfa that year .  he regretted the milk .  in fact  even the beef seemed  somehow  to be just a little less savory      the vote came in the early hours of the morning .  aurora declared war .  most of the worlds of the aurora bloc joined it by dawn .   in the history books  the war was later known as the three weeks  war .  in the first week  auroran forces occupied several of the trans plutonian asteroids  and at the beginning of the third week  the bulk of earth s home fleet was all but completely destroyed in a battle within the orbit of saturn by an aurora fleet not one quarter its size  numerically .   declarations of war from the outer worlds yet neutral followed like the pop pop of a string of firecrackers .   on the twenty first day of the war  lacking two hours  earth surrendered .   the negotiations of peace terms took place among the outer worlds .  earth s activities were concerned with signing only .  the conditions of peace were unusual  perhaps unique  and under the force of an unprecedented humiliation  all the hordes of earth seemed suddenly struck with a silence that came from a shamed anger too strong for words .   the terms mentioned were perhaps best commented upon by a voice on the auroran video two days after they were made public .  it can be quoted in part     .  .  .  there is nothing in or on earth that we of the outer worlds can need or want .  all that was ever worthwhile on earth left it centuries ago in the persons of our ancestors .    they call us the children of mother earth  but that is not       so  for we are the descendants of a mother earth that no longer exists  a mother that we brought with us .  the earth of today bears us at best a cousinly relation .  no more .    do we want their resources .  why  they have none for themselves .  can we use their industry or science .  they are almost dead for lack of ours .  can we use their man power .  ten of them are not worth a single robot .  do we even want the dubious glory of ruling them .  there is no such glory .  as our helpless and incompetent inferiors  they would be only a drag upon us .  they would divert from our own use food  labor and administrative ability .    so they have nothing to give us but the space they occupy in our thought .  they have nothing to free us from but themselves .  they cannot benefit us in any way other than in their absence .    it is for that reason that the peace terms have been defined as they have been .  we wish them no harm  so let them have their own solar system .  let them live there in peace .  let them mold their own destiny in their own way  and we will not disturb them there by even the least hint of our presence .  but we in turn want peace .  we in turn would guide our own future in our own way .  so we do not want their presence .  and with that end in view  an outer world fleet will patrol the boundaries of their system  outer world bases will be established on their outermost asteroids  so that we may make sure they do not intrude on our territory .    there will be no trade  no diplomatic relationships  no travel  no communications .  they are fenced off  locked out  hermetically sealed away .  out here we have a new universe  a second creation of man  a higher man      they ask us  what will become of earth .  we answer  that is earth s problem .  population growth can be controlled .  resources can be efficiently exploited .  economic systems can be revised .  we know  for we have done so .  if they cannot  let them go the way of the dinosaur  and make room .    let them make room  instead of forever demanding room .    and so an impenetrable curtain swung slowly shut about the solar system .  the stars in earth s sky became only stars again  as in the long dead days before the first ship had penetrated the barrier of light s speed .   the government that had made war and peace resigned  but       there was no one  really  to take their place .  the legislature elected luiz moreno   ex ambassador to aurora  ex secretary without portfolio   as president pro tem  and the earth as a whole was too numbed to agree or disagree .  there was only a widespread relief that someone existed who would be willing to take the job of trying to guide the destinies of a world in prison .   very few realized how well planned an ending this was  or with what calculation moreno found himself in the president s chair .   ernest keilin said hopelessly from the video screen   we are only ourselves now .  for us  there is no universe and no past   only earth  and the future .    that night he heard from luiz moreno once again  and before morning he left for the capital .   moreno s presence seemed incongruent within the stiffly formal president s mansion .  he was suffering from a cold again  and snuffled when he talked .   keilin regarded him with a self terrifying hostility  an almost singeing hatred in which he could feel his fingers begin to twitch in the first gestures of choking .  perhaps he shouldn t have come    well  what was the difference  the orders had been plain .  if he had not come  he would have been brought .   the new president looked at him sharply   you have to alter your attitude toward me  keilin  i know you regard me as one of the gravediggers of earth   isn t that the phrase you used last night .    but you must listen to me quietly for a while .  in your present state of suppressed rage  i doubt if you could hear me .     i will hear whatever you have to say  mr .  president .     well   the external amenities  at least .  that s hopeful .  or do you think a video tracer is attached to the room .    keilin merely lifted his eyebrows .   moreno said   it isn t .  we are quite alone .  we must be alone  otherwise  how could i tell you safely that it is being arranged for you to be elected president under a constitution now being devised .  eh  what s the matter .    then he grinned at the look of bloodless amazement in kei lin s face .   oh  you don t believe it .  well  it s past your stopping .  and before an hour is up  you ll understand .          i m to be president .   keilia struggled with a strange  hoarse voice .  then  more firmly   you are mad .     no .  not i .  those out there  rather .  out there in the outer worlds .   there was a sudden vicious intensity in moreno s eyes  and face  and voice  so that you forgot he was a little monkey of a man with a perpetual cold .  you didn t notice the wrinkled  sloping forehead .  you forgot the baldish head and ill fitting clothes .  there was only the bright and luminous look in his eyes  and the hard incision in his voice .  that you noticed .   keilin reached blindly backward for a chair  as moreno came closer and spoke with increasing intensity .    yes   said moreno .   those out among the stars .  the godlike ones .  the stately supermen .  the strong  handsome master race .  they are mad .  but only we on earth know it .    come  you have heard of the pacific project .  i know you have .  you denounced it to cellioni once  and called it a fake .  but it isn t a fake .  and almost none of it is a secret .  in fact  the only secret about it was that almost none of it was a secret .    you re no fool  keilin .  you just never stopped to work it all out .  and yet you were on the track .  you had the feel of it .  what was it you said that time you were interviewing me on the program .  something about the attitude of the outer worldling toward the earthman being the only flaw in the former s stability .  that was it  wasn t it .  or something like that .  very well  then  good .  you had the first third of the pacific project in your mind at the time  and it was no secret after all  was it .    ask yourself  keilin   what was the attitude of the typical auroran to a typical earthman .  a feeling of superiority .  that s the first thought  i suppose .  but  tell me  keih n  if he really felt superior  really superior  would it be so necessary for him to call such continuous attention to it .  what kind of superiority is it that must be continuously bolstered by the constant repetition of phrases such as  apemen    submen    half animals of earth   and so on .  that is not the calm internal assurance of superiority .  do you waste epithets on earthworms .  no  there is something else there .    or let us approach it from another tack .  why do outer world tourists stay in special hotels  travel in inclosed ground cars  and have rigid  if unwritten  rules against social intermingling .  are they afraid of pollution .  strange  then  that they are not afraid to eat our food and drink our wine and       smoke our tobacco .    you see  keilin  there are no psychiatrists on the outer worlds .  the supermen are  so they say  too well adjusted .  but here on earth  as the proverb goes  there are more psychiatrists than plumbers  and they get lots of practice .  so it is we  and not they  who know the truth about this outer world superiority complex  who know it to be simply a wild reaction against an overwhelming feeling of guilt .    don t you think that can be so .  you shake your head as though you disagree .  you don t see that a handful of men who clutch a galaxy while billions starve for lack of room must feel a subconscious guilt  no matter what .  and  since they won t share the loot  don t you see that the only way they can justify themselves is to try to convince themselves that earth men  after all  are inferior  that they do not deserve the galaxy  that a new race of men have been created out there and that we here are only the diseased remnants of an old race that should die out like the dinosaur  through the working of inexorable natural laws .    ah  if they could only convince themselves of that  they would no longer be guilty  but merely superior .  only  it doesn t work  it never does .  it requires constant bolstering  constant repetition  constant reinforcement .  and still it doesn t quite convince .    best of all  if only they could pretend that earth and its population do not exist at all .  when you visit earth  therefore  avoid earthmen  or they might make you uncomfortable by not looking inferior enough .  sometimes they might look miserable instead  and nothing more .  or worse still  they might even seem intelligent   as i did  for instance  on aurora .    occasionally  an outer worlder like moreanu did crop up  and was able to recognize guilt for what it was without being afraid to say so out loud .  he spoke of the duty the outer worlds owed earth   and so he was dangerous to us .  for if the others listened to him and had offered token assistance to earth  their guilt might have been assuaged in their own minds  and that without any lasting help to earth .  so moreanu was removed through our web weaving  and the way left clear to those who were unbending  who refused to admit guilt  and whose reaction could therefore be predicted and manipulated .    send them an arrogant note  for instance  and they automatically strike back with a useless embargo that merely gives       us the ideal pretext for war .  then lose a war quickly  and you are sealed off by the annoyed supermen .  no communication  no contact .  you no longer exist to annoy them .  isn t that simple .  didn t it work out nicely .    keilin finally found his voice  because moreno gave him time by stopping .  hd said   you mean that all thjs was planned .  you did deliberately instigate the war for the purpose of sealing earth off from the galaxy .  you sent out the men of the home fleet to sure death because you wanted defeat .  why  you re a monster  a  .  .  .  a       moreno frowned   please relax .  it was not as simple as you think  and i am not a monster .  do you think the war could simply be   instigated .  it had to be nurtured gently in just the right way and to just the right conclusion .  if we had made the first move  if we had been the aggressor  if we had in any way put the fault on our side   why  they of the outer worlds would have occupied earth and ground it under .  they would no longer feel guilty  you see  if we committed a crime against them .  or  again  if we fought a protracted war  or one in which we inflicted damage  they could succeed in shifting the blame .    but we didn t .  we merely imprisoned auroran smugglers  and were obviously within our rights .  they had to go to war over it because only so could they protect their superiority  which in turn protected them against the horrors of guilt .  and we lost quickly .  scarcely an auroran died .  the guilt grew deeper and resulted in exactly the peace treaty our psychiatrists had predicted .    and as for sending men out to die  that is a commonplace in every war   and a necessity .  it was necessary to fight a battle  and  naturally  there were casualties .     but why .   interrupted keilin  wildly .   why .  why .  why does all this gibberish seem to make sense to you .  what have we gained .  what can we possibly gain out of the present situation .     gained  man .  you ask what we ve gained .  why  we ve gained the universe .  what has held us back so far .  you know what earth has needed these last centuries .  you yourself once outlined it forcefully to cellioni .  we need a positronic robot society and an atomic power technology .  we need chemical farming and we need population control .  well  what s prevented that  eh .  only the customs of centuries which said       robots were evil since they deprived human beings of jobs  that population control was merely the murder of unborn children  and so on .  and worse  there was always the safety valve of emigration either actual or hoped for .    but now we cannot emigrate .  we re stuck here .  worse than that  we have been humiliatingly defeated by a handful of men out in the stars  and we ve had a humiliating treaty of peace forced upon us .  what earthman wouldn t subconsciously burn for revenge .  self preservation has frequently knuckled under to that tremendous yearning to  get even .     and that is the second third of the pacific project  the recognition of the revenge motive .  as simple as that .    and how can we know that this is really so .  why  it has been demonstrated in history scores of times .  defeat a nation  but don t crush it entirely  and in a generation or two or three it will be stronger than it was before .  why .  because in the interval  sacrifices will have been made for revenge that would not have been made for mere conquest .    think .  rome beat carthage rather easily the first time  but was almost defeated the second .  every time napoleon defeated the europen coalition  he laid the groundwork for another just a little bit harder to defeat  until he himself was crushed by the eighth .  it took four years to defeat wilhelm of medieval germany  and six much more dangerous years to stop his successor  hitler .    there you are .  until now  earth needed to change its way of life only for greater comfort and happiness .  a minor item like that could always wait .  but now it must change for revenge  and that will not wait .  and i want that change for its own sake .    only   i am not the man to lead .  i am tarred with the failure of yesteryear  and will remain so until  long after i am bone dust  earth learns the truth .  but you  .  .  .  you  and others like you  have always fought for the road to modernization .  you will be in charge .  it may take a hundred years .  grandchildren of men unborn may be the first to see its completion .  but at least you will see the start .    eh  what do you say .    keilin was fumbling at the dream .  he seemed to see it in a misty distance   a new and reborn earth .  but the change in attitude was too extreme .  it could not be done just yet  he shook his head .        he said   what makes you think the outer worlds would allow such a change  supposing what you say to be true .  they will be watching  i am sure  and they will detect a growing danger and put a stop to it .  can you deny that .    moreno threw his head back and laughed noiselessly .  he gasped out   but we have still a third left of the pacific project  a last  subtle and ironic third       the outer worlders call the men of earth the subhuman dregs of a great race  but we are the men of earth .  do you realize what that means .  we live on a planet upon which  for a billion years  life   the life that has culminated in mankind  has been adapting itself .  there is not a microscopic part of man  not a tiny working of his mind  that has not as its reason some tiny facet of the physical make up of earth  or of the biological make up of earth s other life forms  or of the sociological make up of the society about him .    no other planet can substitute for earth  in man s present shape .    the outer worlders exist as they do  only because pieces of earth have been transplanted .  soil has been brought out there  plants  animals  men .  they keep themselves surrounded by an artificial earth born geology which has within it  for instance  those traces of cobalt  zinc and copper which human chemistry must have .  they surround thmselves by earth born bacteria and algae which have the ability to make those inorganic traces available in just the right way and in just the right quantity .    and they maintain that situation by continued imports  luxury imports  they call it   from earth .    but on the outer worlds  even with terrestrian soil laid down to bedrock  they cannot keep rain from falling and rivers from flowing  so that there is an inevitable  if slow  admixture with the native soil  an inevitable contamination of terrestrian soil bacteria with the native bacteria  and an exposure  in any case  to a different atmosphere and to solar radiations of different types .  terrestrian bacteria disappear or change .  and then plant life changes .  and then animal life .    no great change  mind you .  plant life would not become poisonous or nonnutritious in a day  or year  or decade .  but already  the men of the outer worlds can detect the loss or change of the trace compounds that are responsible for that infinitely elusive thing we call  flavor .   it has gone that far .    and it will go further .  do you know  for instance  that on       aurora  nearly one half the native bacterial species known have protoplasm based on the fluorocarbon rather than hydrocarbon chemistry .  can you imagine the essential foreignness of such an environment .    well  for two decades now  the bacteriologists and physiologists of earth have studied various forms of outer world life   the only portion of the pacific project that has been truly secret   and the transplanted terrestrian life is akeady beginning to show certain changes on the subcellular level .  even among the humans    and here is the irony .  the outer worlders  by their rigid racism and unbending genetic policies are consistently eliminating from among themselves any children that show signs of adapting themselves to their respective planets in any way that departs from the norm .  they are maintaining   they must maintain as a result of their own thought processes   an artificial criterion of  healthy  humanity  which is based on terrestrian chemistry and not their own .    but now that earth has been cut off from them  now that not even a trickle of terrestrian soil and life will reach them  change will be piled on change .  sicknesses will come  mortality will increase  child abnormalities will become more frequent        and then .   asked keilin  suddenly caught up .    and then .  well  they are physical scientists   leaving such inferior sciences as biology to us .  and they cannot abandon their sensation of superiority and their arbitrary standard of human perfection .  they will never detect the change till it is too late to fight it .  not all mutations are clearly visible  and there will be an increasing revolt against the mores of those stiff outer world societies .  there will be a century of increasing physical and social turmoil which will prevent any interference on their part with us .    we will have a century of rebuilding and revitalization  and at the end of it  we shall face an outer galaxy which will either be dying or changed .  in the first case  we will build a second terrestrian empire  more wisely and with greater knowledge than we did the first  one based on a strong and modernized earth .    in the second case  we will face perhaps ten  twenty  or even all fifty outer worlds  each with a slightly different variety of man .  fifty humanoid species  no longer united against us  each increasingly adapted to its own planet  each with a suffi        cient tendency toward atavism to love earth  to regard it as the great and original mother .    and racism will be dead  for variety will then be the great fact of humanity  and not uniformity .  each type of man will have a world of its own  for which no other world could quite substitute  and on which no other type could live quite as well .  and other worlds can be settled to breed still newer varieties  until out of the grand intellectual mixture  mother earth will finally have given birth not to merely a terrestrian  but to a galactic empire .    keilin said  fascinated   you foresee all this so certainly .     nothing is truly certain  but the best minds on earth agree on this .  there may be unforeseen stumbling blocks on the way  but to remove those will be the adventure of our great grandchildren .  of our adventure  one phase has been successfully concluded  and another phase is beginning .  join us  keilin .    slowly  keilin began to think that perhaps moreno was not a monster after all      the end  what interests me roost about  mother earth  is that it seems to show clear premonitions of the novels caves of steel and the naked sun  which i was to write in the     s .   one thing about the story that i can t explain is the fact that i have two characters in it  one of whom is named moreno and one moreanu .  i haven t the slightest idea why i used such similiar names .  there was no significance in it  i assure you  only carelessness .  there was also a maynard .   somehow  in reading and rereading the manuscript  the sloppiness of the situation never struck me .  it did  however  just as soon as i saw the story in print .  why campbell didn t notice and make me change the names  i haven t the faintest idea .   i had no sooner sold  mother earth  than i began a new  foundation  story entitled   .  .  .  and now you don t .   it was to be the last .  like the mule   it was fifty thousand words long  and i didn t finish it till march          .  i submitted it to campbell the next day and he took it at once .  at two cents a word  it netted me a check for one thousand dollars  the first four figure check i ever received .   it appeared as a three part serial in the november             december      and january      issues of astounding  and it made up the final two thirds of my book second foundation .   by then  though  a great change was coming over the field of science fiction .  the atom bomb had altered science fiction from a disregarded field of crazy stories into a literature of dreadful perception .  slowly  it was mounting in readership and esteem .  new magazines were about to come into being  and the large publishing houses were about to consider putting out regular lines of hardback science fiction novels  hitherto the domain of small specialty houses no more affluent than the magazines and no more hopeful as a source of income  .   the matter of hardback novels was of particular interest to doubleday   company  inc .   though  of course  i didn t know it at the time  .  on february          while i was working on the last of the  foundation  stories  i attended a meeting of the hydra club   a group of science fiction professionals who lived in new york .  there i met a doubleday editor  walter i .  bradbury  for the first time .  it was he who was trying to build up a science fiction line for doubleday  and he expressed some interest in the mule .    i paid little attention to this  however .  the thought of publishing a book  a real book  as opposed to magazine stories  was so outlandish that i simply couldn t cram it into my head .   but fred pohl could .  he had been in the army  serving in italy and rising to the rank of sergeant .  after discharge  he became an agent again .  i had indignantly told him the story of merwin s rejection of  grow old with me   so when bradbury continued searching  pohl suggested to him that he look at that story of mine .   bradbury was interested and  after considerable trouble  pohl managed to pry the story out of me .    it s no good   i kept saying     having never really recovered from the double rejection .    but on march           i received the word that bradbury wanted  grow old with me  if i would expand it to seventy thousand words .  what s more  he paid me a      option  which i could keep even if the revision was unsatisfactory .  that was the first time anyone had paid me anything in advance  and i was flabbergasted .   on april    i began the revision  and on may           i finished it and retitled it pebble in the sky .  on may          doubleday accepted it  and i had to grasp the fact that i was going to have a book published .   but even as i struggled with that  another change was taking place simultaneously .   there was still the matter of a job .  all the time i was working for professor elderfleld  i was still searching for one that i could take after that temporary position reached its natural end in may      .  i was having no success at all .   but then  on january           professor william c .  boyd of boston university school of medicine was visiting new york  and we met .   professor boyd was a science fiction reader of long standing and had liked my stories .  for a couple of years we had been corresponding and we had grown quite friendly .  now he told me that there was an opening in the biochemistry department at his school and would i be interested .  i was interested  of course  but boston is twice as far from new york as philadelphia is  and i hated to leave new york again .   i refused the offer  but not very hard .   and i continued to look for a job  and i continued to fail .   i therefore reconsidered my refusal of the position at boston university school of medicine and wrote a letter to professor boyd  saying that perhaps i might be interested  after all .   on march          i traveled to boston for the first time in my life  on a sleeper   but i didn t sleep  .  i met professor burnham s .  walker  head of the department of biochemistry  the next day and he offered me a position on the faculty at five thousand per year .  i saw no way out of my jobless dilemma but to accept .   did i have to .  was there no chance that i might have made my living as a writer .   how could i honestly come to a decision that i could .  in mid       i had been writing for exactly eleven years .  in all that time  my total earnings had come to        .     averaging a little over      per year  or     .    per week .  in my better years  such as the seventh  mid      to mid       when i had sold four stories  including  the mule    i had earned         and in the tenth and eleventh together i had earned        .  it looked as though  even in good years  i could not count on much more than thirty dollars per week  and that just wasn t enough .        of course  now that i was going to be publishing a book     but books were unknown quantities .  besides  the book sale had come too late .  by the time bradbury accepted pebble in the sky  i was committed to the new job  and two days later  on june          i left for boston .   it is at this point i must come to a halt  for the multiple changes put a final end to the first stage of my writing career .   i had left campbell  this time forever .  oh  i saw him occasionally  and we corresponded  but the steady drizzle of near weekly visits was never to take place again .  though i wrote for him and continued to publish in astounding  new magazines appeared  including the magazine of fantasy and science fiction in       galaxy science fiction in       and others .  my market broadened  and the word rate went up still further  to three cents and even four cents a word .   the appearance of my first book  pebble in the sky  on january           introduced a new dimension to my self image  to my prestige in the field and to my earnings .  other books followed   some new novels  some collections of older stories .   my position at boston university school of medicine led me to publish non fiction .  the first attempt was a textbook for medical students called biochemistry and human metabolism .  this was begun in      in collaboration with professors walker and boyd .  it went through three editions and  though rather a failure  allowed me to discover that i enjoyed non fiction writing at least as much as fiction writing and helped me start on a new phase of my writing career .   with all this taken into account  it is not surprising that my earnings as a writer began to rise rapidly almost as soon as i came to boston .  by      i was making considerably more money as a writer than as a professor  and the discrepancy grew larger   in favor of writing   each succeeding year .  by       i d decided  still somewhat to my surprise  that i had been a writer all along and that that was all i was .   on july           gave up my salary and my duties but  with the agreement of the school  kept my title  which was then associate professor of biochemistry .  i keep that title to this day .  i give an occasional lecture at the school when asked to do so  and i also lecture elsewhere when asked to do so  and       charge a fee  .  for the rest  i became a full time free lance writer .   writing is easy now  and is ever more satisfying .  i keep what amounts to a seventy hour week  if you count all the ancillary jobs of proofreading  indexing  research and so on .  i average seven or eight books a year  and this book  the early asimov  is my    th book .   and yet  i must admit there has never been  since       anything like the real excitement of those first eleven  campbell years   when i wrote only in my spare time  and sometimes not even then  when every submission meant unbearable suspense  when every rejection meant misery and every acceptance ecstasy  and every fifty dollar check was the wealth of croesus .   and on july           john campbell  at the still early age of sixty one  while watching television  died at   .    p . m .  quietly and peacefully  without any pain at all .   there is no way at all to express how much he meant to me and how much he did for me except  perhaps  to write these books evoking  once more  those days of a quarter century ago .      appendix the sixty stories of the campbell years  story  words   magazine issue  collection    .  cosmic corkscrew                      .  the callistan menace
