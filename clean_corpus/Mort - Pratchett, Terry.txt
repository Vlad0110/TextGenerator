begin reading     this is the bright candlelit room where the life timers are stored   shelf upon shelf of them  squat hourglasses  one for every living person  pouring their fine sand from the future into the past .  the accumulated hiss of the falling grains makes the room roar like the sea .   this is the owner of the room  stalking through it with a preoccupied air .  his name is death .   but not any death .  this is the death whose particular sphere of operations is  well  not a sphere at all  but the discworld  which is flat and rides on the back of four giant elephants who stand on the shell of the enormous star turtle great a   tuin  and which is bounded by a waterfall that cascades endlessly into space .   scientists have calculated that the chance of anything so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one .   but magicians have calculated that million to one chances crop up nine times out of ten .   death clicks across the black and white tiled floor on toes of bone  muttering inside his cowl as his skeletal fingers count along the rows of busy hourglasses .   finally he finds one that seems to satisfy him  lifts it carefully from its shelf and carries it across to the nearest candle .  he holds it so that the light glints off it  and stares at the little point of reflected brilliance .   the steady gaze from those twinkling eye sockets encompasses the world turtle  sculling through the deeps of space  carapace scarred by comets and pitted by meteors .  one day even great a   tuin will die  death knows  now  that would be a challenge .   but the focus of his gaze dives onwards towards the blue green magnificence of the disc itself  turning slowly under its tiny orbiting sun .   now it curves away towards the great mountain range called the ramtops .  the ramtops are full of deep valleys and unexpected crags and considerably more geography than they know what to do with .  they have their own peculiar weather  full of shrapnel rain and whiplash winds and permanent thunderstorms .  some people say it   s all because the ramtops are the home of old  wild magic .  mind you  some people will say anything .   death blinks  adjusts for depth of vision .  now he sees the grassy country on the turnwise slopes of the mountains .   now he sees a particular hillside .   now he sees a field .   now he sees a boy  running .   now he watches .   now  in a voice like lead slabs being dropped on granite  he says  yes .       there was no doubt that there was something magical in the soil of that hilly  broken area which   because of the strange tint that it gave to the local flora   was known as the octarine grass country .  for example  it was one of the few places on the disc where plants produced reannual varieties .   reannuals are plants that grow backwards in time .  you sow the seed this year and they grow last year .   mort   s family specialized in distilling the wine from reannual grapes .  these were very powerful and much sought after by fortune tellers  since of course they enabled them to see the future .  the only snag was that you got the hangover the morning before  and had to drink a lot to get over it .   reannual growers tended to be big  serious men  much given to introspection and close examination of the calendar .  a farmer who neglects to sow ordinary seeds only loses the crop  whereas anyone who forgets to sow seeds of a crop that has already been harvested twelve months before risks disturbing the entire fabric of causality  not to mention acute embarrassment .   it was also acutely embarrassing to mort   s family that the youngest son was not at all serious and had about the same talent for horticulture that you would find in a dead starfish .  it wasn   t that he was unhelpful  but he had the kind of vague  cheerful helpfulness that serious men soon learn to dread .  there was something infectious  possibly even fatal  about it .  he was tall  red haired and freckled  with the sort of body that seems to be only marginally under its owner   s control  it appeared to have been built out of knees .   on this particular day it was hurtling across the high fields  waving its hands and yelling .   mort   s father and uncle watched it disconsolately from the stone wall .      what i don   t understand     said father lezek     is that the birds don   t even fly away .  i   d fly away  if i saw it coming towards me .         ah .  the human body   s a wonderful thing .  i mean  his legs go all over the place but there   s a fair turn of speed there .      mort reached the end of a furrow .  an overfull woodpigeon lurched slowly out of his way .      his heart   s in the right place  mind     said lezek  carefully .      ah .     course     tis the rest of him that isn   t .         he   s clean about the house .  doesn   t eat much     said lezek .      no  i can see that .      lezek looked sideways at his brother  who was staring fixedly at the sky .      i did hear you   d got a place going up at your farm  hamesh     he said .      ah .  got an apprentice in  didn   t i .         ah     said lezek gloomily     when was that  then .         yesterday     said his brother  lying with rattlesnake speed .     all signed and sealed .  sorry .  look  i got nothing against young mort  see  he   s as nice a boy as you could wish to meet  it   s just that           i know  i know     said lezek .     he couldn   t find his arse with both hands .      they stared at the distant figure .  it had fallen over .  some pigeons had waddled over to inspect it .      he   s not stupid  mind     said hamesh .     not what you   d call stupid .         there   s a brain there all right     lezek conceded .     sometimes he starts thinking so hard you has to hit him round the head to get his attention .  his granny taught him to read  see .  i reckon it overheated his mind .      mort had got up and tripped over his robe .      you ought to set him to a trade     said hamesh  reflectively .     the priesthood  maybe .  or wizardry .  they do a lot of reading  wizards .      they looked at each other .  into both their minds stole an inkling of what mort might be capable of if he got his well meaning hands on a book of magic .      all right     said hamesh hurriedly .     something else  then .  there must be lots of things he could turn his hand to .         he starts thinking too much  that   s the trouble     said lezek .     look at him now .  you don   t think about how to scare birds  you just does it .  a normal boy  i mean .      hamesh scratched his chin thoughtfully .      it could be someone else   s problem     he said .   lezek   s expression did not alter  but there was a subtle change around his eyes .      how do you mean .     he said .      there   s the hiring fair at sheepridge next week .  you set him as a prentice  see  and his new master   ll have the job of knocking him into shape .     tis the law .  get him indentured  and    tis binding .      lezek looked across the field at his son  who was examining a rock .      i wouldn   t want anything to happen to him  mind     he said doubtfully .     we   re quite fond of him  his mother and me .  you get used to people .         it   d be for his own good  you   ll see .  make a man of him .         ah .  well .  there   s certainly plenty of raw material     sighed lezek .       mort was getting interested in the rock .  it had curly shells in it  relics of the early days of the world when the creator had made creatures out of stone  no one knew why .   mort was interested in lots of things .  why people   s teeth fitted together so neatly  for example .  he   d given that one a lot of thought .  then there was the puzzle of why the sun came out during the day  instead of at night when the light would come in useful .  he knew the standard explanation  which somehow didn   t seem satisfying .   in short  mort was one of those people who are more dangerous than a bag full of rattlesnakes .  he was determined to discover the underlying logic behind the universe .   which was going to be hard  because there wasn   t one .  the creator had a lot of remarkably good ideas when he put the world together  but making it understandable hadn   t been one of them .   tragic heroes always moan when the gods take an interest in them  but it   s the people the gods ignore who get the really tough deals .   his father was yelling at him  as usual .  mort threw the rock at a pigeon  which was almost too full to lurch out of the way  and wandered back across the field .       and that was why mort and his father walked down through the mountains into sheepridge on hogswatch eve  with mort   s rather sparse possessions in a sack on the back of a donkey .  the town wasn   t much more than four sides to a cobbled square  lined with shops that provided all the service industry of the farming community .   after five minutes mort came out of the tailor   s wearing a loose fitting brown garment of imprecise function  which had been understandably unclaimed by a previous owner and had plenty of room for him to grow  on the assumption that he would grow into a nineteen legged elephant .   his father regarded him critically .      very nice     he said     for the money .         it itches     said mort .     i think there   s things in here with me .         there   s thousands of lads in the world   d be very thankful for a nice warm       lezek paused  and gave up      garment like that  my lad .         i could share it with them .     mort said hopefully .      you   ve got to look smart     said lezek severely .     you   ve got to make an impression  stand out in the crowd .      there was no doubt about it .  he would .  they set out among the throng crowding the square  each listening to his own thoughts .  usually mort enjoyed visiting the town  with its cosmopolitan atmosphere and strange dialects from villages as far away as five  even ten miles  but this time he felt unpleasantly apprehensive  as if he could remember something that hadn   t happened yet .   the fair seemed to work like this  men looking for work stood in ragged lines in the center of the square .  many of them sported little symbols in their hats to tell the world the kind of work they were trained in   shepherds wore a wisp of wool  carters a hank of horsehair  interior decorators a strip of rather interesting hessian wallcovering  and so on .   the boys seeking apprenticeships were clustered on the hub side of the square .      you just go and stand there  and someone comes and offers you an apprenticeship     said lezek  his voice trimmed with uncertainty .     if they like the look of you  that is .         how do they do that .     said mort .      well     said lezek  and paused .  hamesh hadn   t explained about this bit .  he drew on his limited knowledge of the marketplace  which was restricted to livestock sales  and ventured     i suppose they count your teeth and that .  and make sure you don   t wheeze and your feet are all right .  i shouldn   t let on about the reading  it unsettles people .         and then what .     said mort .      then you go and learn a trade     said lezek .      what trade in particular .         well   carpentry is a good one     lezek hazarded .     or thievery .  someone   s got to do it .      mort looked at his feet .  he was a dutiful son  when he remembered  and if being an apprentice was what was expected of him then he was determined to be a good one .  carpentry didn   t sound very promising  though   wood had a stubborn life of its own  and a tendency to split .  and official thieves were rare in the ramtops  where people weren   t rich enough to afford them .      all right     he said eventually     i   ll go and give it a try .  but what happens if i don   t get prenticed .      lezek scratched his head .      i don   t know     he said .     i expect you just wait until the end of the fair .  at midnight .  i suppose .          and now midnight approached .   a light frost began to crisp the cobblestones .  in the ornamental clock tower that overlooked the square a couple of delicately carved little automatons whirred out of trapdoors in the clockface and struck the quarter hour .   fifteen minutes to midnight .  mort shivered  but the crimson fires of shame and stubbornness flared up inside him  hotter than the slopes of hell .  he blew on his fingers for something to do and stared up at the freezing sky  trying to avoid the stares of the few stragglers among what remained of the fair .   most of the stallkeepers had packed up and gone .  even the hot meat pie man had stopped crying his wares and  with no regard for personal safety  was eating one .   the last of mort   s fellow hopefuls had vanished hours ago .  he was a wall eyed young man with a stoop and a running nose  and sheepridge   s one licensed beggar had pronounced him to be ideal material .  the lad on the other side of mort had gone off to be a toymaker .  one by one they had trooped off   the masons  the farriers  the assassins  the mercers  coopers  hoodwinkers and ploughmen .  in a few minutes it would be the new year and a hundred boys would be starting out hopefully on their careers  new worthwhile lives of useful service rolling out in front of them .   mort wondered miserably why he hadn   t been picked .  he   d tried to look respectable  and had looked all prospective masters squarely in the eye to impress them with his excellent nature and extremely likeable qualities .  this didn   t seem to have the right effect .      would you like a hot meat pie .     said his father .      no .         he   s selling them cheap .         no .  thank you .         oh .      lezek hesitated .      i could ask the man if he wants an apprentice     he said  helpfully .     very reliable  the catering trade .         i don   t think he does     said mort .      no  probably not     said lezek .     bit of a one man business  i expect .  he   s gone now  anyway .  tell you what  i   ll save you a bit of mine .         i don   t actually feel very hungry  dad .         there   s hardly any gristle .         no .  but thanks all the same .         oh .     lezek deflated a little .  he danced about a bit to stamp some life back into his feet  and whistled a few tuneless bars between his teeth .  he felt he ought to say something  to offer some kind of advice  to point out that life had its ups and downs  to put his arm around his son   s shoulder and talk expansively about the problems of growing up  to indicate   in short   that the world is a funny old place where one should never  metaphorically speaking  be so proud as to turn down the offer of a perfectly good hot meat pie .   they were alone now .  the frost  the last one of the year  tightened its grip on the stones .   high in the tower above them a cogged wheel went clonk  tripped a lever  released a ratchet and let a heavy lead weight drop down .  there was a dreadful metallic wheezing noise and the trapdoors in the clock face slid open  releasing the clockwork men .  swinging their hammers jerkily  as if they were afflicted with robotic arthritis  they began to ring in the new day .      well  that   s it     said lezek  hopefully .  they   d have to find somewhere to sleep   hogswatchnight was no time to be walking in the mountains .  perhaps there was a stable somewhere    .      it   s not midnight until the last stroke     said mort  distantly .   lezek shrugged .  the sheer strength of mort   s obstinacy was defeating him .      all right     he said .     we   ll wait  then .      and then they heard the clip clop of hooves  which boomed rather more loudly around the chilly square than common acoustics should really allow .  in fact clip clop was an astonishingly inaccurate word for the kind of noise which rattled around mort   s head  clip clop suggested a rather jolly little pony  quite possibly wearing a straw hat with holes cut out for its ears .  an edge to this sound made it very clear that straw hats weren   t an option .   the horse entered the square by the hub road  steam curling off its huge damp white flanks and sparks striking up from the cobbles beneath it .  it trotted proudly  like a war charger .  it was definitely not wearing a straw hat .   the tall figure on its back was wrapped up against the cold .  when the horse reached the center of the square the rider dismounted  slowly  and fumbled with something behind the saddle .  eventually he   or she   produced a nosebag  fastened it over the horse   s ears  and gave it a friendly pat on the neck .   the air took on a thick  greasy feel  and the deep shadows around mort became edged with blue and purple rainbows .  the rider strode towards him  black cloak billowing and feet making little clicking sounds on the cobbles .  they were the only noises   silence clamped down on the square like great drifts of cotton wool .   the impressive effect was rather spoilt by a patch of ice .   oh  bugger .   it wasn   t exactly a voice .  the words were there all right  but they arrived in mort   s head without bothering to pass through his ears .   he rushed forward to help the fallen figure  and found himself grabbing hold of a hand that was nothing more than polished bone  smooth and rather yellowed like an old billiard ball .  the figure   s hood fell back  and a naked skull turned its empty eyesockets towards him .   not quite empty  though .  deep within them  as though they were windows looking across the gulfs of space  were two tiny blue stars .   it occurred to mort that he ought to feel horrified  so he was slightly shocked to find that he wasn   t .  it was a skeleton sitting in front of him  rubbing its knees and grumbling  but it was a live one  curiously impressive but not  for some strange reason  very frightening .   thank you  boy  said the skull .  what is your name .      uh     said mort     mortimer   sir .  they call me mort .      what a coincidence  said the skull .  help me up  please .   the figure rose unsteadily  brushing itself down .  now mort could see there was a heavy belt around its waist  from which was slung a white handled sword .      i hope you are not hurt  sir     he said politely .   the skull grinned .  of course  mort thought  it hasn   t much of a choice .   no harm done  i am sure .  the skull looked around and seemed to see lezek  who appeared to be frozen to the spot  for the first time .  mort thought an explanation was called for .      my father     he said  trying to move protectively in front of exhibit a without causing any offense .     excuse me  sir  but are you death .      correct .  full marks for observation  that boy .   mort swallowed .      my father is a good man     he said .  he thought for a while  and added     quite good .  i   d rather you left him alone  if it   s all the same to you .  i don   t know what you have done to him  but i   d like you to stop it .  no offense meant .      death stepped back  his skull on one side .   i have merely put us outside time for a moment  he said .  he will see and hear nothing that disturbs him .  no  boy  it was you i came for .      me .      you are here seeking employment .   light dawned on mort .     you are looking for an apprentice .     he said .   the eyesockets turned towards him  their actinic pinpoints flaring .   of course .   death waved a bony hand .  there was a wash of purple light  a sort of visible    pop     and lezek unfroze .  above his head the clockwork automatons got on with the job of proclaiming midnight  as time was allowed to come creeping back .   lezek blinked .      didn   t see you there for a minute     he said .     sorry   mind must have been elsewhere .      i was offering your boy a position  said death .  i trust that meets with your approval .      what was your job again .     said lezek  talking to a black robed skeleton without showing even a flicker of surprise .   i usher souls into the next world  said death .      ah     said lezek     of course  sorry  should have guessed from the clothes .  very necessary work  very steady .  established business .      i have been going for some time  yes  said death .      good .  good .  never really thought of it as a job for mort  you know  but it   s good work  good work  always very reliable .  what   s your name .      death .      dad       said mort urgently .      can   t say i recognize the firm     said lezek .     where are you based exactly .      from the uttermost depths of the sea to the heights where even the eagle may not go  said death .      that   s fair enough     nodded lezek .     well  i           dad       said mort  pulling at his father   s coat .   death laid a hand on mort   s shoulder .   what your father sees and hears is not what you see and hear  he said .  do not worry him .  do you think he would want to see me   in the flesh  as it were .      but you   re death     said mort .     you go around killing people .      i .  kill .  said death  obviously offended .  certainly not .  people get killed  but that   s their business .  i just take over from then on .  after all  it   d be a bloody stupid world if people got killed without dying  wouldn   t it .      well  yes       said mort  doubtfully .   mort had never heard the word    intrigued .     it was not in regular use in the family vocabulary .  but a spark in his soul told him that here was something weird and fascinating and not entirely horrible  and that if he let this moment go he   d spend the rest of his life regretting it .  and he remembered the humiliations of the day  and the long walk back home    .      er     he began     i don   t have to die to get the job  do i .      being dead is not compulsory .      and   the bones    .      not if you don   t want to .   mort breathed out again .  it had been starting to prey on his mind .      if father says it   s all right     he said .   they looked at lezek  who was scratching his beard .      how do you feel about this  mort .     he said  with the brittle brightness of a fever victim .     it   s not everyone   s idea of an occupation .  it   s not what i had in mind  i admit .  but they do say that undertaking is an honored profession .  it   s your choice .         undertaking .     said mort .  death nodded  and raised his finger to his lips in a conspiratorial gesture .      it   s interesting     said mort slowly .     i think i   d like to try it .         where did you say your business was .     said lezek .     is it far .      no further than the thickness of a shadow  said death .  where the first primal cell was  there was i also .  where man is  there am i .  when the last life crawls under freezing stars  there will i be .      ah     said lezek     you get about a bit  then .     he looked puzzled  like a man struggling to remember something important  and then obviously gave up .   death patted him on the shoulder in a friendly fashion and turned to mort .   have you any possessions  boy .      yes     said mort  and then remembered .     only i think i left them in the shop .  dad  we left the sack in the clothes shop .         it   ll be shut     said lezek .     shops don   t open on hogswatch day .  you   ll have to go back the day after tomorrow   well  tomorrow now .      it is of little account  said death .  we will leave now .  no doubt i will have business here soon enough .      i hope you   ll be able to drop in and see us soon     said lezek .  he seemed to be struggling with his thoughts .      i   m not sure that will be a good idea     said mort .      well  goodbye  lad     said lezek .     you   re to do what you   re told  you understand .  and   excuse me  sir  do you have a son .      death looked rather taken aback .   no  he said  i have no sons .      i   ll just have a last word with my boy  if you   ve no objection .      then i will go and see to the horse  said death  with more than normal tact .   lezek put his arm around his son   s shoulders  with some difficulty in view of their difference in height  and gently propelled him across the square .      mort  you know your uncle hemesh told me about this prenticing business .     he whispered .      yes .         well  he told me something else     the old man confided .     he said it   s not unknown for an apprentice to inherit his master   s business .  what do you think of that  then .         uh .  i   m not sure     said mort .      it   s worth thinking about     said lezek .      i am thinking about it  father .         many a young lad has started out that way     hemesh said .     he makes himself useful  earns his master   s confidence  and  well  if there   s any daughters in the house   did mr .  er  mr .  say anything about daughters .         mr .  who .     said mort .      mr   your new master .         oh .  him .  no .  no  i don   t think so     said mort slowly .     i don   t think he   s the marrying type .         many a keen young man owes his advancement to his nuptials     said lezek .      he does .         mort  i don   t think you   re really listening .         what .      lezek came to a halt on the frosty cobbles and spun the boy around to face him .      you   re really going to have to do better than this     he said .     don   t you understand  boy .  if you   re going to amount to anything in this world then you   ve got to listen .  i   m your father telling you these things .      mort looked down at his father   s face .  he wanted to say a lot of things  he wanted to say how much he loved him  how worried he was  he wanted to ask what his father really thought he   d just seen and heard .  he wanted to say that he felt as though he stepped on a molehill and found that it was really a volcano .  he wanted to ask what    nuptials    meant .   what he actually said was     yes .  thank you .  i   d better be going .  i   ll try and write you a letter .         there   s bound to be someone passing who can read it to us     said lezek .     goodbye  mort .     he blew his nose .      goodbye  dad .  i   ll come back to visit     said mort .  death coughed tactfully  although it sounded like the pistol crack of an ancient beam full of death watch beetle .   we had better be going  he said .  hop up  mort .   as mort scrambled behind the ornate silver saddle death leaned down and shook lezek   s hand .   thank you  he said .      he   s a good lad at heart     said lezek .     a bit dreamy  that   s all .  i suppose we were all young once .      death considered this .   no  he said  i don   t think so .   he gathered up the reins and turned the horse towards the rim road .  from his perch behind the black robed figure mort waved desperately .   lezek waved back .  then  as the horse and its two riders disappeared from view  he lowered his hand and looked at it .  the handshake   it had felt strange .  but  somehow  he couldn   t remember exactly why .       mort listened to the clatter of stone under the horse   s hooves .  then there was the soft thud of packed earth as they reached the road  and then there was nothing at all .   he looked down and saw the landscape spread out below him  the night etched with moonlight silver .  if he fell off  the only thing he   d hit was air .   he redoubled his grip on the saddle .   then death said  are you hungry  boy .      yes  sir .     the words came straight from his stomach without the intervention of his brain .   death nodded  and reined in the horse .  it stood on the air  the great circular panorama of the disc glittering below it .  here and there a city was an orange glow  in the warm seas nearer the rim thee was a hint of phosphorescence .  in some of the deep valleys the trapped daylight of the disc  which is slow and slightly heavy   was evaporating like silver steam .   but it was outshone by the glow that rose towards the stars from the rim itself .  vast streamers of light shimmered and glittered across the night .  great golden walls surrounded the world .      it   s beautiful     said mort softly .     what is it .      the sun is under the disc  said death .      is it like this every night .      every night  said death .  nature   s like that .      doesn   t anyone know .      me .  you .  the gods .  good  is it .      gosh .      death leaned over the saddle and looked down at the kingdoms of the world .   i don   t know about you  he said  but i could murder a curry .       although it was well after midnight the twin city of ankh morpork was roaring with life .  mort had thought sheepridge looked busy  but compared to the turmoil of the street around him the town was  well  a morgue .   poets have tried to describe ankh morpork .  they have failed .  perhaps it   s the sheer zestful vitality of the place  or maybe it   s just that a city with a million inhabitants and no sewers is rather robust for poets  who prefer daffodils and no wonder .  so let   s just say that ankh morpork is as full of life as an old cheese on a hot day  as loud as a curse in a cathedral  as bright as an oil slick  as colorful as a bruise and as full of activity  industry  bustle and sheer exuberant busyness as a dead dog on a termite mound .   there were temples  their doors wide open  filling the streets with the sounds of gongs  cymbals and  in the case of some of the more conservative fundamentalist religions  the brief screams of the victims .  there were shops whose strange wares spilled out on to the pavement .  there seemed to be rather a lot of friendly young ladies who couldn   t afford many clothes .  there were flares  and jugglers  and assorted sellers of instant transcendence .   and death stalked through it all .  mort had half expected him to pass through the crowds like smoke  but it wasn   t like that at all .  the simple truth was that wherever death walked  people just drifted out of the way .   it didn   t work like that for mort .  the crowds that gently parted for his new master closed again just in time to get in his way .  his toes got trodden on  his ribs were bruised  people kept trying to sell him unpleasant spices and suggestively shaped vegetables  and a rather elderly lady said  against all the evidence  that he looked a well set up young lad who would like a nice time .   he thanked her very much  and said that he hoped he was having a nice time already .   death reached the street corner  the light from the flares raising brilliant highlights on the polished dome of his skull  and sniffed the air .  a drunk staggered up  and without quite realizing why made a slight detour in his erratic passage for no visible reason .   this is the city  boy  said death .  what do you think .      it   s very big     said mort  uncertainly .     i mean  why does everyone want to live all squeezed together like this .      death shrugged .   i like it  he said .  it   s full of life .      sir .      yes .      what   s a curry .      the blue fires flared deep in the eyes of death .   have you ever bitten a red hot ice cube .      no  sir     said mort .   curry   s like that .      sir .      yes .   mort swallowed hard .     excuse me  sir  but my dad said  if i don   t understand  i was to ask questions  sir .      very commendable  said death .  he set off down a side street  the crowds parting in front of him like random molecules .      well  sir  i can   t help noticing  the point is  well  the plain fact of it  sir  is        out with it  boy .      how can you eat things  sir .      death pulled up short  so that mort walked into him .  when the boy started to speak he waved him into silence .  he appeared to be listening to something .   there are times  you know  he said  half to himself  when i get really upset .   he turned on one heel and set off down an alleyway at high speed  his cloak flying out behind him .  the alley wound between dark walls and sleeping buildings  not so much a thoroughfare as a meandering gap .   death stopped by a decrepit water butt and plunged his arm in at full length  bringing out a small sack with a brick tied to it .  he drew his sword  a line of flickering blue fire in the darkness  and sliced through the string .   i get very angry indeed  he said .  he upended the sack and mort watched the pathetic scraps of sodden fur slide out  to lie in their spreading puddle on the cobbles .  death reached out with his white fingers and stroked them gently .   after a while something like gray smoke curled up from the kittens and formed three small cat shaped clouds in the air .  they billowed occasionally  unsure of their shape  and blinked at mort with puzzled gray eyes .  when he tried to touch one his hand went straight through it  and tingled .   you don   t see people at their best in this job  said death .  he blew on a kitten  sending it gently tumbling .  its miaow of complaint sounded as though it had come from a long way away via a tin tube .      they   re souls  aren   t they .     said mort .     what do people look like .      people shaped  said death .  it   s basically all down to the characteristic morphogenetic field .   he sighed like the swish of a shroud  picked the kittens out of the air  and carefully stowed them away somewhere in the dark recesses of his robe .  he stood up .   curry time  he said .       it was crowded in the curry gardens on the corner of god street and blood alley  but only with the cream of society   at least  with those people who are found floating on the top and who  therefore  it   s wisest to call the cream .  fragrant bushes planted among the tables nearly concealed the basic smell of the city itself  which has been likened to the nasal equivalent of a foghorn .   mort ate ravenously  but curbed his curiosity and didn   t watch to see how death could possibly eat anything .  the food was there to start with and wasn   t there later  so presumably something must have happened in between .  mort got the feeling that death wasn   t really used to all this but was doing it to put him at his ease  like an elderly bachelor uncle who has been landed with his nephew for a holiday and is terrified of getting it wrong .   the other diners didn   t take much notice  even when death leaned back and lit a rather fine pipe .  someone with smoke curling out of their eye sockets takes some ignoring  but everyone managed it .      is it magic .     said mort .   what do you think .  said death .  am i really here  boy .      yes     said mort slowly .     i   i   ve watched people .  they look at you but they don   t see you  i think .  you do something to their minds .      death shook his head .   they do it all themselves  he said .  there   s no magic .  people can   t see me  they simply won   t allow themselves to do it .  until it   s time  of course .  wizards can see me  and cats .  but your average human   no  never .  he blew a smoke ring at the sky  and added  strange but true .   mort watched the smoke ring wobble into the sky and drift away towards the river .      i can see you     he said .   that   s different .   the klatchian waiter arrived with the bill  and placed it in front of death .  the man was squat and brown  with a hairstyle like a coconut gone nova  and his round face creased into a puzzled frown when death nodded politely to him .  he shook his head like someone trying to dislodge soap from his ears  and walked away .   death reached into the depths of his robe and brought out a large leather bag full of assorted copper coinage  most of it blue and green with age .  he inspected the bill carefully .  then he counted out a dozen coins .   come  he said  standing up .  we must go .   mort trotted along behind him as he stalked out of the garden and into the street  which was still fairly busy even though there were the first suggestions of dawn on the horizon .      what are we going to do now .      buy you some new clothes .      these were new today   yesterday  i mean .      really .      father said the shop was famous for its budget clothing     said mort  running to keep up .   it certainly adds a new terror to poverty .   they turned into a wider street leading into a more affluent part of the city  the torches were closer together and the middens further apart  .  there were no stalls and alley corner traders here  but proper buildings with signs hanging outside .  they weren   t mere shops  they were emporia  they had purveyors in them  and chairs  and spittoons .  most of them were open even at this time of night  because the average ankhian trader can   t sleep for thinking of the money he   s not making .      doesn   t anyone ever go to bed around here .     said mort .   this is a city  said death  and pushed open the door of a clothing store .  when they came out twenty minutes later mort was wearing a neatly fitting black robe with faint silver embroidery  and the shopkeeper was looking at a handful of antique copper coins and wondering precisely how he came to have them .      how do you get all those coins .     asked mort .   in pairs .   an all night barber sheared mort   s hair into the latest fashion among the city   s young bloods while death relaxed in the next chair  humming to himself .  much to his surprise  he felt in a good humor .   in fact after a while he pushed his hood back and glanced up at the barber   s apprentice  who tied a towel around his neck in that unseeing  hypnotized way that mort was coming to recognize  and said  a splash of toilet water and a polish  my good man .   an elderly wizard having a beard trim on the other side stiffened when he heard those somber  leaden tones and swung around .  he blanched and muttered a few protective incantations after death turned  very slowly for maximum effect  and treated him to a grin .   a few minutes later  feeling rather self conscious and chilly around the ears  mort was heading back towards the stables where death had lodged his horse .  he tried an experimental swagger  he felt his new suit and haircut rather demanded it .  it didn   t quite work .       mort awoke .   he lay looking at the ceiling while his memory did a fast rewind and the events of the previous day crystallized in his mind like little ice cubes .   he couldn   t have met death .  he couldn   t have eaten a meal with a skeleton with glowing blue eyes .  it had to be a weird dream .  he couldn   t have ridden pillion on a great white horse that had cantered up into the sky and then went        where .   the answer flowed into his mind with all the inevitability of a tax demand .   here .   his searching hands reached up to his cropped hair  and down to sheets of some smooth slippery material .  it was much finer than the wool he was used to at home  which was coarse and always smelled of sheep  it felt like warm  dry ice .   he swung out of the bed hastily and stared around the room .   first of all it was large  larger than the entire house back home  and dry  dry as old tombs under ancient deserts .  the air tasted as though it had been cooked for hours and then allowed to cool .  the carpet under his feet was deep enough to hide a tribe of pygmies and crackled electrically as he padded through it .  and everything had been designed in shades of purple and black .   he looked down at his own body  which was wearing a long white nightshirt .  his clothes had been neatly folded on a chair by the bed  the chair  he couldn   t help noticing  was delicately carved with a skull and bones motif .   mort sat down on the edge of the bed and began to dress  his mind racing .   he eased open the heavy oak door  and felt oddly disappointed when it failed to creak ominously .   there was a bare wooden corridor outside  with big yellow candles set in holders on the far wall .  mort crept out and sidled along the boards until he reached a staircase .  he negotiated that successfully without anything ghastly happening  arriving in what looked like an entrance hall full of doors .  there were a lot of funereal drapes here  and a grandfather clock with a tick like the heartbeat of a mountain .  there was an umbrella stand beside it .   it had a scythe in it .   mort looked around at the doors .  they looked important .  their arches were carved in the now familiar bones motif .  he went to try the nearest one  and a voice behind him said      you mustn   t go in there  boy .      it took him a moment to realize that this wasn   t a voice in his head  but real human words that had been formed by a mouth and transferred to his ears by a convenient system of air compression  as nature intended .  nature had gone to a lot of trouble for six words with a slightly petulant tone to them .   he turned around .  there was a girl there  about his own height and perhaps a few years older than him .  she had silver hair  and eyes with a pearly sheen to them  and the kind of interesting but impractical long  dress that tends to be worn by tragic heroines who clasp single roses to their bosom while gazing soulfully at the moon .  mort had never heard the phrase    pre raphaelite     which was a pity because it would have been almost the right description .  however  such girls tend to be on the translucent  consumptive side  whereas this one had a slight suggestion of too many chocolates .   she stared at him with her head on one side  and one foot tapping irritably on the floor .  then she reached out quickly and pinched him sharply on the arm .      ow .         hmm .  so you   re really real     she said .     what   s your name  boy .         mortimer .  they call me mort     he said  rubbing his elbow .     what did you do that for .         i shall call you boy     she said .     and i don   t really have to explain myself  you understand  but if you must know i thought you were dead .  you look dead .      mort said nothing .      lost your tongue .      mort was  in fact  counting to ten .      i   m not dead     he said eventually .     at least  i don   t think so .  it   s a little hard to tell .  who are you .         you may call me miss ysabell     she said haughtily .     father told me you must have something to eat .  follow me .      she swept away towards one of the other doors .  mort trailed behind her at just the right distance to have it swing back and hit his other elbow .   there was a kitchen on the other side of the door   long  low and warm  with copper pans hanging from the ceiling and a vast black iron stove occupying the whole of one long wall .  an old man was standing in front of it  frying eggs and bacon and whistling between his teeth .   the smell attracted mort   s taste buds from across the room  hinting that if they got together they could really enjoy themselves .  he found himself moving forward without even consulting his legs .      albert     snapped ysabell     another one for breakfast .      the man turned his head slowly  and nodded at her without saying a word .  she turned back to mort .      i must say     she said     that with the whole disc to choose from  i should think father could have done rather better than you .  i suppose you   ll just have to do .      she swept out of the room  slamming the door behind her .      have to do what .     said mort  to no one in particular .   the room was silent  except for the sizzle of the frying pan and the crumbling of coals in the molten heart of the stove .  mort saw that it had the words    the little moloch  ptntd     embossed on its oven door .   the cook didn   t seem to notice him  so mort pulled up a chair and sat down at the white scrubbed table .      mushrooms .     said the old man  without looking around .      hmm .  what .         i said  do you want mushrooms .         oh .  sorry .  no  thank you     said mort .      right you are  young sir .      he turned around and set out for the table .   even after he got used to it  mort always held his breath when he watched albert walking .  death   s manservant was one of those stick thin  raw nosed old men who always look as though they are wearing gloves with the fingers cut out   even when they   re not   and his walking involved a complicated sequence of movements .  albert leaned forward and his left arm started to swing  slowly at first but soon evolving into a wild jerking movement that finally and suddenly  at about the time when a watcher would have expected the arm to fly off at the elbow  transferred itself down the length of his body to his legs and propelled him forward like a high speed stilt walker .  the frying pan followed a series of intricate curves in the air and was brought to a halt just over mort   s plate .   albert did indeed have exactly the right type of half moon spectacles to peer over the top of .      there could be some porridge to follow     he said  and winked  apparently to include mort in the world porridge conspiracy .      excuse me     said mort     but where am i  exactly .         don   t you know .  this is the house of death  lad .  he brought you here last night .         i   sort of remember .  only       .      hmm .         well .  the bacon and eggs     said mort  vaguely .     it doesn   t seem  well  appropriate .         i   ve got some black pudding somewhere     said albert .      no  i mean       mort hesitated .     it   s just that i can   t see him sitting down to a couple of rashers and a fried slice .      albert grinned .     oh  he doesn   t  lad .  not as a regular thing  no .  very easy to cater for  the master .  i just cook for me and       he paused      the young lady  of course .      mort nodded .     your daughter     he said .      mine .  ha     said albert .     you   re wrong there .  she   s his .      mort stared down at his fried eggs .  they stared back from their lake of fat .  albert had heard of nutritional values  and didn   t hold with them .      are we talking about the same person .     he said at last .     tall  wears black  he   s a bit   skinny    .         adopted     said albert  kindly .     it   s rather a long story        a bell jangled by his head .         which will have to wait .  he wants to see you in his study .  i should run along if i were you .  he doesn   t like to be kept waiting .  understandable  really .  up the steps and first door on the left .  you can   t miss it           it   s got skulls and bones around the door .     said mort  pushing back his chair .      they all have  most of them     sighed albert .     it   s only his fancy .  he doesn   t mean anything by it .      leaving his breakfast to congeal  mort hurried up the steps  along the corridor and paused in front of the first door .  he raised his hand to knock .   enter .   the handle turned of its own accord .  the door swung inward .   death was seated behind a desk  peering intently into a vast leather book almost bigger than the desk itself .  he looked up as mort came in  keeping one calcareous finger marking his place  and grinned .  there wasn   t much of an alternative .   ah  he said  and then paused .  then he scratched his chin  with a noise like a fingernail being pulled across a comb .   who are you  boy .      mort  sir     said mort .     your apprentice .  you remember .      death stared at him for some time .  then the pinpoint blue eyes turned back to the book .   oh yes  he said  mort .  well  boy  do you sincerely wish to learn the uttermost secrets of time and space .      yes  sir .  i think so  sir .      good .  the stables are around the back .  the shovel hangs just inside the door .   he looked down .  he looked up .  mort hadn   t moved .   is it by any chance possible that you fail to understand me .      not fully  sir     said mort .   dung  boy .  dung .  albert has a compost heap in the garden .  i imagine there   s a wheelbarrow somewhere on the premises .  get on with it .   mort nodded mournfully .     yes  sir .  i see  sir .  sir .      yes .      sir  i don   t see what this has to do with the secrets of time and space .      death did not look up from his book .   that  he said  is because you are here to learn .       it is a fact that although the death of the discworld is  in his own words  an anthropomorphic personification  he long ago gave up using the traditional skeletal horses  because of the bother of having to stop all the time to wire bits back on .  now his horses were always flesh and blood beasts  from the finest stock .   and  mort learned  very well fed .   some jobs offer increments .  this one offered   well  quite the reverse  but at least it was in the warm and fairly easy to get the hang of .  after a while he got into the rhythm of it  and started playing the private little quantity surveying game that everyone plays in these circumstances .  let   s see  he thought  i   ve done nearly a quarter  let   s call it a third  so when i   ve done that corner by the hayrack it   ll be more than half  call it five eighths  which means three more wheelbarrow loads    .  it doesn   t prove anything very much except that the awesome splendor of the universe is much easier to deal with if you think of it as a series of small chunks .   the horse watched him from its stall  occasionally trying to eat his hair in a friendly sort of way .   after a while he became aware that someone else was watching him .  the girl ysabell was leaning on the half door  her chin in her hands .      are you a servant .     she said .   mort straightened up .      no     he said     i   m an apprentice .         that   s silly .  albert said you can   t be an apprentice .      mort concentrated on hefting a shovelful into the wheelbarrow .  two more shovelfuls  call it three if it   s well pressed down  and that means four more barrows  all right  call it five  before i   ve done halfway to the        he says     said ysabell in a louder voice     that apprentices become masters  and you can   t have more than one death .  so you   re just a servant and you have to do what i say .         and then eight more barrows means it   s all done all the way to the door  which is nearly two thirds of the whole thing  which means    .      did you hear what i said  boy .      mort nodded .  and then it   ll be fourteen more barrows  only call it fifteen because i haven   t swept up properly in the corner  and    .      have you lost your tongue .         mort     said mort mildly .   she looked at him furiously .     what .         my name is mort     said mort .     or mortimer .  most people call me mort .  did you want to talk to me about something .      she was speechless for a moment  staring from his face to the shovel and back again .      only i   ve been told to get on with this     said mort .   she exploded .      why are you here .  why did father bring you here .         he hired me at the hiring fair     said mort .     all the boys got hired .  and me .         and you wanted to be hired .     she snapped .     he   s death  you know .  the grim reaper .  he   s very important .  he   s not something you become  he   s something you are .      mort gestured vaguely at the wheelbarrow .      i expect it   ll turn out for the best     he said .     my father always says things generally do .      he picked up the shovel and turned away  and grinned at the horse   s backside as he heard ysabell snort and walk away .   mort worked steadily through the sixteenths  eighths  quarters and thirds  wheeling the barrow out through the yard to the heap by the apple tree .   death   s garden was big  neat and well tended .  it was also very  very black .  the grass was black .  the flowers were black .  black apples gleamed among the black leaves of a black apple tree .  even the air looked inky .   after a while mort thought he could see   no  he couldn   t possibly imagine he could see   different colors of black .   that   s to say  not simply very dark tones of red and green and whatever  but real shades of black .  a whole spectrum of colors  all different and all   well  black .  he tipped out the last load  put the barrow away  and went back to the house .   enter .   death was standing behind a lectern  poring over a map .  he looked at mort as if he wasn   t entirely there .   you haven   t heard of the bay of mante  have you .  he said .      no  sir     said mort .   famous shipwreck there .      was there .      there will be  said death  if i can find the damn place .   mort walked around the lectern and peered at the map .      you   re going to sink the ship .     he said .   death looked horrified .   certainly not .  there will be a combination of bad seamanship  shallow water and a contrary wind .      that   s horrible     said mort .     will there be many drowned .      that   s up to fate  said death  turning to the bookcase behind him and pulling out a heavy gazetteer .  there   s nothing i can do about it .  what is that smell .      me     said mort  simply .   ah .  the stables .  death paused  his hand on the spine of the book .  and why do you think i directed you to the stables .  think carefully  now .   mort hesitated .  he had been thinking carefully  in between counting wheelbarrows .  he   d wondered if it had been to coordinate his hand and eye  or teach him the habit of obedience  or bring home to him the importance  on the human scale  of small tasks  or make him realize that even great men must start at the bottom .  none of these explanations seemed exactly right .      i think       he began .   yes .      well  i think it was because you were up to your knees in horseshit  to tell you the truth .      death looked at him for a long time .  mort shifted uneasily from one foot to the other .   absolutely correct  snapped death .  clarity of thought .  realistic approach .  very important in a job like ours .      yes  sir .  sir .      hmm .  death was struggling with the index .      people die all the time  sir  don   t they .  millions .  you must be very busy .  but        death gave mort the look he was coming to be familiar with .  it started off as blank surprise  flickered briefly towards annoyance  called in for a drink at recognition and settled finally on vague forbearance .   but .      i   d have thought you   d have been  well  out and about a bit more .  you know .  stalking the streets .  my granny   s almanack   s got a picture of you with a scythe and stuff .      i see .  i am afraid it is hard to explain unless you know about point incarnation and node focusing .  i don   t expect you do .      i don   t think so .      generally i   m only expected to make an actual appearance on special occasions .      like a king  i suppose     said mort .     i mean  a king is reigning even when he   s doing something else or asleep  even .  is that it  sir .      it   ll do  said death  rolling up the maps .  and now  boy  if you   ve finished the stable you can go and see if albert has any jobs he wants doing .  if you like  you can come out on the round with me this evening .   mort nodded .  death went back to his big leather book  took up a pen  stared at it for a moment  and then looked up at mort with his skull on one side .   have you met my daughter .  he said .      er .  yes  sir     said mort  his hand on the doorknob .   she is a very pleasant girl  said death  but i think she quite likes having someone of her own age around to talk to .      sir .      and  of course  one day all this will belong to her .   something like a small blue supernova flared for a moment in the depths of his eyesockets .  it dawned on mort that  with some embarrassment and complete lack of expertise  death was trying to wink .       in a landscape that owed nothing to time and space  which appeared on no map  which existed only in those far reaches of the multiplexed cosmos known to the few astrophysicists who have taken really bad acid  mort spent the afternoon helping albert plant out broccoli .  it was black  tinted with purple .      he tries  see     said albert  flourishing the dibber .     it   s just that when it comes to color  he hasn   t got much imagination .         i   m not sure i understand all this     said mort .     did you say he made all this .      beyond the garden wall the ground dropped towards a deep valley and then rose into dark moorland that marched all the way to distant mountains  jagged as cats    teeth .      yeah     said albert .     mind what you   re doing with that watering can .         what was here before .         i dunno     said albert  starting a fresh row .     firmament  i suppose .  that   s the fancy name for raw nothing .  it   s not a very good job of work  to tell the truth .  i mean  the garden   s okay  but the mountains are downright shoddy .  they   re all fuzzy when you get up close .  i went and had a look once .      mort squinted hard at the trees nearest him .  they seemed commendably solid .      what   d he do it all for .     he said .   albert grunted .     do you know what happens to lads who ask too many questions .      mort thought for a moment .      no     he said eventually     what .      there was silence .   then albert straightened up and said     damned if i know .  probably they get answers  and serve    em right .         he said i could go out with him tonight     said mort .      you   re a lucky boy then  aren   t you     said albert vaguely  heading back for the cottage .      did he really make all this .     said mort  tagging along after him .      yes .         why .         i suppose he wanted somewhere where he could feel at home .         are you dead  albert .         me .  do i look dead .     the old man snorted when mort started to give him a slow  critical look .     and you can stop that .  i   m as alive as you are .  probably more .         sorry .         right .     albert pushed open the back door  and turned to regard mort as kindly as he could manage .      it   s best not to ask all these questions     he said     it upsets people .  now  how about a nice fry up .          the bell rang while they were playing dominoes .  mort sat to attention .      he   ll want the horse made ready     said albert .     come on .      they went out to the stable in the gathering dusk  and mort watched the old man saddle up death   s horse .      his name   s binky     said albert  fastening the girth .     it just goes to show  you never can tell .      binky tried to eat his scarf in an affectionate way .   mort remembered the woodcut in his grandmother   s almanack  between the page on planting times and the phases of the moon section  showing dethe thee great levyller comes to alle menne .  he   d stared at it hundreds of times when learning his letters .  it wouldn   t have been half so impressive if it had been generally known that the flame breathing horse the specter rode was called binky .      i would have thought something like fang or sabre or ebony     albert continued     but the master will have his little fancies  you know .  looking forward to it  are you .         i think so     said mort uncertainly .     i   ve never seen death actually at work .         not many have     said albert .     not twice  at any rate .      mort took a deep breath .      about this daughter of his       he began .   ah .  good evening  albert  boy .      mort     said mort automatically .   death strode into the stable  stooping a little to clear the ceiling .  albert nodded  not in any subservient way  mort noticed  but simply out of form .  mort had met one or two servants  on the rare occasions he   d been taken into town  and albert wasn   t like any of them .  he seemed to act as though the house really belonged to him and its owner was just a passing guest  something to be tolerated like peeling paintwork or spiders in the lavatory .  death put up with it too  as though he and albert had said everything that needed to be said a long time ago and were simply content  now  to get on with their jobs with the minimum of inconvenience all round .  to mort it was rather like going for a walk after a really bad thunderstorm   everything was quite fresh  nothing was particularly unpleasant  but there was the sense of vast energies just expended .   finding out about albert tagged itself on to the end of his list of things to do .   hold this  said death  and pushed a scythe into his hand while he swung himself up on to binky .  the scythe looked normal enough  except for the blade  it was so thin that mort could see through it  a pale blue shimmer in the air that could slice flame and chop sound .  he held it very carefully .   right  boy  said death .  come on up .  albert .  don   t wait up .   the horse trotted out of the courtyard and into the sky .   there should have been a flash or rush of stars .  the air should have spiralled and turned into speeding sparks such as normally happens in the common  everyday trans dimensional hyper jumps .  but this was death  who has mastered the art of going everywhere without ostentation and could slide between dimensions as easily as he could slip through a locked door  and they moved at an easy gallop through cloud canyons  past great billowing mountains of cumulus  until the wisps parted in front of them and the disc lay below  basking in sunlight .   that   s because time is adjustable  said death  when mort pointed this out .  it   s not really important .      i always thought it was .      people think it   s important only because they invented it  said death somberly .  mort considered this rather trite  but decided not to argue .      what are we going to do now .     he said .   there   s a promising war in klatchistan  said death .  several plague outbreaks .  one rather important assassination  if you   d prefer .      what  a murder .      aye  a king .      oh  kings     said mort dismissively .  he knew about kings .  once a year a band of strolling players  or at any rate ambling ones  came to sheepridge and the plays  they performed were invariably about kings .  kings were always killing one another  or being killed .  the plots were quite complicated  involving mistaken identity  poisons  battles  long lost sons  ghosts  witches and  usually  lots of daggers .  since it was clear that being a king was no picnic it was amazing that half the cast were apparently trying to become one .  mort   s idea of palace life was a little hazy  but he imagined that no one got much sleep .      i   d quite like to see a real king     he said .     they wear crowns all the time  my granny said .  even when they go to the lavatory .      death considered this carefully .   there   s no technical reason why not  he conceded .  in my experience  however  it is generally not the case .   the horse wheeled  and the vast flat checkerboard of the sto plain sped underneath them at lightning speed .  this was rich country  full of silt and rolling cabbage fields and neat little kingdoms whose boundaries wriggled like snakes as small  formal wars  marriage pacts  complex alliances and the occasional bit of sloppy cartography changed the political shape of the land .      this king     said mort  as a forest zipped beneath them     is he good or bad .      i never concern myself with such things  said death .  he   s no worse than any other king  i imagine .      does he have people put to death .     said mort  and remembering who he was talking to added     saving y   honor   s presence  of course .      sometimes .  there are some things you have to do  when you   re a king .   a city slid below them  clustered around a castle built on a rock outcrop that poked up out of the plain like a geological pimple .  it was one huge rock from the distant ramtops  death said  left there by the retreating ice in the legendary days when the ice giants waged war on the gods and rode their glaciers across the land in an attempt to freeze the whole world .  they   d given up in the end  however  and driven their great glittering flocks back to their hidden lands among the razor backed mountains near the hub .  no one on the plains knew why they had done this  it was generally considered by the younger generation in the city of sto lat  the city around the rock  that it was because the place was dead boring .   binky trotted down over nothingness and touched down on the flagstones of the castle   s topmost tower .  death dismounted and told mort to sort out the nosebag .      won   t people notice there   s a horse up here .     he said  as they strolled to a stairwell .   death shook his head .   would you believe there could be a horse at the top of this tower .  he said .      no .  you couldn   t get one up these stairs     said mort .   well  then .      oh .  i see .  people don   t want to see what can   t possibly exist .      well done .   now they were walking along a wide corridor hung with tapestries .  death reached into his robe and pulled out an hourglass  peering closely at it in the dim light .   it was a particularly fine one  its glass cut into intricate facets and imprisoned in an ornate framework of wood and brass .  the words    king olerve the bastard    were engraved deeply into it .   the sand inside sparkled oddly .  there wasn   t a lot left .   death hummed to himself and stowed the glass away in whatever mysterious recess it had occupied .   they turned a corner and hit a wall of sound .  there was a hall full of people there  under a cloud of smoke and chatter that rose all the way up into the banner haunted shadows in the roof .  up in a gallery a trio of minstrels were doing their best to be heard and not succeeding .   the appearance of death didn   t cause much of a stir .  a footman by the door turned to him  opened his mouth and then frowned in a distracted way and thought of something else .  a few courtiers glanced in their direction  their eyes instantly unfocusing as common sense overruled the other five .   we   ve got a few minutes  said death  taking a drink from a passing tray .  let   s mingle .      they can   t see me either .     said mort .     but i   m real .      reality is not always what it seems  said death .  anyway  if they don   t want to see me  they certainly don   t want to see you .  these are aristocrats  boy .  they   re good at not seeing things .  why is there a cherry on a stick in this drink .      mort     said mort automatically .   it   s not as if it does anything for the flavor .  why does anyone take a perfectly good drink and then put in a cherry on a pole .      what   s going to happen next .     said mort .  an elderly earl bumped into his elbow  looked everywhere but directly at him  shrugged and walked away .   take these things  now  said death  fingering a passing canape .  i mean  mushrooms yes  chicken yes  cream yes  i   ve nothing against any of them  but why in the name of sanity mince them all up and put them in little pastry cases .      pardon .     said mort .   that   s mortals for you  death continued .  they   ve only got a few years in this world and they spend them all in making things complicated for themselves .  fascinating .  have a gherkin .      where   s the king .     said mort  craning to look over the heads of the court .   chap with the golden beard  said death .  he tapped a flunky on the shoulder  and as the man turned and looked around in puzzlement deftly piloted another drink from his tray .   mort cast around until he saw the figure standing in a little group in the center of the crowd  leaning over slightly the better to hear what a rather short courtier was saying to him .  he was a tall  heavily built man with the kind of stolid  patient face that one would confidently buy a used horse from .      he doesn   t look a bad king     said mort .     why would anyone want to kill him .      see the man next to him .  with the little moustache and the grin like a lizard .  death pointed with his scythe .      yes .      his cousin  the duke of sto helit .  not the nicest of people  said death .  a handy man with a bottle of poison .  fifth in line to the throne last year  now second in line .  bit of a social climber  you might say .  he fumbled inside his robe and produced an hourglass in which black sand coursed between a spiked iron latticework .  he gave it an experimental shake .  and due to live another thirty  thirty five years  he said  with a sigh .      and he goes around killing people .     said mort .  he shook his head .     there   s no justice .      death sighed .  no  he said  handing his drink to a page who was surprised to find he was suddenly holding an empty glass  there   s just me .   he drew his sword  which had the same ice blue  shadow thin blade as the scythe of office  and stepped forward .      i thought you used the scythe     whispered mort .   kings get the sword  said death .  it   s a royal whats name  prerogative .   his free hand thrust its bony digits beneath his robe again and brought out king olerve   s glass .  in the top half the last few grains of sand were huddling together .   pay careful attention  said death  you may be asked questions afterwards .      wait     said mort  wretchedly .     it   s not fair .  can   t you stop it .      fair .  said death .  who said anything about fair .      well  if the other man is such a        listen  said death  fair doesn   t come into it .  you can   t take sides .  good grief .  when it   s time  it   s time .  that   s all there is to it  boy .      mort     moaned mort  staring at the crowd .   and then he saw her .  a random movement in the people opened up a channel between mort and a slim  red haired girl seated among a group of older women behind the king .  she wasn   t exactly beautiful  being over endowed in the freckle department and  frankly  rather on the skinny side .  but the sight of her caused a shock that hot wired mort   s hindbrain and drove it all the way to the pit of his stomach  laughing nastily .   it   s time  said death  giving mort a nudge with a sharp elbow .  follow me .   death walked toward the king  weighing his sword in his hand .  mort blinked  and started to follow .  the girl   s eyes met his for a second and immediately looked away   then swiveled back  dragging her head around  her mouth starting to open in an    o    of horror .   mort   s backbone melted .  he started to run towards the king .      look out .     he screamed .     you   re in great danger .      and the world turned into treacle .  it began to fill up with blue and purple shadows  like a heatstroke dream  and sound faded away until the roar of the court became distant and scritchy  like the music in someone else   s headphones .  mort saw death standing companionably by the king  his eyes turned up towards        the minstrel gallery .   mort saw the bowman  saw the bow  saw the bolt now winging through the air at the speed of a sick snail .  slow as it was  he couldn   t outrun it .  it seemed like hours before he could bring his leaden legs under control  but finally he managed to get both feet to touch the floor at the same time and kicked away with all the apparent acceleration of continental drift .   as he twisted slowly through the air death said  without rancor  it won   t work  you know .  it   s only natural that you should want to try  but it won   t work .   dream like  mort drifted through a silent world    .   the bolt struck .  death brought his sword around in a double handed swing that passed gently through the king   s neck without leaving a mark .  to mort  spiraling gently through the twilight world  it looked as though a ghostly shape had dropped away .   it couldn   t be the king  because he was manifestly still standing there  looking directly at death with an expression of extreme surprise .  there was a shadowy something around his feet  and a long way away people were reacting with shouts and screams .   a good clean job  said death .  royalty are always a problem .  they tend to want to hang on .  your average peasant  now  he can   t wait .      who the hell are you .     said the king .     what are you doing here .  eh .  guards .  i deman        the insistent message from his eyes finally battered through to his brain .  mort was impressed .  king olerve had held on to his throne for many years and  even when dead  knew how to behave .      oh     he said     i see .  i didn   t expect to see you so soon .      your majesty  said death  bowing  few do .   the king looked around .  it was quiet and dim in this shadow world  but outside there seemed to be a lot of excitement .      that   s me down there  is it .      i am afraid so  sire .      clean job .  crossbow  was it .      yes .  and now  sire  if you would        who did it .     said the king .  death hesitated .   a hired assassin from ankh morpork  he said .      hmm .  clever .  i congratulate sto helit .  and here   s me filling myself with antidotes .  no antidote to cold steel  eh .  eh .      indeed not  sire .      the old rope ladder and fast horse by the drawbridge trick  eh .      so it would appear  sire  said death  taking the king   s shade gently by the arm .  if it   s any consolation  though  the horse needs to be fast .      eh .      death allowed his fixed grin to widen a little .   i have an appointment with its rider tomorrow in ankh  said death .  you see  he allowed the duke to provide him with a packed lunch .   the king  whose eminent suitability for his job meant that he was not automatically quick on the uptake  considered this for a moment and then gave a short laugh .  he noticed mort for the first time .      who   s this .     he said     he dead too .      my apprentice  said death .  who will be getting a good talking to before he   s much older  the scallywag .      mort     said mort automatically .  the sound of their talking washed around him  but he couldn   t take his eyes off the scene around them .  he felt real .  death looked solid .  the king looked surprisingly fit and well for someone who was dead .  but the rest of the world was a mass of sliding shadows .  figures were bent over the slumped body  moving through mort as if they were no more substantial than a mist .   the girl was kneeling down  weeping .      that   s my daughter     said the king .     i ought to feel sad .  why don   t i .      emotions get left behind .  it   s all a matter of glands .      ah .  that would be it  i suppose .  she can   t see us  can she .      no .      i suppose there   s no chance that i could    .      none  said death .      only she   s going to be queen  and if i could only let her        sorry .   the girl looked up and through mort .  he watched the duke walk up behind her and lay a comforting hand on her shoulder .  a faint smile hovered around the man   s lips .  it was the sort of smile that lies on sandbanks waiting for incautious swimmers .   i can   t make you hear me  mort said .  don   t trust him .   she peered at mort  screwing up her eyes .  he reached out  and watched his hand pass straight through hers .   come along  boy .  no lallygagging .   mort felt death   s hand tighten on his shoulder  not in an unfriendly fashion .  he turned away reluctantly  following death and the king .   they walked out through the wall .  he was halfway after them before he realized that walking through walls was impossible .   the suicidal logic of this nearly killed him .  he felt the chill of the stone around his limbs before a voice in his ear said   look at it this way .  the wall can   t be there .  otherwise you wouldn   t be walking through it .  would you  boy .      mort     said mort .   what .      my name is mort .  or mortimer     said mort angrily  pushing forward .  the chill fell behind him .   there .  that wasn   t so hard  was it .   mort looked up and down the length of the corridor  and slapped the wall experimentally .  he must have walked through it  but it felt solid enough now .  little specks of mica glittered at him .      how do you do that stuff .     he said .     how do i do it .  is it magic .      magic is the one thing it isn   t  boy .  when you can do it by yourself  there will be nothing more that i can teach you .   the king  who was considerably more diffuse now  said     it   s impressive  i   ll grant you .  by the way  i seem to be fading .      it   s the morphogenetic field weakening  said death .   the king   s voice was no louder than a whisper .     is that what it is .      it happens to everyone .  try to enjoy it .      how .     now the voice was no more than a shape in the air .  just be yourself .   at that moment the king collapsed  growing smaller and smaller in the air as the field finally collapsed into a tiny  brilliant pinpoint .  it happened so quickly that mort almost missed it .  from ghost to mote in half a second  with a faint sigh .   death gently caught the glittering thing and stowed it away somewhere under his robe .      what   s happened to him .     said mort .   only he knows  said death .  come .      my granny says that dying is like going to sleep     mort added  a shade hopefully .   i wouldn   t know .  i have done neither .   mort took a last look along the corridor .  the big doors had been flung back and the court was spilling out .  two older women were endeavoring to comfort the princess  but she was striding ahead of them so that they bounced along behind her like a couple of fussy balloons .  they disappeared up another corridor .   already a queen  said death  approvingly .  death liked style .   they were on the roof before he spoke again .   you tried to warn him  he said  removing binky   s nosebag .      yes  sir .  sorry .      you cannot interfere with fate .  who are you to judge who should live and who should die .   death watched mort   s expression carefully .   only the gods are allowed to do that  he added .  to tinker with the fate of even one individual could destroy the whole world .  do you understand .   mort nodded miserably .      are you going to send me home .     he said .   death reached down and swung him up behind the saddle .   because you showed compassion .  no .  i might have done if you had shown pleasure .  but you must learn the compassion proper to your trade .      what   s that .      a sharp edge .       days passed  although mort wasn   t certain how many .  the gloomy sun of death   s world rolled regularly across the sky  but the visits to mortal space seemed to adhere to no particular system .  nor did death visit only kings and important battles  most of the personal visits were to quite ordinary people .   meals were served up by albert  who smiled to himself a lot and didn   t say anything much .  ysabell kept to her room most of the time  or rode her own pony on the black moors above the cottage .  the sight of her with her hair streaming in the wind would have been more impressive if she was a better horse woman  or if the pony had been rather larger  or if her hair was the sort that streams naturally .  some hair has got it  and some hasn   t .  hers hadn   t .   when he wasn   t out on what death referred to as the duty mort assisted albert  or found jobs in the garden or stable  or browsed through death   s extensive library  reading with the speed and omnivorousness common to those who discover the magic of the written word for the first time .   most of the books in the library were biographies  of course .   they were unusual in one respect .  they were writing themselves .  people who had already died  obviously  filled their books from cover to cover  and those who hadn   t been born yet had to put up with blank pages .  those in between   mort took note  marking the place and counting the extra lines  and estimated that some books were adding paragraphs at the rate of four or five every day .  he didn   t recognize the handwriting .   and finally he plucked up his courage .   a what .  said death in astonishment  sitting behind his ornate desk and turning his scythe shaped paperknife over and over in his hands .      an afternoon off     repeated mort .  the room suddenly seemed to be oppressively big  with himself very exposed in the middle of a carpet about the size of a field .   but why .  said death .  it can   t be to attend your grandmother   s funeral  he added .  i would know .      i just want to  you know  get out and meet people     said mort  trying to outstare that unflinching blue gaze .   but you meet people every day  protested death .      yes  i know  only  well  not for very long     said mort .     i mean  it   d be nice to meet someone with a life expectancy of more than a few minutes .  sir     he added .   death drummed his fingers on the desk  making a sound not unlike a mouse tap dancing  and gave mort another few seconds of stare .  he noticed that the boy seemed rather less elbows than he remembered  stood a little more upright and  bluntly  could use a word like    expectancy .     it was all that library .   allright  he said grudgingly .  but it seems to me you have everything you need right here .  the duty is not onerous  is it .      no  sir .      and you have good food and a warm bed and recreation and people your own age .      pardon  sir .     said mort .   my daughter  said death .  you have met her  i believe .      oh .  yes  sir .     she has a very warm personality when you get to know her .      i am sure she has  sir .      nevertheless  you wish   death launched the words with a spin of distaste   an afternoon off .      yes  sir .  if you please  sir .      very well .  so be it .  you may have until sunset .   death opened his great ledger  picked up a pen  and began to write .  occasionally he   d reach out and flick the beads of an abacus .   after a minute he looked up .   you   re still here  he said .  and in your own time  too  he added sourly .      um     said mort     will people be able to see me  sir .      i imagine so  i   m sure  said death .  is there anything else i might be able to assist you with before you leave for this debauch .      well  sir  there is one thing  sir  i don   t know how to get to the mortal world  sir     said mort desperately .   death sighed loudly  and pulled open a desk drawer .   just walk there .   mort nodded miserably  and took the long walk to the study door .  as he pulled it open death coughed .   boy .  he called  and tossed something across the room .   mort caught it automatically as the door creaked open .   the doorway vanished .  the deep carpet underfoot became muddy cobbles .  broad daylight poured over him like quicksilver .      mort     said mort  to the universe at large .      what .     said a stallholder beside him .  mort stared around .  he was in a crowded marketplace  packed with people and animals .  every kind of thing was being sold from needles to  via a few itinerant prophets  visions of salvation .  it was impossible to hold any conversation quieter than a shout .   mort tapped the stallholder in the small of the back .      can you see me .     he demanded .   the stallholder squinted critically at him .      i reckon so     he said     or someone very much like you .         thank you     said mort  immensely relieved .      don   t mention it .  i see lots of people every day  no charge .  want to buy any bootlaces .         i don   t think so     said mort .     what place is this .         you don   t know .      a couple of people at the next stall were looking at mort thoughtfully .  his mind went into overdrive .      my master travels a lot     he said  truthfully .     we arrived last night  and i was asleep on the cart .  now i   ve got the afternoon off .         ah     said the stallholder .  he leaned forward conspiratorially .     looking for a good time  are you .  i could fix you up .         i   d quite enjoy knowing where i am     mort conceded .   the man was taken aback .      this is ankh morpork     he said .     anyone ought to be able to see that .  smell it  too .      mort sniffed .  there was a certain something about the air in the city .  you got the feeling that it was air that had seen life .  you couldn   t help noting with every breath that thousands of other people were very close to you and nearly all of them had armpits .   the stallholder regarded mort critically  noting the pale face  well cut clothes and strange presence  a sort of coiled spring effect .      look  i   ll be frank     he said .     i could point you in the direction of a great brothel .         i   ve already had lunch     said mort  vaguely .     but you can tell me if we   re anywhere near  i think it   s called sto lat .         about twenty miles hubwards  but there   s nothing there for a young man of your kidney     said the trader hurriedly .     i know  you   re out by yourself  you want new experiences  you want excitement  romance        mort  meanwhile  had opened the bag death had given him .  it was full of small gold coins  about the size of sequins .   an image formed again in his mind  of a pale young face under a head of red hair who had somehow known he was there .  the unfocused feelings that had haunted his mind for the last few days suddenly sharpened to a point .      i want     he said firmly     a very fast horse .          five minutes later  mort was lost .   this part of ankh morpork was known as the shades  an inner city area sorely in need either of governmental help or  for preference  a flamethrower .  it couldn   t be called squalid because that would be stretching the word to breaking point .  it was beyond squalor and out the other side  where by a sort of einsteinian reversal it achieved a magnificent horribleness that it wore like an architectural award .  it was noisy and sultry and smelled like a cowshed floor .   it didn   t so much have a neighborhood as an ecology  like a great land based coral reef .  there were the humans  all right  humanoid equivalents of lobsters  squid  shrimps and so on .  and sharks .   mort wandered hopelessly along the winding streets .  anyone hovering at rooftop height would have noticed a certain pattern in the crowds behind him  suggesting a number of men converging nonchalantly on a target  and would rightly have concluded that mort and his gold had about the same life expectancy as a three legged hedgehog on a six lane motorway .   it is probably already apparent that the shades was not the sort of place to have inhabitants .  it had denizens .  periodically mort would try to engage one in conversation  to find the way to a good horse dealer .  the denizen would usually mutter something and hurry away  since anyone wishing to live in the shades for longer than maybe three hours developed very specialized senses indeed and would no more hang around near mort than a peasant would stand near a tall tree in thundery weather .   and so mort came at last to the river ankh  greatest of rivers .  even before it entered the city  it was slow and heavy with the silt of the plains  and by the time it got to the shades even an agnostic could have walked across it .  it was hard to drown in the ankh  but easy to suffocate .   mort looked at the surface doubtfully .  it seemed to be moving .  there were bubbles in it .  it had to be water .   he sighed  and turned away .   three men had appeared behind him  as though extruded from the stonework .  they had the heavy  stolid look of those thugs whose appearance in any narrative means that it   s time for the hero to be menaced a bit  although not too much  because it   s also obvious that they   re going to be horribly surprised .   they were leering .  they were good at it .   one of them had drawn a knife  which he waved in little circles in the air .  he advanced slowly towards mort  while the other two hung back to provide immoral support .      give us the money     he rasped .   mort   s hand went to the bag on his belt .      hang on a minute     he said .     what happens then .         what .         i mean  is it my money or my life .     said mort .     that   s the sort of thing robbers are supposed to demand .  your money or your life .  i read that in a book once     he added .      possibly  possibly     conceded the robber .  he felt he was losing the initiative  but rallied magnificently .     on the other hand  it could be your money and your life .  pulling off the double  you might say .     the man looked sideways at his colleagues  who sniggered on cue .      in that case       said mort  and hefted the bag in one hand preparatory to chucking it as far out into the ankh as he could  even though there was a reasonable chance it would bounce .      hey  what are you doing     said the robber .  he started to run forward  but halted when mort gave the bag a threatening jerk .      well     said mort     i look at it like this .  if you   re going to kill me anyway  i might as well get rid of the money .  it   s entirely up to you .     to illustrate his point he took one coin out of the bag and flicked it out across the water  which accepted it with an unfortunate sucking noise .  the thieves shuddered .   the leading thief looked at the bag .  he looked at his knife .  he looked at mort   s face .  he looked at his colleagues .      excuse me     he said  and they went into a huddle .   mort measured the distance to the end of the alley .  he wouldn   t make it .  anyway  these three looked as though chasing people was another thing they were good at .  it was only logic that left them feeling a little stretched .   their leader turned back to mort .  he gave a final glance at the other two .  they both nodded decisively .      i think we kill you and take a chance on the money     he said .     we don   t want this sort of thing to spread .      the other two drew their knives .   mort swallowed .     this could be unwise     he said .      why .         well  i won   t like it  for one .         you   re not supposed to like it  you   re supposed to   die     said the thief  advancing .      i don   t think i   m due to die     said mort  backing away .     i   m sure i would have been told .         yeah     said the thief  who was getting fed up with this .     yeah  well  you have been  haven   t you .  great steaming elephant turds .      mort had just stepped backwards again .  through a wall .   the leading thief glared at the solid stone that had swallowed mort  and then threw down his knife .      well     me     he said .     a    ing wizard .  i hate    ing wizards .         you shouldn   t    them  then     muttered one of his henchmen  effortlessly pronouncing a row of dashes .   the third member of the trio  who was a little slow of thinking  said     here  he walked through the wall .         and we bin following him for ages  too     muttered the second one .     fine one you are  pilgarlic .  i said i thought he was a wizard  only wizards   d walk round here by themselves .  dint i say he looked like a wizard .  i said           you   re saying a good deal too much     growled the leader .      i saw him  he walked right through the wall there           oh  yeah .         yeah .         right through it  dint you see .         think you   re sharp  do you .         sharp enough  come to that .      the leader scooped his knife out of the dirt in one snaky movement .      sharp as this .      the third thief lurched over to the wall and kicked it hard a few times  while behind him there were the sounds of scuffle and some damp bubbling noises .      yep  it   s a wall okay     he said .     that   s a wall if ever i saw one .  how d   you think they do it  lads .         lads .      he tripped over the prone bodies .      oh     he said .  slow as his mind was  it was quick enough to realize something very important .  he was in a back alley in the shades  and he was alone .  he ran for it  and got quite a long way .       death walked slowly across tiles in the lifetimer room  inspecting the serried rows of busy hourglasses .  albert followed dutifully behind with the great ledger open in his arms .   the sound roared around them  a vast gray waterfall of noise .   it came from the shelves where  stretching away into the infinite distance  row upon row of hourglasses poured away the sands of mortal time .  it was a heavy sound  a dull sound  a sound that poured like sullen custard over the bright roly poly pudding of the soul .   very well  said death at last .  i make it three .  a quiet night .      that   d be goodie hamstring  the abbot lobsang again  and this princess keli     said albert .   death looked at the three hourglasses in his hand .   i was thinking of sending the lad out  he said .   albert consulted his ledger .      well  goodie wouldn   t be any trouble and the abbot is what you might call experienced     he said .     shame about the princess .  only fifteen .  could be tricky .      yes .  it is a pity .      master .      death stood with the third glass in his hand  staring thoughtfully at the play of light across its surface .  he sighed .   one so young        are you feeling all right  master .     said albert  his voice full of concern .   time like an ever rolling stream bears all its        master .      what .  said death  snapping out of it .      you   ve been overdoing it  master  that   s what it is        what are you blathering about  man .      you had a bit of a funny turn there  master .      nonsense .  i have never felt better .  now  what were we talking about .   albert shrugged  and peered down at the entries in the book .      goodie   s a witch     he said .     she might get a bit annoyed if you send mort .      all practitioners of magic earned the right  once their own personal sands had run out  of being claimed by death himself rather than his minor functionaries .   death didn   t appear to hear albert .  he was staring at princess keli   s hourglass again .   what is that sense inside your head of wistful regret that things are the way they apparently are .      sadness  master .  i think .  now        i am sadness .   albert stood with his mouth open .  finally he got a grip on himself long enough to blurt out     master  we were talking about mort .      mort who .      your apprentice  master     said albert patiently .     tall young lad .      of course .  well  we   ll send him .      is he ready to go solo  master .     said albert doubtfully .   death thought about it .  he can do it  he said at last .  he   s keen  he   s quick to learn and  really  he added  people can   t expect to have me running around after them all the time .       mort stared blankly at the velvet wall hangings a few inches from his eyes .   i   ve walked through a wall  he thought .  and that   s impossible .   he gingerly moved the hangings aside to see if a door was lurking somewhere  but there was nothing but crumbling plaster which had cracked away in places to reveal some dampish but emphatically solid brickwork .   he prodded it experimentally .  it was quite clear that he wasn   t going back out that way .      well     he said to the wall .     what now .      a voice behind him said     um .  excuse please .      he turned around slowly .   grouped around a table in the middle of the room was a klatchian family of father  mother and half a dozen children of dwindling size .  eight pairs of round eyes were fixed on mort .  a ninth pair belonging to an aged grandparent of indeterminate sex weren   t  because their owner had taken advantage of the interruption to get some elbow room at the communal rice bowl  taking the view that a boiled fish in the hand was worth any amount of unexplained manifestations  and the silence was punctuated by the sound of determined mastication .   in one corner of the crowded room was a little shrine to offler  the six armed crocodile god of klatch .  it was grinning just like death  except of course death didn   t have a flock of holy birds that brought him news of his worshippers and also kept his teeth clean .   klatchians prize hospitality above all other virtues .  as mort stared the woman took another plate off the shelf behind her and silently began to fill it from the big bowl  snatching a choice cut of catfish from the ancient   s hands after a brief struggle .  her kohl rimmed eyes remained steadily on mort  however .   it was the father who had spoken .  mort bowed nervously .      sorry     he said .     er  i seem to have walked through this wall .     it was rather lame  he had to admit .      please .     said the man .  the woman  her bangles jangling  carefully arranged a few slices of pepper across the plate and sprinkled it with a dark green sauce that mort was afraid he recognized .  he   d tried it a few weeks before  and although it was a complicated recipe one taste had been enough to know that it was made out of fish entrails marinated for several years in a vat of shark bile .  death had said that it was an acquired taste .  mort had decided not to make the effort .   he tried to sidle around the edge of the room towards the bead hung doorway  all the heads turning to watch him .  he tried a grin .   the woman said     why does the demon show his teeth  husband of my life .      the man said     it could be hunger  moon of my desire .  pile on more fish .      and the ancestor grumbled     i was eating that  wretched child .  woe unto the world when there is no respect for age .      now the fact is that while the words entered mort   s ear in their spoken klatchian  with all the curlicues and subtle diphthongs of a language so ancient and sophisticated that it had fifteen words meaning    assassination    before the rest of the world had caught on to the idea of bashing one another over the head with rocks  they arrived in his brain as clear and understandable as his mother tongue .      i   m no demon .  i   m a human .     he said  and stopped in shock as his words emerged in perfect klatch .      you   re a thief .     said the father .     a murderer .  to creep in thus  are you a tax gatherer .     his hand slipped under the table and came up holding a meat cleaver honed to paper thinness .  his wife screamed and dropped the plate and clutched the youngest children to her .   mort watched the blade weave through the air  and gave in .      i bring you greetings from the uttermost circles of hell     he hazarded .   the change was remarkable .  the cleaver was lowered and the family broke into broad smiles .      there is much luck to us if a demon visits     beamed the father .     what is your wish  o foul spawn of offler   s loins .         sorry .     said mort .      a demon brings blessing and good fortune on the man that helps it     said the man .     how may we be of assistance  o evil dogsbreath of the nether pit .         well  i   m not very hungry     said mort     but if you know where i can get a fast horse  i could be in sto lat before sunset .      the man beamed and bowed .     i know the very place  noxious extrusion of the bowels  if you would be so good as to follow me .      mort hurried out after him .  the ancient ancestor watched them go with a critical expression  its jowls rhythmically chewing .      that was what they call a demon around here .     it said .     offler rot this country of dampness  even their demons are third rate  not a patch on the demons we had in the old country .      the wife placed a small bowl of rice in the folded middle pair of hands of the offler statue  it would be gone in the morning  and stood back .      husband did say that last month at the curry gardens he served a creature who was not there     she said .     he was impressed .      ten minutes later the man returned and  in solemn silence  placed a small heap of gold coins on the table .  they represented enough wealth to purchase quite a large part of the city .      he had a bag of them     he said .   the family stared at the money for some time .  the wife sighed .      riches bring many problems     she said .     what are we to do .         we return to klatch     said the husband firmly     where our children can grow up in a proper country  true to the glorious traditions of our ancient race and men do not need to work as waiters for wicked masters but can stand tall and proud .  and we must leave right now  fragrant blossom of the date palm .         why so soon  o hardworking son of the desert .         because     said the man     i have just sold the patrician   s champion racehorse .          the horse wasn   t as fine or as fast as binky  but it swept the miles away under its hooves and easily outdistanced a few mounted guards who  for some reason  appeared anxious to talk to mort .  soon the shanty suburbs of morpork were left behind and the road ran out into rich black earth country of the sto plain  constructed over eons by the periodic flooding of the great slow ankh that brought to the region prosperity  security and chronic arthritis .   it was also extremely boring .  as the light distilled from silver to gold mort galloped across a flat  chilly landscape  checkered with cabbage fields from edge to edge .  there are many things to be said about cabbages .  one may talk at length about their high vitamin content  their vital iron contribution  the valuable roughage and commendable food value .  in the mass  however  they lack a certain something  despite their claim to immense nutritional and moral superiority over  say  daffodils  they have never been a sight to inspire the poet   s muse .  unless he was hungry  of course .  it was only twenty miles to sto lat  but in terms of meaningless human experience it seemed like two thousand .   there were guards on the gates of sto lat  although compared to the ones that patrolled ankh they had a sheepish  amateurish look .  mort trotted past and one of them  feeling a bit of a fool  asked him who went there .      i   m afraid i can   t stop     said mort .   the guard was new to the job  and quite keen .  guarding wasn   t what he   d been led to expect .  standing around all day in chain mail with an axe on a long pole wasn   t what he   d volunteered for  he   d expected excitement and challenge and a crossbow and a uniform that didn   t go rusty in the rain .   he stepped forward  ready to defend the city against people who didn   t respect commands given by duly authorized civic employees .  mort considered the pike blade hovering a few inches from his face .  there was getting to be too much of this .      on the other hand     he said calmly     how would you like it if i made you a present of this rather fine horse .      it wasn   t hard to find the entrance to the castle .  there were guards there  too  and they had crossbows and a considerably more unsympathetic outlook on life and  in any case  mort had run out of horses .  he loitered a bit until they started paying him a generous amount of attention  and then wandered disconsolately away into the streets of the little city  feeling stupid .   after all this  after miles of brassicas and a backside that now felt like a block of wood  he didn   t even know why he was there .  so she   d seen him even when he was invisible .  did it mean anything .  of course it didn   t .  only he kept seeing her face  and the flicker of hope in her eyes .  he wanted to tell her that everything was going to be all right .  he wanted to tell her about himself and everything he wanted to be .  he wanted to find out which was her room in the castle and watch it all night until the light went out .  and so on .   a little later a blacksmith  whose business was in one of the narrow streets that looked out on to the castle walls  glanced up from his work to see a tall  gangling young man  rather red in the face  who kept trying to walk through the walls .   rather later than that a young man with a few superficial bruises on his head called in at one of the city   s taverns and asked for directions to the nearest wizard .   and it was later still that mort turned up outside a peeling plaster house which announced itself on a blackened brass plaque to be the abode of igneous cutwell  dm  unseen   marster of the infinit  illuminartus  wyzard to princes  gardian of the sacred portalls  if out leave maile with mrs .  nugent next door .   suitably impressed despite his pounding heart  mort lifted the heavy knocker  which was in the shape of a repulsive gargoyle with a heavy iron ring in its mouth  and knocked twice .   there was a brief commotion from within  the series of hasty domestic sounds that might  in a less exalted house  have been made by  say  someone shoveling the lunch plates into the sink and tidying the laundry out of sight .   eventually the door swung open  slowly and mysteriously .      you   d fbetter pretend to be impreffed     said the doorknocker conversationally  but hampered somewhat by the ring .     he does it with pulleys and a bit of ftring .  no good at opening fpells  fee .      mort looked at the grinning metal face .  i work for a skeleton who can walk through walls  he told himself .  who am i to be surprised at anything .      thank you     he said .      you   re welcome .  wipe your feet on the doormat  it   s the bootfcraper   s day off .      the big low room inside was dark and shadowy and smelled mainly of incense but slightly of boiled cabbage and elderly laundry and the kind of person who throws all his socks at the wall and wears the ones that don   t stick .  there was a large crystal ball with a crack in it  an astrolabe with several bits missing  a rather scuffed octogram on the floor  and a stuffed alligator hanging from the ceiling .  a stuffed alligator is absolutely standard equipment in any properly run magical establishment .  this one looked as though it hadn   t enjoyed it much .   a bead curtain on the far wall was flung aside with a dramatic gesture and a hooded figure stood revealed .      beneficent constellations shine on the hour of our meeting .     it boomed .      which ones .     said mort .   there was a sudden worried silence .      pardon .         which constellations would these be .     said mort .      beneficent ones     said the figure  uncertainly .  it rallied .     why do you trouble igneous cutwell  holder of the eight keys  traveler in the dungeon dimensions  supreme mage of           excuse me     said mort     are you really .         really what .         master of the thingy  lord high wossname of the sacred dungeons .      cutwell pushed back his hood with an annoyed flourish .  instead of the gray bearded mystic mort had expected he saw a round  rather plump face  pink and white like a pork pie  which it somewhat resembled in other respects .  for example  like most pork pies  it didn   t have a beard and  like most pork pies  it looked basically good humored .      in a figurative sense     he said .      what does that mean .         well  it means no     said cutwell .      but you said           that was advertising     said the wizard .     it   s a kind of magic i   ve been working on .  what was it you were wanting  anyway .     he leered suggestively .     a love philter  yes .  something to encourage the young ladies .         is it possible to walk through walls .     said mort desperately .  cutwell paused with his hand already halfway to a large bottle full of sticky liquid .      using magic .         um     said mort     i don   t think so .         then pick very thin walls     said cutwell .     better still  use the door .  the one over there would be favorite  if you   ve just come here to waste my time .      mort hesitated  and then put the bag of gold coins on the table .  the wizard glanced at them  made a little whinnying noise in the back of his throat  and reached out .  mort   s hand shot across and grabbed his wrist .      i   ve walked through walls     he said  slowly and deliberately .      of course you have  of course you have     mumbled cutwell  not taking his eyes off the bag .  he flicked the cork out of the bottle of blue liquid and took an absent minded swig .      only before i did it i didn   t know that i could  and when i was doing it i didn   t know i was  and now i   ve done it i can   t remember how it was done .  and i want to do it again .         why .         because     said mort     if i could walk through walls i could do anything .         very deep     agreed cutwell .     philosophical .  and the name of the young lady on the other side of this wall .         she   s       mort swallowed .     i don   t know her name .  even if there is a girl     he added haughtily     and i   m not saying there is .         right     said cutwell .  he took another swig  and shuddered .     fine .  how to walk through walls .  i   ll do some research .  it might be expensive  though .      mort carefully picked up the bag and pulled out one small gold coin .      a down payment     he said  putting it on the table .   cutwell picked up the coin as if he expected it to go bang or evaporate  and examined it carefully .      i   ve never seen this sort of coin before     he said accusingly .     what   s all this curly writing .         it   s gold  though  isn   t it .     said mort .     i mean  you don   t have to accept it           sure  sure  it   s gold     said cutwell hurriedly .     it   s gold all right .  i just wondered where it had come from  that   s all .         you wouldn   t believe me     said mort .     what time   s sunset around here .         we normally manage to fit it in between night and day     said cutwell  still staring at the coin and taking little sips from the blue bottle .     about now .      mort glanced out of the window .  the street outside already had a twilight look to it .      i   ll be back     he muttered  and made for the door .  he heard the wizard call out something  but mort was heading down the street at a dead run .   he started to panic .  death would be waiting for him forty miles away .  there would be a row .  there would be a terrible     ah  boy .   a familiar figure stepped out from the flare around a jellied eel stall  holding a plate of winkles .   the vinegar is particularly piquant .  help yourself  i have an extra pin .   but  of course  just because he was forty miles away didn   t mean he wasn   t here as well    .   and in his untidy room cutwell turned the gold coin over and over in his fingers  muttering    walls    to himself  and draining the bottle .   he appeared to notice what he was doing only when there was no more to drink  at which point his eyes focused on the bottle and  through a rising pink mist  read the label which said    granny weatherwax   s ramrub invigoratore and passion   s philter  onne spoonful onlie before bed and that smalle .             by myself .     said mort .   certainly .  i have every faith in you .      gosh .      the suggestion put everything else out of mort   s mind  and he was rather surprised to find that he didn   t feel particularly squeamish .  he   d seen quite a few deaths in the last week or so  and all the horror went out of it when you knew you   d be speaking to the victim afterwards .  most of them were relieved  one or two of them were angry  but they were all glad of a few helpful words .   think you can do it .      well  sir .  yes .  i think .      that   s the spirit .  i   ve left binky by the horsetrough round the corner .  take him straight home when you   ve finished .      you   re staying here  sir .      death looked up and down the street .  his eyesockets flared .   i thought i might stroll around a bit  he said mysteriously .  i don   t seem to feel quite right .  i could do with the fresh air .  he seemed to remember something  reached into the mysterious shadows of his cloak  and pulled out three hourglasses .   all straightforward  he said .  enjoy yourself .   he turned and strode off down the street  humming .      um .  thank you     said mort .  he held the hourglasses up to the light  noting the one that was on its very last few grains of sand .      does this mean i   m in charge .     he called  but death had turned the corner .   binky greeted him with a faint whinny of recognition .  mort mounted up  his heart pounding with apprehension and responsibility .  his fingers worked automatically  taking the scythe out of its sheath and adjusting and locking the blade  which flashed steely blue in the night  slicing the starlight like salami  .  he mounted carefully  wincing at the stab from his saddlesores  but binky was like riding a pillow .  as an afterthought  drunk with delegated authority  he pulled death   s riding cloak out of its saddlebag and fastened it by its silver brooch .   he took another look at the first hourglass  and nudged binky with his knees .  the horse sniffed the chilly air  and began to trot .   behind them cutwell burst out of his doorway  accelerating down the frosty street with his robes flying out behind him .   now the horse was cantering  widening the distance between its hooves and the cobbles .  with a swish of its tail it cleared the housetops and floated up into the chilly sky .   cutwell ignored it .  he had more pressing things on his mind .  he took a flying leap and landed full length in the freezing waters of the horsetrough  lying back gratefully among the bobbing ice splinters .  after a while the water began to steam .  mort kept low for the sheer exhilaration of the speed .  the sleeping countryside roared soundlessly underneath .  binky moved at an easy gallop  his great muscles sliding under his skin as easily as alligators off a sandbank  his mane whipping in mort   s face .  the night swirled away from the speeding edge of the scythe  cut into two curling halves .   they sped under the moonlight as silent as a shadow  visible only to cats and people who dabbled in things men were not meant to wot of .   mort couldn   t remember afterwards  but very probably he laughed .   soon the frosty plains gave way to the broken lands around the mountains  and then the marching ranks of the ramtops themselves raced across the world towards them .  binky put his head down and opened his stride  aiming for a pass between two mountains as sharp as goblins    teeth in the silver light .  somewhere a wolf howled .   mort took another look at the hourglass .  its frame was carved with oak leaves and mandrake roots  and the sand inside  even by moonlight  was pale gold .  by turning the glass this way and that  he could just make out the name    ammeline hamstring    etched in the faintest of lines .   binky slowed to a canter .  mort looked down at the roof of a forest  dusted with snow that was either early or very  very late  it could have been either  because the ramtops hoarded their weather and doled it out with no real reference to the time of year .   a gap opened up beneath them .  binky slowed again  wheeled around and descended towards a clearing that was white with drifted snow .  it was circular  with a tiny cottage in the exact middle .  if the ground around it hadn   t been covered in snow  mort would have noticed that there were no tree stumps to be seen  the trees hadn   t been cut down in the circle  they   d simply been discouraged from growing there .  or had moved away .   candlelight spilled from one downstairs window  making a pale orange pool on the snow .   binky touched down smoothly and trotted across the freezing crust without sinking .  he left no hoofprints  of course .   mort dismounted and walked towards the door  muttering to himself and making experimental sweeps with the scythe .   the cottage roof had been built with wide eaves  to shed snow and cover the logpile .  no dweller in the high ramtops would dream of starting a winter without a logpile on three sides of the house .  but there wasn   t a logpile here  even though spring was still a long way off .   there was  however  a bundle of hay in a net by the door .  it had a note attached  written in big  slightly shaky capitals  for thee hors .   it would have worried mort if he   d let it .  someone was expecting him .  he   d learned in recent days  though  that rather than drown in uncertainty it was best to surf right over the top of it .  anyway  binky wasn   t worried by moral scruples and bit straight in .   it did leave the problem of whether to knock .  somehow  it didn   t seem appropriate .  supposing no one answered  or told him to go away .   so he lifted the thumb latch and pushed at the door .  it swung inwards quite easily  without a creak .   there was a low ceilinged kitchen  its beams at trepanning height for mort .  the light from the solitary candle glinted off crockery on a long dresser and flagstones that had been scrubbed and polished into iridescence .  the fire in the cave like inglenook didn   t add much light  because it was no more than a heap of white ash under the remains of a log .  mort knew  without being told  that it was the last log .   an elderly lady was sitting at the kitchen table  writing furiously with her hooked nose only a few inches from the paper .  a gray cat curled on the table beside her blinked calmly at mort .   the scythe bumped off a beam .  the woman looked up .      be with you in a minute     she said .  she frowned at the paper .     i haven   t put in the bit about being of sound mind and body yet  lot of foolishness anyway  no one sound in mind and body would be dead .  would you like a drink .         pardon .     said mort .  he recalled himself  and repeated    pardon .         if you drink  that is .  it   s raspberry port .  on the dresser .  you might as well finish the bottle .      mort eyed the dresser suspiciously .  he felt he   d rather lost the initiative .  he pulled out the hourglass and glared at it .  there was a little heap of sand left .      there   s still a few minutes yet     said the witch  without looking up .      how  i mean  how do you know .      she ignored him  and dried the ink in front of the candle  sealed the letter with a drip of wax  and tucked it under the candlestick .  then she picked up the cat .      granny beedle will be around directly tomorrow to tidy up and you   re to go with her  understand .  and see she lets gammer nutley have the pink marble washstand  she   s had her eye on it for years .      the cat yawped knowingly .      i haven   t  that is  i haven   t got all night  you know     said mort reproachfully .      you have  i haven   t  and there   s no need to shout     said the witch .  she slid off her stall and then mort saw how bent she was  like a bow .  with some difficulty she unhooked a tall pointed hat from its nail on the wall  skewered it into place on her white hair with a battery of hatpins  and grasped two walking sticks .   she tottered across the floor towards mort  and looked up at him with eyes as small and bright as blackcurrants .      will i need my shawl .  shall i need a shawl  d   you think .  no  i suppose not .  i imagine it   s quite warm where i   m going .     she peered closely at mort  and frowned .      you   re rather younger than i imagined     she said .  mort said nothing .  then goodie hamstring said  quietly     you know  i don   t think you   re who i was expecting at all .      mort cleared his throat .      who were you expecting  precisely .     he said .      death     said the witch  simply .     it   s part of the arrangement  you see .  one gets to know the time of one   s death in advance  and one is guaranteed   personal attention .         i   m it     said mort .      it .         the personal attention .  he sent me .  i work for him .  no one else would have me .     mort paused .  this was all wrong .  he   d be sent home again in disgrace .  his first bit of responsibility  and he   d ruined it .  he could already hear people laughing at him .   the wail started in the depths of his embarrassment and blared out like a foghorn .     only this is my first real job and it   s all gone wrong .      the scythe fell to the floor with a clatter  slicing a piece off the table leg and cutting a flagstone in half .   goodie watched him for some time  with her head on one side .  then she said     i see .  what is your name  young man .         mort     sniffed mort .     short for mortimer .         well  mort  i expect you   ve got an hourglass somewhere about your person .      mort nodded vaguely .  he reached down to his belt and produced the glass .  the witch inspected it critically .      still a minute or so     she said .     we don   t have much time to lose .  just give me a moment to lock up .         but you don   t understand .     mort wailed .     i   ll mess it all up .  i   ve never done this before .      she patted his hand .     neither have i     she said .     we can learn together .  now pick up the scythe and try to act your age  there   s a good boy .      against his protestations she shooed him out into the snow and followed behind him  pulling the door shut and locking it with a heavy iron key which she hung on a nail by the door .   the frost had tightened its grip on the forest  squeezing it until the roots creaked .  the moon was setting  but the sky was full of hard white stars that made the winter seem colder still .  goodie hamstring shivered .      there   s an old log over there     she said conversationally .     there   s quite a good view across the valley .  in the summertime  of course .  i should like to sit down .      mort helped her through the drifts and brushed as much snow as possible off the wood .  they sat down with the hourglass between them .  whatever the view might have been in the summer  it now consisted of black rocks against a sky from which little flakes of snow were now tumbling .      i can   t believe all this     said mort .     i mean you sound as if you want to die .         there   s some things i shall miss     she said .     but it gets thin  you know .  life  i   m referring to .  you can   t trust your own body any more  and it   s time to move on .  i reckon it   s about time i tried something else .  did he tell you magical folk can see him all the time .         no     said mort  inaccurately .      well  we can .         he doesn   t like wizards and witches much     mort volunteered .      nobody likes a smartass     she said with some satisfaction .     we give him trouble  you see .  priests don   t  so he likes priests .         he   s never said     said mort .      ah .  they   re always telling folk how much better it   s going to be when they   re dead .  we tell them it could be pretty good right here if only they   d put their minds to it .      mort hesitated .  he wanted to say  you   re wrong  he   s not like that at all  he doesn   t care if people are good or bad so long as they   re punctual .  and kind to cats  he added .   but he thought better of it .  it occurred to him that people needed to believe things .   the wolf howled again  so near that mort looked around apprehensively .  another one across the valley answered it .  the chorus was picked up by a couple of others in the depths of the forest .  mort had never heard anything so mournful .   he glanced sideways at the still figure of goodie hamstring and then  with mounting panic  at the hourglass .  he sprang to his feet  snatched up the scythe  and brought it around in a two handed swing .   the witch stood up  leaving her body behind .      well done     she said .     i thought you   d missed it  for a minute  there .      mort leaned against a tree  panting heavily  and watched goodie walk around the log to look at herself .      hmm     she said critically .     time has got a lot to answer for .     she raised her hand and laughed to see the stars through it .   then she changed .  mort had seen this happen before  when the soul realized it was no longer bound by the body   s morphic field  but never under such control .  her hair unwound itself from its tight bun  changing color and lengthening .  her body straightened up .  wrinkles dwindled and vanished .  her gray woolen dress moved like the surface of the sea and ended up tracing entirely different and disturbing contours .   she looked down  giggled  and changed the dress into something leaf green and clingy .      what do you think  mort .     she said .  her voice had sounded cracked and quavery before .  now it suggested musk and maple syrup and other things that set mort   s adam   s apple bobbing like a rubber ball on an elastic band .             he managed  and gripped the scythe until his knuckles went white .   she walked towards him like a snake in a four wheel drift .      i didn   t hear you     she purred .      v v very nice     he said .     is that who you were .         it   s who i   ve always been .         oh .     mort stared at his feet .     i   m supposed to take you away     he said .      i know     she said     but i   m going to stay .         you can   t do that .  i mean       he fumbled for words      you see  if you stay you sort of spread out and get thinner  until           i shall enjoy it     she said firmly .  she leaned forward and gave him a kiss as insubstantial as a mayfly   s sigh  fading as she did so until only the kiss was left  just like a cheshire cat only much more erotic .      have a care  mort     said her voice in his head .     you may want to hold on to your job  but will you ever be able to let go .      mort stood idiotically holding his cheek .  the trees around the clearing trembled for a moment  there was the sound of laughter on the breeze  and then the freezing silence closed in again .   duty called out to him through the pink mists in his head .  he grabbed the second glass and stared at it .  the sand was nearly all gone .   the glass itself was patterned with lotus petals .  when mort flicked it with his finger it went    ommm .      he ran across the crackling snow to binky and hurled himself into the saddle .  the horse threw up his head  reared  and launched itself towards the stars .       great silent streamers of blue and green flame hung from the roof of the world .  curtains of octarine glow danced slowly and majestically over the disc as the fire of the aurora coriolis  the vast discharge of magic from the disc   s standing field  earthed itself in the green ice mountains of the .  hub .   the central spire of cori celesti  home of the gods  was a ten mile high column of cold coruscating fire .   it was a sight seen by few people  and mort wasn   t one of them  because he lay low over binky   s neck and clung on for his life as they pounded through the night sky ahead of a comet trail of steam .   there were other mountains clustered around cori .  by comparison they were no more than termite mounds  although in reality each one was a majestic assortment of cols  ridges  faces  cliffs  screes and glaciers that any normal mountain range would be happy to associate with .   among the highest of them  at the end of a funnel shaped valley  dwelt the listeners .   they were one of the oldest of the disc   s religious sects  although even the gods themselves were divided as to whether listening was really a proper religion  and all that prevented their temple being wiped out by a few well aimed avalanches was the fact that even the gods were curious as to what it was that the listeners might hear .  if there   s one thing that really annoys a god  it   s not knowing something .   it   ll take mort several minutes to arrive .  a row of dots would fill in the time nicely  but the reader will already be noticing the strange shape of the temple   curled like a great white ammonite at the end of the valley   and will probably want an explanation .   the fact is that the listeners are trying to work out precisely what it was that the creator said when he made the universe .   the theory is quite straightforward .   clearly  nothing that the creator makes could ever be destroyed  which means that the echoes of those first syllables must still be around somewhere  bouncing and rebounding off all the matter in the cosmos but still audible to a really good listener .   eons ago the listeners had found that ice and chance had carved this one valley into the perfect acoustic opposite of an echo valley  and had built their multi chambered temple in the exact position that the one comfy chair always occupies in the home of a rabid hi fi fanatic .  complex baffles caught and amplified the sound that was funneled up the chilly valley  steering it ever inwards to the central chamber where  at any hour of the day or night  three monks always sat .   listening .   there were certain problems caused by the fact that they didn   t hear only the subtle echoes of the first words  but every other sound made on the disc .  in order to recognize the sound of the words  they had to learn to recognize all the other noises .  this called for a certain talent  and a novice was only accepted for training if he could distinguish by sound alone  at a distance of a thousand yards  which side a dropped coin landed .  he wasn   t actually accepted into the order until he could tell what color it was .   and although the holy listeners were so remote  many people took the extremely long and dangerous path to their temple  traveling through frozen  troll haunted lands  fording swift icy rivers  climbing forbidding mountains  trekking across inhospitable tundra  in order to climb the narrow stairway that led into the hidden valley and seek with an open heart the secrets of being .   and the monks would cry unto them     keep the bloody noise down .      binky came through the mountain tops like a white blur  touching down in the snowy emptiness of a courtyard made spectral by the disco light from the sky .  mort leapt from his back and ran through the silent cloisters to the room where the   th abbot lay dying  surrounded by his devout followers .   mort   s footsteps boomed as he hurried across the intricate mosaic floor .  the monks themselves wore woolen overshoes .   he reached the bed and waited for a moment  leaning on the scythe  until he could get his breath back .   the abbot  who was small and totally bald and had more wrinkles than a sackful of prunes  opened his eyes .      you   re late     he whispered  and died .   mort swallowed  fought for breath  and brought the scythe around in a slow arc .  nevertheless  it was accurate enough  the abbot sat up  leaving his corpse behind .      not a moment too soon     he said  in a voice only mort could hear .     you had me worried for a moment there .         okay .     said mort .     only i   ve got to rush        the abbot swung himself off the bed and walked towards mort through the ranks of his bereaved followers .      don   t rush off     he said .     i always look forward to these talks .  what   s happened to the usual fellow .         usual fellow .     said mort  bewildered .      tall chap .  black cloak .  doesn   t get enough to eat  by the look of him     said the abbot .      usual fellow .  you mean death .     said mort .      that   s him     said the abbot  cheerfully .  mort   s mouth hung open .      die a lot  do you .     he managed .      a fair bit .  a fair bit .  of course     said the abbot     once you get the hang of it  it   s only a matter of practice .         it is .         we must be off     said the abbot .  mort   s mouth snapped shut .      that   s what i   ve been trying to say     he said .      so if you could just drop me off down in the valley     the little monk continued placidly .  he swept past mort and headed for the courtyard .  mort stared at the floor for a moment  and then ran after him in a way which he knew to be extremely unprofessional and undignified .      now look       he began .      the other one had a horse called binky  i remember     said the abbot pleasantly .     did you buy the round off him .         the round .     said mort  now completely lost .      or whatever .  forgive me     said the abbot     i don   t really know how these things are organized  lad .         mort     said mort  absently .     and i think you   re supposed to come back with me  sir .  if you don   t mind     he added  in what he hoped was a firm and authoritative manner .  the monk turned and smiled pleasantly at him .      i wish i could     he said .     perhaps one day .  now  if you could give me a lift as far as the nearest village  i imagine i   m being conceived about now .         conceived .  but you   ve just died .     said mort .      yes  but  you see  i have what you might call a season ticket     the abbot explained .   light dawned on mort  but very slowly .      oh     he said     i   ve read about this .  reincarnation  yes .         that   s the word .  fifty three times so far .  or fifty four .      binky looked up as they approached and gave a short neigh of recognition when the abbot patted his nose .  mort mounted up and helped the abbot up behind him .      it must be very interesting     he said  as binky climbed away from the temple .  on the absolute scale of small talk this comment must rate minus quite a lot  but mort couldn   t think of anything better .      no  it mustn   t     said the abbot .     you think it must be because you believe i can remember all my lives  but of course i can   t .  not while i   m alive  anyway .         i hadn   t thought of that     mort conceded .      imagine toilet training fifty times .         nothing to look back on  i imagine     said mort .      you   re right .  if i had my time all over again i wouldn   t reincarnate .  and just when i   m getting the hang of things  the lads come down from the temple looking for a boy conceived at the hour the old abbot died .  talk about unimaginative .  stop here a moment  please .      mort looked down .      we   re in mid air     he said doubtfully .      i won   t keep you a minute .     the abbot slid down from binky   s back  walked a few steps on thin air  and shouted .   it seemed to go on for a long time .  then the abbot climbed back again .      you don   t know how long i   ve been looking forward to that     he said .   there was a village in a lower valley a few miles from the temple  which acted as a sort of service industry .  from the air it was a random scattering of small but extremely well soundproofed huts .      anywhere will do     the abbot said .  mort left him standing a few feet above the snow at a point where the huts appeared to be thickest .      hope the next lifetime improves     he said .  the abbot shrugged .      one can always hope     he said .     i get a nine month break  anyway .  the scenery isn   t much  but at least it   s in the warm .         goodbye  then     said mort .     i   ve got to rush .         au revoir     said the abbot  sadly  and turned away .   the fires of the hub lights were still casting their flickering illumination across the landscape .  mort sighed  and reached for the third glass .   the container was silver  decorated with small crowns .  there was hardly any sand left .   mort  feeling that the night had thrown everything at him and couldn   t get any worse  turned it around carefully to get a glimpse of the name    .       princess keli awoke .   there had been a sound like someone making no noise at all .  forget peas and mattresses   sheer natural selection had established over the years that the royal families that survived longest were those whose members could distinguish an assassin in the dark by the noise he was clever enough not to make  because  in court circles  there was always someone ready to cut the heir with a knife .   she lay in bed  wondering what to do next .  there was a dagger under her pillow .  she started to slide one hand up the sheets  while peering around the room with half closed eyes in search of unfamiliar shadows .  she was well aware that if she indicated in any way that she was not asleep she would never wake up again .   some light came into the room from the big window at the far end  but the suits of armor  tapestries and assorted paraphernalia that littered the room could have provided cover for an army .   the knife had dropped down behind the bedhead .  she probably wouldn   t have used it properly anyway .   screaming for the guards  she decided  was not a good idea .  if there was anyone in the room then the guards must have been overpowered  or at least stunned by a large sum of money .   there was a warming pan on the flagstones by the fire .  would it make a weapon .   there was a faint metallic sound .   perhaps screaming wouldn   t be such a bad idea after all    .   the window imploded .  for an instant keli saw  framed against a hell of blue and purple flames  a hooded figure crouched on the back of the largest horse she had ever seen .   there was someone standing by the bed  with a knife half raised .   in slow motion  she watched fascinated as the arm went up and the horse galloped at glacier speed across the floor .  now the knife was above her  starting its descent  and the horse was rearing and the rider was standing in the stirrups and swinging some sort of weapon and its blade tore through the slow air with a noise like a finger on the rim of a wet glass     the light vanished .  there was a soft thump on the floor  followed by a metallic clatter .  keli took a deep breath .   a hand was briefly laid across her mouth and a worried voice said     if you scream  i   ll regret it .  please .  i   m in enough trouble as it is .      anyone who could get that amount of bewildered pleading into their voice was either genuine or such a good actor they wouldn   t have to bother with assassination for a living .  she said     who are you .         i don   t know if i   m allowed to tell you     said the voice .     you are still alive  aren   t you .      she bit down the sarcastic reply just in time .  something about the tone of the question worried her .      can   t you tell .     she said .      it   s not easy    .     there was a pause .  she strained to see in the darkness  to put a face around that voice .     i may have done you some terrible harm     it added .      haven   t you just saved my life .         i don   t know what i have saved  actually .  is there some light around here .         the maid sometimes leaves matches on the mantelpiece     said keli .  she felt the presence beside her move away .  there were a few hesitant footsteps  a couple of thumps  and finally a clang  although the word isn   t sufficient to describe the real ripe cacophony of falling metal that filled the room .  it was even followed by the traditional little tinkle a couple of seconds after you thought it was all over .   the voice said  rather indistinctly     i   m under a suit of armor .  where should i be .      keli slid quietly out of bed  felt her way towards the fireplace  located the bundle of matches by the faint light from the dying fire  struck one in a burst of sulfurous smoke  lit a candle  found the pile of dismembered armor  pulled its sword from its scabbard and then nearly swallowed her tongue .   someone had just blown hot and wetly in her ear .      that   s binky     said the heap .     he   s just trying to be friendly .  i expect he   d like some hay  if you   ve got any .      with royal self control  keli said     this is the fourth floor .  it   s a lady   s bedroom .  you   d be amazed at how many horses we don   t get up here .         oh .  could you help me up  please .      she put the sword down and pulled aside a breastplate .  a thin white face stared back at her .      first  you   d better tell me why i shouldn   t send for the guards anyway    she said .     even being in my bedroom could get you tortured to death .      she glared at him .   finally he said     well   could you let my hand free  please .  thank you   firstly  the guards probably wouldn   t see me  secondly  you   ll never find out why i   m here and you look as though you   d hate not to know  and thirdly    .         thirdly what .     she said .   his mouth opened and shut .  mort wanted to say  thirdly  you   re so beautiful  or at least very attractive  or anyway far more attractive than any other girl i   ve ever met  although admittedly i haven   t met very many .  from this it will be seen that mort   s innate honesty will never make him a poet  if mort ever compared a girl to a summer   s day  it would be followed by a thoughtful explanation of what day he had in mind and whether it was raining at the time .  in the circumstances  it was just as well that he couldn   t find his voice .   keli held up the candle and looked at the window .   it was whole .  the stone frames were unbroken .  every pane  with its stained glass representatives of the sto lat coat of arms  was complete .  she looked back at mort .      never mind thirdly     she said     let   s get back to secondly .      an hour later dawn reached the city .  daylight on the disc flows rather than rushes  because light is slowed right down by the world   s standing magical field  and it rolled across the flat lands like a golden sea .  the city on the mound stood out like a sandcastle in the tide for a moment  until the day swirled around it and crept onwards .   mort and keli sat side by side on her bed .  the hourglass lay between them .  there was no sand left in the top bulb .   from outside came the sounds of the castle waking up .      i still don   t understand this     she said .     does it mean i   m dead  or doesn   t it .         it means you ought to be dead     he said     according to fate or whatever .  i haven   t really studied the theory .         and you should have killed me .         no .  i mean  no  the assassin should have killed you .  i did try to explain all that     said mort .      why didn   t you let him .      mort looked at her in horror .      did you want to die .         of course i didn   t .  but it looks as though what people want doesn   t come into it  does it .  i   m trying to be sensible about this .      mort stared at his knees .  then he stood up .      i think i   d better be going     he said coldly .   he folded up the scythe and stuck it into its sheath behind the saddle .  then he looked at the window .      you came through that     said keli  helpfully .     look  when i said           does it open .         no .  there   s a balcony along the passage .  but people will see you .      mort ignored her  pulled open the door and led binky out into the corridor .  keli ran after them .  a maid stopped  curtsied  and frowned slightly as her brain wisely dismissed the sight of a very large horse walking along the carpet .   the balcony overlooked one of the inner courtyards .  mort glanced over the parapet  and then mounted .      watch out for the duke     he said .     he   s behind all this .         my father always warned me about him     said the princess .     i   ve got a foodtaster .         you should get a bodyguard as well     said mort .     i must go .  i have important things to do .  farewell     he added  in what he hoped was the right tone of injured pride .      shall i see you again .     said keli .     there   s lots i want to           that might not be a good idea  if you think about it     said mort haughtily .  he clicked his tongue  and binky leapt into the air  cleared the parapet and cantered up into the blue morning sky .      i wanted to say thank you .     keli yelled after him .   the maid  who couldn   t get over the feeling that something was wrong and had followed her  said     are you all right  ma   am .      keli looked at her distractedly .      what .     she demanded .      i just wondered if   everything was all right .      keli   s shoulders sagged .      no     she said .     everything   s all wrong .  there   s a dead assassin in my bedroom .  could you please have something done about it .      and       she held up a hand      i don   t want you to say    dead  ma   am .     or    assassin  ma   am .     or scream or anything  i just want you to get something done about it .  quietly .  i think i   ve got a headache .  so just nod .      the maid nodded  bobbed uncertainly  and backed away .       mort wasn   t sure how he got back .  the sky simply changed from ice blue to sullen gray as binky eased himself into the gap between dimensions .  he didn   t land on the dark soil of death   s estate  it was simply there  underfoot  as though an aircraft carrier had gently maneuvered itself under a jumpjet to save the pilot all the trouble of touching down .   the great horse trotted into the stableyard and halted outside the double door  swishing his tail .  mort slid off and ran for the house .   and stopped  and ran back  and filled the hayrack  and ran for the house  and stopped and muttered to himself and ran back and rubbed the horse down and checked the water bucket  and ran for the house  and ran back and fetched the horseblanket down from its hook on the wall and buckled it on .  binky gave him a dignified nuzzle .   no one seemed to be about as mort slipped in by the back door and made his way to the library  where even at this time of night the air seemed to be made of hot dry dust .  it seemed to take years to locate princess keli   s biography  but he found it eventually .  it was a depressingly slim volume on a shelf only reachable by the library ladder  a wheeled rickety structure that strongly resembled an early siege engine .   with trembling fingers he opened it at the last page  and groaned .      the princess   s assassination at the age of fifteen     he read     was followed by the union of sto lat with sto helit and  indirectly  the collapse of the city states of the central plain and the rise of        he read on  unable to stop .  occasionally he groaned again .   finally he put the book back  hesitated  and then shoved it behind a few other volumes .  he could still feel it there as he climbed down the ladder  shrieking its incriminating existence to the world .   there were few ocean going ships on the disc .  no captain liked to venture out of sight of a coastline .  it was a sorry fact that ships which looked from a distance as though they were going over the edge of the world weren   t in fact disappearing over the horizon  they were in fact dropping over the edge of the world .   every generation or so a few enthusiastic explorers doubted this and set out to prove it wrong .  strangely enough  none of them had ever come back to announce the result of their researches .   the following analogy would  therefore  have been meaningless to mort .   he felt as if he   d been shipwrecked on the titanic but in the nick of time had been rescued .  by the lusitania .   he felt as though he   d thrown a snowball on the spur of the moment and watched the ensuing avalanche engulf three ski resorts .   he felt history unraveling all around him .   he felt he needed someone to talk to  quickly .   that had to mean either albert or ysabell  because the thought of explaining everything to those tiny blue pinpoints was not one he cared to contemplate after a long night .  on the rare occasions ysabell deigned to look in his direction she made it clear that the only difference between mort and a dead toad was the color .  as for albert    .   all right  not the perfect confidant  but definitely the best in a field of one .   mort slid down the steps and threaded his way back through the bookshelves .  a few hours    sleep would be a good idea  too .   then he heard a gasp  the brief patter of running feet  and the slam of a door .  when he peered around the nearest bookcase there was nothing there except a stool with a couple of books on it .  he picked one up and glanced at the name  then read a few pages .  there was a damp lace handkerchief lying next to it .       mort rose late  and hurried towards the kitchen expecting at any moment the deep tones of disapproval .  nothing happened .   albert was at the stone sink  gazing thoughtfully at his chip pan  probably wondering whether it was time to change the fat or let it bide for another year .  he turned as mort slid into a chair .      you had a busy time of it  then     he said .     gallivanting all over the place until all hours  i heard .  i could do you an egg .  or there   s porridge .         egg  please     said mort .  he   d never plucked up the courage to try albert   s porridge  which led a private life of its own in the depths of its saucepan and ate spoons .      the master wants to see you after     albert added     but he said you wasn   t to rush .         oh .     mort stared at the table .     did he say anything else .         he said he hadn   t had an evening off in a thousand years     said albert .     he was humming .  i don   t like it .  i   ve never seen him like this .         oh .     mort took the plunge .     albert  have you been here long .      albert looked at him over the top of his spectacles .      maybe     he said .     it   s hard to keep track of outside time  boy .  i bin here since just after the old king died .         which king  albert .         artorollo  i think he was called .  little fat man .  squeaky voice .  i only saw him the once  though .         where was this .         in ankh  of course .         what .     said mort .     they don   t have kings in ankh morpork  everyone knows that .         this was back a bit  i said     said albert .  he poured himself a cup of tea from death   s personal teapot and sat down  a dreamy look in his crusted eyes .  mort waited expectantly .      and they was kings in those days  real kings  not like the sort you get now .  they was monarchs     continued albert  carefully pouring some tea into his saucer and fanning it primly with the end of his muffler .     i mean  they was wise and fair  well  fairly wise .  and they wouldn   t think twice about cutting your head off soon as look at you     he added approvingly .     and all the queens were tall and pale and wore them balaclava helmet things           wimples .     said mort .      yeah  them  and the princesses were beautiful as the day is long and so noble they  they could pee through a dozen mattresses           what .      albert hesitated .     something like that  anyway     he conceded .     and there was balls and tournaments and executions .  great days .     he smiled dreamily at his memories .      not like the sort of days you get now     he said  emerging from his reverie with bad grace .      have you got any other names  albert .     said mort .  but the brief spell had been broken and the old man wasn   t going to be drawn .      oh  i know     he snapped     get albert   s name and you   ll go and look him up in the library  won   t you .  prying and poking .  i know you  skulking in there at all hours reading the lives of young wimmen        the heralds of guilt must have flourished their tarnished trumpets in the depths of mort   s eyes  because albert cackled and prodded him with a bony finger .      you might at least put them back where you find    em     he said     not leave piles of    em around for old albert to put back .  anyway  it   s not right  ogling the poor dead things .  it probably turns you blind .         but i only       mort began  and remembered the damp lace handkerchief in his pocket  and shut up .   he left albert grumbling to himself and doing the washing up  and slipped into the library .  pale sunlight lanced down from the high windows  gently fading the covers on the patient  ancient volumes .  occasionally a speck of dust would catch the light as it floated through the golden shafts  and flare like a miniature supernova .   mort knew that if he listened hard enough he could hear the insect like scotching of the books as they wrote themselves .   once upon a time mort would have found it eerie .  now it was   reassuring .  it demonstrated that the universe was running smoothly .  his conscience  which had been looking for the opening  gleefully reminded him that  all right  it might be running smoothly but it certainly wasn   t heading in the right direction .   he made his way through the maze of shelves to the mysterious pile of books  and found it was gone .  albert had been in the kitchen  and mort had never seen death himself enter the library .  what was ysabell looking for  then .   he glanced up at the cliff of shelves above him  and his stomach went cold when he thought of what was starting to happen    .   there was nothing for it .  he   d have to tell someone .       keli  meanwhile  was also finding life difficult .   this was because causality had an incredible amount of inertia .  mort   s misplaced thrust  driven by anger and desperation and nascent love  had sent it down a new track but it hadn   t noticed yet .  he   d kicked the tail of the dinosaur  but it would be some time before the other end realized it was time to say    ouch .      bluntly  the universe knew keli was dead and was therefore rather surprised to find that she hadn   t stopped walking and breathing yet .   it showed it in little ways .  the courtiers who gave her furtive odd looks during the morning would not have been able to say why the sight of her made them feel strangely uncomfortable .  to their acute embarrassment and her annoyance they found themselves ignoring her  or talking in hushed voices .   the chamberlain found he   d instructed that the royal standard be flown at half mast and for the life of him couldn   t explain why .  he was gently led off to his bed with a mild nervous affliction after ordering a thousand yards of black bunting for no apparent reason .   the eerie  unreal feeling soon spread throughout the castle .  the head coachman ordered the state bier to be brought out again and polished  and then stood in the stable yard and wept into his chamois leather because he couldn   t remember why .  servants walked softly along the corridors .  the cook had to fight an overpowering urge to prepare simple banquets of cold meat .  dogs howled and then stopped  feeling rather stupid .  the two black stallions who traditionally pulled the sto lat funeral cortege grew restive in their stalls and nearly kicked a groom to death .   in his castle in sto helit  the duke waited in vain for a messenger who had in fact set out  but had stopped halfway down the street  unable to remember what it was he was supposed to be doing .   through all this keli moved like a solid and increasingly more irritated ghost .   things came to a head at lunchtime .  she swept into the great hall and found no place had been set in front of the royal chair .  by speaking loudly and distinctly to the butler she managed to get that rectified  then saw dishes being passed in front of her before she could get a fork into them .  she watched in sullen disbelief as the wine was brought in and poured first for the lord of the privy closet .   it was an unregal thing to do  but she stuck out a foot and tripped the wine waiter .  he stumbled  muttered something under his breath  and stared down at the flagstones .   she leaned the other way and shouted into the ear of the yeoman of the pantry     can you see me  man .  why are we reduced to eating cold pork and ham .      he turned aside from his hushed conversation with the lady of the small hexagonal room in the north turret  gave her a long look in which shock made way for a sort of unfocused puzzlement  and said     why  yes   i can   er    .         your royal highness     prompted keli .      but   yes   highness     he muttered .  there was a heavy pause .   then  as if switched back on  he turned his back on her and resumed his conversation .   keli sat for a while  white with shock and anger  then pushed the chair back and stormed away to her chambers .  a couple of servants sharing a quick rollup in the passage outside were knocked sideways by something they couldn   t quite see .   keli ran into her room and hauled on the rope that should have sent the duty maid running in from the sitting room at the end of the corridor .  nothing happened for some time  and then the door was pushed open slowly and a face peered in at her .   she recognized the look this time  and was ready for it .  she grabbed the maid by the shoulders and hauled her bodily into the room  slamming the door shut behind her .  as the frightened woman stared everywhere but at keli she hauled off and fetched her a stinging slap across the cheek .      did you feel that .  did you feel it .     she shrieked .      but   you       the maid whimpered  staggering backwards until she hit the bed and sitting down heavily on it .      look at me .  look at me when i talk to you .     yelled keli  advancing on her .     you can see me  can   t you .  tell me you can see me or i   ll have you executed .      the maid stared into her terrified eyes .      i can see you     she said     but    .         but what .  but what .         surely you   re   i heard   i thought    .         what did you think .     snapped keli .  she wasn   t shouting any more .  her words came out like white hot whips .   the maid collapsed into a sobbing heap .  keli stood tapping her foot for a moment  and then shook the woman gently .      is there a wizard in the city .     she said .     look at me  at me .  there   s a wizard  isn   t there .  you girls are always skulking off to talk to wizards .  where does he live .      the woman turned a tear stained face towards her  fighting against every instinct that told her the princess didn   t exist .      uh   wizard  yes   cutwell  in wall street    .      keli   s lips compressed into a thin smile .  she wondered where her cloaks were kept  but cold reason told her it was going to be a damn sight easier to find them herself than try to make her presence felt to the maid .  she waited  watching closely  as the woman stopped sobbing  looked around her in vague bewilderment  and hurried out of the room .   she   s forgotten me already  she thought .  she looked at her hands .  she seemed solid enough .   it had to be magic .   she wandered into her robing room and experimentally opened a few cupboards until she found a black cloak and hood .  she slipped them on and darted out into the corridor and down the servants    stairs .   she hadn   t been this way since she was little .  this was the world of linen cupboards  bare floors and dumb waiters .  it smelled of slightly stale crusts .   keli moved through it like an earthbound spook .  she was aware of the servants    quarters  of course  in the same way that people are aware at some level in their minds of the drains or the guttering  and she would be quite prepared to concede that although servants all looked pretty much alike they must have some distinguishing features by which their nearest and dearest could  presumably  identify them .  but she was not prepared for sights like moghedron the wine butler  whom she had hitherto seen only as a stately presence  moving like a galleon under full sail  sitting in his pantry with his jacket undone and smoking a pipe .   a couple of maids ran past her without a second glance  giggling .  she hurried on  aware that in some strange way she was trespassing in her own castle .   and that  she realized  was because it wasn   t her castle at all .  the noisy world around her  with its steaming laundries and chilly stillrooms  was its own world .  she couldn   t own it .  possibly it owned her .   she took a chicken leg from the table in the biggest kitchen  a cavern lined with so many pots that by the light of its fires it looked like an armory for tortoises  and felt the unfamiliar thrill of theft .  theft .  in her own kingdom .  and the cook looked straight through her  eyes as glazed as jugged ham .   keli ran across the stable yards and out of the back gate  past a couple of sentries whose stern gaze quite failed to notice her .   out in the streets it wasn   t so creepy  but she still felt oddly naked .  it was unnerving  being among people who were going about their own affairs and not bothering to look at one  when one   s entire experience of the world hitherto was that it revolved around one .  pedestrians bumped into one and rebounded away  wondering briefly what it was they had hit  and one several times had to scurry away out of the path of wagons .   the chicken leg hadn   t gone far to fill the hole left by the absence of lunch  and she filched a couple of apples from a stall  making a mental note to have the chamberlain find out how much apples cost and send some money down to the stallholder .   disheveled  rather grubby and smelling slightly of horse dung  she came at last to cutwell   s door .  the knocker gave her some trouble .  in her experience doors opened for you  there were special people to arrange it .   she was so distraught she didn   t even notice that the knocker winked at her .   she tried again  and thought she heard a distant crash .  after some time the door opened a few inches and she caught a glimpse of a round flustered face topped with curly hair .  her right foot surprised her by intelligently inserting itself in the crack .      i demand to see the wizard     she announced .     pray admit me this instant .         he   s rather busy at present     said the face .     were you after a love potion .         a what .         i   ve   we   ve got a special on cutwell   s shield of passion ointment     said the face  and winked in a startling fashion .     provides your wild oats while guaranteeing a crop failure  if you know what i mean .      keli bridled .     no     she lied coldly     i do not .         ramrub .  maidens    longstop .  belladonna eyedrops .         i demand           sorry  we   re closed     said the face  and shut the door .  keli withdrew her foot just in time .   she muttered some words that would have amazed and shocked her tutors  and thumped on the woodwork .   the tattoo of her hammering suddenly slowed as realization dawned .   he   d seen her .  he   d heard her .   she beat on the door with renewed vigor  yelling with all the power in her lungs .   a voice by her ear said     it won   t work .  he    eef very fstubborn .      she looked around slowly and met the impertinent gaze of the doorknocker .  it waggled its metal eyebrows at her and spoke indistinctly through its wrought iron ring .      i am princess keli  heir to the throne of sto lat     she said haughtily  holding down the lid on her terror .     and i don   t talk to door furniture .         fwell  i   m just a doorknocker and i can talk to fwhoever i please     said the gargoyle pleasantly .     and i can ftell you the fmaster iff having a trying day and duff fnot fwant to be disturbed .  but you could ftry to use the magic word     it added .     coming from an attractiff fwoman it works nine times out of eight .         magic word .  what   s the magic word .      the knocker perceptibly sneered .     haff you been taught nothing  miss .      she drew herself up to her full height  which wasn   t really worth the effort .  she felt she   d had a trying day too .  her father had personally executed a hundred enemies in battle .  she should be able to manage a doorknocker .      i have been educated     she informed it with icy precision     by some of the finest scholars in the land .      the doorknocker did not appear to be impressed .      iff they didn   t teach you the magic word     it said calmly     they couldn   t haff fbeen all that fine .      keli reached out  grabbed the heavy ring  and pounded it on the door .  the knocker leered at her .      ftreat me rough     it lisped .     that   f the way i like it .         you   re disgusting .         yeff .  ooo  that waff nife  do it again    .      the door opened a crack .  there was a shadowy glimpse of curly hair .      madam  i said we   re cl        keli sagged .      please help me     she said .     please .         see .     said the doorknocker triumphantly .     sooner or later everyone remembers the magic word .          keli had been to official functions in ankh morpork and had met senior wizards from unseen university  the disc   s premier college of magic .  some of them had been tall  and most of them had been fat  and nearly all of them had been richly dressed  or at least thought they were richly dressed .   in fact there are fashions in wizardry as in more mundane arts  and this tendency to look like elderly aldermen was only temporary .  previous generations had gone in for looking pale and interesting  or druidical and grubby  or mysterious and saturnine .  but keli was used to wizards as a sort of fur trimmed small mountain with a wheezy voice  and igneous cutwell didn   t quite fit the mage image .   he was young .  well  that couldn   t be helped  presumably even wizards had to start off young .  he didn   t have a beard  and the only thing his rather grubby robe was trimmed with was frayed edges .      would you like a drink or something .     he said  surreptitiously kicking a discarded vest under the table .   keli looked around for somewhere to sit that wasn   t occupied with laundry or used crockery  and shook her head .  cutwell noticed her expression .      it   s a bit alfresco  i   m afraid     he added hurriedly  elbowing the remains of a garlic sausage on to the floor .     mrs .  nugent usually comes in twice a week and does for me but she   s gone to see her sister who   s had one of her turns .  are you sure .  it   s no trouble .  i saw a spare cup here only yesterday .         i have a problem  mr .  cutwell     said keli .      hang on a moment .     he reached up to a hook over the fireplace and took down a pointy hat that had seen better days  although from the look of it they hadn   t been very much better  and then said     right .  fire away .         what   s so important about the hat .         oh  it   s very essential .  you   ve got to have the proper hat for wizarding .  we wizards know about this sort of thing .         if you say so .  look  can you see me .      he peered at her .     yes .  yes  i would definitely say i can see you .         and hear me .  you can hear me  can you .         loud and clear .  yes .  every syllable tinkling into place .  no problems .         then would you be surprised if i told you that no one else in this city can .         except me .      keli snorted .     and your doorknocker .      cutwell pulled out a chair and sat down .  he squirmed a little .  a thoughtful expression passed over his face .  he stood up  reached behind him and produced a flat reddish mass which might have once been half a pizza  .  he stared at it sorrowfully .      i   ve been looking for that all morning  would you believe .     he said .     it was an all on with extra peppers  too .     he picked sadly at the squashed shape  and suddenly remembered keli .      gosh  sorry     he said     where   s my manners .  whatever will you think of me .  here .  have an anchovy .  please .         have you been listening to me .     snapped keli .      do you feel invisible .  in yourself  i mean .     said cutwell  indistinctly .      of course not .  i just feel angry .  so i want you to tell my fortune .         well  i don   t know about that  it all sounds rather medical to me and           i can pay .         it   s illegal  you see     said cutwell wretchedly .     the old king expressly forbade fortune telling in sto lat .  he didn   t like wizards much .         i can pay a lot .         mrs .  nugent was telling me this new girl is likely to be worse .  a right haughty one  she said .  not the sort to look kindly on practitioners of the subtle arts  i fear .      keli smiled .  members of the court who had seen that smile before would have hastened to drag cutwell out of the way and into a place of safety  like the next continent  but he just sat there trying to pick bits of mushroom out of his robe .      i understand she   s got a foul temper on her     said keli .     i wouldn   t be surprised if she didn   t turn you out of the city anyway .         oh dear     said cutwell     do you really think so .         look     said keli     you don   t have to tell my future  just my present .  even she couldn   t object to that .  i   ll have a word with her if you like     she added magnanimously .   cutwell brightened .     oh  do you know her .     he said .      yes .  but sometimes  i think  not very well .      cutwell sighed and burrowed around in the debris on the table  dislodging cascades of elderly plates and the long mummified remains of several meals .  eventually he unearthed a fat leather wallet  stuck to a cheese slice .      well     he said doubtfully     these are caroc cards .  distilled wisdom of the ancients and all that .  or there   s the ching aling of the hublandish .  it   s all the rage in the smart set .  i don   t do tealeaves .         i   ll try the ching thing .         you throw these yarrow stalks in the air  then .      she did .  they looked at the ensuing pattern .      hmm     said cutwell after a while .     well  that   s one in the fireplace  one in the cocoa mug  one in the street  shame about the window  one on the table  and one  no  two behind the dresser .  i expect mrs .  nugent will be able to find the rest .         you didn   t say how hard .  shall i do it again .         no ooo  i don   t think so .     cutwell thumbed through the pages of a yellowed book that had previously been supporting the table leg .     the pattern seems to make sense .  yes  here we are  octogram        illegality  the unatoning goose .  which we cross reference here   hold on   hold on   yes .  got it .         well .         without verticality  wisely the cochineal emperor goes forth at teatime  at evening the mollusc is silent among the almond blossom .         yes .     said keli  respectfully .     what does that mean .         unless you   re a mollusc  probably not a lot     said cutwell .     i think perhaps it lost something in translation .         are you sure you know how to do this .         let   s try the cards     said cutwell hurriedly  fanning them out .     pick a card .  any card .         it   s death     said keli .      ah .  well .  of course  the death card doesn   t actually mean death in all circumstances     cutwell said quickly .      you mean  it doesn   t mean death in those circumstances where the subject is getting over excited and you   re too embarrassed to tell the truth  hmm .         look  take another card .         this one   s death as well     said keli .      did you put the other one back .         no .  shall i take another card .         may as well .         well  there   s a coincidence .         death number three .         right .  is this a special pack for conjuring tricks .     keli tried to sound composed  but even she could detect the faint tinkle of hysteria in her voice .   cutwell frowned at her and carefully put the cards back in the pack  shuffled it  and dealt them out on to the table .  there was only one death .      oh dear     he said     i think this is going to be serious .  may i see the palm of your hand  please .      he examined it for a long time .  alter a while he went to the dresser  took a jeweler   s eyeglass out of a drawer  wiped the porridge off it with the sleeve of his robe  and spent another few minutes examining her hand in minutest detail .  eventually he sat back  removed the glass  and stared at her .      you   re dead     he said .   keli waited .  she couldn   t think of any suitable reply .     i   m not    lacked a certain style  while    is it serious .     seemed somehow too frivolous .      did i say i thought this was going to be serious .     said cutwell .      i think you did     said keli carefully  keeping her tone totally level .      i was right .         oh .         it could be fatal .         how much more fatal     said keli     than being dead .         i didn   t mean for you .         oh .         something very fundamental seems to have gone wrong  you see .  you   re dead in every sense but the  er  actual .  i mean  the cards think you   re dead .  your lifeline thinks you   re dead .  everything and everyone thinks you   re dead .         i don   t     said keli  but her voice was less than confident .      i   m afraid your opinion doesn   t count .         but people can see and hear me .         the first thing you learn when you enroll at unseen university  i   m afraid  is that people don   t pay much attention to that sort of thing .  it   s what their minds tell them that   s important .         you mean people don   t see me because their minds tell them not to .            fraid so .  it   s called predestination  or something .     cutwell looked at her wretchedly .     i   m a wizard .  we know about these things .      actually it   s not the first thing you learn when you enroll     he added     i mean  you learn where the lavatories are and all that sort of thing before that .  but after all that  it   s the first thing .         you can see me  though .         ah .  well .  wizards are specially trained to see things that are there and not to see things that aren   t .  you get these special exercises        keli drummed her fingers on the table  or tried to .  it turned out to be difficult .  she stared down in vague horror .   cutwell hurried forward and wiped the table with his sleeve .      sorry     he muttered     i had treacle sandwiches for supper last night .         what can i do .         nothing .         nothing .         well  you could certainly become a very successful burglar   sorry .  that was tasteless of me .         i thought so .      cutwell patted her ineptly on the hand  and keli was too preoccupied even to notice such flagrant l  se majest   .      you see  everything   s fixed .  history is all worked out  from start to finish .  what the facts actually are is beside the point  history just rolls straight over the top of them .  you can   t change anything because the changes are already part of it .  you   re dead .  it   s fated .  you   ll just have to accept it .      he gave an apologetic grin .     you   re a lot luckier than most dead people  if you look at it objectively     he said .     you   re alive to enjoy it .         i don   t want to accept it .  why should i accept it .  it   s not my fault .         you don   t understand .  history is moving on .  you can   t get involved in it any more .  there isn   t a part in it for you  don   t you see .  best to let things take their course .     he patted her hand again .  she looked at him .  he withdrew his hand .      what am i supposed to do then .     she said .     not eat  because the food wasn   t destined to be eaten by me .  go and live in a crypt somewhere .         bit of a poser  isn   t it .     agreed cutwell .     that   s fate for you  i   m afraid .  if the world can   t sense you  you don   t exist .  i   m a wizard .  we know           don   t say it .      keli stood up .   five generations ago one of her ancestors had halted his band of nomadic cutthroats a few miles from the mound of sto lat and had regarded the sleeping city with a peculiarly determined expression that said  this   ll do .  just because you   re born in the saddle doesn   t mean you have to die in the bloody thing .   strangely enough  many of his distinctive features had  by a trick of heredity  been bequeathed to his descendant   accounting for her rather idiosyncratic attractiveness .  they were never more apparent than now .  even cutwell was impressed .  when it came to determination  you could have cracked rocks on her jaw .   in exactly the same tone of voice that her ancestor had used when he addressed his weary  sweaty followers before the attack     she said      no .  no  i   m not going to accept it .  i   m not going to dwindle into some sort of ghost .  you   re going to help me  wizard .      cutwell   s subconscious recognized that tone .  it had harmonics in it that made even the woodworms in the floorboards stop what they were doing and stand to attention .  it wasn   t voicing an opinion  it was saying  things will be thus .      me  madam .     he quavered     i don   t see what i can possibly        he was jerked off his chair and out into the street  his robes billowing around him .  keli marched towards the palace with her shoulders set determinedly  dragging the wizard behind her like a reluctant puppy .  it was with such a walk that mothers used to bear down on the local school when their little boy came home with a black eye  it was unstoppable  it was like the march of time .      what is it you intend .     cutwell stuttered  horribly aware that there was going to be nothing he could do to resist  whatever it was .      it   s your lucky day  wizard .         oh .  good     he said weakly .      you   ve just been appointed royal recognizer .         oh .  what does that entail  exactly .         you   re going to remind everyone i   m alive .  it   s very simple .  there   s three square meals a day and your laundry done .  step lively  man .         royal .         you   re a wizard .  i think there   s something you ought to know     said the princess .       there is .  said death .    that was a cinematic trick adapted for print .  death wasn   t talking to the princess .  he was actually in his study  talking to mort .  but it was quite effective  wasn   t it .  it   s probably called a fast dissolve  or a crosscut zoom .  or something .  an industry where a senior technician is called a best boy might call it anything .    and what is that .  he added  winding a bit of black silk around the wicked hook in a little vice he   d clamped to his desk .   mort hesitated .  mostly this was because of fear and embarrassment  but it was also because the sight of a hooded specter peacefully tying dry flies was enough to make anyone pause .   besides  ysabell was sitting on the other side of the room  ostensibly doing some needlework but also watching him through a cloud of sullen disapproval .  he could feel her red rimmed eyes boring into the back of his neck .   death inserted a few crow hackles and whistled a busy little tune through his teeth  not having anything else to whistle through .  he looked up .   hmm .      they   didn   t go as smoothly as i thought     said mort  standing nervously on the carpet in front of the desk .   you had trouble .  said death  snipping off a few scraps of feather .      well  you see  the witch wouldn   t come away  and the monk  well  he started out all over again .      there   s nothing to worry about there  lad           mort           you should have worked out by now that everyone gets what they think is coming to them .  it   s so much neater that way .      i know  sir .  but that means bad people who think they   re going to some sort of paradise actually do get there .  and good people who fear they   re going to some kind of horrible place really suffer .  it doesn   t seem like justice .      what is it i   ve said you must remember  when you   re out on the duty .      well  you        hmm .   mort stuttered into silence .   there   s no justice .  there   s just you .      well  i        you must remember that .      yes  but        i expect it all works out properly in the end .  i have never met the creator  but i   m told he   s quite kindly disposed to people .  death snapped the thread and started to unwind the vice .   put such thoughts out of your mind  he added .  at least the third one shouldn   t have given you any trouble .   this was the moment .  mort had thought about it for a long time .  there was no sense in concealing it .  he   d upset the whole future course of history .  such things tend to draw themselves to people   s attention .  best to get it off his chest .  own up like a man .  take his medicine .  cards on table .  beating about bush  none of .  mercy  throw himself on .   the piercing blue eyes glittered at him .   he looked back like a nocturnal rabbit trying to outstare the headlights of a sixteen wheeled artic whose driver is a twelve hour caffeine freak outrunning the tachometers of hell .   he failed .      no  sir     he said .   good .  well done .  now then  what do you think of this .   anglers reckon that a good dry fly should cunningly mimic the real thing .  there are the right flies for morning .  there are different flies for the evening rise .  and so on .   but the thing between death   s triumphant digits was a fly from the dawn of time .  it was the fly in the primordial soup .  it had bred on mammoth turds .  it wasn   t a fly that bangs on window panes  it was a fly that drills through walls .  it was an insect that would crawl out from between the slats of the heaviest swat dripping venom and seeking revenge .  strange wings and dangling bits stuck out all over it .  it seemed to have a lot of teeth .      what   s it called .     said mort .   i shall call it   death   s glory .  death gave the thing a final admiring glance and stuck it into the hood of his robe .  i feel inclined to see a little bit of life this evening  he said .  you can take the duty  now that you   ve got the hang of it .  as it were .      yes .  sir     said mort  mournfully .  he saw his life stretching out in front of him like a nasty black tunnel with no light at the end of it .   death drummed his finger on the desk  muttered to himself .   ah yes  he said .  albert tells me someone   s been meddling in the library .      pardon  sir .      taking books out  leaving them lying around .  books about young women .  he seems to think it is amusing .   as has already been revealed  the holy listeners have such well developed hearing that they can be deafened by a good sunset .  just for a few seconds it seemed to mort that the skin on the back of his neck was developing similar strange powers  because he could see ysabell freeze in mid stitch .  he also heard the little intake of breath that he   d heard before  among the shelves .  he remembered the lace handkerchief .   he said     yes  sir .  it won   t happen again  sir .      the skin on the back of his neck started to itch like fury .   splendid .  now  you two can run along .  get albert to do you a picnic lunch or something .  get some fresh air .  i   ve noticed the way you two always avoid each other .  he gave mort a conspiratorial nudge   it was like being poked with a stick   and added  albert   s told me what that means .      has he .     said mort gloomily .  he   d been wrong  there was a light at the end of the tunnel  and it was a flamethrower .   death gave him another of his supernova winks .   mort didn   t return it .  instead he turned and plodded towards the door  at a general speed and gait that made great a   tuin look like a spring lamb .   he was halfway along the corridor before he heard the soft rush of footsteps behind him and a hand caught his arm .      mort .      he turned and gazed at ysabell through a fog of depression .      why did you let him think it was you in the library .         don   t know .         it was   very   kind of you     she said cautiously .      was it .  i can   t think what came over me .     he felt in his pocket and produced the handkerchief .     this belongs to you  i think .         thank you .     she blew her nose noisily .   mort was already well down the corridor  his shoulders hunched like vulture   s wings .  she ran after him .      i say     she said .      what .         i wanted to say thank you .         it doesn   t matter     he muttered .     it   d just be best if you don   t take books away again .  it upsets them  or something .     he gave what he considered to be a mirthless laugh .     ha .         ha what .         just ha .      he   d reached the end of the corridor .  there was the door into the kitchen  where albert would be leering knowingly  and mort decided he couldn   t face that .  he stopped .      but i only took the books for a bit of company     she said behind him .   he gave in .      we could have a walk in the garden     he said in despair  and then managed to harden his heart a little and added     without obligation  that is .         you mean you   re not going to marry me .     she said .  mort was horrified .     marry .         isn   t that what father brought you here for .     she said .     he doesn   t need an apprentice  after all .         you mean all those nudges and winks and little comments about some day my son all this will be yours .     said mort .     i tried to ignore them .  i don   t want to get married to anyone yet     he added  suppressing a fleeting mental picture of the princess .     and certainly not to you  no offense meant .         i wouldn   t marry you if you were the last man on the disc     she said sweetly .   mort was hurt by this .  it was one thing not to want to marry someone  but quite another to be told they didn   t want to marry you .      at least i don   t look like i   ve been eating doughnuts in a wardrobe for years     he said  as they stepped out on to death   s black lawn .      at least i walk as if my legs only had one knee each     she said .      my eyes aren   t two juugly poached eggs .      ysabell nodded .     on the other hand  my ears don   t look like something growing on a dead tree .  what does juugly mean .         you know  eggs like albert does them .         with the white all sticky and runny and full of slimy bits .         yes .         a good word     she conceded thoughtfully .     but my hair  i put it to you  doesn   t look like something you clean a privy with .         certainly  but neither does mine look like a wet hedgehog .         pray note that my chest does not appear to be a toast rack in a wet paper bag .      mort glanced sideways at the top of ysabell   s dress  which contained enough puppy fat for two litters of rottweilers  and forbore to comment .      my eyebrows don   t look like a pair of mating caterpillars     he hazarded .      true .  but my legs  i suggest  could at least stop a pig in a passageway .         sorry    .         they   re not bandy     she explained .      ah .      they strolled through the lily beds  temporarily lost for words .  eventually ysabell confronted mort and stuck out her hand .  he shook it in thankful silence .      enough .     she said .      just about .         good .  obviously we shouldn   t get married  if only for the sake of the children .      mort nodded .   they sat down on a stone seat between some neatly clipped box hedges .  death had made a pond in this corner of the garden  fed by an icy spring that appeared to be vomited into the pool by a stone lion .  fat white carp lurked in the depths  or nosed on the surface among the velvety black water lilies .      we should have brought some breadcrumbs     said mort gallantly  opting for a totally noncontroversial subject .      he never comes out here  you know     said ysabell  watching the fish .     he made it to keep me amused .         it didn   t work .         it   s not real     she said .     nothing   s real here .  not really real .  he just likes to act like a human being .  he   s trying really hard at the moment  have you noticed .  i think you   re having an effect on him .  did you know he tried to learn the banjo once .         i see him as more the organ type .         he couldn   t get the hang of it     said ysabell  ignoring him .     he can   t create  you see .         you said he created this pool .         it   s a copy of one he saw somewhere .  everything   s a copy .      mort shifted uneasily .  some small insect had crawled up his leg .      it   s rather sad     he said  hoping that this was approximately the right tone to adopt .      yes .      she scooped a handful of gravel from the path and began to flick it absent mindedly into the pool .      are my eyebrows that bad .     she said .      um     said mort     afraid so .         oh .     flick  flick .  the carp were watching her disdainfully .      and my legs .     he said .      yes .  sorry .      mort shuffled anxiously through his limited repertoire of small talk  and gave up .      never mind     he said gallantly .     at least you can use tweezers .         he   s very kind     said ysabell  ignoring him     in a sort of absent minded way .         he   s not exactly your real father  is he .         my parents were killed crossing the great nef years ago .  there was a storm  i think .  he found me and brought me here .  i don   t know why he did it .         perhaps he felt sorry for you .         he never feels anything .  i don   t mean that nastily  you understand .  it   s just that he   s got nothing to feel with  no whatd   youcallits  no glands .  he probably thought sorry for me .      she turned her pale round face towards mort .      i won   t hear a word against him .  he tries to do his best .  it   s just that he   s always got so much to think about .         my father was a bit like that .  is  i mean .         i expect he   s got glands  though .         i imagine he has     said mort  shifting uneasily .     it   s not something i   ve ever really thought about  glands .      they stared side by side at the trout .  the trout stared back .      i   ve just upset the entire history of the future     said mort .      yes .         you see  when he tried to kill her i killed him  but the thing is  according to the history she should have died and the duke would be king  but the worst bit  the worst bit is that although he   s absolutely rotten to the core he   d unite the cities and eventually they   ll be a federation and the books say there   ll be a hundred years of peace and plenty .  i mean  you   d think there   d be a reign of terror or something  but apparently history needs this kind of person sometimes and the princess would just be another monarch .  i mean  not bad  quite good really  but just not right and now it   s not going to happen and history is flapping around loose and it   s all my fault .      he subsided  anxiously awaiting her reply .      you were right  you know .         i was .         we ought to have brought some breadcrumbs     she said .     i suppose they find things to eat in the water .  beetles and so on .         did you hear what i said .         what about .         oh .  nothing .  nothing much  really .  sorry .      ysabell sighed and stood up .      i expect you   ll be wanting to get off     she said .     i   m glad we got this marriage business sorted out .  it was quite nice talking to you .         we could have a sort of hate hate relationship     said mort .      i don   t normally get to talk with the people father works with .     she appeared to be unable to draw herself away  as though she was waiting for mort to say something else .      well  you wouldn   t     was all he could think of .      i expect you   ve got to go off to work now .         more or less .     mort hesitated  aware that in some indefinable way the conversation had drifted out of the shallows and was now floating over some deep bits he didn   t quite understand .   there was a noise like     it made mort recall the old yard at home  with a pang of homesickness .  during the harsh ramtop winters the family kept hardy mountain tharga beasts in the yard  chucking in straw as necessary .  after the spring thaw the yard was several feet deep and had quite a solid crust on it .  you could walk across it if you were careful .  if you weren   t  and sank knee deep in the concentrated gyppo  then the sound your boot made as it came out  green and steaming  was as much the sound of the turning year as birdsong and beebuzz .   it was that noise .  mort instinctively examined his shoes .   ysabell was crying  not in little ladylike sobs  but in great yawning gulps  like bubbles from an underwater volcano  fighting one another to be the first to the surface .  they were sobs escaping under pressure  matured in humdrum misery .   mort said     er .      her body was shaking like a waterbed in an earthquake zone .  she fumbled urgently in her sleeves for the handkerchief  but it was no more use in the circumstances than a paper hat in a thunderstorm .  she tried to say something  which became a stream of consonants punctuated by sobs .   mort said     um .         i said  how old do you think i am .         fifteen .     he hazarded .      i   m sixteen     she wailed .     and do you know how long i   ve been sixteen for .         i   m sorry  i don   t under           no  you wouldn   t .  no one would .     she blew her nose again  and despite her shaking hands nevertheless carefully tucked the rather damp hanky back up her sleeve .      you   re allowed out     she said .     you haven   t been here long enough to notice .  time stands still here  haven   t you noticed .  oh  something passes  but it   s not real time .  he can   t create real time .         oh .      when she spoke again it was in the thin  careful and above all brave voice of someone who has pulled themselves together despite overwhelming odds but might let go again at any moment .      i   ve been sixteen for thirty five years .         oh .         it was bad enough the first year .      mort looked back at his last few weeks  and nodded in sympathy .      is that why you   ve been reading all those books .     he said .   ysabell looked down  and twiddled a sandaled toe in the gravel in an embarrassed fashion .      they   re very romantic     she said .     there   s some really lovely stories .  there was this girl who drank poison when her young man had died  and there was one who jumped off a cliff because her father insisted she should marry this old man  and another one drowned herself rather than submit to        mort listened in astonishment .  to judge by ysabell   s careful choice of reading matter  it was a matter of note for any disc female to survive adolescence long enough to wear out a pair of stockings .         and then she thought he was dead  and she killed herself and then he woke up and so he did kill himself  and then there was this girl        common sense suggested that at least a few women reached their third decade without killing themselves for love  but common sense didn   t seem to get even a walk on part in these dramas .   mort was already aware that love made you feel hot and cold and cruel and weak  but he hadn   t realized that it could make you stupid .         swam the river every night  but one night there was this storm  and when he didn   t arrive she        mort felt instinctively that some young couples met  say  at a village dance  and hit it off  and went out together for a year or two  had a few rows  made up  got married and didn   t kill themselves at all .   he became aware that the litany of star crossed love had wound down .      oh     he said  weakly .     doesn   t anyone just  you know  just get along any more .         to love is to suffer     said ysabell .     there   s got to be lots of dark passion .         has there .         absolutely .  and anguish .      ysabell appeared to recall something .      did you say something about something flapping around loose .     she said  in the tight voice of someone pulling themselves together .   mort considered .     no     he said .      i   m afraid i wasn   t paying much attention .         it doesn   t matter at all .      they strolled back to the house in silence .   when mort went back to the study he found that death had gone  leaving four hourglasses on the desk .  the big leather book was lying on a lectern  securely locked shut .   there was a note tucked under the glasses .   mort had imagined that death   s handwriting would either be gothic or else tombstone angular  but death had in fact studied a classic work on graphology before selecting a style and had adopted a hand that indicated a balanced  well adjusted personality .   it said   gone fyshing .  theyre ys ane execution in pseudopolis  a naturral in krull  a faytal fall in the carrick mtns  ane ague in ell kinte .  thee rest of thee day   s your own .       mort thought that history was thrashing around like a steel hawser with the tension off  twanging backwards and forwards across reality in great destructive sweeps .   history isn   t like that .  history unravels gently  like an old sweater .  it has been patched and darned many times  reknitted to suit different people  shoved in a box under the sink of censorship to be cut up for the dusters of propaganda  yet it always   eventually   manages to spring back into its old familiar shape .  history has a habit of changing the people who think they are changing it .  history always has a few tricks up its frayed sleeve .  it   s been around a long time .   this is what was happening   the misplaced stroke of mort   s scythe had cut history into two separate realities .  in the city of sto lat princess keli still ruled  with a certain amount of difficulty and with the full time aid of the royal recognizer  who was put on the court payroll and charged with the duty of remembering that she existed .  in the lands outside  though   beyond the plain  in the ramtops  around the circle sea and all the way to the rim   the traditional reality still held sway and she was quite definitely dead  the duke was king and the world was proceeding sedately according to plan  whatever that was .   the point is that both realities were true .   the sort of historical event horizon was currently about twenty miles away from the city  and wasn   t yet very noticeable .  that   s because the   well  call it the difference in historical pressures   wasn   t yet very great .  but it was growing .  out in the damp cabbage fields there was a shimmer in the air and a faint sizzle  like frying grasshoppers .   people don   t alter history any more than birds alter the sky  they just make brief patterns in it .  inch by inch  implacable as a glacier and far colder  the real reality was grinding back towards sto lat .       mort was the first person to notice .   it had been a long afternoon .  the mountaineer had held on to his icy handhold until the last moment and the executee had called mort a lackey of the monarchist state .  only the old lady of      who had gone to her reward surrounded by her sorrowing relatives  had smiled at him and said he was looking a little pale .   the disc sun was close to the horizon by the time binky cantered wearily through the skies over sto lat  and mort looked down and saw the borderland of reality .  it curved away below him  a crescent of faint silver mist .  he didn   t know what it was  but he had a nasty foreboding that it had something to do with him .   he reined in the horse and allowed him to trot gently towards the ground  touching down a few yards behind the wall of iridescent air .  it was moving at something less than walking pace  hissing gently as it drifted ghost like across the stark damp cabbage fields and frozen drainage ditches .   it was a cold night  the type of night when frost and fog fight for domination and every sound is muffled .  binky   s breath made fountains of cloud in the still air .  he whinnied gently  almost apologetically  and pawed at the ground .   mort slid out of the saddle and crept up to the interface .  it crackled softly .  weird shapes coruscated across it  flowing and shifting and disappearing .   after some searching he found a stick and poked it cautiously into the wall .  it made strange ripples that wobbled slowly out of sight .   mort looked up as a shape drifted overhead .  it was a black owl  patrolling the ditches for anything small and squeaky .   it hit the wall with a splash of sparkling mist  leaving an owl shaped ripple that grew and spread until it joined the boiling kaleidoscope .   then it vanished .  mort could see through the transparent interface  and certainly no owl reappeared on the other side .  just as he was puzzling over this there was another soundless splash a few feet away and the bird burst into view again  totally unconcerned  and skimmed away across the fields .   mort pulled himself together  and stepped through the barrier which was no barrier at all .  it tingled .   a moment later binky burst through after him  eyes rolling in desperation and tendrils of interface catching on his hooves .  he reared up  shaking his mane like a dog to remove clinging fibers of mist  and looked at mort beseechingly .   mort caught his bridle  patted him on the nose  and fumbled in his pocket for a rather grubby sugar lump .  he was aware that he was in the presence of something important  but he wasn   t yet quite sure what it was .   there was a road running between an avenue of damp and gloomy willow trees .  mort remounted and steered binky across the field into the dripping darkness under the branches .   in the distance he could see the lights of sto helit  which really wasn   t much more than a small town  and a faint glow on the edge of sight must be sto lat .  he looked at it longingly .   the barrier worried him .  he could see it creeping across the field behind the trees .   mort was on the point of urging binky back into the air when he saw the light immediately ahead of him  warm and beckoning .  it was spilling from the windows of a large building set back from the road .  it was probably a cheerful sort of light in any case  but in these surroundings and compared with mort   s mood it was positively ecstatic .   as he rode nearer he saw shadows moving against it  and made out a few snatches of song .  it was an inn  and inside there were people having a good time  or what passed for a good time if you were a peasant who spent most of your time closely concerned with cabbages .  compared to brassicas  practically anything is fun .   there were human beings in there  doing uncomplicated human things like getting drunk and forgetting the words of songs .   mort had never really felt homesick  possibly because his mind had been too occupied with other things .  but he felt it now for the first time   a sort of longing  not for a place  but for a state of mind  for being just an ordinary human being with straightforward things to worry about  like money and sickness and other people    .      i shall have a drink     he thought     and perhaps i shall feel better .      there was an open fronted stable at one side of the main building  and he led binky into the warm  horse smelling darkness that already accommodated three other horses .  as mort unfastened the nosebag he wondered if death   s horse felt the same way about other horses which had rather less supernatural lifestyles .  he certainly looked impressive compared to the others  which regarded him watchfully .  binky was a real horse   the blisters of the shovel handle on mort   s hands were a testimony to that   and compared to the others he looked more real than ever .  more solid .  more horsey .  slightly larger than life .   in fact  mort was on the verge of making an important deduction  and it is unfortunate that he was distracted  as he walked across the yard to the inn   s low door  by the sight of the inn sign .  its artist hadn   t been particularly gifted  but there was no mistaking the line of keli   s jaw or her mass of fiery hair in the portrait of the quene   s hed .   he sighed  and pushed open the door .   as one man  the assembled company stopped talking and stared at him with the honest rural stare that suggests that for two pins they   ll hit you around the head with a shovel and bury your body under a compost heap at full moon .   it might be worth taking another look at mort  because he   s changed a lot in the last few chapters .  for example  while he still has plenty of knees and elbows about his person  they seem to have migrated to their normal places and he no longer moves as though his joints were loosely fastened together with elastic bands .  he used to look as if he knew nothing at all  now he looks as though he knew too much .  something about his eyes suggests that he has seen things that ordinary people never see  or at least never see more than once .   something about all the rest of him suggests to the watchers that causing an inconvenience for this boy might just be as wise as kicking a wasp nest .  in short  mort no longer looks like something the cat brought in and then brought up .   the landlord relaxed his grip on the stout blackthorn peacemaker he kept under the bar and composed his features into something resembling a cheerful welcoming grin  although not very much .      evening  your lordship     he said .     what   s your pleasure this cold and frosty night .         what .     said mort  blinking in the light .      what he means is  what d   you want to drink .     said a small ferret faced man sitting by the fire  who was giving mort the kind of look a butcher gives a field full of lambs .      um .  i don   t know     said mort .     do you sell stardrip .         never heard of it  lordship .      mort looked around at the faces watching him  illuminated by the firelight .  they were the sort of people generally called the salt of the earth .  in other words  they were hard  square and bad for your health  but mort was too preoccupied to notice .      what do people like to drink here  then .      the landlord looked sideways at his customers  a clever trick given that they were directly in front of him .      why  lordship  we drink scumble  for preference .         scumble .     said mort  failing to notice the muffled sniggers .      aye  lordship .  made from apples .  well  mainly apples .      this seemed healthy enough to mort .     oh  right     he said .     a pint of scumble  then .     he reached into his pocket and withdrew the bag of gold that death had given him .  it was still quite full .  in the sudden hush of the inn the faint clink of the coins sounded like the legendary brass gongs of leshp  which can be heard far out to sea on stormy nights as the currents stir them in their drowned towers three hundred fathoms below .      and please serve these gentlemen with whatever they want     he added .   he was so overwhelmed by the chorus of thanks that he didn   t take much notice of the fact that his new friends were served their drinks in tiny  thimble sized glasses  while his alone turned up in a large wooden mug .   a lot of stories are told about scumble  and how it is made out on the damp marshes according to ancient recipes handed down rather unsteadily from father to son .  it   s not true about the rats  or the snake heads  or the lead shot .  the one about the dead sheep is a complete fabrication .  we can lay to rest all the variations of the one about the trouser button .  but the one about not letting it come into contact with metal is absolutely true  because when the landlord flagrantly shortchanged mort and plonked the small heap of copper in a puddle of the stuff it immediately began to froth .   mort sniffed his drink  and then took a sip .  it tasted something like apples  something like autumn mornings  and quite a lot like the bottom of a logpile .  not wishing to appear disrespectful  however  he took a swig .   the crowd watched him  counting under its breath .   mort felt something was being demanded of him .      nice     he said     very refreshing .     he took another sip .     bit of an acquired taste     he added     but well worth the effort  i   m sure .      there were one or two mutters of discontent from the back of the crowd .      he   s been watering the scumble  that   s what    tis .         nay  thou knows what happens if you lets a drop of water touch scumble .      the landlord tried to ignore this .     you like it .     he said to mort  in pretty much the same tone of voice people used when they said to st .  george     you killed a what .         it   s quite tangy     said mort .     and sort of nutty .         excuse me     said the landlord  and gently took the mug out of mort   s hand .  he sniffed at it  then wiped his eyes .      uuunnyag     he said .     it   s the right stuff all right .      he looked at the boy with something verging on admiration .  it wasn   t that he   d drunk a third of a pint of scumble in itself  it was that he was still vertical and apparently alive .  he handed the pot back again  it was as if mort was being given a trophy after some incredible contest .  when the boy took another mouthful several of the watchers winced .  the landlord wondered what mort   s teeth were made of  and decided it must be the same stuff as his stomach .      you   re not a wizard by any chance .     he inquired  just in case .      sorry  no .  should i be .      didn   t think so  thought the landlord  he doesn   t walk like a wizard and anyway he isn   t smoking anything .  he looked at the scumble pot again .   there was something wrong about this .  there was something wrong about the boy .  he didn   t look right .  he looked        more solid than he should do .   that was ridiculous  of course .  the bar was solid  the floor was solid  the customers were as solid as you could wish for .  yet mort  standing there looking rather embarrassed and casually sipping a liquid you could clean spoons with  seemed to emit a particularly potent sort of solidness  an extra dimension of realness .  his hair was more hairy  his clothes more clothy  his boots the epitome of bootness .  it made your head ache just to look at him .   however  mort then demonstrated that he was human after all .  the mug dropped from his stricken fingers and clattered on the flagstones  where the dregs of scumble started to eat its way through them .  he pointed at the far wall  his mouth opening and shutting wordlessly .   the regulars turned back to their conversations and games of shovel up  reassured that things were as they should be  mort was acting perfectly normal now .  the landlord  relieved that the brew had been vindicated  reached across the bar top and patted him companionably on the shoulder .      it   s all right     he said .     it often takes people like this  you   ll just have a headache for a few weeks  don   t worry about it  a drop of scumble   ll see you all right again .      it is a fact that the best remedy for a scumble hangover is a hair of the dog  although it should more accurately be called a tooth of the shark or possibly a tread of the bulldozer .   but mort merely went on pointing and said  in a trembling voice     can   t you see it .  it   s coming through the wall .  it   s coming right through the wall .         a lot of things come through the wall after your first drink of scumble .  green hairy things  usually .         it   s the mist .  can   t you hear it sizzling .         a sizzling mist  is it .     the landlord looked at the wall  which was quite empty and unmysterious except for a few cobwebs .  the urgency in mort   s voice unsettled him .  he would have preferred the normal scaly monsters .  a man knew where he stood with them .      it   s coming right across the room .  can   t you feel it .      the customers looked at one another .  mort was making them uneasy .  one or two of them admitted later that they did feel something  rather like an icy tingle  but it could have been indigestion .   mort backed away  and then gripped the bar .  he shivered for a moment .      look     said the landlord     a joke   s a joke  but           you had a green shirt on before .      the landlord looked down .  there was an edge of terror in his voice .      before what .     he quavered .  to his astonishment  and before his hand could complete its surreptitious journey towards the blackthorn stick  mort lunged across the bar and grabbed him by the apron .      you   ve got a green shirt  haven   t you .     he said .     i saw it  it had little yellow buttons .         well  yes .  i   ve got two shirts .     the landlord tried to draw himself up a little .     i   m a man of means     he added .     i just didn   t wear it today .     he didn   t want to know how mort knew about the buttons .   mort let him go and spun round .      they   re all sitting in different places .  where   s the man who was sitting by the fire .  it   s all changed .      he ran out through the door and there was a muffled cry from outside .  he dashed back  wild eyed  and confronted the horrified crowd .      who changed the sign .  someone changed the sign .      the landlord nervously ran his tongue across his lips .      after the old king died  you mean .     he said .   mort   s look chilled him  the boy   s eyes were two black pools of terror .      it   s the name i mean .         we   ve   it   s always been the same name     said the man  looking desperately at his customers for support .     isn   t that so  lads .  the duke   s head .      there was a murmured chorus of agreement .   mort stared at everyone  visibly shaking .  then he turned and ran outside again .   the listeners heard hoofbeats in the yard  which grew fainter and then disappeared entirely  just as though a horse had left the face of the earth .   there was no sound inside the inn .  men tried to avoid one another   s gaze .  no one wanted to be the first to admit to seeing what he thought he had just seen .   so it was left to the landlord to walk unsteadily across the room and reach out and run his fingers across the familiar  reassuring wooden surface of the door .  it was solid  unbroken  everything a door should be .   everyone had seen mort run through it three times .  he just hadn   t opened it .       binky fought for height  rising nearly vertically with his hooves thrashing the air and his breath curling away behind him like a vapor trail .  mort hung on with knees and hands and mostly with willpower  his face buried in the horse   s mane .  he didn   t look down until the air around him was freezing and thin as workhouse gravy .   overhead the hub lights flickered silently across the winter sky .  below        an upturned saucer  miles across  silvery in the starlight .  he could see lights through it .  clouds were drifting through it .   no .  he watched carefully .  clouds were certainly drifting into it  and there were clouds in it  but the clouds inside were wispier and moving in a slightly different direction and  in fact  didn   t seem to have much to do with the clouds outside .  there was something else   oh yes  the hub lights .  they gave the night outside the ghostly hemisphere a faint green tint  but there was no sign of it under the dome .   it was like looking into a piece of another world  almost identical  that had been grafted on to the disc .  the weather was slightly different in there  and the lights weren   t on display tonight .   and the disc was resenting it  and surrounding it  and pushing it back into non existence .  mort couldn   t see it growing smaller from up here  but in his mind   s ear he could hear the locust sizzle of the thing as it ground across the land  changing things back to where they should be .  reality was healing itself .   mort knew  without even having to think about it  who was at the center of the dome .  it was obvious even from here that it was centered firmly on sto lat .   he tried not to think what would happen when the dome had shrunk to the size of the room  and then the size of a person  and then the size of an egg .  he failed .   logic would have told mort that here was his salvation .  in a day or two the problem would solve itself  the books in the library would be right again  the world would have sprung back into shape like an elastic bandage .  logic would have told him that interfering with the process a second time around would only make things worse .  logic would have said all that  if only logic hadn   t taken the night off too .       light travels quite slowly on the disc  due to the braking effect of the huge magical field  and currently that part of the rim carrying the island of krull was directly under the little sun   s orbit and it was  therefore  still early evening .  it was also quite warm  since the rim picks up more heat and enjoys a gentle maritime climate .   in fact krull  with a large part of what for want of a better word must be called its coastline sticking out over the edge  was a fortunate island .  the only native krullians who did not appreciate this were those who didn   t look where they were going or who walked in their sleep and  because of natural selection  there weren   t very many of them any more .  all societies have their share of dropouts  but on krull they never had a chance to drop back in again .   terpsic mims was not a dropout .  he was an angler .  there is a difference  angling is more expensive .  but terpsic was happy .  he was watching a feather on a cork bob gently on the gentle  reed lined waters of the hakrull river and his mind was very nearly a blank .  the only thing that could have disturbed his mood was actually catching a fish  because catching fish was the one thing about angling that he really dreaded .  they were cold and slimy and panicky and got on his nerves  and terpsic   s nerves weren   t very good .   so long as he caught nothing terpsic mims was one of the disc   s happiest anglers  because the hakrull river was five miles from his home and therefore five miles from mrs .  gwladys mims  with whom he had enjoyed six happy months of married life .  that had been some twenty years previously .   terpsic did not pay undue heed when another angler took up station further along the bank .  of course  some fishermen might have objected to this breach of etiquette  but in terpsic   s book anything that reduced his chance of actually catching any of the damned things was all right by him .  out of the corner of his eye he noted that the newcomer was fly fishing  an interesting pastime which terpsic had rejected because one spent altogether far too much time at home making the equipment .   he had never seen fly fishing like this before .  there were wet flies  and there were dry flies  but this fly augured into the water with a saw toothed whine and dragged the fish out backwards .   terpsic watched in horrified fascination as the indistinct figure behind the willow trees cast and cast again .  the water boiled as the river   s entire piscine population fought to get out of the way of the buzzing terror and  unfortunately  a large and maddened pike took terpsic   s hook out of sheer confusion .   one moment he was standing on the bank  and the next he was in a green  clanging gloom  bubbling his breath away and watching his life flash before his eyes and  even in the moment of drowning  dreading the thought of watching the bit between the day of his wedding and the present .  it occurred to him that gwladys would soon be a widow  which cheered him up a little bit .  in fact terpsic had always tried to look on the bright side  and it struck him  as he sank gratefully into the silt  that from this point on his whole life could only improve    .   and a hand grabbed his hair and dragged him to the surface  which was suddenly full of pain .  ghastly blue and black blotches swam in front of his eyes .  his lungs were on fire .  his throat was a pipe of agony .   hands   cold hands  freezing hands  hands that felt like a glove full of dice   towed him through the water and threw him down on to the bank where  after some game attempts to get on with drowning  he was eventually bullied back into what passed for his life .   terpsic didn   t often get angry  because gwladys didn   t hold with it .  but he felt cheated .  he   d been born without being consulted  he   d been married because gwladys and her father had seen to it  and the only major human achievement that was uniquely his had been rudely snatched away from him .  a few seconds ago it had all been so simple .  now it was all complicated again .   not that he wanted to die  of course .  the gods were very firm on the subject of suicide .  he just hadn   t wanted to be rescued .   through red eyes in a mask of slime and duckweed he peered at the blurred form above him  and shouted     why did you have to save me .      the answer worried him .  he thought about it as he squelched all the way home .  it sat at the back of his mind while gwladys complained about the state of his clothes .  it squirreled around in his head as he sat and sneezed guiltily by the fire  because being ill was another thing gwladys didn   t hold with .  as he lay shivering in bed it settled in his dreams like an iceberg .  in the midst of his fever he muttered     what did he mean     for later    .          torches flared in the city of sto lat .  whole squads of men were charged with the task of constantly renewing them .  the streets glowed .  the sizzling flames pushed back shadows that had been blamelessly minding their own business every night for centuries .  they illuminated ancient corners where the eyes of bewildered rats glittered in the depths of their holes .  they forced burglars to stay indoors .  they glowed on the night mists  forming a nimbus of yellow light that blotted out the cold high flames streaming from the hub .  but mainly they shone on the face of princess keli .   it was everywhere .  it plastered every flat surface .  binky cantered along the glowing streets between princess keli on doors  walls and gable ends .  mort gaped at posters of his beloved on every surface where workmen had been able to make paste stick .   even stranger  no one seemed to be paying them much attention .  while sto lat   s night life was not as colorful and full of incident as that of ankh morpork  in the same way that a wastepaper basket cannot compete with a municipal tip  the streets were nevertheless a bustle with people and shrill with the cries of hucksters  gamblers  sellers of sweetmeats  pea and thimble men  ladies of assignation  pickpockets and the occasional honest trader who had wandered in by mistake and couldn   t now raise enough money to leave .  as mort rode through them snatches of conversation in half a dozen languages floated into his ears  with numb acceptance he realized he could understand every one of them .   he eventually dismounted and led the horse along wall street  searching in vain for cutwell   s house .  he found it only because a lump on the nearest poster was making muffled swearing noises .   he reached out gingerly and pulled aside a strip of paper .      fanks very much     said the gargoyle doorknocker .     you wouldn   t credit it  would you .  one minute life as normal  nexft minute a mouthful of glue .         where   s cutwell .         he   s gone off to the palace .     the knocker leered at him and winked a cast iron eye .     some men came and took all his fstuff away .  then some ovver men started pasting pictures of his girlfriend all over the place .  barftuds     it added .   mort colored .      his girlfriend .      the doorknocker  being of the demonic persuasion  sniggered at his tone .  it sounded like fingernails being dragged over a file .      yeff     it said .     they feemed in a bit of a hurry  if you ask me .      mort was already up on binky   s back .      i fay .     shouted the knocker at his retreating back .     i fay .  could you unftick me  boy .      mort tugged on binky   s reins so hard that the horse reared and danced crazily backwards across the cobbles  then reached out and grabbed the ring of the knocker .  the gargoyle looked up into his face and suddenly felt like a very frightened doorknocker indeed .  mort   s eyes glowed like crucibles  his expression was a furnace  his voice held enough heat to melt iron .  it didn   t know what he could do  but felt that it would prefer not to find out .      what did you call me .     mort hissed .   the doorknocker thought quickly .     fir .     it said .      what did you ask me to do .         unftick me .         i don   t intend to .         fine     said the doorknocker     fine .  that   s okay by me .  i   ll just ftick around  then .      it watched mort canter off along the street and shuddered with relief  knocking itself gently in its nervousness .      a naaaarrow sqeeeak     said one of the hinges .      fut up .          mort passed night watchmen  whose job now appeared to consist of ringing bells and shouting the name of the princess  but a little uncertainly  as if they had difficulty remembering it .  he ignored them  because he was listening to voices inside his head which went   she   s only met you once  you fool .  why should she bother about you .   yes  but i did save her life .   that means it belongs to her .  not to you .  besides  he   s a wizard .   so what .  wizards aren   t supposed to   to go out with girls  they   re celebrate    .   celebrate .   they   re not supposed to youknow    .   what  never any youknow at all .  said the internal voice  and it sounded as if it was grinning .   it   s supposed to be bad for the magic  thought mort bitterly .   funny place to keep magic .   mort was shocked .  who are you .  he demanded .   i   m you  mort .  your inner self .   well  i wish i   d get out of my head  it   s quite crowded enough with me in here .   fair enough  said the voice  i was only trying to help .  but remember  if you ever need you  you   re always around .   the voice faded away .   well  thought mort bitterly  that must have been me .  i   m the only one that calls me mort .   the shock of the realization quite obscured the fact that  while mort had been locked into the monologue  he had ridden right through the gates of the palace .  of course  people rode through the gates of the palace every day  but most of them needed the things to be opened first .   the guards on the other side were rigid with fear  because they thought they had seen a ghost .  they would have been far more frightened if they had known that a ghost was almost exactly what they hadn   t seen .   the guard outside the doors of the great hall had seen it happen too  but he had time to gather his wits  or such that remained  and raise his spear as binky trotted across the courtyard .      halt     he croaked .     halt .  what goes where .      mort saw him for the first time .      what .     he said  still lost in thought .   the guard ran his tongue over his dry lips  and backed away .  mort slid off binky   s back and walked forward .      i meant  what goes there .     the guard tried again  with a mixture of doggedness and suicidal stupidity that marked him for early promotion .   mort caught the spear gently and lifted it out of the way of the door .  as he did so the torchlight illuminated his face .      mort     he said softly .   it should have been enough for any normal soldier  but this guard was officer material .      i mean  friend or foe .     he stuttered  trying to avoid mort   s gaze .      which would you prefer .     he grinned .  it wasn   t quite the grin of his master  but it was a pretty effective grin and didn   t have a trace of humor in it .   the guard sagged with relief  and stood aside .      pass  friend     he said .   mort strode across the hall towards the staircase that led to the royal apartments .  the hall had changed a lot since he last saw it .  portraits of keli were everywhere  they   d even replaced the ancient and crumbling battle banners in the shadowy heights of the roof .  anyone walking through the palace would have found it impossible to go more than a few steps without seeing a portrait .  part of mort   s mind wondered why  just as another part worried about the flickering dome that was steadily closing on the city  but most of his mind was a hot and steamy glow of rage and bewilderment and jealousy .  ysabell had been right  he thought  this must be love .      the walk through walls boy .      he jerked his head up .  cutwell was standing at the top of the stairs .   the wizard had changed a lot too  mort thought bitterly .  perhaps not that much  though .  although he was wearing a black and white robe embroidered with sequins  although his pointy hat was a yard high and decorated with more mystic symbols than a dental chart  and although his red velvet shoes had silver buckles and toes that curled like snails  there were still a few stains on his collar and he appeared to be chewing .   he watched mort climb the stairs towards him .      are you angry about something .     he said .     i started work  but i got rather tied up with other things .  very difficult  walking through   why are you looking at me like that .         what are you doing here .         i might ask you the same question .  would you like a strawberry .      mort glanced at the small wooden punnet in the wizard   s hands .      in mid winter .         actually  they   re sprouts with a dash of enchantment .         they taste like strawberries .      cutwell sighed .     no  like sprouts .  the spell isn   t totally efficient .  i thought they might cheer the princess up  but she threw them at me .  shame to waste them .  be my guest .      mort gaped at him .      she threw them at you .         very accurately  i   m afraid .  very strong minded young lady .      hi  said a voice in the back of mort   s mind  it   s you again  pointing out to yourself that the chances of the princess even contemplating you know with this fellow are on the far side of remote .   go away  thought mort .  his subconscious was worrying him .  it appeared to have a direct line to parts of his body that he wanted to ignore at the moment .      why are you here .     he said aloud .     is it something to do with all these pictures .         good idea  wasn   t it .     beamed cutwell .     i   m rather proud of it myself .         excuse me     said mort weakly .     i   ve had a busy day .  i think i   d like to sit down somewhere .         there   s the throne room     said cutwell .     there   s no one in there at this time of night .  everyone   s asleep .      mort nodded  and then looked suspiciously at the young wizard .      what are you doing up  then .     he said .      um     said cutwell     um  i just thought i   d see if there was anything in the pantry .      he shrugged .    now is the time to report that cutwell too notices that mort  even a mort weary with riding and lack of sleep  is somehow glowing from within and in some strange way unconnected with size is nevertheless larger than life .  the difference is that cutwell is  by training  a better guesser than other people and knows that in occult matters the obvious answer is usually the wrong one .   mort can move absentmindedly through walls and drink neat widowmaker soberly not because he is turning into a ghost  but because he is becoming dangerously real .   in fact  as the boy stumbles while they walk along the silent corridors and steps through a marble pillar without noticing  it   s obvious that the world is becoming a pretty insubstantial place from his point of view .      you just walked through a marble pillar     observed cutwell .     how did you do it .         did i .     mort looked around .  the pillar looked sound enough .  he poked an arm towards it  and slightly bruised his elbow .      i could have sworn you did     said cutwell .     wizards notice these things  you know .     he reached into the pocket of his robe .      then have you noticed the mist dome around the country .     said mort .   cutwell squeaked .  the jar in his hand dropped and smashed on the tiles  there was the smell of slightly rancid salad dressing .      already .         i don   t know about already     said mort     but there   s this sort of crackling wall sliding over the land and no one else seems to worry about it and           how fast was it moving .            it changes things .         you saw it .  how far away is it .  how fast is it moving .         of course i saw it .  i rode through it twice .  it was like           but you   re not a wizard  so why           what are you doing here  anyway        cutwell took a deep breath .     everyone shut up .     he screamed .   there was silence .  then the wizard grabbed mort   s arm .     come on     he said  pulling him back along the corridor .     i don   t know who you are exactly and i hope i   ve got time to find out one day but something really horrible is going to happen soon and i think you   re involved  somehow .         something horrible .  when .         that depends on how far away the interface is and how fast it   s moving     said cutwell  dragging mort down a side passage .  when they were outside a small oak door he let go of his arm and fumbled in his pocket again  removing a small hard piece of cheese and an unpleasantly squashy tomato .      hold these  will you .  thank you .     he delved again  produced a key and unlocked the door .      it   s going to kill the princess  isn   t it .     said mort .      yes     said cutwell     and then again  no .     he paused with his hand on the doorhandle .     that was pretty perspicacious of you .  how did you know .         i       mort hesitated .      she told me a very strange story     said cutwell .      i expect she did     said mort .     if it was unbelievable  it was true .         you   re him  are you .  death   s assistant .         yes .  off duty at the moment  though .         pleased to hear it .      cutwell shut the door behind them and fumbled for a candlestick .  there was a pop  a flash of blue light and a whimper .      sorry     he said  sucking his fingers .     fire spell .  never really got the hang of it .         you were expecting the dome thing  weren   t you .     said mort urgently .     what will happen when it closes in .      the wizard sat down heavily on the remains of a bacon sandwich .      i   m not exactly sure     he said .     it   ll be interesting to watch .  but not from inside  i   m afraid .  what i think will happen is that the last week will never have existed .         she   ll suddenly die .         you don   t quite understand .  she will have been dead for a week .  all this       he waved his hands vaguely in the air      will not have happened .  the assassin will have done his job .  you will have done yours .  history will have healed itself .  everything will be all right .  from history   s point of view  that is .  there really isn   t any other .      mort stared out of the narrow window .  he could see across the courtyard into the glowing streets outside  where a picture of the princess smiled at the sky .      tell me about the pictures     he said .     that looks like some sort of wizard thing .         i   m not sure if it   s working .  you see  people were beginning to get upset and they didn   t know why  and that made it worse .  their minds were in one reality and their bodies were in another .  very unpleasant .  they couldn   t get used to the idea that she was still alive .  i thought the pictures might be a good idea but  you know  people just don   t see what their mind tells them isn   t there .         i could have told you that     said mort bitterly .      i had the town criers out during the daytime     cutwell continued .     i thought that if people could come to believe in her  then this new reality could become the real one .         mmmph .     said mort .  he turned away from the window .     what do you mean .         well  you see   i reckoned that if enough people believed in her  they could change reality .  it works for gods .  if people stop believing in a god  he dies .  if a lot of them believe in him  he grows stronger .         i didn   t know that .  i thought gods were just gods .         they don   t like it talked about     said cutwell  shuffling through the heap of books and parchments on his worktable .      well  that might work for gods  because they   re special     said mort .     people are   more solid .  it wouldn   t work for people .         that   s not true .  let   s suppose you went out of here and prowled around the palace .  one of the guards would probably see you and he   d think you were a thief and he   d fire his crossbow .  i mean  in his reality you   d be a thief .  it wouldn   t actually be true but you   d be just as dead as if it was .  belief is powerful stuff .  i   m a wizard .  we know about these things .  look here .      he pulled a book out of the debris in front of him and opened it at the piece of bacon he   d used as a bookmark .  mort looked over his shoulder  and frowned at the curly magical writing .  it moved around on the page  twisting and writhing in an attempt not to be read by a non wizard  and the general effect was unpleasant .      what   s this .     he said .      it   s the book of the magick of alberto malich the mage     said the wizard     a sort of book of magical theory .  it   s not a good idea to look too hard at the words  they resent it .  look  it says here        his lips moved soundlessly .  little beads of sweat sprang up on his forehead and decided to get together and go down and see what his nose was doing .  his eyes watered .   some people like to settle down with a good book .  no one in possession of a complete set of marbles would like to settle down with a book of magic  because even the individual words have a private and vindictive life of their own and reading them  in short  is a kind of mental indian wrestling .  many a young wizard has tried to read a grimoire that is too strong for him  and people who   ve heard the screams have found only his pointy shoes with the classic wisp of smoke coming out of them and a book which is  perhaps  just a little fatter .  things can happen to browsers in magical libraries that make having your face pulled off by tentacled monstrosities from the dungeon dimensions seem a mere light massage by comparison .   fortunately cutwell had an expurgated edition  with some of the more distressing pages clamped shut  although on quiet nights he could hear the imprisoned words scritching irritably inside their prison  like a spider trapped in a matchbox  anyone who has ever sat next to someone wearing a walkman will be able to imagine exactly what they sounded like  .      this is the bit     said cutwell .     it says here that even gods           i   ve seen him before .         what .      mort pointed a shaking finger at the book .      him .      cutwell gave him an odd look and examined the left hand page .  there was a picture of an elderly wizard holding a book and a candlestick in an attitude of near terminal dignity .      that   s not part of the magic     he said testily     that   s just the author .         what does it say under the picture .         er .  it says    yff youe have enjoyed thiss boke  youe maye be interestede yn othere titles by           no  right under the picture is what i meant .         that   s easy .  it   s old malich himself .  every wizard knows him .  i mean  he founded the university .     cutwell chuckled .     there   s a famous statue of him in the main hall  and during rag week once i climbed up it and put a        mort stared at the picture .      tell me     he said quietly     did the statue have a drip on the end of its nose .         i shouldn   t think so     said cutwell .     it was marble .  but i don   t know what you   re getting so worked up about .  lots of people know what he looked like .  he   s famous .         he lived a long time ago  did he .         two thousand years  i think .  look  i don   t know why           i bet he didn   t die  though     said mort .     i bet he just disappeared one day .  did he .      cutwell was silent for a moment .      funny you should say that     he said slowly .     there was a legend i heard .  he got up to some weird things  they say .  they say he blew himself into the dungeon dimensions while trying to perform the rite of ashkente backwards .  all they found was his hat .  tragic  really .  the whole city in mourning for a day just for a hat .  it wasn   t even a particularly attractive hat  it had burn marks on it .         alberto malich     said mort  half to himself .     well .  fancy that .      he drummed his fingers on the table  although the sound was surprisingly muted .      sorry     said cutwell .     i can   t get the hang of treacle sandwiches  either .         i reckon the interface is moving at a slow walking pace     said mort  licking his fingers absentmindedly .     can   t you stop it by magic .      cutwell shook his head .     not me .  it   d squash me flat     he said cheerfully .      what   ll happen to you when it arrives  then .         oh  i   ll go back to living in wall street .  i mean  i never will have left .  all this won   t have happened .  pity  though .  the cooking here is pretty good  and they do my laundry for free .  how far away did you say it was  by the way .         about twenty miles  i guess .      cutwell rolled his eyes heavenwards and moved his lips .  eventually he said     that means it   ll arrive around midnight tomorrow  just in time for the coronation .         whose .         hers .         but she   s queen already  isn   t she .         in a way  but officially she   s not queen until she   s crowned .     cutwell grinned  his face a pattern of shade in the candlelight  and added     if you want a way of thinking about it  then it   s like the difference between stopping living and being dead .      twenty minutes earlier mort had been feeling tired enough to take root .  now he could feel a fizzing in his blood .  it was the kind of late night  frantic energy that you knew you would pay for around midday tomorrow  but for now he felt he had to have some action or else his muscles would snap out of sheer vitality .      i want to see her     he said .     if you can   t do anything  there might be something i can do .         there   s guards outside her room     said cutwell .     i mention this merely as an observation .  i don   t imagine for one minute that they   ll make the slightest difference .          it was midnight in ankh morpork  but in the great twin city the only difference between night and day was  well  it was darker .  the markets were thronged  the spectators were still thickly clustered around the whore pits  runners up in the city   s eternal and byzantine gang warfare drifted silently down through the chilly waters of the river with lead weights tied to their feet  dealers in various illegal and even illogical delights plied their sidelong trade  burglars burgled  knives flashed starlight in alleyways  astrologers started their day   s work and in the shades a nightwatchman who had lost his way rang his bell and cried out     twelve o   clock and all   s arrrrrgghhhh    .      however  the ankh morpork chamber of commerce would not be happy at the suggestion that the only real difference between their city and a swamp is the number of legs on the alligators  and indeed in the more select areas of ankh  which tend to be in the hilly districts where there is a chance of a bit of wind  the nights are gentle and scented with habiscine and cecillia blossoms .   on this particular night they were scented with saltpeter  too  because it was the tenth anniversary of the accession of the patrician  and he had invited a few friends round for a drink  five hundred of them in this case  and was letting off fireworks .  laughter and the occasional gurgle of passion filled the palace gardens  and the evening had just got to that interesting stage where everyone had drank too much for their own good but not enough actually to fall over .  it is the kind of state in which one does things that one will recall with crimson shame in later life  such as blowing through a paper squeaker and laughing so much that one is sick .   in fact some two hundred of the patrician   s guests were now staggering and kicking their way through the serpent dance  a quaint morporkian folkway which consisted of getting rather drunk  holding the waist of the person in front  and then wobbling and giggling uproariously in a long crocodile that wound through as many rooms as possible  preferably ones with breakables in  while kicking one leg vaguely in time with the beat  or at least in time with some other beat .  this dance had gone on for half an hour and had wound through every room in the palace  picking up two trolls  the cook  the patrician   s head torturer  three waiters  a burglar who happened to be passing and a small pet swamp dragon .   somewhere around the middle of the dance was fat lord rodley of quirm  heir to the fabulous quirm estates  whose current preoccupation was with the thin fingers gripping his waist .  under its bath of alcohol his brain kept trying to attract his attention .      i say     he called over his shoulder  as they oscillated for the tenth hilarious time through the enormous kitchen     not so tight  please .      i am most terribly sorry .      no offense  old chap .  do i know you .     said lord rodley  kicking vigorously on the back beat .   i think it unlikely .  tell me  please  what is the meaning of this activity .      what .     shouted lord rodley  above the sound of someone kicking in the door of a glass cabinet amid shrieks of merriment .   what is this thing that we do .  said the voice  with glacial patience .      haven   t you been to a party before .  mind the glass  by the way .      i am afraid i do not get out as much as i would like to .  please explain this .  does it have to do with sex .      not unless we pull up sharp  old boy  if you know what i mean .     said his lordship  and nudged his unseen fellow guest with his elbow .      ouch     he said .  a crash up ahead marked the demise of the cold buffet .   no .     what .      i do not know what you mean .      mind the cream there  it   s slippery   look  it   s just a dance  all right .  you do it for fun .      fun .      that   s right .  dada  dada  da   kick .     there was an audible pause .   who is this fun .      no  fun isn   t anybody  fun is what you have .      we are having fun .      i thought i was     said his lordship uncertainly .  the voice by his ear was vaguely worrying him  it appeared to be arriving directly into his brain .   what is this fun .      this is .      to kick vigorously is fun .      well  part of the fun .  kick .      to hear loud music in hot rooms is fun .      possibly .      how is this fun manifest .      well  it   look  either you   re having fun or you   re not  you don   t have to ask me  you just know  all right .  how did you get in here  anyway .     he added .     are you a friend of the patrician .      let us say  he puts business my way .  i felt i ought to learn something of human pleasures .      sounds like you   ve got a long way to go .      i know .  please excuse my lamentable ignorance .  i wish only to learn .  all these people  please   they are having fun .      yes .      then this is fun .      i   m glad we   ve got that sorted out .  mind the chair     snapped lord rodley  who was now feeling very unfunny and unpleasantly sober .   a voice behind him said quietly  this is fun .  to drink excessively is fun .  we are having fun .  he is having fun .  this is some fun .   what fun .   behind death the patrician   s small pet swamp dragon held on grimly to the bony hips and thought  guards or no guards  next time we pass an open window i   m going to run like buggery .       keli sat bolt upright in bed .      don   t move another step     she said .     guards .         we couldn   t stop him     said the first guard  poking his head shame facedly around the doorpost .      he just pushed in       said the other guard  from the other side of the doorway .      and the wizard said it was all right  and we were told everyone must listen to him because    .         all right  all right .  people could get murdered around here     said keli testily  and put the crossbow back on the bedside table without  unfortunately  operating the safety catch .   there was a click  the thwack of sinew against metal  a zip of air  and a groan .  the groan came from cutwell .  mort spun round to him .      are you all right .     he said .     did it hit you .         no     said the wizard  weakly .     no  it didn   t .  how do you feel .         a bit tired .  why .         oh  nothing .  nothing .  no draughts anywhere .  no slight leaking feelings .         no .  why .         oh  nothing  nothing .     cutwell turned and looked closely at the wall behind mort .      aren   t the dead allowed any peace .     said keli bitterly .     i thought one thing you could be sure of when you were dead was a good night   s sleep .     she looked as though she had been crying .  with an insight that surprised him  mort realized that she knew this and that it was making her even angrier than before .      that   s not really fair     he said .     i   ve come to help .  isn   t that right  cutwell .         hmm .     said cutwell  who had found the crossbow bolt buried in the plaster and was looking at it with deep suspicion .     oh  yes .  he has .  it won   t work  though .  excuse me  has anyone got any string .         help .     snapped keli .     help .  if it wasn   t for you           you   d still be dead     said mort .  she looked at him with her mouth open .      i wouldn   t know about it  though     she said .     that   s the worst part .         i think you two had better go     said cutwell to the guards  who were trying to appear inconspicuous .     but i   ll have that spear  please .  thank you .         look     said mort     i   ve got a horse outside .  you   d be amazed .  i can take you anywhere .  you don   t have to wait around here .         you don   t know much about monarchy  do you     said keli .      um .  no .         she means better to be a dead queen in your own castle than a live commoner somewhere else     said cutwell  who had stuck the spear into the wall by the bolt and was trying to sight along it .     wouldn   t work  anyway .  the dome isn   t centered on the palace  it   s centered on her .         on who .     said keli .  her voice could have kept milk fresh for a month .      on her highness     said cutwell automatically  squinting along the shaft .      don   t you forget it .         i won   t forget it  but that   s not the point     said the wizard .  he pulled the bolt out of the plaster and tested the point with his finger .      but if you stay here you   ll die .     said mort .      then i shall have to show the disc how a queen can die     said keli  looking as proud as was possible in a pink knitted bed jacket .   mort sat down on the end of the bed with his head in his hands .      i know how a queen can die     he muttered .     they die just like other people .  and some of us would rather not see it happen .         excuse me  i just want to look at this crossbow     said cutwell conversationally  reaching across them .     don   t mind me .         i shall go proudly to meet my destiny     said keli  but there was the barest flicker of uncertainty in her voice .      no you won   t .  i mean  i know what i   m talking about .  take it from me .  there   s nothing proud about it .  you just die .         yes  but it   s how you do it .  i shall die nobly  like queen ezeriel .      mort   s forehead wrinkled .  history was a closed book to him .      who   s she .         she lived in klatch and she had a lot of lovers and she sat on a snake     said cutwell  who was winding up the crossbow .      she meant to .  she was crossed in love .         all i can remember was that she used to take baths in asses    milk .  funny thing  history     said cutwell reflectively .     you become a queen  reign for thirty years  make laws  declare war on people and then the only thing you get remembered for is that you smelled like yogurt and were bitten in the           she   s a distant ancestor of mine     snapped keli .     i won   t listen to this sort of thing .         will you both be quiet and listen to me .     shouted mort .   silence descended like a shroud .   then cutwell sighted carefully and shot mort in the back .       the night shed its early casualties and journeyed onwards .  even the wildest parties had ended  their guests lurching home to their beds  or someone   s bed at any rate .  shorn of these fellow travelers  mere daytime people who had strayed out of their temporal turf  the true survivors of the night got down to the serious commerce of the dark .   this wasn   t so very different from ankh morpork   s daytime business  except that the knives were more obvious and people didn   t smile so much .   the shades were silent  save only for the whistled signals of thieves and the velvety hush of dozens of people going about their private business in careful silence .   and  in ham alley  cripple wa   s famous floating crap game was just getting under way .  several dozen cowled figures knelt or squatted around the little circle of packed earth where wa   s three eight sided dice bounced and spun their misleading lesson in statistical probability .      three .         tuphal   s eyes  by io .         he   s got you there  hummok .  this guy knows how to roll his bones .      it   s a knack .   hummok m   guk  a small flat faced man from one of the hublandish tribes whose skill at dice was famed wherever two men gathered together to fleece a third  picked up the dice and glared at them .  he silently cursed wa  whose own skill at switching dice was equally notorious among the cognoscenti but had  apparently  failed him  wished a painful and untimely death on the shadowy player seated opposite and hurled the dice into the mud .      twenty one the hard way .      wa scooped up the dice and handed them to the stranger .  as he turned to hummok one eye flickered ever so slightly .  hummok was impressed   he   d barely noticed the blur in wa   s deceptively gnarled fingers  and he   d been watching for it .   it was disconcerting the way the things rattled in the stranger   s hand and then flew out of it in a slow arc that ended with twenty four little spots pointing at the stars .   some of the more streetwise in the crowd shuffled away from the stranger  because luck like that can be very unlucky in cripple wa   s floating crap game .   wa   s hand closed over the dice with a noise like the click of a trigger .      all the eights     he breathed .     such luck is uncanny  mister .      the rest of the crowd evaporated like dew  leaving only those heavy set  unsympathetic looking men who  if wa had ever paid tax  would have gone down on his return as essential plant and business equipment .      maybe it   s not luck     he added .     maybe it   s wizarding .      i most strongly resent that .      we had a wizard once who tried to get rich     said wa .     can   t seem to remember what happened to him .  boys .         we give him a good talking to              and left him in pork passage              and in honey lane              and a couple other places i can   t remember .      the stranger stood up .  the boys closed in around him .   this is uncalled for .  i seek only to learn .  what pleasure can humans find in a mere reiteration of the laws of chance .      chance doesn   t come into it .  let   s have a look at him  boys .      the events that followed were recalled by no living soul except the one belonging to a feral cat  one of the city   s thousands  that was crossing the alley en route to a tryst .  it stopped and watched with interest .   the boys froze in mid stab .  painful purple light flickered around them .  the stranger pushed his hood back and picked up the dice  and then pushed them into wa   s unresisting hand .  the man was opening and shutting his mouth  his eyes unsuccessfully trying not to see what was in front of them .  grinning .   throw .   wa managed to look down at his hand .      what are the stakes .     he whispered .   if you win  you will refrain from these ridiculous attempts to suggest that chance governs the affairs of men .      yes .  yes .  and   if i lose .      you will wish you had won .   wa tried to swallow  but his throat had gone dry .     i know i   ve had lots of people murdered        twenty three  to be precise .      is it too late to say i   m sorry .      such things do not concern me .  now throw the dice .   wa shut his eyes and dropped the dice on to the ground  too nervous even to try the special flick and twist throw .  he kept his eyes shut .   all the eights .  there  that wasn   t too difficult  was it .   wa fainted .   death shrugged and walked away  pausing only to tickle the ears of an alley cat that happened to be passing .  he hummed to himself .  he didn   t quite know what had come over him  but he was enjoying it .          you couldn   t be sure it would work .      cutwell spread his hands in a conciliatory gesture .      well  no     he conceded     but i thought  what have i got to lose .     he backed away .      what have you got to lose .     shouted mort .   he stamped forward and tugged the bolt out of one of the posts in the princess   s bed .      you   re not going to tell me this went through me .     he snapped .      i was particularly watching it     said cutwell .      i saw it too     said keli .     it was horrible .  it came right out of where your heart is .         and i saw you walk through a stone pillar     said cutwell .      and i saw you ride straight through a window .         yes  but that was on business     declared mort  waving his hands in the air .     that wasn   t everyday  that   s different .  and        he paused .     the way you   re looking at me     he said .     they looked at me the same way in the inn this evening  what   s wrong .         it was the way you waved your arm straight through the bedpost     said keli faintly .   mort stared at his hand  and then rapped it on the wood .      see .     he said .     solid .  solid arm  solid wood .         you said people looked at you in an inn .     said cutwell .     what did you do  then .  walk through the wall .         no .  i mean  no  i just drank this drink  i think it was called scrumble           scumble .         yes .  tastes like rotten apples .  you   d have thought it was some sort of poison the way they kept staring .         how much did you drink  then .     said cutwell .      a pint  perhaps  i wasn   t really paying much attention           did you know scumble is the strongest alcoholic drink between here and the ramtops .     the wizard demanded .      no .  no one said     said mort .     what   s it got to do with           no     said cutwell  slowly     you didn   t know .  hmm .  that   s a clue  isn   t it .         has it got anything to do with saving the princess .         probably not .  i   d like to have a look at my books  though .         in that case it   s not important     said mort firmly .   he turned to keli  who was looking at him with the faint beginnings of admiration .      i think i can help     he said .     i think i can lay my hands on some powerful magic .  magic will hold back the dome  won   t it  cutwell .         my magic won   t .  it   d have to be pretty strong stuff  and i   m not sure about it even then .  reality is tougher than           i shall go     said mort .     until tomorrow  farewell .         it is tomorrow     keli pointed out .   mort deflated slightly .      all right  tonight then     he said  slightly put out  and added     i will begone .         begone what .         it   s hero talk     said cutwell  kindly .     he can   t help it .     mort scowled at him  smiled bravely at keli and walked out of the room .      he might have opened the door     said keli  after he had gone .      i think he was a bit embarrassed     said cutwell .     we all go through that stage .         what  of walking through things .         in a manner of speaking .  walking into them  anyway .         i   m going to get some sleep     keli said .     even the dead need some rest .  cutwell  stop fiddling with that crossbow  please .  i   m sure it   s not wizardly to be alone in a lady   s boudoir .         hmm .  but i   m not alone  am i .  you   re here .         that     she said     is the point  isn   t it .         oh .  yes .  sorry .  um .  i   ll see you in the morning  then .         goodnight  cutwell .  shut the door behind you .          the sun crept over the horizon  decided to make a run for it  and began to rise .   but it would be some time before its slow light rolled across the sleeping disc  herding the night ahead of it  and nocturnal shadows still ruled the city .   they clustered now around the mended drum in filigree street  foremost of the city   s taverns .  it was famed not for its beer  which looked like maiden   s water and tasted like battery acid  but for its clientele .  it was said that if you sat long enough in the drum  then sooner or later every major hero on the disc would steal your horse .   the atmosphere inside was still loud with talk and heavy with smoke although the landlord was doing all those things landlords do when they think it   s time to close  like turn some of the lights out  wind up the clock  put a cloth over the pumps and  just in case  check the whereabouts of their club with the nails hammered in it .  not that the customers were taking the slightest bit of notice  of course .  to most of the drum   s clientele even the nailed club would have been considered a mere hint .   however  they were sufficiently observant to be vaguely worried by the tall dark figure standing by the bar and drinking his way through its entire contents .   lonely  dedicated drinkers always generate a mental field which insures complete privacy  but this particular one was radiating a kind of fatalistic gloom that was slowly emptying the bar .   this didn   t worry the barman  because the lonely figure was engaged in a very expensive experiment .   every drinking place throughout the multiverse has them   those shelves of weirdly shaped  sticky bottles that not only contain exotically named liquid  which is often blue or green  but also odds and ends that bottles of real drink would never stoop to contain  such as whole fruits  bits of twig and  in extreme cases  small drowned lizards .  no one knows why barmen stock so many  since they all taste like treacle dissolved in turpentine .  it has been speculated that they dream of a day when someone will walk in off the street unbidden and ask for a glass of peach corniche with a hint of mint and overnight the place will become somewhere to be seen at .   the stranger was working his way along the row .   what is that green one .   the landlord peered at the label .      it says it   s melon brandy     he said doubtfully .     it says it   s bottled by some monks to an ancient recipe     he added .   i will try it .   the man looked sideways at the empty glasses on the counter  some of them still containing bits of fruit salad  cherries on a stick and small paper umbrellas .      are you sure you haven   t had enough .     he said .  it worried him vaguely that he couldn   t seem to make out the stranger   s face .   the glass  with its drink crystallizing out on the sides  disappeared into the hood and came out again empty .   no .  what is the yellow one with the wasps in it .      spring cordial  it says .  yes .      yes .  and then the blue one with the gold flecks .      er .  old overcoat .      yes .  and then the second row .      which one did you have in mind .      all of them .   the stranger remained bolt upright  the glasses with their burdens of syrup and assorted vegetation disappearing into the hood on a production line basis .   this is it  the landlord thought  this is style  this is where i buy a red jacket and maybe put some monkey nuts and a few gherkins on the counter  get a few mirrors around the place  replace the sawdust .  he picked up a beer soaked cloth and gave the woodwork a few enthusiastic wipes  speading the drips from the cordial glasses into a rainbow smear that took the varnish off .  the last of the usual customers put on his hat and staggered out  muttering to himself .      i don   t see the point  the stranger said .      sorry .      what is supposed to happen .      how many drinks have you had .      forty seven .      just about anything  then     said the barman and  because he knew his job and knew what was expected of him when people drank alone in the small hours  he started to polish a glass with the slops cloth and said     your lady thrown you out  has she .      pardon .      drowning your sorrows  are you .      i have no sorrows .      no  of course not .  forget i mentioned it .     he gave the glass a few more wipes .     just thought it helps to have someone to talk to     he said .   the stranger was silent for a moment  thinking .  then he said  you want to talk to me .      yes .  sure .  i   m a good listener .      no one ever wanted to talk to me before .      that   s a shame .      they never invite me to parties  you know .      tch .      they all hate me .  everyone hates me .  i don   t have a single friend .      everyone ought to have a friend     said the barman sagely .   i think        yes .      i think   i think i could be friends with the green bottle .   the landlord slid the octagon bottle along the counter .  death took it and tilted it over the glass .  the liquid tinkled on the rim .   you drunk i   m think  don   t you .      i serve anyone who can stand upright best out of three     said the landlord .   yourrre absorootly right .  but i     the stranger paused  one declamatory finger in the air .   was what i saying .      you said i thought you were drunk .      ah .  yes  but i can be shober any time i like .  this ish an experiment .  and now i would likes to experiment with the orange brandy again .   the landlord sighed  and glanced at the clock .  there was no doubt that he was making a lot of money  especially since the stranger didn   t seem inclined to worry about overcharging or short change .  but it was getting late  in fact it was getting so late that it was getting early .  there was also something about the solitary customer that unsettled him .  people in the mended drum often drank as though there was no tomorrow  but this was the first time he   d actually felt they might be right .   i mean  what have i got to look forward to .  where   s the sense in it all .  what is it really all about .      can   t say  my friend .  i expect you   ll feel better after a good night   s sleep .      sleep .  sleep .  i never sleep .  i   m wossname  proverbial for it .      everyone needs their sleep .  even me     he hinted .   they all hate me  you know .      yes  you said .  but it   s a quarter to three .      the stranger turned unsteadily and looked around the silent room .   there   s no one in the place but you and i  he said .   the landlord lifted up the flap and came around the bar  helping the stranger down from his stool .   i haven   t got a single friend .  even cats find me amusing .   a hand shot out and grabbed a bottle of amanita liquor before the man managed to propel its owner to the door  wondering how someone so thin could be so heavy .   i don   t have to be drunk  i said .  why do people like to be drunk .  is it fun .      helps them forget about life  old chap .  now just you lean there while i get the door open        forget about life .  ha .  ha .      you come back any time you like  y   hear .      you   d really like to see me again .   the landlord looked back at the small heap of coins on the bar .  that was worth a little weirdness .  at least this one was a quiet one  and seemed to be harmless .      oh  yes     he said  propelling the stranger into the street and retrieving the bottle in one smooth movement .     drop in anytime .      that   s the nicehest thing     the door slammed on the rest of the sentence .       ysabell sat up in bed .   the knocking came again  soft and urgent .  she pulled the covers up to her chin .      who is it .     she whispered .      it   s me  mort     came the hiss under the door .     let me in  please .         wait .      ysabell scrambled frantically on the bedside table for the matches  knocking over a bottle of toilet water and dislodging a box of chocolates that was now mostly discarded wrappers .  once she   d got the candle alight she adjusted its position for maximum effect  tweaked the line of her nightdress into something more revealing  and said     it   s not locked .      mort staggered into the room  smelling of horses and frost and scumble .      i hope     said ysabell archly     that you have not forced your way in here in order to take advantage of your position in this household .      mort looked around him .  ysabell was heavily into frills .  even the dressing table seemed to be wearing a petticoat .  the whole room wasn   t so much furnished as lingeried .      look  i haven   t got time to mess around     he said .     bring that candle into the library .  and for heaven   s sake put on something sensible  you   re overflowing .      ysabell looked down  and then her head snapped up .      well .      mort poked his head back round the door .     it   s a matter of life and death     he added  and disappeared .   ysabell watched the door creak shut after him  revealing the blue dressing gown with the tassels that death had thought up for her as a present last hogswatch and which she hadn   t the heart to throw away  despite the fact that it was a size too small and had a rabbit on the pocket .   finally she swung her legs out of bed  slipped into the shameful dressing gown  and padded out into the corridor .  mort was waiting for her .      won   t father hear us .     she said .      he   s not back .  come on .         how can you tell .         the place feels different when he   s here .  it   s   it   s like the difference between a coat when it   s being worn and when it   s hanging on a hook .  haven   t you noticed .         what are we doing that   s so important .      mort pushed open the library door .  a gust of warm  dry air drifted out  and the door hinges issued a protesting creak .      we   re going to save someone   s life     he said .     a princess  actually .      ysabell was instantly fascinated .      a real princess .  i mean can she feel a pea through a dozen mattresses .         can she    .     mort felt a minor worry disappear .     oh .  yes .  i thought albert had got it wrong .         are you in love with her .      mort came to a standstill between the shelves  aware of the busy little scritchings inside the book covers .      it   s hard to be sure     he said .     do i look it .         you look a bit flustered .  how does she feel about you .         don   t know .         ah     said ysabell knowingly  in the tones of an expert .     unrequited love is the worst kind .  it   s probably not a good idea to go taking poison or killing yourself  though     she added thoughtfully .     what are we doing here .  do you want to find her book to see if she marries you .         i   ve read it  and she   s dead     said mort .     but only technically .  i mean  not really dead .         good  otherwise that would be necromancy .  what are we looking for .         albert   s biography .         what for .  i don   t think he   s got one .         everyone   s got one .         well  he doesn   t like people asking personal questions .  i looked for it once and i couldn   t find it .  albert by itself isn   t much to go on .  why is he so interesting .     ysabell lit a couple of candles from the one in her hand and filled the library with dancing shadows .      i need a powerful wizard and i think he   s one .         what  albert .         yes .  only we   re looking for alberto malich .  he   s more than two thousand years old  i think .         what  albert .         yes .  albert .         he never wears a wizard   s hat     said ysabell doubtfully .      he lost it .  anyway  the hat isn   t compulsory .  where do we start looking .         well  if you   re sure   the stack  i suppose .  that   s where father puts all the biographies that are more than five hundred years old .  it   s this way .      she led the way past the whispering shelves to a door set in a cul de sac .  it opened with some effort and the groan of the hinges reverberated around the library  mort fancied for a moment that all the books paused momentarily in their work just to listen .   steps led down into the velvet gloom .  there were cobwebs and dust  and air that smelled as though it had been locked in a pyramid for a thousand years .      people don   t come down here very often     said ysabell .     i   ll lead the way .      mort felt something was owed .      i must say     he said     you   re a real brick .         you mean pink  square and dumpy .  you really know how to talk to a girl  my boy .         mort     said mort automatically .   the stack was as dark and silent as a cave deep underground .  the shelves were barely far enough apart for one person to walk between them  and towered up well beyond the dome of candlelight .  they were particularly eerie because they were silent .  there were no more lives to write  the books slept .  but mort felt that they slept like cats  with one eye open .  they were aware .      i came down here once     said ysabell  whispering .     if you go far enough along the shelves the books run out and there   s clay tablets and lumps of stone and animal skins and everyone   s called ug and zog .      the silence was almost tangible .  mort could feel the books watching them as they tramped through the hot  silent passages .  everyone who had ever lived was here somewhere  right back to the first people that the gods had baked out of mud or whatever .  they didn   t exactly resent him  they were just wondering about why he was here .      did you get past ug and zog .     he hissed .     there   s a lot of people would be very interested to know what   s there .         i got frightened .  it   s a long way and i didn   t have enough candles .         pity .      ysabell stopped so sharply that mort cannoned into the back of her .      this would be about the right area     she said .     what now .      mort peered at the faded names on the spines .      they don   t seem to be in any order .     he moaned .   they looked up .  they wandered down a couple of side alleys .  they pulled a few books off the lowest shelves at random  raising pillows of dust .      this is silly     said mort at last .     there   s millions of lives here .  the chances of finding his are worse than        ysabell laid her hand against his mouth .      listen .      mort mumbled a bit through her fingers and then got the message .  he strained his ears  striving to hear anything above the heavy hiss of absolute silence .   and then he found it .  a faint  irritable scratching .  high  high overhead  somewhere in the impenetrable darkness on the cliff of shelves  a life was still being written .   they looked at each other  their eyes widening .  then ysabell said     we passed a ladder back there .  on wheels .      the little casters on the bottom squeaked as mort rolled it back .  the top end moved too  as if it was fixed to another set of wheels somewhere up in the darkness .      right     he said .     give me the candle  and           if the candle   s going up  then so am i     said ysabell firmly .     you stop down here and move the ladder when i say .  and don   t argue .         it might be dangerous up there     said mort gallantly .      it might be dangerous down here     ysabell pointed out .     so i   ll be up the ladder with the candle  thank you .      she set her foot on the bottom rung and was soon no more than a frilly shadow outlined in a halo of candlelight that soon began to shrink .   mort steadied the ladder and tried not to think of all the lives pressing in on him .  occasionally a meteor of hot wax would thump into the floor beside him  raising a crater in the dust .  ysabell was now a faint glow far above  and he could feel every footstep as it vibrated down the ladder .   she stopped .  it seemed to be for quite a long time .   then her voice floated down  deadened by the weight of silence around them .      mort  i   ve found it .         good .  bring it down .         mort  you were right .         okay  thanks .  now bring it down .         yes  mort  but which one .         don   t mess about  that candle won   t last much longer .         mort .         what .         mort  there   s a whole shelf .          now it really was dawn  that cusp of the day that belonged to no one except the seagulls in morpork docks  the tide that rolled in up the river  and a warm turnwise wind that added a smell of spring to the complex odor of the city .   death sat on a bollard  looking out to sea .  he had decided to stop being drunk .  it made his head ache .   he   d tried fishing  dancing  gambling and drink  allegedly four of life   s greatest pleasures  and wasn   t sure that he saw the point .  food he was happy with   death liked a good meal as much as anyone else .  he couldn   t think of any other pleasures of the flesh or  rather  he could  but they were  well  fleshy  and he couldn   t see how it would be possible to go about them without some major bodily restructuring  which he wasn   t going to contemplate .  besides  humans seemed to leave off doing them as they grew older  so presumably they couldn   t be that attractive .   death began to feel that he wouldn   t understand people as long as he lived .   the sun made the cobbles steam and death felt the faintest tingling of that little springtime urge that can send a thousand tons of sap pumping through fifty feet of timber in a forest .   the seagulls swooped and dived around him .  a one eyed cat  down to its eighth life and its last ear  emerged from its lair in a heap of abandoned fish boxes  stretched  yawned  and rubbed itself against his legs .  the breeze  cutting through ankh   s famous smell  brought a hint of spices and fresh bread .   death was bewildered .  he couldn   t fight it .  he was actually feeling glad to be alive  and very reluctant to be death .   i must be sickening for something  he thought .       mort eased himself up the ladder alongside ysabell .  it was shaky  but seemed to be safe .  at least the height didn   t bother him  everything below was just blackness .   some of albert   s earlier volumes were very nearly falling apart .  he reached out for one at random  feeling the ladder tremble underneath them as he did so  brought it back and opened it somewhere in the middle .      move the candle this way     he said .      can you read it .         sort of              turnered hys hand  butt was sorelie vexed that alle menne at laste comme to nort  viz .  deathe  and vowed hymme to seke imortalitie yn his pride .     thus     he tolde the younge wizzerds     we may take unto

     it was albert all right .  mort caught several references to fried bread .      let   s have a look at what he   s doing now     said ysabell .      do you think we should .  it   s a bit like spying .         so what .  scared .         all right .      he flicked through until he came to the unfilled pages  and then turned back until he found the story of albert   s life  crawling across the page at surprising speed considering it was the middle of the night  most biographies didn   t have much to say about sleep  unless the dreams were particularly vivid .      hold the candle properly  will you .  i don   t want to get grease on his life .         why not .  he likes grease .         stop giggling  you   ll have us both off .  now look at this bit    .         he crept through the dusty darkness of the stack       ysabell read      his eyes fixed on the tiny glow of candlelight high above .  prying  he thought  poking away at things that shouldn   t concern them  the little devils           mort .  he   s           shut up .  i   m reading .            soon put a stop to this .  albert crept silently to the foot of the ladder  spat on his hands  and got ready to push .  the master   d never know  he was acting strange these days and it was all that lad   s fault  and        mort looked up into ysabell   s horrified eyes .   then the girl took the book out of mort   s hand  held it at arm   s length while her gaze remained fixed woodenly on his  and let it go .   mort watched her lips move and then realized that he  too  was counting under his breath .   three  four     there was a dull thump  a muffled cry  and silence .      do you think you   ve killed him .     said mort  after a while .      what  here .  anyway  i didn   t notice any better ideas coming from you .         no  but   he is an old man  after all .         no  he   s not     said ysabell sharply  starting down the ladder .      two thousand years .         not a day over sixty seven .         the books said           i told you  time doesn   t apply here .  not real time .  don   t you listen  boy .         mort     said mort .      and stop treading on my fingers  i   m going as fast as i can .         sorry .         and don   t act so wet .  have you any idea how boring it is living here .         probably not     said mort  adding with genuine longing     i   ve heard about boredom but i   ve never had a chance to try it .         it   s dreadful .         if it comes to that  excitement isn   t all it   s cracked up to be .         anything   s got to be better than this .      there was a groan from below  and then a stream of swearwords .   ysabell peered into the gloom .      obviously i didn   t damage his cursing muscles     she said .     i don   t think i ought to listen to words like that .  it could be bad for my moral fiber .      they found albert slumped against the foot of the bookshelf  muttering and holding his arm .      there   s no need to make that kind of fuss     said ysabell briskly .     you   re not hurt  father simply doesn   t allow that kind of thing to happen .         what did you have to go and do that for .     he moaned .     i didn   t mean any harm .         you were going to push us off     said mort  trying to help him up .     i read it .  i   m surprised you didn   t use magic .      albert glared at him .      oh  so you   ve found out  have you .     he said quietly .     then much good may it do you .  you   ve no right to go prying .      he struggled to his feet  shook off mort   s hand  and stumbled back along the hushed shelves .      no  wait     said mort     i need your help .         well  of course     said albert over his shoulder .     it stands to reason  doesn   t it .  you thought  i   ll just go and pry into someone   s private life and then i   ll drop it on him and then i   ll ask him to help me .         i only wanted to find out if you were really you     said mort  running after him .      i am .  everyone is .         but if you don   t help me something terrible will happen .  there   s this princess  and she           terrible things happen all the time  boy              mort              and no one expects me to do anything about it .         but you were the greatest .      albert stopped for a moment  but did not look around .      was the greatest  was the greatest .  and don   t you try to butter me up .  i ain   t butterable .         they   ve got statues to you and everything     said mort  trying not to yawn .      more fool them  then .     albert reached the foot of the steps into the library proper  stamped up them and stood outlined against the candlelight from the library .      you mean you won   t help .     said mort .     not even if you can .         give the boy a prize     growled albert .     and it   s no good thinking you can appeal to my better nature under this here crusty exterior     he added        cos my interior   s pretty damn crusty too .      they heard him cross the library floor as though he had a grudge against it  and slam the door behind him .      well     said mort  uncertainly .      what did you expect .     snapped ysabell .     he doesn   t care for anyone much except father .         it   s just that i thought someone like him would help if i explained it properly     said mort .  he sagged .  the rush of energy that had propelled him through the long night had evaporated  filling his mind with lead .     you know he was a famous wizard .         that doesn   t mean anything  wizards aren   t necessarily nice .  do not meddle in the affairs of wizards because a refusal often offends  i read somewhere .     ysabell stepped closer to mort and peered at him with some concern .     you look like something left on a plate     she said .         m okay     said mort  walking heavily up the steps and into the scratching shadows of the library .      you   re not .  you could do with a good night   s sleep  my lad .         m   t     murmured mort .   he felt ysabell slip his arm over her shoulder .  the walls were moving gently  even the sound of his own voice was coming from a long way off  and he dimly felt how nice it would be to stretch out on a nice stone slab and sleep forever .   death   d be back soon  he told himself  feeling his unprotesting body being helped along the corridors .  there was nothing for it  he   d have to tell death .  he wasn   t such a bad old stick .  death would help  all he needed to do was explain things .  and then he could stop all this worrying and go to slee    .          and what was your previous position .      i beg your pardon .      what did you do for a living .     said the thin young man behind the desk .   the figure opposite him shifted uneasily .   i ushered souls into the next world .  i was the grave of all hope .  i was the ultimate reality .  i was the assassin against whom no lock would hold .      yes  point taken  but do you have any particular skills .     death thought about it .   i suppose a certain amount of expertise with agricultural implements .  he ventured after a while .   the young man shook his head firmly .   no .      this is a city  mr .        he glanced down  and once again felt a faint unease that he couldn   t quite put his finger on      mr .    mr .    mr .   and we   re a bit short of fields .      he laid down his pen and gave the kind of smile that suggested he   d learned it from a book .   ankh morpork wasn   t advanced enough to possess an employment exchange .  people took jobs because their fathers made room for them  or because their natural talent found an opening  or by word of mouth .  but there was a call for servants and menial workers  and with the commercial sections of the city beginning to boom the thin young man   a mr .  liona keeble   had invented the profession of job broker and was  right at this moment  finding it difficult .      my dear mr .        he glanced down      mr .   we get many people coming into the city from outside because  alas  they believe life is richer here .  excuse me for saying so  but you seem to me to be a gentleman down on his luck .  i would have thought you would have preferred something rather more refined than       he glanced down again  and frowned         something nice working with cats or flowers .         i   m sorry .  i felt it was time for a change .      can you play a musical instrument .      no .      can you do carpentry .      i do not know  i have never tried .  death stared at his feet .  he was beginning to feel deeply embarrassed .   keeble shuffled the paper on his desk  and sighed .   i can walk through walls  death volunteered  aware that the conversation had reached an impasse .   keeble looked up brightly .     i   d like to see that     he said .     that could be quite a qualification .      right .   death pushed his chair back and stalked confidently towards the nearest wall .   ouch .   keeble watched expectantly .     go on  then     he said .   um .  this is an ordinary wall  is it .      i assume so .  i   m not an expert .      it seems to be presenting me with some difficulty .      so it would appear .      what do you call the feeling of being very small and hot .   keeble twiddled his pencil .      pygmy .      begins with an m .      embarrassing .         yes     said death  i mean yes .      it would seem that you have no useful skill or talent whatsoever     he said .     have you thought of going into teaching .      death   s face was a mask of terror .  well  it was always a mask of terror  but this time he meant it to be .      you see     said keeble kindly  putting down his pen and steepling his hands together     it   s very seldom i ever have to find a new career for an   what was it again .      anthropomorphic personification .      oh  yes .  what is that  exactly .      death had had enough .   this  he said .   for a moment  just for a moment  mr .  keeble saw him clearly .  his face went nearly as pale as death   s own .  his hands jerked convulsively .  his heart gave a stutter .   death watched him with mild interest  then drew an hourglass from the depths of his robe and held it up to the light and examined it critically .   settle down  he said  you   ve got a good few years yet .      bbbbbbb        i could tell you how many if you like .   keeble  fighting to breathe  managed to shake his head .   do you want me to get you a glass of water  then .      nnn   nnn .      the shop bell jangled .  keeble   s eyes rolled .  death decided that he owed the man something .  he shouldn   t be allowed to lose custom  which was clearly something humans valued dearly .   he pushed aside the bead curtain and stalked into the outer shop  where a small fat woman  looking rather like an angry cottage loaf  was hammering on the counter with a haddock .      it   s about that cook   s job up at the university     she said .     you told me it was a good position and it   s a disgrace up there  the tricks them students play  and i demand   i want you to   i   m not    .      her voice trailed off .         ere     she said  but you could tell her heart wasn   t in it     you   re not keeble  are you .      death stared at her .  he   d never before experienced an unsatisfied customer .  he was at a less .  finally he gave up .   begone  you black and midnight hag  he said .   the cook   s small eyes narrowed .         oo are you calling a midnight bag .     she said accusingly  and hit the counter with the fish again .     look at this     she said .     last night it was my bedwarmer  in the morning it   s a fish .  i ask you .      may all the demons of hell rend your living spirit if you don   t get out of the shop this minute  death tried .      i don   t know about that  but what about my bedwarmer .  it   s no place for a respectable woman up there  they tried to        if you would care to go away  said death desperately  i will give you some money .      how much .     said the cook  with a speed that would have outdistanced a striking rattlesnake and given lightning a nasty shock .   death pulled out his coin bag and tipped a heap of verdigrised and darkened coins on the counter .  she regarded them with deep suspicion .   now leave upon the instant  said death  and added  before the searing winds of infinity scorch thy worthless carcass .      my husband will be told about this     said the cook darkly  as she left the shop .  it seemed to death that no threat of his could possibly be as dire .   he stalked back through the curtains .  keeble  still slumped in his chair  gave a kind of strangled gurgle .      it was true .     he said .     i thought you were a nightmare .      i could take offense at that  said death .      you really are death .     said keeble .   yes .      why didn   t you say .      people usually prefer me not to .   keeble scrabbled among his papers  giggling hysterically .      you want to do something else .     he said .     tooth fairy .  water sprite .  sandman .      do not be foolish .  i simply   feel i want a change .   keeble   s frantic rustling at last turned up the paper he   d been searching for .  he gave a maniacal laugh and thrust it into death   s hands .   death read it .   this is a job .  people are paid to do this .      yes  yes  go and see him  you   re just the right type .  only don   t tell him i sent you .          binky moved at a hard gallop across the night  the disc unrolling far below his hooves .  now mort found that the sword could reach out further than he had thought  it could reach the stars themselves  and he swung it across the deeps of space and into the heart of a yellow dwarf which went nova most satisfactorily .  he stood in the saddle and whirled the blade around his head  laughing as the blue flame fanned across the sky leaving a trail of darkness and embers .   and didn   t stop .  mort struggled as the sword cut through the horizon  grinding down the mountains  drying up the seas  turning green forests into punk and ashes .  he heard voices behind him  and the brief screams of friends and relatives as he turned desperately .  dust storms whirled from the dead earth as he fought to release his own grip  but the sword burned icy cold in his hand  dragging him on in a dance that would not end until there was nothing left alive .   and that time came  and mort stood alone except for death  who said     a fine job  boy .      and mort said  mort .      mort .  mort .  wake up .      mort surfaced slowly  like a corpse in a pond .  he fought against it  clinging to his pillow and the horrors of sleep  but someone was tugging urgently at his ear .      mmmph .     he said .      mort .         wsst .         mort  it   s father .      he opened his eyes and stared up blankly into ysabell   s face .  then the events of the previous night hit him like a sock full of damp sand .   mort swung his legs out of bed  still wreathed in the remains of his dream .      yeah  okay     he said .     i   ll go and see him directly .         he   s not here .  albert   s going crazy .     ysabell stood by the bed  tugging a handkerchief between her hands .     mort  do you think something bad has happened to him .      he gave her a blank look .     don   t be bloody stupid     he said     he   s death .     he scratched his skin .  he felt hot and dry and itchy .      but he   s never been away this long .  not even when there was that big plague in pseudopolis .  i mean  he has to be here in the mornings to do the books and work out the nodes and        mort grabbed her arms .     all right  all right     he said  as soothingly as he could manage .     i   m sure everything   s okay .  just settle down  i   ll go and check   why have you got your eyes shut .         mort  please put some clothes on     said ysabell in a tight little voice .   mort looked down .      sorry     he said meekly     i didn   t realize   who put me to bed .         i did     she said .     but i looked the other way .      mort dragged on his breeches  shrugged into his shirt and hurried out towards death   s study with ysabell on his heels .  albert was in there  jumping from foot to foot like a duck on a griddle .  when mort came in the look on the old man   s face could almost have been gratitude .   mort saw with amazement that there were tears in his eyes .      his chair hasn   t been sat in     albert whined .      sorry  but is that important .     said mort .     my grandad didn   t used to come home for days if he   d had a good sale at the market .         but he   s always here     said albert .     every morning  as long as i   ve known him  sitting here at his desk a working on the nodes .  it   s his job .  he wouldn   t miss it .         i expect the nodes can look after themselves for a day or two     said mort .   the drop in temperature told him he was wrong .  he looked at their faces .      they can   t .     he said .   both heads shook .      if the nodes aren   t worked out properly all the balance is destroyed     said ysabell .     anything could happen .         didn   t he explain .     said albert .      not really .  i   ve really only done the practical side .  he said he   d tell me about the theoretical stuff later     said mort .  ysabell burst into tears .   albert took mort   s arm and  with considerable dramatic waggling of his eyebrows  indicated that they should have a little talk in the corner .  mort trailed after him reluctantly .   the old man rummaged in his pockets and at last produced a battered paper bag .      peppermint .     he inquired .   mort shook his head .      he never tell you about the nodes .     said albert .   mort shook his head again .  albert gave his peppermint a suck  it sounded like the plughole in the bath of god .      how old are you  lad .         mort .  i   m sixteen .         there   s some things a lad ought to be tole before he   s sixteen     said albert  looking over his shoulder at ysabell  who was sobbing in death   s chair .      oh  i know about that .  my father told me all about that when we used to take the thargas to be mated .  when a man and a woman           about the universe is what i meant     said albert hurriedly .     i mean  have you ever thought about it .         i know the disc is carried through space on the backs of four elephants that stand on the shell of great a   tuin     said mort .      that   s just part of it .  i meant the whole universe of time and space and life and death and day and night and everything .         can   t say i   ve ever given it much thought     said mort .      ah .  you ought .  the point is  the nodes are part of it .  they stop death from getting out of control  see .  not him  not death .  just death itself .  like  uh       albert struggled for words      like  death should come exactly at the end of life  see  and not before or after  and the nodes have to be worked out so that the key figures   you   re not taking this in  are you .         sorry .         they   ve got to be worked out     said albert flatly     and then the correct lives have got to be got .  the hourglasses  you call them .  the actual duty is the easy job .         can you do it .         no .  can you .         no .      albert sucked reflectively at his peppermint .     that   s the whole world in the gyppo  then     he said .      look  i can   t see why you   re so worried .  i expect he   s just got held up somewhere     said mort  but it sounded feeble even to him .  it wasn   t as though people buttonholed death to tell him another story  or clapped him on the back and said things like    you   ve got time for a quick half in there  my old mate  no need to rush off home    or invited him to make up a skittles team and come out for a klatchian take away afterwards  or   it struck mort with sudden  terrible poignancy that death must be the loneliest creature in the universe .  in the great party of creation  he was always in the kitchen .      i   m sure i don   t know what   s come over the master lately     mumbled albert .     out of the chair  my girl .  let   s have a look at these nodes .      they opened the ledger .   they looked at it for a long time .   then mort said     what do all those symbols mean .         sodomy non sapiens     said albert under his breath .      what does that mean .         means i   m buggered if i know .         that was wizard talk  wasn   t it .     said mort .      you shut up about wizard talk .  i don   t know anything about wizard talk .  you apply your brain to this here .      mort looked down again at the tracery of lines .  it was as if a spider had spun a web on the page  stopping at every junction to make notes .  mort stared until his eyes hurt  waiting for some spark of inspiration .  none volunteered .      any luck .         it   s all klatchian to me     said mort .     i don   t even know whether it should be read upside down or sideways .         spiralling from the center outwards     sniffed ysabell from her seat in the corner .   their heads collided as they both peered at the center of the page .  they stared at her .  she shrugged .      father taught me how to read the node chart     she said     when i used to do my sewing in here .  he used to read bits out .         you can help .     said mort .      no     said ysabell .  she blew her nose .      what do you mean  no .     growled albert .     this is too important for any flighty           i mean     said ysabell  in razor tones     that i can do them and you can help .          the ankh morpork guild of merchants has taken to hiring large gangs of men with ears like fists and fists like large bags of walnuts whose job it is to re educate those misguided people who publicly fail to recognize the many attractive points of their fine city .  for example the philosopher catroaster was found floating face downward in the river within hours of uttering the famous line     when a man is tired of ankh morpork  he is tired of ankle deep slurry .      therefore it is prudent to dwell on one   of the very many  of course   on one of the things that makes ankh morpork renowned among the great cities of the multiverse .   this is its food .   the trade routes of half the disc pass through the city or down its rather sluggish river .  more than half the tribes and races of the disc have representatives dwelling within its sprawling acres .  in ankh morpork the cuisines of the world collide  on the menu are one thousand types of vegetable  fifteen hundred cheeses  two thousand spices  three hundred types of meat  two hundred fowl  five hundred different kinds of fish  one hundred variations on the theme of pasta  seventy eggs of one kind or another  fifty insects  thirty molluscs  twenty assorted snakes and other reptiles  and something pale brown and warty known as the klatchian migratory bog truffle .   its eating establishments range from the opulent  where the portions are tiny but the plates are silver  to the secretive  where some of the disc   s more exotic inhabitants are rumored to eat anything they can get down their throat best out of three .   harga   s house of ribs down by the docks is probably not numbered among the city   s leading eateries  catering as it does for the type of beefy clientele that prefers quantity and breaks up the tables if it doesn   t get it .  they don   t go in for the fancy or exotic  but stick to conventional food like flightless bird embryos  minced organs in intestine skins  slices of hog flesh and burnt ground grass seeds dipped in animal fats  or  as it is known in their patois  egg  soss and bacon and a fried slice .   it was the kind of eating house that didn   t need a menu .  you just looked at harga   s vest .   still  he had to admit  this new cook seemed to be the business .  harga  an expansive advert for his own high carbohydrate merchandise  beamed at a room full of satisfied customers .  and a fast worker  too .  in fact  disconcertingly fast .   he rapped on the hatch .      double egg  chips  beans  and a trollburger  hold the onions     he rasped .   right .   the hatch slid up a few seconds later and two plates were pushed through .  harga shook his head in gratified amazement .   it had been like that all evening .  the eggs were bright and shiny  the beans glistened like rubies  and the chips were the crisp golden brown of sunburned bodies on expensive beaches .  harga   s last cook had turned out chips like little paper bags full of pus .   harga looked around the steamy cafe .  no one was watching him .  he was going to get to the bottom of this .  he rapped on the hatch again .      alligator sandwich     he said .     and make it sna        the hatch shot up .  after a few seconds to pluck up enough courage  harga peered under the top slice of the long sarny in front of him .  he wasn   t saying that it was alligator  and he wasn   t saying it wasn   t .  he knuckled the hatch again .      okay     he said     i   m not complaining  i just want to know how you did it so fast .      time is not important .      you say .      right .   harga decided not to argue .      well  you   re doing a damn fine job in there  boy     he said .   what is it called when you feel warm and content and wish things would stay that way .      i guess you   d call it happiness     said harga .   inside the tiny  cramped kitchen  strata   d with the grease of decades  death spun and whirled  chopping  slicing and flying .  his skillet flashed through the fetid steam .   he   d opened the door to the cold night air  and a dozen neighborhood cats had strolled in  attracted by the bowls of milk and meat   some of harga   s best  if he   d known   that had been strategically placed around the floor .  occasionally death would pause in his work and scratch one of them behind the ears .      happiness     he said  and puzzled at the sound of his own voice .       cutwell  the wizard and royal recognizer by appointment  pulled himself up the last of the tower steps and leaned against the wall  waiting for his heart to stop thumping .   actually it wasn   t particularly high  this tower  just high for sto lat .  in general design and outline it looked the standard sort of tower for imprisoning princesses in  it was mainly used to store old furniture .   however  it offered unsurpassed views of the city and the sto plain  which is to say  you could see an awful lot of cabbages .   cutwell made it as far as the crumbling crenellations atop the wall and looked out at the morning haze .  it was  maybe  a little hazier than usual .  if he tried hard he could imagine a flicker in the sky .  if he really strained his imagination he could hear a buzzing out over the cabbage fields  a sound like someone frying locusts .  he shivered .   at a time like this his hands automatically patted his pockets  and found nothing but half a bag of jelly babies  melted into a sticky mass  and an apple core .  neither offered much consolation .   what cutwell wanted was what any normal wizard wanted at a time like this  which was a smoke .  he   d have killed for a cigar  and would have gone as far as a flesh wound for a squashed dog end .  he pulled himself together .  resolution was good for the moral fiber  the only trouble was the fiber didn   t appreciate the sacrifices he was making for it .  they said that a truly great wizard should be permanently under tension .  you could have used cutwell for a bowstring .   he turned his back on the brassica ed landscape and made his way back down the winding steps to the main part of the palace .   still  he told himself  the campaign appeared to be working .  the population didn   t seem to be resisting the fact that there was going to be a coronation  although they weren   t exactly clear about who was going to be crowned .  there was going to be bunting in the streets and cutwell had arranged for the town square   s main fountain to run  if not with wine  then at least with an acceptable beer made from broccoli .  there was going to be folk dancing  at sword point if necessary .  there would be races for children .  there would be an ox roast .  the royal coach had been regilded and cutwell was optimistic that people could be persuaded to notice it as it went by .   the high priest at the temple of blind io was going to be a problem .  cutwell had marked him down as a dear old soul whose expertise with the knife was so unreliable that half of the sacrifices got tired of waiting and wandered away .  the last time he   d tried to sacrifice a goat it had time to give birth to twins before he could focus  and then the courage of motherhood had resulted in it chasing the entire priesthood out of the temple .   the chances of him succeeding in putting the crown on the right person even in normal circumstances were only average  cutwell had calculated  he   d have to stand alongside the old boy and try tactfully to guide his shaking hands .   still  even that wasn   t the big problem .  the big problem was much bigger than that .  the big problem had been sprung on him by the chancellor after breakfast .      fireworks .     cutwell had said .      that   s the sort of thing you wizard fellows are supposed to be good at  isn   t it .     said the chancellor  as crusty as a week old loaf .     flashes and bangs and whatnot .  i remember a wizard when i was a lad           i   m afraid i don   t know anything about fireworks     said cutwell  in tones designed to convey that he cherished this ignorance .      lots of rockets     the chancellor reminisced happily .     ankhian candles .  thunderflashes .  and thingies that you can hold in your hand .  it   s not a proper coronation without fireworks .         yes  but  you see           good man     said the chancellor briskly     knew we could rely on you .  plenty of rockets  you understand  and to finish with there must be a set piece  mind you  something really breathtaking like a portrait of   of       his eyes glazed over in a way that was becoming depressingly familiar to cutwell .      the princess keli     he said wearily .      ah .  yes .  her     said the chancellor .     a portrait of   who you said   in fireworks .  of course  it   s probably all pretty simple stuff to you wizards  but the people like it .  nothing like a good blowout and a blowup and a bit of balcony waving to keep the loyalty muscles in tip top shape  that   s what i always say .  see to it .  rockets .  with runes on .      an hour ago cutwell had thumbed through the index of the monster fun grimoire and had cautiously assembled a number of common household ingredients and put a match to them .   funny thing about eyebrows  he mused .  you never really noticed them until they   d gone .   red around the eyes  and smelling slightly of smoke  cutwell ambled towards the royal apartments past bevies of maids engaged in whatever it was maids did  which always seemed to take at least three of them .  whenever they saw cutwell they would usually go silent  hurry past with their heads down and then break into muffled giggles along the corridor .  this annoyed cutwell .  not   he told himself quickly   because of any personal considerations  but because wizards ought to be shown more respect .  besides  some of the maids had a way of looking at him which caused him to think distinctly unwizardly thoughts .   truly  he thought  the way of enlightenment is like unto half a mile of broken glass .   he knocked on the door of keli   s suite .  a maid opened it .      is your mistress in .     he said  as haughtily as he could manage .   the maid put her hand to her mouth .  her shoulders shook .  her eyes sparkled .  a sound like escaping steam crept between her fingers .   i can   t help it  cutwell thought  i just seem to have this amazing effect on women .      is it a man .     came keli   s voice from within .  the maid   s eyes glazed over and she tilted her head  as if not sure of what she had heard .      it   s me  cutwell     said cutwell .      oh  that   s all right  then .  you can come in .      cutwell pushed past the girl and tried to ignore the muffled laughter as the maid fled the room .  of course  everyone knew a wizard didn   t need a chaperon .  it was just the tone of the princess   s    oh  that   s all right then    that made him writhe inside .   keli was sitting at her dressing table  brushing her hair .  very few men in the world ever find out what a princess wears under her dresses  and cutwell joined them with extreme reluctance but with remarkable self control .  only the frantic bobbing of his adam   s apple betrayed him .  there was no doubt about it  he   d be no good for magic for days .   she turned and he caught a whiff of talcum powder .  for weeks  dammit  for weeks .      you look a bit hot  cutwell .  is something the matter .         naarg .         i   m sorry .      he shook himself .  concentrate on the hairbrush  man  the hairbrush .     just a bit of magical experimenting  ma   am .  only superficial burns .         is it still moving .         i am afraid so .      keli turned back to the mirror .  her face was set .      have we got time .      this was the bit he   d been dreading .  he   d done everything he could .  the royal astrologer had been sobered up long enough to insist that tomorrow was the only possible day the ceremony could take place  so cutwell had arranged for it to begin one second after midnight .  he   d ruthlessly cut the score of the royal trumpet fanfare .  he   d timed the high priest   s invocation to the gods and then sub edited heavily  there was going to be a row when the gods found out .  the ceremony of the anointing with sacred oils had been cut to a quick dab behind the ears .  skateboards were an unknown invention on the disc  if they hadn   t been  keli   s trip up the aisle would have been unconstitutionally fast .  and it still wasn   t enough .  he nerved himself .      i think possibly not     he said .     it could be a very close thing .      he saw her glare at him in the mirror .      how close .         um .  very .         are you trying to say it might reach us at the same time as the ceremony .         um .  more sort of  um  before it     said cutwell wretchedly .  there was no sound but the drumming of keli   s fingers on the edge of the table .  cutwell wondered if she was going to break down  or smash the mirror .  instead she said      how do you know .      he wondered if he could get away with saying something like  i   m a wizard  we know these things  but decided against it .  the last time he   d said that she   d threatened him with the axe .      i asked one of the guards about that inn mort talked about     he said .     then i worked out the approximate distance it had to travel .  mort said it was moving at a slow walking pace  and i reckon his stride is about           as simple as that .  you didn   t use magic .         only common sense .  it   s a lot more reliable in the long run .      she reached out and patted his hand .      poor old cutwell     she said .      i am only twenty  ma   am .      she stood up and walked over to her dressing room .  one of the things you learn when you   re a princess is always to be older than anyone of inferior rank .      yes  i suppose there must be such things as young wizards     she said over her shoulder .     it   s just that people always think of them as old .  i wonder why this is .         rigors of the calling  ma   am     said cutwell  rolling his eyes .  he could hear the rustle of silk .      what made you decide to become a wizard .     her voice was muffled  as if she had something over her head .      it   s indoor work with no heavy lifting     said cutwell .     and i suppose i wanted to learn how the world worked .         have you succeeded  then .         no .     cutwell wasn   t much good at small talk  otherwise he   d never have let his mind wander sufficiently to allow him to say     what made you decide to become a princess .      after a thoughtful silence she said     it was decided for me  you know .         sorry  i           being royal is a sort of family tradition .  i expect it   s the same with magic  no doubt your father was a wizard .      cutwell gritted his teeth .     um .  no     he said     not really .  absolutely not  in fact .      he knew what she would say next  and here it came  reliable as the sunset  in a voice tinged with amusement and fascination .      oh .  is it really true that wizards aren   t allowed to           well  if that   s all i really should be going     said cutwell loudly .     if anyone wants me  just follow the explosions .  i   gnnnh .      keli had stepped out of the dressing room .   now  women   s clothes were not a subject that preoccupied cutwell much   in fact  usually when he thought about women his mental pictures seldom included any clothes at all   but the vision in front of him really did take his breath away .  whoever had designed the dress didn   t know when to stop .  they   d put lace over the silk  and trimmed it with black vermine  and strung pearls anywhere that looked bare  and puffed and starched the sleeves and then added silver filigree and then started again with the silk .   in fact it really was amazing what could be done with several ounces of heavy metal  some irritated molluscs  a few dead rodents and a lot of thread wound out of insects    bottoms .  the dress wasn   t so much worn as occupied  if the outlying flounces weren   t supported on wheels  then keli was stronger than he   d given her credit for .      what do you think .     she said  turning slowly .     this was worn by my mother  and my grandmother  and her mother .         what  all together .     said cutwell  quite prepared to believe it .  how can she get into it .  he wondered .  there must be a door round the back    .      it   s a family heirloom .  it   s got real diamonds on the bodice .         which bit   s the bodice .         this bit .      cutwell shuddered .     it   s very impressive     he said  when he could trust himself to speak .     you don   t think it   s perhaps a bit mature  though .         it   s queenly .         yes  but perhaps it won   t allow you to move very fast .         i have no intention of running .  there must be dignity .     once again the set of her jaw traced the line of her descent all the way to her conquering ancestor  who preferred to move very fast at all times and knew as much about dignity as could be carried on the point of a sharp spear .   cutwell spread his hands .      all right     he said .     fine .  we all do what we can .  i just hope mort has come up with some ideas .         it   s hard to have confidence in a ghost     said keli .     he walks through walls .         i   ve been thinking about that     said cutwell .     it   s a puzzle  isn   t it .  he walks through things only if he doesn   t know he   s doing it .  i think it   s an industrial disease .         what .         i was nearly sure last night .  he   s becoming real .         but we   re all real .  at least  you are  and i suppose i am .         but he   s becoming more real .  extremely real .  nearly as real as death  and you don   t get much realler .  not much realler at all .             are you sure .     said albert  suspiciously .      of course     said ysabell .     work it out yourself if you like .      albert looked back at the big book  his face a portrait of uncertainty .      well  they could be about right     he conceded with bad grace  and copied out the two names on a scrap of paper .     there   s one way to find out  anyway .      he pulled open the top drawer of death   s desk and extracted a big iron keyring .  there was only one key on it .   what happens now .  said mort .      we   ve got to fetch the lifetimers     said albert .     you have to come with me .         mort .     hissed ysabell .      what .         what you just said       she lapsed into silence  and then added     oh  nothing .  it just sounded   odd .         i only asked what happens now     said mort .      yes  but   oh  never mind .      albert brushed past them and sidled out into the hallway like a two legged spider until he reached the door that was always kept locked .  the key fitted perfectly .  the door swung open .  there wasn   t so much as a squeak from its hinges  just a swish of deeper silence .   and the roar of sand .   mort and ysabell stood in the doorway  transfixed  as albert stamped off between the aisles of glass .  the sound didn   t just enter the body via the ears  it came up through the legs and down through the skull and filled up the brain until all that it could think of was the rushing  hissing gray noise  the sound of millions of lives being lived .  and rushing towards their inevitable destination .   they stared up and out at the endless ranks of lifetimers  every one different  every one named .  the light from torches ranged along the walls picked highlights off them  so that a star gleamed on every glass .  the far walls of the room were lost in the galaxy of light .   mort felt ysabell   s fingers tighten on his arm .  when she spoke  her voice was strained .      mort  some of them are so small .      i know .   her grip relaxed  very gently  like someone putting the top ace on a house of cards and taking their hand away gingerly so as not to bring the whole edifice down .      say that again .     she said quietly .      i said i know .  there   s nothing i can do about it .  haven   t you been in here before .         no .     she had withdrawn slightly  and was staring at his eyes .      it   s no worse than the library     said mort  and almost believed it .  but in the library you only read about it  in here you could see it happening .      why are you looking at me like that .     he added .      i was just trying to remember what color your eyes were     she said     because           if you two have quite had enough of each other .     bellowed albert above the roar of the sand .     this way .         brown     said mort to ysabell .     they   re brown .  why .         hurry up .         you   d better go and help him     said ysabell .     he seems to be getting quite upset .      mort left her  his mind a sudden swamp of uneasiness  and stalked across the tiled floor to where albert stood impatiently tapping a foot .      what do i have to do .     he said .      just follow me .      the room opened out into a series of passages  each one lined with the hourglasses .  here and there the shelves were divided by stone pillars inscribed with angular markings .  albert glanced at them occasionally  mainly he strode through the maze of sand as though he knew every turn by heart .      is there one glass for everyone  albert .         yes .         this place doesn   t look big enough .         do you know anything about m dimensional topography .         um .  no .         then i shouldn   t aspire to hold any opinions  if i was you     said albert .   he paused in front of a shelf of glasses  glanced at the paper again  ran his hand along the row and suddenly snatched up a glass .  the top bulb was almost empty .      hold this     he said .     if this is right  then the other should be somewhere near .  ah .  here .      mort turned the two glasses around in his hands .  one had all the markings of an important life  while the other one was squat and quite unremarkable .   mort read the names .  the first seemed to refer to a nobleman in the agatean empire regions .  the second was a collection of pictograms that he recognized as originating in turnwise klatch .      over to you     albert sneered .     the sooner you get started  the sooner you   ll be finished .  i   ll bring binky round to the front door .         do my eyes look all right to you .     said mort  anxiously .      nothing wrong with them that i can see     said albert .     bit red round the edges  bit bluer than usual  nothing special .      mort followed him back past the long shelves of glass  looking thoughtful .  ysabell watched him take the sword from the rack by the door and test its edge by swishing it through the air  just as death did  and grinning mirthlessly at the satisfactory sound of the thunderclap .   she recognized the walk .  he was stalking .      mort .     she whispered .   yes .      something   s happening to you .      i know  said mort .     but i think i can control it .      they heard the sound of hooves outside  and albert pushed the door open and came in rubbing his hands .      right  lad  no time to        mort swung the sword at arm   s length .  it scythed through the air with a noise like ripping silk and buried itself in the doorpost by albert   s ear .   on your knees  alberto malich .   albert   s mouth dropped open .  his eyes rolled sideways to the shimmering blade a few inches from his head  and then narrowed to tight little lines .      you surely wouldn   t dare  boy     he said .   mort .  the syllable snapped out as fast as a whiplash and twice as vicious .      there was a pact     said albert  but there was the barest gnat song of doubt in his voice .     there was an agreement .         not with me .         there was an agreement .  where would we be if we could not honor an agreement .         i don   t know where i would be     said mort softly .  but i know where you would go .      that   s not fair .     now it was a whine .   there   s no justice .  there   s just me .      stop it     said ysabell .     mort  you   re being silly .  you can   t kill anyone here .  anyway  you don   t really want to kill albert .         not here .  but i could send him back to the world .      albert went pale .      you wouldn   t .         no .  i can take you back and leave you there .  i shouldn   t think you   ve got much time left  have you .     have you .      don   t talk like that     said albert  quite failing to meet his gaze .     you sound like the master when you talk like that .         i could be a lot worse than the master     said mort evenly .     ysabell  go and get albert   s book  will you .         mort  i really think you   re        shall i ask you again .   she fled from the room  white faced .   albert squinted at mort along the length of the sword  and smiled a lopsided  humorless smile .      you won   t be able to control it forever     he said .      i don   t want to .  i just want to control it for long enough .         you   re receptive now  see .  the longer the master is away  the more you   ll become just like him .  only it   ll be worse  because you   ll remember all about being human and           what about you  then .     snapped mort .     what can you remember about being human .  if you went back  how much life have you got left .         ninety one days  three hours and five minutes     said albert promptly .     i knew he was on my trail  see .  but i   m safe here and he   s not such a bad master .  sometimes i don   t know what he   d do without me .         yes  no one dies in death   s own kingdom .  and you   re pleased with that .     said mort .      i   m more than two thousand years old  i am .  i   ve lived longer than anyone in the world .      mort shook his head .      you haven   t  you know     he said .     you   ve just stretched things out more .  no one really lives here .  the time in this place is just a sham .  it   s not real .  nothing changes .  i   d rather die and see what happens next than spend eternity here .      albert pinched his nose reflectively .     yes  well  you might     he conceded     but i was a wizard  you know .  i was pretty good at it .  they put up a statue to me  you know .  but you don   t live a long life as a wizard without making a few enemies  see  ones who   ll   wait on the other side .      he sniffed .     they ain   t all got two legs  either .  some of them ain   t got legs at all .  or faces .  death don   t frighten me .  it   s what comes after .         help me  then .         what good will that do me .         one day you might need some friends on the other side     said mort .  he thought for a few seconds and added     if i were you  it wouldn   t do any harm to give my soul a bit of a last minute polish .  some of those waiting for you might not like the taste of that .      albert shuddered and shut his eyes .      you don   t know about that what you talk about     he added  with more feeling than grammar     else you wouldn   t say that .  what do you want from me .      mort told him .   albert cackled .      just that .  just change reality .  you can   t .  there isn   t any magic strong enough any more .  the great spells could of done it .  nothing else .  and that   s it  so you might as well do as you please and the best of luck to you .      ysabell came back  a little out of breath  clutching the latest volume of albert   s life .  albert sniffed again .  the tiny drip on the end of his nose fascinated mort .  it was always on the point of dropping off but never had the courage .  just like him  he thought .      you can   t do anything to me with the book     said the old wizard warily .      i don   t intend to .  but it strikes me that you don   t get to be a powerful wizard by telling the truth all the time .  ysabell  read out what   s being written .            albert looked at him uncertainly        ysabell read .      you can   t believe everything writ down there                 he burst out  knowing in the flinty pit of his heart that mort certainly could        ysabell read .      stop it .            he shouted  trying to put at the back of his mind the knowledge that even if reality could not be stopped it might be possible to slow it down a little .         how .         intoned mort in the leaden tones of death        began ysabell dutifully .      yes  yes  all right  you needn   t bother with my bit     snapped mort irritably .      pardon me for living  i   m sure .      no one gets pardoned for living .      and don   t talk like that to me  thank you .  it doesn   t frighten me     she said .  she glanced down at the book  where the moving line of writing was calling her a liar .      tell me how  wizard     said mort .      my magic   s all i   ve got left .     wailed albert .      you don   t need it  you old miser .         you don   t frighten me  boy        look into my face and tell me that .   mort snapped his fingers imperiously .  ysabell bent her head over the book again .         albert looked into the blue glow of those eyes and the last of his defiance drained away        she read        for he saw not just death but death with all the human seasonings of vengeance and cruelty and distaste  and with a terrible certainty he knew that this was the last chance and mort would send him back into time and hunt him down and take him and deliver him bodily into the dark dungeon dimensions where creatures of horror would dot dot dot dot dot        she finished .     it   s just dots for half a page .         that   s because the book daren   t even mention them     whispered albert .  he tried to shut his eyes but the pictures in the darkness behind his eyelids were so vivid that he opened them again .  even mort was better than that .      all right     he said .     there is one spell .  it slows down time over a little area .  i   ll write it down  but you   ll have to find a wizard to say it .         i can do that .      albert ran a tongue like an old loofah over his dry lips .      there is a price  though     he added .     you must complete the duty first .         ysabell .     said mort .  she looked at the page in front of her .      he means it     she said .     if you don   t then everything will go wrong and he   ll drop back into time anyway .      all three of them turned to look at the great clock that dominated the hallway .  its pendulum blade sawed slowly through the air  cutting time into little pieces .   mort groaned .      there isn   t enough time .     he groaned .     i can   t do both of them in time .     he groaned .     i can   t do both of them in time .         the master would have found time     observed albert .   mort wrenched the blade from the doorway and shook it furiously but ineffectually towards albert  who flinched .      write down the spell  then     he shouted .     and do it fast .      he turned on his heel and stalked back into death   s study .  there was a large disc of the world in one corner  complete down to solid silver elephants standing on the back of a great a   tuin cast in bronze and more than a meter long .  the great rivers were represented by veins of jade  the deserts by powdered diamond and the most notable cities were picked out in precious stones  ankh morpork  for instance  was a carbuncle .   he plonked the two glasses down at the approximate locations of their owners and flopped down in death   s chair  glaring at them  willing them to be closer together .  the chair squeaked gently as he swivelled from side to side  glowering at the little disc .   after a while ysabell came in  treading softly .      albert   s written it down     she said quietly .     i   ve checked the book .  it isn   t a trick .  he   s gone and locked himself in his room now and           look at these two .  i mean  will you look at them .         i think you should calm down a bit  mort .         how can i calm down with  look  this one over here almost in the great nef  and this one right in bes pelargic and then i   ve got to get back to sto lat .  that   s a ten thousand mile round trip however you look at it .  it can   t be done .         i   m sure you   ll find a way .  and i   ll help .      he looked at her for the first time and saw she was wearing her outdoor coat  the unsuitable one with the big fur collar .      you .  what could you do .         binky can easily carry two     said ysabell meekly .  she waved a paper package vaguely .     i   ve packed us something to eat .  i could   hold open doors and things .      mort laughed mirthlessly .  that won   t be necessary .      i wish you   d stop talking like that    .      i can   t take passengers .  you   ll slow me down .      ysabell sighed .     look  how about this .  let   s pretend we   ve had the row and i   ve won .  see .  it saves a lot of effort .  i actually think you might find binky rather reluctant to go if i   m not there .  i   ve fed him an awful lot of sugar lumps over the years .  now   are we going .          albert sat on his narrow bed  glowering at the wall .  he heard the sound of hoofbeats  abruptly cut off as binky got airborne  and muttered under his breath .   twenty minutes passed .  expressions flitted across the old wizard   s face like cloud shadows across a hillside .  occasionally he   d whisper something to himself  like    i told    em    or    never would of stood for it    or    the master ought to be tole .      eventually he seemed to reach an agreement with himself  knelt down gingerly and pulled a battered trunk from under his bed .  he opened it with difficulty and unfolded a dusty gray robe that scattered mothballs and tarnished sequins across the floor .  he pulled it on  brushed off the worst of the dust  and crawled under the bed again .  there was a lot of muffled cursing and the occasional clink of china and finally albert emerged holding a staff taller than he was .   it was thicker than any normal staff  mainly because of the carvings that covered it from top to bottom .  they were actually quite indistinct  but gave the impression that if you could see them better you would regret it .   albert brushed himself down again and examined himself critically in the washstand mirror .   then he said     hat .  no hat .  got to have a hat for the wizarding .  damn .      he stamped out of the room and returned after a busy fifteen minutes which included a circular hole cut out of the carpet in mort   s bedroom  the silver paper taken out from behind the mirror in ysabell   s room  a needle and thread from the box under the sink in the kitchen and a few loose sequins scraped up from the bottom of the robe chest .  the end result was not as good as he would have liked and tended to slip rakishly over one eye  but it was black and had stars and moons on it and proclaimed its owner to be  without any doubt  a wizard  although possibly a desperate one .   he felt properly dressed for the first time in two thousand years .  it was a disconcerting feeling and caused him a second   s reflection before he kicked aside the rag rug beside the bed and used the staff to draw a circle on the floor .   when the tip of the staff passed it left a line of glowing octarine  the eighth color of the spectrum  the color of magic  the pigment of the imagination .   he marked eight points on its circumference and joined them up to form an octogram .  a low throbbing began to fill the room .   alberto malich stepped into the center and held the staff above his head .  he felt it wake to his grip  felt the tingle of the sleeping power unfold itself slowly and deliberately  like a waking tiger .  it triggered old memories of power and magic that buzzed through the cobwebbed attics of his mind .  he felt alive for the first time in centuries .   he licked his lips .  the throbbing had died away  leaving a strange  waiting kind of silence .   malich raised his head and shouted one single syllable .   blue green fire flashed from both ends of the staff .  streams of octarine flame spouted from the eight points of the octogram and enveloped the wizard .  all this wasn   t actually necessary to accomplish the spell  but wizards consider appearances are very important    .   so are disappearances .  he vanished .       stratohemispheric winds whipped at mort   s cloak .      where are we going first .     yelled ysabell in his ear .      bes pelargic .     shouted mort  the gale whirling his words away .      where   s that .         agatean empire .  counterweight continent .      he pointed downward .   he wasn   t forcing binky at the moment  knowing the miles that lay ahead  and the big white horse was currently running at an easy gallop out over the ocean .  ysabell looked down at roaring green waves topped with white foam  and clung tighter to mort .   mort peered ahead at the cloudbank that marked the distant continent and resisted the urge to hurry binky along with the flat of his sword .  he   d never struck the horse and wasn   t at all confident about what would happen if he did .  all he could do was wait .   a hand appeared under his arm  holding a sandwich .      there   s ham or cheese and chutney     she said .     you might as well eat  there   s nothing else to do .      mort looked down at the soggy triangle and tried to remember when he last had a meal .  some time beyond the reach of a clock  anyway   he   d need a calendar to calculate it .  he took the sandwich .      thanks     he said  as graciously as he could manage .   the tiny sun rolled down towards the horizon  towing its lazy daylight behind it .  the clouds ahead grew  and became outlined in pink and orange .  after a while he could make out the darker blur of land below them  with here and there the lights of a city .   half an hour later he was sure he could see individual buildings .  agatean architecture inclined towards squat pyramids .   binky lost height until his hooves were barely a few feet above the sea .  mort examined the hourglass again  and gently tugged on the reins to direct the horse towards a seaport a little rimwards of their present course .   there were a few ships at anchor  mostly single sailed coastal traders .  the empire didn   t encourage its subjects to go far away  in case they saw things that might disturb them .  for the same reason it had built a wall around the entire country  patrolled by the heavenly guard whose main function was to tread heavily on the fingers of any inhabitants who felt they might like to step outside for five minutes for a breath of fresh air .   this didn   t happen often  because most of the subjects of the sun emperor were quite happy to live inside the wall .  it   s a fact of life that everyone is on one side or other of a wall  so the only thing to do is forget about it or evolve stronger fingers .      who runs this place .     said ysabell  as they passed over the harbor .      there   s some kind of boy emperor     said mort .     but the top man is really the grand vizier  i think .         never trust a grand vizier     said ysabell wisely .   in fact the sun emperor didn   t .  the vizier  whose name was nine turning mirrors  had some very clear views about who should run the country  e . g .   that it should be him  and now the boy was getting big enough to ask questions like    don   t you think the wall would look better with a few gates in it .     and    yes  but what is it like on the other side .     he had decided that in the emperor   s own best interests he should be painfully poisoned and buried in quicklime .   binky landed on the raked gravel outside the low  many roomed palace  severely rearranging the harmony of the universe .   mort slid off his back and helped ysabell down .      just don   t get in the way  will you .     he said urgently .     and don   t ask questions either .      he ran up some lacquered steps and hurried through the silent rooms  pausing occasionally to take his bearings from the hourglass .  at last he sidled down a corridor and peered through an ornate lattice into a long low room where the court was at its evening meal .   the young sun emperor was sitting crosslegged at the head of the mat with his cloak of vermine and feathers spread out behind him .  he looked as though he was outgrowing it .  the rest of the court was sitting around the mat in strict and complicated order of precedence  but there was no mistaking the vizier  who was tucking into his bowl of squishi and boiled seaweed in a highly suspicious fashion .  no one seemed to be about to die .   mort padded along the passage  turned the corner and nearly walked into several large members of the heavenly guard  who were clustered around a spyhole in the paper wall and passing a cigarette from hand to hand in that palm cupped way of soldiers on duty .   he tiptoed back to the lattice and overheard the conversation thus      i am the most unfortunate of mortals  o immanent presence  to find such as this in my otherwise satisfactory squishi    said the vizier  extending his chopsticks .   the court craned to see .  so did mort .  mort couldn   t help agreeing with the statement  though   the thing was a sort of blue green lump with rubbery tubes dangling from it .      the preparer of food will be disciplined  noble personage of scholarship     said the emperor .     who got the spare ribs .         no  o perceptive father of your people  i was rather referring to the fact that this is  i believe  the bladder and spleen of the deepwater puff eel  allegedly the most tasty of morsels to the extent that it may be eaten only by those beloved of the gods themselves or so it is written  among such company of course i do not include my miserable self .      with a deft flick he transported it to the bowl of the emperor  where it wobbled to a standstill .  the boy looked at it for some time  and then skewered it on a chopstick .      ah     he said     but is it not also written by none other than the great philosopher ly tin wheedle that a scholar may be ranked above princes .  i seem to remember you giving me the passage to read once  o faithful and assiduous seeker of knowledge .      the thing followed another brief arc through the air and flopped apologetically into the vizier   s bowl .  he scooped it up in a quick movement and poised it for a second service .  his eyes narrowed .      such may be generally the case  o jade river of wisdom  but specifically i cannot be ranked above the emperor whom i love as my own son and have done ever since his late father   s unfortunate death  and thus i lay this small offering at your feet .      the eyes of the court followed the wretched organ on its third flight across the mat  but the emperor snatched up his fan and brought off a magnificent volley that ended back in the vizier   s bowl with such force that it sent up a spray of seaweed .      somebody eat it  for heaven   s sake     shouted mort  totally unheard .     i   m in a hurry .         thou art indeed the most thoughtful of servants  o devoted and indeed only companion of my late father and grandfather when they passed over  and therefore i decree that your reward shall be this most rare and exquisite of morsels .      the vizier prodded the thing uncertainly  and looked into the emperor   s smile .  it was bright and terrible .  he fumbled for an excuse .      alas  it would seem that i have already eaten far too much       he began  but the emperor waved him into silence .      doubtless it requires a suitable seasoning     he said  and clapped his hands .  the wall behind him ripped from top to bottom and four heavenly guards stepped through  three of them brandishing cando swords and the fourth trying hurriedly to swallow a lighted dog end .   the vizier   s bowl dropped from his hands .      my most faithful of servants believes he has no space left for this final mouthful     said the emperor .     doubtless you can investigate his stomach to see if this is true .  why has that man got smoke coming out of his ears .         anxious for action  o sky eminence     said the sergeant quickly .     no stopping him  i   m afraid .         then let him take his knife and   oh  the vizier seems to be hungry after all .  well done .      there was absolute silence while the vizier   s cheeks bulged rhythmically .  then he gulped .      delicious     he said .     superb .  truly the food of the gods  and now  if you will excuse me       he unfolded his legs and made as if to stand up .  little beads of sweat had appeared on his forehead .      you wish to depart .     said the emperor  raising his eyebrows .      pressing matters of state  o perspicacious personage of           be seated .  rising so soon after meals can be bad for the digestion     said the emperor  and the guards nodded agreement .     besides  there are no urgent matters of state unless you refer to those in the small red bottle marked    antidote    in the black lacquered cabinet on the bamboo rug in your quarters  o lamp of midnight oil .      there was a ringing in the vizier   s ears .  his face began to go blue .      you see .     said the emperor .     untimely activity on a heavy stomach is conducive to ill humors .  may this message go swiftly to all corners of my country  that all men may know of your unfortunate condition and derive instruction thereby .         i   must   congratulate your   personage on such   consideration     said the vizier  and fell forward into a dish of boiled soft shelled crabs .      i had an excellent teacher     said the emperor .   about time  too  said mort  and swung the sword .   a moment later the soul of the vizier got up from the mat and looked mort up and down .      who are you  barbarian .     he snapped .   death .      not my death     said the vizier firmly .     where   s the black celestial dragon of fire .      he couldn   t come  said mort .  there were shadows forming in the air behind the vizier   s soul .  several of them wore emperor   s robes  but there were plenty of others jostling them  and they all looked most anxious to welcome the newcomer to the lands of the dead .      i think there   s some people here to see you     said mort  and hurried away .  as he reached the passageway the vizier   s soul started to scream    .   ysabell was standing patiently by binky  who was making a late lunch of a five hundred year old bonsai tree .      one down     said mort  climbing into the saddle .     come on .  i   ve got a bad feeling about the next one  and we haven   t much time .          albert materialized in the center of unseen university  in the same place  in fact  from which he had departed the world some two thousand years before .   he grunted with satisfaction and brushed a few specks of dust off his robe .   he became aware that he was being watched  on looking up  he discovered that he had flashed into existence under the stern marble gaze of himself .   he adjusted his spectacles and peered disapprovingly at the bronze plaque screwed to his pedestal .  it said      alberto malich  founder of this university .  am               .     we will not see his like again .         so much for prediction  he thought .  and if they thought so much of him they could at least have hired a decent sculptor .  it was disgraceful .  the nose was all wrong .  call that a leg .  people had been carving their names on it  too .  he wouldn   t be seen dead in a hat like that  either .  of course  if he could help it  he wouldn   t be seen dead at all .   albert aimed an octarine thunderbolt at the ghastly thing and grinned evilly as it exploded into dust .      right     he said to the disc at large     i   m back .     the tingle from the magic coursed all the way up his arm and started a warm glow in his mind .  how he   d missed it  all these years .   wizards came hurrying through the big double doors at the sound of the explosion and cleared the wrong conclusion from a standing start .   there was the pedestal  empty .  there was a cloud of marble dust over everything .  and striding out of it  muttering to himself  was albert .   the wizards at the back of the crowd started to have it away as quickly and quietly as possible .  there wasn   t one of them that hadn   t  at some time in his jolly youth  put a common bedroom utensil on old albert   s head or carved his name somewhere on the statue   s chilly anatomy  or spilled beer on the pedestal .  worse than that  too  during rag week when the drink flowed quickly and the privy seemed too far to stagger .  these had all seemed hilarious ideas at the time .  they suddenly didn   t  now .   only two figures remained to face the statue   s wrath  one because he had got his robe caught in the door and the other because he was  in fact  an ape and could therefore take a relaxed attitude to human affairs .   albert grabbed the wizard  who was trying desperately to walk into the wall .  the man squealed .      all right  all right  i admit it .  i was drunk at the time  believe me  didn   t mean it  gosh  i   m sorry  i   m so sorry           what are you bleating about  man .     said albert  genuinely puzzled .         so sorry  if i tried to tell you how sorry i am we   d           stop this bloody nonsense .     albert glanced down at the little ape  who gave him a warm friendly smile .     what   s your name  man .         yes  sir  i   ll stop  sir  right away  no more nonsense  sir   rincewind  sir .  assistant librarian  if it   s all right by you .      albert looked him up and down .  the man had a desperate scuffed look  like something left out for the laundry .  he decided that if this was what wizarding had come to  someone ought to do something about it .      what sort of librarian would have you for assistant .     he demanded irritably .      oook .      something like a warm soft leather glove tried to hold his hand .      a monkey .  in my university .         orangoutang  sir .  he used to be a wizard but got caught in some magic  sir  now he won   t let us turn him back  and he   s the only one who knows where all the books are     said rincewind urgently .     i look after his bananas     he added  feeling some additional explanation was called for .   albert glared at him .     shut up .         shutting up right away  sir .         and tell me where death is .         death  sir .     said rincewind  backing against the wall .      tall  skeletal  blue eyes  stalks  talks like this   death .  seen him lately .      rincewind swallowed .     not lately  sir .         well  i want him .  this nonsense has got to stop .  i   m going to stop it now  see .  i want the eight most senior wizards assembled here  right  in half an hour with all the necessary equipment to perform the rite of ashkente  is that understood .  not that the sight of you lot gives me any confidence .  bunch of pantywaisters the lot of you  and stop trying to hold my hand .         oook .         and now i   m going to the pub     snapped albert .     do they sell any halfway decent cat   s piss anywhere these days .         there   s the drum  sir     said rincewind .      the broken drum .  in filigree street .  still there .         well  they change the name sometimes and rebuild it completely but the site has been  er  on the site for years .  i expect you   re pretty dry  eh  sir .     rincewind said  with an air of ghastly camaraderie .      what would you know about it .     said albert sharply .      absolutely nothing  sir     said rincewind promptly .      i   m going to the drum  then .  half an hour  mind .  and if they   re not waiting for me when i come back  then well  they   d just better be .      he stormed out of the hall in a cloud of marble dust .   rincewind watched him go .  the librarian held his hand .      you know the worst of it .     said rincewind .      oook .         i don   t even remember walking under a mirror .          at about the time albert was in the mended drum arguing with the landlord over a yellowing bar tab that had been handed down carefully from father to son through one regicide  three civil wars  sixty one major fires  four hundred and ninety robberies and more than fifteen thousand bar room brawls to record the fact that alberto malich still owed the management three copper pieces plus interest currently standing at the contents of most of the disc   s larger strongrooms  which proved once again that an ankhian merchant with an unpaid bill has the kind of memory that would make an elephant blink   at about this time  binky was leaving a vapor trail in skies above the great mysterious continent of klatch .   far below drums sounded in the scented  shadowy jungles and columns of curling mist rose from hidden rivers where nameless beasts lurked under the surface and waited for supper to walk past .      there   s no more cheese  you   ll have to have the ham     said ysabell .     what   s that light over there .         the light dams     said mort .     we   re getting closer .     he pulled the hourglass out of his pocket and checked the level of the sand .      but not close enough  dammit .      the light dams lay like pools of light hubwards of their course  which is exactly what they were  some of the tribes constructed mirror walls in the desert mountains to collect the disc sunlight  which is slow and slightly heavy .  it was used as currency .   binky glided over the campfires of the nomads and the silent marshes of the tsort river .  ahead of them dark  familiar shapes began to reveal themselves in the moonlight .      the pyramids of tsort by moonlight .     breathed ysabell .     how romantic .      mortared with the blood of thousands of slaves  observed mort .      please don   t .         i   m sorry  but the practical fact of the matter is that these           all right  all right  you   ve made your point     said ysabell irritably .      it   s a lot of effort to go to to bury a dead king     said mort  as they circled above one of the smaller pyramids .     they fill them full of preservative  you know  so they   ll survive into the next world .         does it work .         not noticeably .     mort leaned over binky   s neck .     torches down there     he said .     hang on .      a procession was winding away from the avenue of pyramids  led by a giant statue of offler the crocodile god borne by a hundred sweating slaves .  binky cantered above it  entirely unnoticed  and performed a perfect four point landing on the hard packed sand outside the pyramid   s entrance .      they   ve pickled another king     said mort .  he examined the glass again in the moonlight .  it was quite plain  not the sort normally associated with royalty .      that can   t be him     said ysabell .     they don   t pickle them when they   re still alive  do they .         i hope not  because i read where  before they do the preserving  they  um  cut them open and remove           i don   t want to hear it              all the soft bits     mort concluded lamely .     it   s just as well the pickling doesn   t work  really  just imagine having to walk around with no           so it isn   t the king you   ve come to take     said ysabell loudly .     who is it  then .      mort turned towards the dark entrance .  it wouldn   t be sealed until dawn  to give time for the dead king   s soul to leave .  it looked deep and foreboding  hinting at purposes considerably more dire than  say  keeping a razor blade nice and sharp .      let   s find out     he said .          look out .  he   s coming back .      the university   s eight most senior wizards shuffled into line  tried to smooth out their beards and in general made an unsuccessful effort to look presentable .  it wasn   t easy .  they had been snatched from their workrooms  or a postprandial brandy in front of a roaring fire  or quiet contemplation under a handkerchief in a comfy chair somewhere  and all of them were feeling extremely apprehensive and rather bewildered .  they kept glancing at the empty pedestal .   only one creature could have duplicated the expressions on their faces  and that would be a pigeon who has heard not only that lord nelson has got down off his column but has also been seen buying a    bore repeater and a box of cartridges .      he   s coming up the corridor .     shouted rincewind  and dived behind a pillar .   the assembled mages watched the big double doors as if they were about to explode  which shows how prescient they were  because they exploded .  matchstick sized bits of oak rained down among them and a small thin figure stood outlined against the light .  it held a smoking staff in one hand .  the other held a small yellow toad .      rincewind .     bawled albert .      sir .         take this thing away and dispose of it .      the toad crawled into rincewind   s hand and gave him an apologetic look .      that   s the last time that bloody landlord gives any lip to a wizard     said albert with smug satisfaction .     it seems i turn my back for a few hundred years and suddenly people in this town are encouraged to think they can talk back to wizards  eh .      one of the senior wizards mumbled something .      what was that .  speak up  man .         as the bursar of this university i must say that we   ve always encouraged a good neighbor policy with respect to the community     mumbled the wizard  trying to avoid albert   s gimlet stare .  he had an upturned chamber pot on his conscience  with three cases of obscene graffiti to be taken into consideration .   albert let his mouth drop open .     why .     he said .      well  er  a sense of civic duty  we feel it   s vitally important that we show an examp   arrgh .      the wizard tried desperately to beat out the flames in his beard .  albert lowered his staff and looked slowly along the row of mages .  they swayed away from his stare like grass in a gale .      anyone else want to show a sense of civic duty .     he said .     good neighbors  anybody .     he drew himself up to his full height .     you spineless maggots .  i didn   t found this university so you could lend people the bloody lawnmower .  what   s the use of having the power if you don   t wield it .  man doesn   t show you respect  you don   t leave enough of his damn inn to roast chestnuts on  understand .      something like a soft sigh went up from the assembled wizards .  they stared sadly at the toad in rincewind   s hand .  most of them  in the days of their youth  had mastered the art of getting rascally drunk at the drum .  of course  all that was behind them now  but the guild of merchants    annual knife and fork supper would have been held in the dram   s upstairs room the following evening  and all the eighth level wizards had been sent complimentary tickets  there would have been roast swan and two kinds of trifle and lots of fraternal toasts to    our esteemed  nay  distinguished guests    until it was time for the college porters to turn up with the wheelbarrows .   albert strutted along the row  poking the occasional paunch with his staff .  his mind danced and sang .  go back .  never .  this was power  this was living  he   d challenge old boniface and spit in his empty eye .      by the smoking mirror of grism  there   s going to be a few changes around here .      those wizards who had studied history nodded uncomfortably .  it would be back to the stone floors and getting up when it was still dark and no alcohol under any circumstances and memorizing the true names of everything until the brain squeaked .      what   s that man doing .      a wizard who had absent mindedly reached for his tobacco pouch let the half formed cigarette fall from his trembling fingers .  it bounced when it hit the floor and all the wizards watched it roll with longing eyes until albert stepped forward smartly and squashed it .   albert spun round .  rincewind  who had been following him as a sort of unofficial adjutant  nearly walked into him .      you .  rincething .  d   yer smoke .         no  sir .  filthy habit .     rincewind avoided the gaze of his superiors .  he was suddenly aware that he had made some lifelong enemies  and it was no consolation to know that he probably wouldn   t have them for very long .      right .  hold my staff .  now  you bunch of miserable back sliders  this is going to stop  d   yer hear .  first thing tomorrow  up at dawn  three times round the quadrangle and back here for physical jerks .  balanced meals .  study .  healthy exercise .  and that bloody monkey goes to a circus  first thing .         oook .      several of the older wizards shut their eyes .      but first     said albert  lowering his voice     you   ll oblige me by setting up the rite of ashkente .         i have some unfinished business     he added .       mort strode through the cat black corridors of the pyramid  with ysabell hurrying along behind him .  the faint glow from his sword illuminated unpleasant things  offler the crocodile god was a cosmetics advert compared to some of the things the people of tsort worshipped .  in alcoves along the way were statues of creatures apparently built of all the bits god had left over .      what are they here for .     whispered ysabell .      the tsortean priests say they come alive when the pyramid is sealed and prowl the corridors to protect the body of the king from tomb robbers     said mort .      what a horrible superstition .         who said anything about superstition .     said mort absently .      they really come alive .         all i   ll say is that when the tsorteans put a curse on a place  they don   t mess about .      mort turned a corner and ysabell lost sight of him for a heart stopping moment .  she scurried through the darkness and cannoned into him .  he was examining a dog headed bird .      urgh     she said .     doesn   t it send shivers up your spine .         no     said mort flatly .      why not .      because i am mort .  he turned  and she saw his eyes glow like blue pinpoints .      stop it .      i   can   t .   she tried to laugh .  it didn   t work .     you   re not death     she said .     you   re only doing his job .      death is whoever does death   s job .   the shocked pause that followed this was broken by a groan from further along the dark passage .  mort turned on his heel and hurried towards it .   he   s right  thought ysabell .  even the way he moves    .   but the fear of the darkness that the light was dragging towards her overcame any other doubts and she crept after him  around another corner and into what appeared  in the fitful glow from the sword  to be a cross between a treasury and a very cluttered attic .      what   s this place .     she whispered .     i   ve never seen so much stuff .      the king takes it with him into the next world  said mort .      he certainly doesn   t believe in traveling light .  look  there   s a whole boat .  and a gold bathtub .      doubtless he will wish to keep clean when he gets there .      and all those statues .      those statues  i   m sorry to say  were people .  servants for the king  you understand .   ysabell   s face set grimly .   the priests give them poison .   there was another groan  from the other side of the cluttered room .  mort followed it to its source  stepping awkwardly over rolls of carpet  bunches of dates  crates of crockery and piles of gems .  the king obviously hadn   t been able to decide what he was going to leave behind on his journey  so had decided to play safe and take everything .   only it doesn   t always work quickly  mort added somberly .   ysabell clambered gamely after him  and peered over a canoe at a young girl sprawled across a pile of rugs .  she was wearing gauze trousers  a waistcoat cut from not enough material  and enough bangles to moor a decent sized ship .  there was a green stain around her mouth .      does it hurt .     said ysabell quietly .   no .  they think it takes them to paradise .      does it    .   maybe .  who knows .  mort took the hourglass out of an inner pocket and inspected it by the gleam of the sword .  he seemed to be counting to himself  and then with a sudden movement tossed the glass over his shoulder and brought the sword down with his other hand .   the girl   s shade sat up and stretched  with a clink of ghostly jewelry .  she caught sight of mort  and bowed her head .      my lord .      no one   s lord  said mort .  now run along to wherever you believe you   re going .      i shall be a concubine at the heavenly court of king zetesphut  who will dwell among the stars forever     she said firmly .      you don   t have to be     said ysabell sharply .  the girl turned to her  wide eyed .      oh  but i must .  i   ve been training for it     she said  as she faded from view .     i   ve only managed to be a handmaiden up till now .      she vanished .  ysabell stared with dark disapproval at the space she had occupied .      well .     she said  and     did you see what she had on .      let   s get out of here .      but it can   t be true about king whosis dwelling among the stars     she grumbled as they found their way out of the crowded room .     there   s nothing but empty space up there .      it   s hard to explain  said mort .  he   ll dwell among the stars in his own mind .      with slaves .      if that   s what they think they are .      that   s not very fair .      there   s no justice  said mort .  just us .   they hurried back along the avenues of waiting ghouls and were nearly running when they burst out into the desert night air .  ysabell leaned against the rough stonework and panted for breath .   mort wasn   t out of breath .   he wasn   t breathing .   i will take you wherever you want  he said  and then i must leave you .      but i thought you wanted to rescue the princess .      mort shook his head .   i have no choice .  there are no choices .   she ran forward and grabbed his arm as he turned towards the waiting binky .  he removed her hand gently .   i have finished my apprenticeship .      it   s all in your own mind .     yelled ysabell .     you   re whatever you think you are .      she stopped and looked down .  the sand around mort   s feet was beginning to whip up in little spurts and twirling dust devils .   there was a crackle in the air  and a greasy feel .  mort looked uneasy .   someone is performing the rite of ash     it hit like a hammer  a force from out of the sky that blew the sand into a crater .  there was a low buzzing and the smell of hot tin .   mort looked around himself in the gale of rushing sand  turning as if in a dream  alone in the calm center of the gale .  lightning flashed in the whirling cloud .  deep inside his own mind he struggled to break free  but something had him in its grip and he could no more resist than a compass needle can ignore the compulsion to point towards the hub .   at last he found what he was searching for .  it was a doorway edged in octarine light  leading to a short tunnel .  there were figures at the other end  beckoning to him .   i come  he said  and then turned as he heard the sudden noise behind him .  eleven stone of young womanhood hit him squarely in the chest  lifting him off the ground .   mort landed with ysabell kneeling on him  holding on grimly to his arms .   let me go  he intoned .  i have been summoned .      not you  idiot .      she stared into the blue  pupil less pools of his eyes .  it was like looking down a rushing tunnel .   mort arched his back and screamed a curse so ancient and virulent that in the strong magical field it actually took on a form  flapped its leathery wings and slunk away .  a private thunderstorm crashed around the sand dunes .   his eyes drew her again .  she looked away before she dropped like a stone down a well made of blue light .   i command you .  mort   s voice could have cut holes in rock .      father tried that tone on me for years     she said calmly .     generally when he wanted me to clean my bedroom .  it didn   t work then  either .      mort screamed another curse  which flopped out of the air and tried to bury itself in the sand .   the pain        it   s all in your head     she said  bracing herself against the force that wanted to drag them towards that flickering doorway .     you   re not death .  you   re just mort .  you   re whatever i think you are .      in the center of the blurred blueness of his eyes were two tiny brown dots  rising at the speed of sight .   the storm around them rose and wailed .  mort screamed .       the rite of ashkente  quite simply  summons and binds death .  students of the occult will be aware that it can be performed with a simple incantation  three small bits of wood and  cc of mouse blood  but no wizard worth his pointy hat would dream of doing anything so unimpressive  they knew in their hearts that if a spell didn   t involve big yellow candles  lots of rare incense  circles drawn on the floor with eight different colors of chalk and a few cauldrons around the place then it simply wasn   t worth contemplating .   the eight wizards at their stations on the points of the great ceremonial octogram swayed and chanted  their arms held out sideways so they were just touching the fingertips of the mages on either side .   but something was going wrong .  true  a mist had formed in the very center of the living octogram  but it was writhing and turning in on itself  refusing to focus .      more power .     shouted albert .     give it more power .      a figure appeared momentarily in the smoke  black robed and holding a glittering sword .  albert swore as he caught a glimpse of the pale face under the cowl  it wasn   t pale enough .      no .     albert yelled  ducking into the octogram and flailing at the flickering shape with his hands .     not you  not you    .      and  in faraway tsort  ysabell forgot she was a lady  bunched her fist  narrowed her eyes and caught mort squarely on the jaw .  the world around her exploded    .   in the kitchen of harga   s house of ribs the frying pan crashed to the floor  sending the cats scurrying out of the door    .   in the great hall of the unseen university everything happened at once .    the tremendous force the wizards had been exerting on the shadow realm suddenly had one focus .  like a reluctant cork from a bottle  like a dollop of fiery ketchup from the upturned sauce bottle of infinity  death landed in the octogram and swore .   albert realized just too late that he was inside the charmed ring and made a dive for the edge .  but skeletal fingers caught him by the hem of his robe .   the wizards  such of them who were still on their feet and conscious  were rather surprised to see that death was wearing an apron and holding a small kitten .      why did you have    to spoil it all .      spoil it all .  have you seen what the lad has done .     snapped albert  still trying to reach the edge of the ring .   death raised his skull and sniffed the air .   the sound cut through all the other noises in the hall and forced them into silence .   it was the kind of noise that is heard on the twilight edges of dreams  the sort that you wake from in a cold sweat of mortal horror .  it was the snuffling under the door of dread .  it was like the snuffling of a hedgehog  but if so then it was the kind of hedgehog that crashes out of the verges and flattens lorries .  it was the kind of noise you wouldn   t want to hear twice  you wouldn   t want to hear it once .   death straightened up slowly .   is this how he repays my kindness .  to steal my daughter  insult my servants  and risk the fabric of reality on a personal whim .  oh  foolish  foolish  i have been foolish too long .      master  if you would just be so good as to let go of my robe       began albert  and the wizard noticed a pleading edge to his voice that hadn   t been there before .   death ignored him .  he snapped his fingers like a castanet and the apron around his waist exploded into brief flames .  the kitten  however  he put down very carefully and gently pushed away with his foot .   did i not give him the greatest opportunity .      exactly  master  and now if you could see your way clear        skills .  a career structure .  prospects .  a job for life .      indeed  and if you would but let go        the change in albert   s voice was complete .  the trumpets of command had become the piccolos of supplication .  he sounded terrified  in fact  but he managed to catch rincewind   s eye and hiss      my staff .  throw me my staff .  while he is in the circle he is not invincible .  let me have my staff and i can break free .      rincewind said     pardon .      oh  mine is the fault for giving in to these weaknesses of what for want of a better word i shall call the flesh .      my staff  you idiot  my staff .     gibbered albert .      sorry .      well done  my servant  for calling me to my senses  said death .  let us lose no time .      my sta    .      there was an implosion and an inrush of air .  the candle flames stretched out like lines of fire for a moment  and then went out .   some time passed .   then the bursar   s voice from somewhere near the floor said     that was very unkind  rincewind  losing his staff like that .  remind me to discipline you severely one of these days .  anyone got a light .         i don   t know what happened to it .  i just leaned it against the pillar here and now it   s           oook .         oh     said rincewind .      extra banana ration  that ape     said the bursar levelly .  a match flared and someone managed to get a candle alight .  wizards started to pick themselves off the floor .      well  that was a lesson to all of us     the bursar continued  brushing dust and candlewax off his robe .  he looked up  expecting to see the statue of alberto malich back on its pedestal .      clearly even statues have feelings     he said .     i myself recall  when i was but a first year student  writing my name on his well  never mind .  the point is  i propose here and now we replace the statue .      dead silence greeted this suggestion .      with  say  an exact likeness cast in gold .  suitably embellished with jewels  as befits our great founder     he went on brightly .      and to make sure no students deface it in any way i suggest we then erect it in the deepest cellar     he continued .      and then lock the door     he added .  several wizards began to cheer up .      and throw away the key .     said rincewind .      and weld the door     the bursar said .  he had just remembered about the mended drum .  he thought for a while and remembered about the physical fitness regime as well .      and then brick up the doorway     he said .  there was a round of applause .      and throw away the bricklayer .     chortled rincewind  who felt he was getting the hang of this .   the bursar scowled at him .     no need to get carried away     he said .       in the silence a larger than usual sand dune humped up awkwardly and then fell away to reveal binky  blowing the sand out of his nostrils and shaking his mane .   mort opened his eyes .   there should be a word for that brief period just after waking when the mind is full of warm pink nothing .  you lie there entirely empty of thought  except for a growing suspicion that heading towards you  like a sockful of damp sand in a nocturnal alleyway  are all the recollections you   d really rather do without  and which amount to the fact that the only mitigating factor in your horrible future is the certainty that it will be quite short .   mort sat up and put his hands on top of his head to stop it unscrewing .   the sand beside him heaved and ysabell pushed herself into a sitting position .  her hair was full of sand and her face was grimy with pyramid dust .  some of her hair had frizzled at the tips .  she stared listlessly at him .      did you hit me .     he said  gently testing his jaw .      yes .         oh .      he looked at the sky  as though it could remind him about things .  he had to be somewhere  soon  he recalled .  then he remembered something else .      thank you     he said .      any time  i assure you .     ysabell made it to her feet and tried to brush the dirt and cobwebs off her dress .      are we going to rescue this princess of yours .     she said diffidently .   mort   s own personal  internal reality caught up with him .  he shot to his feet with a strangled cry  watched blue fireworks explode in front of his eyes  and collapsed again .  ysabell caught him under the shoulders and hauled him back on his feet .      let   s go down to the river     she said .     i think we could all do with a drink .         what happened to me .      she shrugged as best she could while supporting his weight .      someone used the rite of ashkente .  father hates it  he says they always summon him at inconvenient moments .  the part of you that was death went and you stayed behind .  i think .  at least you   ve got your own voice back .         what time is it .         what time did you say the priests close up the pyramid .      mort squinted through streaming eyes back towards the tomb of the king .  sure enough  torchlit fingers were working on the door .  soon  according to the legend  the guardians would come to life and begin their endless patrol .   he knew they would .  he remembered the knowledge .  he remembered his mind feeling as cold as ice and limitless as the night sky .  he remembered being summoned into reluctant existence at the moment the first creature lived  in the certain knowledge that he would outlive life until the last being in the universe passed to its reward  when it would then be his job  figuratively speaking  to put the chairs on the tables and turn all the lights off .   he remembered the loneliness .      don   t leave me     he said urgently .      i   m here     she said .     for as long as you need me .         it   s midnight     he said dully  sinking down by the tsort and lowering his aching head to the water .  beside him there was a noise like a bath emptying as binky also took a drink .      does that mean we   re too late .         yes .         i   m sorry .  i wish there was something i could do .         there isn   t .         at least you kept your promise to albert .         yes     said mort  bitterly .     at least i did that .      nearly all the way from one side of the disc to the other    .   there should be a word for the microscopic spark of hope that you dare not entertain in case the mere act of acknowledging it will cause it to vanish  like trying to look at a photon .  you can only sidle up to it  looking past it  walking past it  waiting for it to get big enough to face the world .   he raised his dripping head and looked towards the sunset horizon  trying to remember the big model of the disc in death   s study without actually letting the universe know what he was entertaining .   at times like this it can seem that eventuality is so finely balanced that merely thinking too loud can spoil everything .   he oriented himself by the thin streamers of hublight dancing against the stars  and made an inspired guess that sto lat was   over there    .      midnight     he said aloud .      gone midnight now     said ysabell .   mort stood up  trying not to let the delight radiate out from him like a beacon  and grabbed binky   s harness .      come on     he said .     we haven   t got much time .         what are you talking about .      mort reached down to swing her up behind him .  it was a nice idea  but merely meant that he nearly pulled himself out of the saddle .  she pushed him back gently and climbed up by herself .  binky skittered sideways  sensing mort   s feverish excitement  and snorted and pawed at the sand .      i said  what are you talking about .      mort turned the horse to face the distant glow of the sunset .      the speed of night     he said .       cutwell poked his head over the palace battlements and groaned .  the interface was only a street away  clearly visible in the octarine  and he didn   t have to imagine the sizzling .  he could hear it   a nasty  saw toothed buzz as random particles of possibility hit the interface and gave up their energy as noise .  as it ground its way up the street the pearly wall swallowed the bunting  the torches and the waiting crowds  leaving only dark streets .  somewhere out there  cutwell thought  i   m fast asleep in my bed and none of this has happened .  lucky me .   he ducked down  skidded down the ladder to the cobbles and legged it back to the main hall with the skirts of his robe flapping around his ankles .  he slipped in through the small postern in the great door and ordered the guards to lock it  then grabbed his skirts again and pounded along a side passage so that the guests wouldn   t notice him .   the hall was lit with thousands of candles and crowded with sto plain dignitaries  nearly all of them slightly unsure why they were there .  and  of course  there was the elephant .   it was the elephant that had convinced cutwell that he had gone off the rails of sanity  but it seemed like a good idea a few hours ago  when his exasperation at the high priest   s poor eyesight had run into the recollection that a lumber mill on the edge of town possessed said beast for the purposes of heavy haulage .  it was elderly  arthritic and had an uncertain temper  but it had one important advantage as a sacrificial victim .  the high priest should be able to see it .   half a dozen guards were gingerly trying to restrain the creature  in whose slow brain the realization had dawned that it should be in its familiar stable  with plenty of hay and water and time to dream of the hot days on the great khaki plains of klatch .  it was getting restless .   it will shortly become apparent that another reason for its growing friskiness is the fact that  in the pre ceremony confusion  its trunk found the ceremonial chalice containing a gallon of strong wine and drained the lot .  strange hot ideas are beginning to bubble in front of its crusted eyes  of uprooted baobabs  mating fights with other bulls  glorious stampedes through native villages and other half remembered pleasures .  soon it will start to see pink people .   fortunately this was unknown to cutwell  who caught the eye of the high priest   s assistant   a forward looking young man who had the foresight to provide himself with a long rubber apron and waders   and signaled that the ceremony should begin .   he darted back into the priest   s robing room and struggled into the special ceremonial robe the palace seamstress had made up for him  digging deep into her workbasket for scraps of lace  sequins and gold thread to produce a garment of such dazzling tastelessness that even the archchancellor of unseen university wouldn   t have been ashamed to wear it .  cutwell allowed himself five seconds to admire himself in the mirror before ramming the pointy hat on his head and running back to the door  stopping just in time to emerge at a sedate pace as befitted a person of substance .   he reached the high priest as keli started her advance up the central aisle  flanked by maidservants who fussed around her like tugs around a liner .   despite the drawbacks of the hereditary dress  cutwell thought she looked beautiful .  there was something about her that made him     he gritted his teeth and tried to concentrate on the security arrangements .  he had put guards at various vantage points in the hall in case the duke of sto helit tried any last minute rearrangement of the royal succession  and reminded himself to keep a special eye on the duke himself  who was sitting in the front row of seats with a strange quiet smile on his face .  the duke caught cutwell   s eye  and the wizard hastily looked away .   the high priest held up his hands for silence .  cutwell sidled towards him as the old man turned towards the hub and in a cracked voice began the invocation to the gods .   cutwell let his eyes slip back towards the duke .      hear me  mm  o gods        was sto helit looking up into the bat haunted darkness of the rafters .         hear me  o blind io of the hundred eyes  hear me  o great offler of the bird haunted mouth  hear me  o merciful fate  hear me  o cold  mm  destiny  hear me  o seven handed sek  hear me  o hoki of the woods  hear me  o        with dull horror cutwell realized that the daft old fool  against all instruction  was going to mention the whole lot .  there were more than nine hundred known gods on the disc  and research theologians were discovering more every year .  it could take hours .  the congregation was already beginning to shuffle its feet .   keli was standing in front of the altar with a look of fury on her face .  cutwell nudged the high priest in the ribs  which had no noticeable effect  and then waggled his eyebrows ferociously at the young acolyte .      stop him .     he hissed .     we haven   t got time .         the gods would be displeased           not as displeased as me  and i   m here .      the acolyte looked at cutwell   s expression for a moment and decided that he   d better explain to the gods later .  he tapped the high priest on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear .         o steikhegel  god of  mm  isolated cow byres  hear me  o   hello .  what .      murmur  murmur .      this is  mm  very irregular .  very well  we shall go straight to the  mm  recitation of the lineage .      murmur  murmur .   the high priest scowled at cutwell  or at least where he believed cutwell to be .      oh  all right .  mm  prepare the incense and fragrances for the shriving of the fourfold path .      murmur  murmur .   the high priest   s face darkened .      i suppose  mm  a short prayer  mm  is totally out of the question .     he said acidly .      if some people don   t get a move on     said keli demurely     there is going to be trouble .      murmur .      i don   t know  i   m sure     said the high priest .     people might as well not bother with a religious  mm  ceremony at all .  fetch the bloody elephant  then .      the acolyte gave cutwell a frantic look and waved at the guards .  as they urged their gently swaying charge forward with shouts and pointed sticks the young priest sidled towards cutwell and pushed something into his hand .   he looked down .  it was a waterproof hat .      is this necessary .         he   s very devout     said the acolyte .     we may need a snorkel .      the elephant reached the altar and was forced  without too much difficulty  to kneel .  it hiccupped .      well  where is it  then .     snapped the high priest .     let   s get this  mm  farce over with .      murmur went the acolyte .  the high priest listened  nodded gravely  picked up his white handled sacrificial knife and raised it double handed over his head .  the whole hall watched  holding its breath .  then he lowered it again .      where in front of me .      murmur .      i certainly don   t need your help  my lad .  i   ve been sacrificing man and boy   and  mm  women and animals   for seventy years  and when i can   t use the  mm  knife you can put me to bed with a shovel .      and he brought the blade down in a wild sweep which  by sheer luck  gave the elephant a mild flesh wound on the trunk .   the creature awoke from its pleasant reflective stupor and squealed .  the acolyte turned in horror to look at two tiny bloodshot eyes squinting down the length of an enraged trunk  and cleared the altar in one standing jump .   the elephant was enraged .  vague confusing recollections flooded its aching head  of fires and shouts and men with nets and cages and spears and too many years hauling heavy tree trunks .  it brought its trunk down across the altar stone and somewhat to its own surprise smashed it in two  levered the two parts into the air with its tusks  tried unsuccessfully to uproot a stone pillar and then  feeling the sudden need for a breath of fresh air  started to charge arthritically down the length of the hall .   it hit the door at a dead run  its blood loud with the call of the herd and fizzing with alcohol  and took it off at the hinges .  still wearing the frame on its shoulders it careened across the courtyard  smashed the outer gates  burped  thundered through the sleeping city and was still slowly accelerating when it sniffed the distant dark continent of klatch on the night breeze and  tail raised  followed the ancient call of home .   back in the hall there was dust and shouts and confusion .  cutwell pushed his hat out of his eyes and got to his hands and knees .      thank you     said keli  who had been lying underneath him .     and why did you jump on top of me .         my first instinct was to protect you  your majesty .         yes  instinct it may have been  but       she started to say that maybe the elephant would have weighed less  but the sight of his big  serious and rather flushed face stopped her .      we will talk about this later     she said  sitting up and brushing the dust off her .     in the meantime  i think we will dispense with the sacrifice .  i   m not your majesty yet  just your highness  and now if someone will fetch the crown        there was the snick of a safety catch behind them .      the wizard will put his hands where i can see them     said the duke .   cutwell stood up slowly  and turned around .  the duke was backed by half a dozen large serious men  the type of men whose only function in life is to loom behind people like the duke .  they had a dozen large serious crossbows  whose main purpose was to appear to be on the point of going off .   the princess sprang to her feet and launched herself at her uncle  but cutwell grabbed her .      no     he said  quietly .     this isn   t the kind of man who ties you up in a cellar with just enough time for the mice to eat your ropes before the flood waters rise .  this is the kind of man who just kills you here and now .      the duke bowed .      i think it can be truly said that the gods have spoken     he said .     clearly the princess was tragically crushed by the rogue elephant .  the people will be upset .  i will personally decree a week of mourning .         you can   t do that  all the guests have seen    .     the princess began  nearly in tears .   cutwell shook his head .  he could see the guards moving through the crowds of bewildered guests .      they haven   t     he said .     you   ll be amazed at what they haven   t seen .  especially when they learn that being tragically crushed to death by rogue elephants can be catching .  you can even die of it in bed .      the duke laughed pleasantly .      you really are quite intelligent for a wizard     he said .     now  i am merely proposing banishment           you won   t get away with this     said cutwell .  he thought for a bit  and added     well  you will probably get away with it  but you   ll feel bad about it on your deathbed and you   ll wish        he stopped talking .  his jaw dropped .   the duke half turned to follow his gaze .      well  wizard .  what have you seen .         you won   t get away with it     said cutwell hysterically .     you won   t even be here .  this is going to have never happened  do you realize .         watch his hands     said the duke .     if he even moves his fingers  shoot them .      he looked around again  puzzled .  the wizard had sounded genuine .  of course  it was said wizards could see things that weren   t there    .      it doesn   t even matter if you kill me     cutwell babbled     because tomorrow i   ll wake up in my own bed and this won   t have happened anyway .  it   s come through the wall .          night rolled onwards across the disc .  it was always there  of course  lurking in shadows and holes and cellars  but as the slow light of day drifted after the sun the pools and lakes of night spread out  met and merged .  light on the discworld moves slowly because of the vast magical field .   light on the discworld isn   t like light elsewhere .  it   s grown up a bit  it   s been around  it doesn   t feel the need to rush everywhere .  it knows that however fast it goes darkness always gets there first  so it takes it easy .   midnight glided across the landscape like a velvet bat .  and faster than midnight  a tiny spark against the dark world of the disc  binky pounded after it .  flames roared back from his hooves .  muscles moved under his glistening skin like snakes in oil .   they moved in silence .  ysabell took one arm from around mort   s waist and watched sparks glitter around her fingers in all eight colors of the rainbow .  little crackling serpents of light flowed down her arm and flashed off the tips of her hair .   mort took the horse down lower  leaving a boiling wake of cloud that extended for miles behind them .      now i know i   m going mad     he muttered .      why .         i just saw an elephant down there .  whoa  boy .  look  you can see sto lat up ahead .      ysabell peered over his shoulder at the distant gleam of light .      how long have we got .     she said nervously .      i don   t know .  a few minutes  perhaps .         mort  i hadn   t asked you before           well .         what are you going to do when we get there .         i don   t know     he said .     i was sort of hoping something would suggest itself at the time .         has it .         no .  but it isn   t time yet .  albert   s spell may help .  and i        the dome of reality squatted over the palace like a collapsing jellyfish .  mort   s voice trailed into horrified silence .  then ysabell said     well  i think it   s nearly time .  what are we going to do .         hold tight .      binky glided through the smashed gates of the outer courtyard  slid across the cobbles in a trail of sparks and leapt through the ravaged doorway of the hall .  the pearly wall of the interface loomed up and passed like a shock of cold spray .   mort had a confused vision of keli and cutwell and a group of large men diving for their lives .  he recognized the features of the duke and drew his sword  vaulting from the saddle as soon as the steaming horse skidded to a halt .      don   t you lay a finger on her .     he screamed .     i   ll have your head off .         this is certainly most impressive     said the duke  drawing his own sword .     and also very foolish .  i        he stopped .  his eyes glazed over .  he toppled forward .  cutwell put down the big silver candlestick he   d wielded and gave mort an apologetic smile .   mort turned towards the guards  the blue flame of death   s sword humming through the air .      anyone else want some .     he snarled .  they backed away  and then turned and ran .  as they passed through the interface they vanished .  there were no guests outside there  either .  in the real reality the hall was dark and empty .   the four of them were left in a hemisphere that was rapidly growing smaller .   mort sidled over to cutwell .      any ideas .     he said .     i   ve got a magic spell here somewhere           forget it .  if i try any magic in here now it   ll blow our heads off .  this little reality is too small to contain it .      mort sagged against the remains of the altar .  he felt empty  drained .  for a moment he watched the sizzling wall of the interface drifting nearer .  he   d survive it  he hoped  and so would ysabell .  cutwell wouldn   t  but a cutwell would .  only keli        am i going to be crowned or not .     she said icily .     i   ve got to die a queen .  it   d be terrible to be dead and common .      mort gave her an unfocused look  trying to remember what on earth she was talking about .  ysabell fished around in the wreckage behind the altar  and came up with a rather battered gold circlet set with small diamonds .      is this it .     she said .      that   s the crown     said keli  nearly in tears .     but there   s no priest or anything .      mort sighed deeply .      cutwell  if this is our own reality we can rearrange it the way we want  can   t we .         what had you in mind .         you   re now a priest .  name your own god .      cutwell curtsied  and took the crown from ysabell .      you   re all making fun of me .     snapped keli .      sorry     said mort  wearily .     it   s been rather a long day .         i hope i can do this right     said cutwell solemnly .     i   ve never crowned anyone before .         i   ve never been crowned before .         good     said cutwell soothingly .     we can learn together .     he started to mutter some impressive words in a strange tongue .  it was in fact a simple spell for ridding the clothing of fleas  but he thought  what the hell .  and then he thought  gosh  in this reality i   m the most powerful wizard there ever was  that   d be something to tell my grandch   he gritted his teeth .  there   d be some rules changed in this reality  that was for sure .   ysabell sat down beside mort and slipped her hand in his .      well .     she said quietly .     this is the time .  has anything suggested itself .         no .      the interface was more than halfway down the hall  slowing slightly as it relentlessly ground down the pressure of the intruding reality .   something wet and warm blew in mort   s ear .  he reached up and touched binky   s muzzle .      dear old horse     he said .     and i   m right out of sugar lumps .  you   ll have to find your way home by yourself        his hand stopped in mid pat .      we can all go home     he said .      i don   t think father would like that very much     said ysabell  but mort ignored her .      cutwell .         yes .         we   re leaving .  are you coming .  you   ll still exist when the interface closes .         part of me will     said the wizard .      that   s what i meant     said mort  swinging himself up on to binky   s back .      but speaking as the part that won   t  i   d like to join you     said cutwell quickly .      i intend to stay here to die in my own kingdom     said keli .      what you intend doesn   t signify     said mort .     i   ve come all the way across the disc to rescue you  d   you see  and you   re going to be rescued .         but i   m the queen .     said keli .  uncertainty welled up in her eyes  and she spun round to cutwell  who lowered his candlestick guiltily .     i heard you say the words .  i am queen  aren   t i .         oh  yes     said cutwell instantly  and then  because a wizard   s word is supposed to be harder than cast iron  added virtuously     and totally free from infestation  too .         cutwell .     snapped mort .  the wizard nodded  caught keli around the waist and bodily hoisted her on to binky   s back .  hoisting his skirts around his waist he clambered up behind mort and reached down and swung ysabell up behind him .  the horse jigged across the floor  complaining about the overloading  but mort turned him towards the broken doorway and urged him forward .   the interface followed them as they clattered down the hall and into the courtyard  rising slowly .  its pearly fog was only yards away  tightening by inches .      excuse me     said cutwell to ysabell  raising his hat .     igneous cutwell  wizard  st grade  uu   former royal recognizer and soon to be beheaded probably .  would you happen to know where we are going .         to my father   s country     shouted ysabell  above the wind of their passage .      have i ever met him .         i don   t think so .  you   d have remembered .      the top of the palace wall scraped binky   s hooves as  muscles straining  he sought for more height .  cutwell leaned backward again  holding on to his hat .      who is this gentleman of which we speak .     he yelled .      death     said ysabell .      not           yes .         oh .     cutwell peered down at the distant rooftops  and gave her a lopsided smile .     would it save time if i just jumped off now .         he   s quite nice if you get to know him     said ysabell defensively .      is he .  do you think we   ll get the chance .         hold on .     said mort .     we should be going across just about        a hole full of blackness rushed out of the sky and caught them .   the interface bobbed uncertainly  empty as a pauper   s pocket  and carried on shrinking .       the front door opened .  ysabell poked her head out .      there   s no one at home     she said .     you   d better come in .      the other three filed into the hallway .  cutwell conscientiously wiped his feet .      it   s a bit small     said keli  critically .      it   s a lot bigger inside     said mort  and turned to ysabell .     have you looked everywhere .         i can   t even find albert     she said .     i can   t remember him ever not being here .      she coughed  remembering her duties as hostess .      would anyone like a drink .     she said .  keli ignored her .      i was expecting a castle at least     she said .     big and black  with great dark towers .  not an umbrella stand .         it has got a scythe in it     cutwell pointed out .      let   s all go into the study and sit down and i   m sure we   ll all feel better     said ysabell hurriedly  and pushed open the black baize door .   cutwell and keli stepped through  bickering .  ysabell took mort   s arm .      what are we going to do now .     she said .     father will be very angry if he finds them here .         i   ll think of something     said mort .     i   ll rewrite the autobiographies or something .     he smiled weakly .     don   t worry .  i   ll think of something .      the door slammed behind him .  mort turned to look into albert   s grinning face .   the big leather armchair behind the desk revolved slowly .  death looked at mort over steepled fingers .  when he was quite certain he had their full  horrified attention  he said   you had better start now .   he stood up  appearing to grow larger as the room darkened .   don   t bother to apologize  he added .   keli buried her head in cutwell   s ample chest .   i am back .  and i am angry .      master  i       mort began .   shut up  said death .  he beckoned keli with a calcareous forefinger .  she turned to look at him  her body not daring to disobey .   death reached out and touched her chin .  mort   s hand went to his sword .   is this the face that launched a thousand ships  and burned the topless towers of pseudopolis .  wondered death .  keli stared hypnotized at the red pinpoints miles deep in those dark sockets .      er  excuse me     said cutwell  holding his hat respectfully  mexican fashion .   well .  said death  distracted .      it isn   t  sir .  you must be thinking about another face .      what is your name .      cutwell  sir .  i   m a wizard  sir .      i   m a wizard  sir  death sneered .  be silent  wizard .      sir .     cutwell stepped back .   death turned to ysabell .   daughter  explain yourself .  why did you aid this fool .   ysabell curtsied nervously .      i   love him  father .  i think .         you do .     said mort  astonished .     you never said .         there didn   t seem to be time     said ysabell .     father  he didn   t mean        be silent .   ysabell dropped her gaze .     yes  father .      death stalked around the desk until he was standing directly in front of mort .  he stared at him for a long time .   then in one blurred movement his hand struck mort across the face  knocking him off his feet .   i invite you into my home  he said  i train you  i feed you  i clothe you  i give you opportunities you could not dream of  and thus you repay me .  you seduce my daughter from me  you neglect the duty  you make ripples in reality that will take a century to heal .  your ill timed actions have doomed your comrades to oblivion .  the gods will demand nothing less .   all in all  boy  not a good start to your first job .   mort struggled into a sitting position  holding his cheek .  it burned coldly  like comet ice .      mort     he said .   it speaks .  what does it say .      you could let them go     said mort .     they just got involved .  it wasn   t their fault .  you could rearrange this so        why should i do that .  they belong to me now .      i   ll fight you for them     said mort .   very noble .  mortals fight me all the time .  you are dismissed .   mort got to his feet .  he remembered what being death had been like .  he caught hold of the feeling  let it surface    .   no  he said .   ah .  you challenge me as between equals  then .   mort swallowed .  but at least the way was clear now .  when you step off a cliff  your life takes a very definite direction .      if necessary     he said .     and if i win        if you win  you will be in a position to do whatever you please  said death .  follow me .   he stalked past mort and out into the hall .   the other four looked at mort .      are you sure you know what you   re doing .     said cutwell .      no .         you can   t beat the master     said albert .  he sighed .     take it from me .         what will happen if you lose .     said keli .      i won   t lose     said mort .     that   s the trouble .         father wants him to win     said ysabell bitterly .      you mean he   ll let mort win .     said cutwell .      oh  no  he won   t let him win .  he just wants him to win .      mort nodded .  as they followed death   s dark shape he reflected on an endless future  serving whatever mysterious purpose the creator had in mind  living outside time .  he couldn   t blame death for wanting to quit the job .  death had said the bones were not compulsory  but perhaps that wouldn   t matter .  would eternity feel like a long time  or were all lives   from a personal viewpoint   entirely the same length .   hi  said a voice in his head .  remember me .  i   m you .  i got you into this .      thanks     he said bitterly .  the others glanced at him .   you could come through this  the voice said .  you   ve got a big advantage .  you   ve been him  and he   s never been you .   death swept through the hall and into the long room  the candles obediently flicking into flame as he entered .   albert .      master .      fetch the glasses .      master .      cutwell grabbed the old man   s arm .      you   re a wizard     he hissed .     you don   t have to do what he says .         how old are you  lad .     said albert  kindly .      twenty .         when you   re my age you   ll see your choices differently .     he turned to mort .     sorry .      mort drew his sword  its blade almost invisible in the light from the candles .  death turned and stood facing him  a thin silhouette against a towering rack of hourglasses .   he held out his arms .  the scythe appeared in them with a tiny thunderclap .   albert came back down one of the glass lined alleys with two hourglasses  and set them down wordlessly on a ledge on one of the pillars .   one was several times the size of the ordinary glasses   black  thin and decorated with a complicated skull and bones motif .   that wasn   t the most unpleasant thing about it .   mort groaned inwardly .  he couldn   t see any sand in there .   the smaller glass beside it was quite plain and unadorned .  mort reached for it .      may i .     he said .   be my guest .   the name mort was engraved on the top bulb .  he held it up to the light  noting without any real surprise that there was hardly any sand left .  when he held it to his ear he thought he could hear  even above the ever present roar of the millions of lifetimers around him  the sound of his own life pouring away .   he put it down very carefully .   death turned to cutwell .   mr .  wizard  sir  you will be good enough to give us a count of three .   cutwell nodded glumly .      are you sure this couldn   t all be sorted out by getting around a table       he began .   no .      no .      mort and death circled one another warily  their reflections flickering across the banks of hourglasses .      one     said cutwell .   death spun his scythe menacingly .      two .      the blades met in mid air with a noise like a cat sliding down a pane of glass .      they both cheated .     said keli .  ysabell nodded .     of course     she said .   mort jumped back  bringing the sword round in a too slow arc that death easily deflected  turning the parry into a wicked low sweep that mort avoided only by a clumsy standing jump .   although the scythe isn   t preeminent among weapons of war  anyone who has been on the wrong end of  say  a peasants    revolt will know that in skilled hands it is fearsome .  once its owner gets it weaving and spinning no one   including the wielder   is quite certain where the blade is now and where it will be next .   death advanced  grinning .  mort ducked a cut at head height and dived sideways  hearing a tinkle behind him as the tip of the scythe caught a glass on the nearest shelf    .      in a dark alley in morpork a night soil entrepreneur clutched at his chest and pitched forward over his cart    .   mort rolled and came up swinging the sword double handed over his head  feeling a twang of dark exhilaration as death darted backwards across the checkered tiles .  the wild swing cut through a shelf  one after another its burden of glasses started to slide towards the floor .  mort was dimly aware of ysabell scurrying past him to catch them one by one    .      across the disc four people miraculously escaped death by falling    .      and then he ran forward  pressing home his advantage .  death   s hands moved in a blur as he blocked every chop and thrust  and then changed grip on the scythe and brought the blade swinging up in an arc that mort sidestepped awkwardly  nicking the frame of an hourglass with the hilt of his sword and sending it flying across the room    .      in the ramtop mountains a tharga herder  searching by lamplight in the high meadows for a lost cow  missed his footing and plunged over a thousand foot drop    .      cutwell dived forward and caught the tumbling glass in one desperately outstretched hand  hit the floor and slid along on his stomach    .      a gnarled sycamore mysteriously loomed under the screaming herder and broke his fall  removing his major problems   death  the judgement of the gods  the uncertainty of paradise and so on   and replacing them with the comparatively simple one of climbing back up about one hundred feet of sheer  icy cliff in pitch darkness .   there was a pause as the combatants backed away from each other and circled again  looking for an opening .      surely there   s something we can do .     said keli .      mort will lose either way     said ysabell  shaking her head .  cutwell shook the silver candlestick out of his baggy sleeve and tossed it thoughtfully from hand to hand .   death hefted the scythe threateningly  incidentally smashing an hourglass by his shoulder    .      in bes pelargic the emperor   s chief torturer slumped backwards into his own acid pit    .      and took another swing which mort dodged by sheer luck .  but only just .  he could feel the hot ache in his muscles and the numbing grayness of fatigue poisons in his brain  two disadvantages that death did not have to consider .   death noticed .   yield  he said .  i may be merciful .   to illustrate the point he made a roundarm slash that mort caught  clumsily  on the edge of his sword .  the scythe blade bounced up  splintered a glass into a thousand shards    .      the duke of sto helit clutched at his heart  felt the icy stab of pain  screamed soundlessly and tumbled from his horse    .   mort backed away until he felt the roughness of a stone pillar on his neck .  death   s glass with its dauntingly empty bulbs was a few inches from his head .   death himself wasn   t paying much attention .  he was looking down thoughtfully at the jagged remains of the duke   s life .   mort yelled and swung his sword up  to the faint cheers of the crowd that had been waiting for him to do this for some time .  even albert clapped his wrinkled hands .   but instead of the tinkle of glass that mort had expected there was   nothing .   he turned and tried again .  the blade passed right through the glass without breaking it .   the change in the texture of the air made him bring the sword around and back in time to deflect a vicious downward sweep .  death sprang away in time to dodge mort   s counter thrust  which was slow and weak .   thus it ends  boy .      mort     said mort .  he looked up .      mort     he repeated  and brought the sword up in a stroke that cut the scythe   s handle in two .  anger bubbled up inside him .  if he was going to die  then at least he   d die with the right name .      mort  you bastard .     he screamed  and propelled himself straight towards the grinning skull with the sword whirring in a complicated dance of blue light .  death staggered backwards  laughing  crouching under the rain of furious strokes that sliced the scythe handle into more pieces .   mort circled him  chopping and thrusting and dully aware  even through the red mists of fury  that death was following his every move  holding the orphaned scytheblade like a sword .  there was no opening  and the motor of his anger wouldn   t last .  you   ll never beat him  he told himself .  the best we can do is hold him off for a while .  and losing is probably better than winning .  who needs eternity  anyway .   through the curtain of his fatigue he saw death unfold the length of his bones and bring his blade around in a slow  leisurely arc as though it was moving through treacle .      father .     screamed ysabell .   death turned his head .   perhaps mort   s mind welcomed the prospect of the life to come but his body  which maybe felt it had most to lose in the deal  objected .  it brought his sword arm up in one unstoppable stroke that flicked death   s blade from his hand  and then pinned him against the nearest pillar .   in the sudden hush mort realized he could no longer hear an intrusive little noise that had been just at his threshold of hearing for the last ten minutes .  his eyes darted sideways .   the last of his sand was running out .   strike .   mort raised the sword  and looked into the twin blue fires .   he lowered the sword .      no .      death   s foot lashed out at groin height with a speed that even made cutwell wince .   mort silently curled into a ball and rolled across the floor .  through his tears he saw death advancing  scytheblade in one hand and mort   s own hourglass in the other .  he saw keli and ysabell swept disdainfully aside as they made a grab for the robe .  he saw cutwell elbowed in the ribs  his candlestick clattering across the tiles .   death stood over him .  the tip of the blade hovered in front of mort   s eyes for a moment  and then swept upwards .      you   re right .  there   s no justice .  there   s just you .      death hesitated  and then slowly lowered the blade .  he turned and looked down into ysabell   s face .  she was shaking with anger .   your meaning .   she glowered up at death   s face and then her hand swung back and swung around and swung forward and connected with a sound like a dice box .   it was nothing like as loud as the silence that followed it .   keli shut her eyes .  cutwell turned away and put his arms over his head .   death raised a hand to his skull  very slowly .   ysabell   s chest rose and fell in a manner that should have made cutwell give up magic for life .   finally  in a voice even more hollow than usual  death said  why .      you said that to tinker with the fate of one individual could destroy the whole world     said ysabell .   yes .      you meddled with his .  and mine .     she pointed a trembling finger at the splinters of glass on the floor .     and those  too .      well .      what will the gods demand for that .      from me .      yes .      death looked surprised .  the gods can demand nothing of me .  even gods answer to me  eventually .      doesn   t seem very fair  does it .  don   t the gods bother about justice and mercy .     snapped ysabell .  without anyone quite noticing she had picked up the sword .   death grinned .  i applaud your efforts  he said  but they avail you naught .  stand aside .      no .      you must be aware that even love is no defense against me .  i am sorry .   ysabell raised the sword .     you   re sorry .      stand aside  i say .      no .  you   re just being vindictive .  it   s not fair .      death bowed his skull for a moment  then looked up with his eyes blazing .   you will do as you are told .      i will not .      you   re making this very difficult .      good .      death   s fingers drummed impatiently on the scytheblade  like a mouse tapdancing on a tin .  he seemed to be thinking .  he looked at ysabell standing over mort  and then turned and looked at the others crouching against a shelf .   no  he said eventually .  no .  i cannot be bidden .  i cannot be forced .  i will do only that which i know to be right .   he waved a hand  and the sword whirred out of ysabell   s grasp .  he made another complicated gesture and the girl herself was picked up and pressed gently but firmly against the nearest pillar .   mort saw the dark reaper advance on him again  blade swinging back for the final stroke .  he stood over the boy .   you don   t know how sorry this makes me  he said .   mort pulled himself on to his elbows .      i might     he said .   death gave him a surprised look for several seconds  and then started to laugh .  the sound bounced eerily around the room  ringing off the shelves as death  still laughing like an earthquake in a graveyard  held mort   s own glass in front of its owner   s eyes .   mort tried to focus .  he saw the last grain of sand skid down the glossy surface  teeter on the edge and then drop  tumbling in slow motion  towards the bottom .  candlelight flickered off its tiny silica facets as it spun gently downward .  it landed soundlessly  throwing up a tiny crater .   the light in death   s eyes flared until it filled mort   s vision and the sound of his laughter rattled the universe .   and then death turned the hourglass over .       once again the great hall of sto lat was brilliant with candlelight and loud with music .   as the guests flocked down the steps and descended on the cold buffet the master of ceremonies was in non stop voice  introducing those who  by reason of importance or simple absent mindedness  had turned up late .  as for example      the royal recognizer  master of the queen   s bedchamber  his ipississumussness igneous cutwell  wizard  st grade  uu  .      cutwell advanced on the royal couple  grinning  a large cigar in one hand .      may i kiss the bride .     he said .      if it   s allowed for wizards     said ysabell  offering a cheek .      we thought the fireworks were marvelous     said mort .     and i expect they   ll soon be able to rebuild the outer wall .  no doubt you   ll be able to find your way to the food .         he   s looking a lot better these days     said ysabell behind her fixed grin  as cutwell disappeared into the throng .      certainly there   s a lot to be said for being the only person who doesn   t bother to obey the queen     said mort  exchanging nods with a passing nobleman .      they say he   s the real power behind the throne     said ysabell .     an eminence something .         eminence grease     said mort absently .     notice how he doesn   t do any magic these days .         shutuphereshecomes .         her supreme majesty  queen kelirehenna i  lord of sto lat  protector of the eight protectorates and empress of the long thin debated piece hubwards of sto kerrig .      ysabell bobbed .  mort bowed .  keli beamed at both of them .  they couldn   t help noticing that she had come under some influence that inclined her towards clothes that at least roughly followed her shape  and away from hairstyles that looked like the offspring of a pineapple and a candyfloss .   she pecked ysabell on the cheek and then stepped back and looked mort up and down .      how   s sto helit .     she said .      fine  fine     said mort .     we   ll have to do something about the cellars  though .  your late uncle had some unusual   hobbies  and           she means you     whispered ysabell .     that   s your official name .         i preferred mort     said mort .      such an interesting coat of arms  too     said the queen .     crossed scythes on an hourglass rampant against a sable field .  it gave the royal college quite a headache .         it   s not that i mind being a duke     said mort .     it   s being married to a duchess that comes as a shock .         you   ll get used to it .         i hope not .         good .  and now  ysabell     said keli  setting her jaw     if you are to move in royal circles there are some people you simply must meet    .      ysabell gave mort a despairing look as she was swept away into the crowd  and was soon lost to view .   mort ran a finger around the inside of his collar  looked both ways  and then darted into a fern shaded corner near the end of the buffet where he could have a quiet moment to himself .   behind him the master of ceremonies cleared his throat .  his eyes took on a distant  glazed look .      the stealer of souls     he said in the faraway voice of one whose ears aren   t hearing what his mouth is saying     defeater of empires  swallower of oceans  thief of years  the ultimate reality  harvester of mankind  the        all right  all right .  i can see myself in .   mort paused with a cold turkey leg halfway to his mouth .  he didn   t turn around .  he didn   t need to .  there was no mistaking that voice  felt rather than heard  or the way in which the air chilled and darkened .  the chatter and music of the wedding reception slowed and faded .      we didn   t think you   d come     he said to a potted fern .   to my own daughter   s wedding .  anyway  it was the first time i   ve ever had an invitation to anything .  it had gold edges and rsvp and everything .      yes  but when you weren   t at the service        i thought perhaps it would not be entirely appropriate .      well  yes  i suppose so        to be frank  i thought you were going to marry the princess .   mort blushed .     we talked about it     he said .     then we thought  just because you happen to rescue a princess  you shouldn   t rush into things .      very wise .  too many young women leap into the arms of the first young man to wake them after a hundred years    sleep  for example .      and  well  we thought that all in all  well  once i really got to know ysabell  well    .      yes  yes  i am sure .  an excellent decision .  however  i have decided not to interest myself in human affairs any further .      really .      except officially  of course .  it was clouding my judgement .   a skeletal hand appeared on the edge of mort   s vision and skilfully speared a stuffed egg .  mort spun around .      what happened .     he said .     i   ve got to know .  one minute we were in the long room and the next we were in a field outside the city  and we were really us .  i mean  reality had been altered to fit us in .  who did it .      i had a word with the gods .  death looked uncomfortable .      oh .  you did  did you .     said mort .  death avoided his gaze .   yes .      i shouldn   t think they were very pleased .      the gods are just .  they are also sentimentalists .  i have never been able to master it  myself .   but you aren   t free yet .  you must see to it that history takes place .      i know     said mort .     uniting the kingdoms and everything .      you might end up wishing you   d stayed with me .      i certainly learned a lot     mort admitted .  he put his hand up to his face and absent mindedly stroked the four thin white scars across his cheek .     but i don   t think i was cut out for that sort of work .  look  i   m really sorry        i have a present for you .   death put down his plate of hors d   oeuvres and fumbled in the mysterious recesses of his robe .  when his skeletal hand emerged it was holding a little globe between thumb and forefinger .   it was about three inches across .  it could have been the largest pearl in the world  except that the surface was a moving swirl of complicated silver shapes  forever on the point of resolving themselves into something recognizable but always managing to avoid it .   when death dropped it into mort   s outstretched palm it felt surprisingly heavy and slightly warm .   for you and your lady .  a wedding present .  a dowry .      it   s beautiful .  we thought the silver toast rack was from you .      that was albert .  i   m afraid he doesn   t have much imagination .   mort turned the globe over and over in his hands .  the shapes boiling inside it seemed to respond to his touch  sending little streamers of light arching across the surface towards his fingers .      is it a pearl .     he said .   yes .  when something irritates an oyster and can   t be removed  the poor thing coats it with mucus and turns it into a pearl .  this is a pearl of a different color .  a pearl of reality .  all that shiny stuff is congealed actuality .  you ought to recognize it   you created it  after all .   mort tossed it gently from hand to hand .      we will put it with the castle jewels     he said .     we haven   t got that many .      one day it will be the seed of a new universe .   mort fumbled the catch  but reached down with lightning reflexes and caught it before it hit the flagstones .      what .      the pressure of this reality keeps it compressed .  there may come a time when the universe ends and reality dies  and then this one will explode and   who knows .  keep it safe .  it   s a future as well as a present .   death put his skull on one side .  it   s a small thing  he added .  you could have had eternity .      i know     said mort .     i   ve been very lucky .      he put it very carefully on the buffet table  between the quails    eggs and the sausage rolls .   there was another thing  said death .  he reached under his robe again and pulled out an oblong shape inexpertly wrapped and tied with string .   it   s for you  he said  personally .  you never showed any interest in it before .  did you think it didn   t exist .   mort unwrapped the packet and realized he was holding a small leather bound book .  on the spine was blocked  in shiny gold leaf  the one word  mort .   he leafed backwards through the unfilled pages until he found the little trail of ink  winding patiently down the page  and read  mort shut the book with a little snap that sounded  in the silence  like the crack of creation  and smiled uneasily .      there   s a lot of pages still to fill     he said .     how much sand have i got left .  only ysabell said that since you turned the glass over that means i shall die when i   m        you have sufficient  said death coldly .  mathematics isn   t all it   s cracked up to be .      how do you feel about being invited to christenings .      i think not .  i wasn   t cut out to be a father  and certainly not a grandad .  i haven   t got the right kind of knees .   he put down his wine glass and nodded at mort .   my regards to your good lady  he said .  and now i really must be off .      are you sure .  you   re welcome to stay .      it   s nice of you to say so  but duty calls .  he extended a bony hand .  you know how it is .   mort gripped the hand and shook it  ignoring the chill .      look     he said .     if ever you want a few days off  you know  if you   d like a holiday        many thanks for the offer  said death graciously .  i shall think about it most seriously .  and now        goodbye     mort said  and was surprised to find a lump in his throat .     it   s such an unpleasant word  isn   t it .      quite so .  death grinned because  as has so often been remarked  he didn   t have much option .  but possibly he meant it  this time .   i prefer au revoir  he said .   the end      about the author   terry pratchett lives in england  an island off the coast of france  where he spends his time writing discworld novels in accordance with the very strong

faster than ordinary light is monarchy  according to the philosopher ly tin wheedle .  he reasoned like this  you can   t have more than one king  and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings  so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir instantaneously .  presumably  he said  there must be some elementary particles   kingons  or possibly queons   that do this job  but of course succession sometimes fails if  in mid flight  they strike an anti particle  or republicon .  his ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages  involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal  were never fully expounded because  at that point  the bar closed .        the first pizza was created on the disc by the klatchian mystic ronron    revelation joe    shuwadhi  who claimed to have been given the recipe in a dream by the creator of the discworld himself  who had apparently added that it was what he had intended all along .  those desert travelers who had seen the original  which is reputedly miraculously preserved in the forbidden city of ee  say that what the creator had in mind then was a fairly small cheese and pepperoni affair with a few black olives   and things like mountains and seas got added out of last minute enthusiasm as so often happens .     after the schism of the turnwise ones and the deaths of some        people in the ensuing jihad the faithful were allowed to add one small bayleaf to the recipe .        although not the droopy moustache and round furry hat with the spike on it .           the speech has been passed on to later generations in an epic poem commissioned by his son  who wasn   t born in a saddle and could eat with a knife and fork .  it began        see yonder the stolid foemen slumber  fat with stolen gold  corrupt of mind .   let the spears of your wrath be as the steppe fire on a  windy day in the dry season   let your honest blade thrust like the horns of  a five year old yok with severe toothache    .      and went on for three hours .  reality  which can   t usually afford to pay poets  records that in fact the entire speech ran      lads  most of them are still in bed  we should go through them like kzak fruit through a short grandmother  and i for one have had it right up to here with yurts  okay .           the disc   s greatest lovers were undoubtedly mellius and gretelina  whose pure  passionate and soul searing affair would have scorched the pages of history if they had not  because of some unexplained quirk of fate  been born two hundred years apart on different continents .  however  the gods took pity on them and turned him into an ironing board   and her into a small brass bollard .     when you   re a god  you don   t have to have reasons .        there had been half a jar of elderly mayonnaise  a piece of very old cheese  and a tomato with white mold growing on it .  since during the day the pantry of the palace of sto lat normally contained fifteen whole stags  one hundred brace of partridges  fifty hogsheads of butter  two hundred jugs of hares  seventy five sides of beef  two miles of assorted sausages  various fowls  eighty dozen eggs  several circle sea sturgeon  a vat of caviar and an elephant   s leg stuffed with olives  cutwell had learned once again that one universal manifestation of raw  natural magic throughout the universe is this  that any domestic food store  raided furtively in the middle of the night  always contains  no matter what its daytime inventory  half a jar of elderly mayonnaise  a piece of very old cheese  and a tomato with white mold growing on it .        ankh morpork had dallied with many forms of government and had ended up with that form of democracy known as one man  one vote .  the patrician was the man  he had the vote .        the stone garden of universal peace and simplicity  laid out to the orders of the old emperor one sun mirror    used economy of position and shadow to symbolize the basic unity of soul and matter and the harmony of all things .  it was said the secrets at the very heart of reality lay hidden in the precise ordering of its stones .     whose other claim to fame was his habit of cutting off his enemies    lips and legs and then promising them their freedom if they could run through the city playing a trumpet .        this is not precisely true .  it is generally agreed by philosophers that the shortest time in which everything can happen is one thousand billion years .
