chapter one      the big snow      when the storm came  it hit the hills like a hammer .  no sky should hold as much snow as this  and because no sky could  the snow fell  fell in a wall of white .   there was a small hill of snow where there had been  a few hours ago  a little cluster of thorn trees on an ancient mound .  this time last year there had been a few early primroses  now there was just snow .   part of the snow moved .  a piece about the size of an apple rose up  with smoke pouring out around it .  a hand no larger than a rabbit   s paw waved the smoke away .   a very small but very angry blue face  with the lump of snow still balanced on top of it  looked out at the sudden white wilderness .      ach  crivens .     it grumbled .     will ye no    look at this .     tis the work o    the wintersmith .  noo there   s a scunner that willna tak       no    fra    an answer .      other lumps of snow were pushed up .  more heads peered out .      oh waily  waily  waily .     said one of them .     he   s found the big wee hag again .      the first head turned toward this head  and said     daft wullie .         yes  rob .         did i no    tell ye to lay off that waily business .         aye  rob  ye did that     said the head addressed as daft wullie .      so why did ye just do it .         sorry  rob .  it kinda bursted oot .         it   s so dispiritin    .         sorry  rob .      rob anybody sighed .     but i fear ye   re right  wullie .  he   s come for the big wee hag  right enough .  who   s watchin    over her doon at the farm .         wee dangerous spike  rob .      rob looked up at clouds so full of snow that they sagged in the middle .      okay     he said  and sighed again .     it   s time fra    the hero .      he ducked out of sight  the plug of snow dropping neatly back into place  and slid down into the heart of the feegle mound .   it was quite big inside .  a human could just about stand up in the middle  but would then bend double with coughing because the middle was where there was a hole to let smoke out .   all around the inner wall were tiers of galleries  and every one of them was packed with feegles .  usually the place was awash with noise  but now it was frighteningly quiet .   rob anybody walked across the floor to the fire  where his wife  jeannie  was waiting .  she stood straight and proud  like a kelda should  but close up it seemed to him that she had been crying .  he put his arm around her .      all right  ye probably ken what   s happenin        he told the blue and red audience looking down on him .     this is nae common storm .  the wintersmith has found the big wee hag   noo then  settle doon .      he waited until the shouting and sword rattling had died down  then went on     we canna fight the wintersmith for her .  that   s her road .  we canna walk it for her .  but the hag o    hags has set us on another path .  it   s a dark one  and dangerous .      a cheer went up .  feegles liked the idea of this  at least .      right .     said rob  satisfied .     ah   m awa    tae fetch the hero .      there was a lot of laughter at this  and big yan  the tallest of the feegles  shouted     it   s tae soon .  we   ve only had time tae gie him a couple o    heroing lessons .  he   s still nae more than a big streak o    nothin    .         he   ll be a hero for the big wee hag and that   s an end o    it     said rob sharply .     noo  off ye go  the whole boilin    o    ye .  tae the chalk pit .  dig me a path tae the underworld .          it had to be the wintersmith  tiffany aching told herself  standing in front of her father in the freezing farmhouse .  she could feel it out there .  this wasn   t normal weather even for midwinter  and this was springtime .  it was a challenge .  or perhaps it was just a game .  it was hard to tell  with the wintersmith .   only it can   t be a game because the lambs are dying .  i   m only just thirteen  and my father  and a lot of other people older than me  want me to do something .  and i can   t .  the wintersmith has found me again .  he is here now  and i   m too weak .   it would be easier if they were bullying me  but no  they   re begging .  my father   s face is gray with worry and he   s begging .  my father is begging me .   oh no  he   s taking his hat off .  he   s taking off his hat to speak to me .   they think magic comes free when i snap my fingers .  but if i can   t do this for them  now  what good am i .  i can   t let them see i   m afraid .  witches aren   t allowed to be afraid .   and this is my fault .  i  i started all this .  i must finish it .   mr .  aching cleared his throat .         and  er  if you could   er  magic it away  uh  or something .  for us    .      everything in the room was gray  because the light from the windows was coming through snow .  no one had wasted time digging the horrible stuff away from the houses .  every person who could hold a shovel was needed elsewhere  and still there were not enough of them .  as it was  most people had been up all night  walking the flocks of yearlings  trying to keep the new lambs safe   in the dark  in the snow    .   her snow .  it was a message to her .  a challenge .  a summons .      all right     she said .     i   ll see what i can do .         good girl     said her father  grinning with relief .  no  not a good girl  thought tiffany .  i brought this on us .      you   ll have to make a big fire  up by the sheds     she said aloud .     i mean a big fire  do you understand .  make it out of anything that will burn  and you must keep it going .  it   ll keep trying to go out  but you must keep it going .  keep piling on the fuel  whatever happens .  the fire must not go out .      she made sure that the    not .     was loud and frightening .  she didn   t want people   s minds to wander .  she put on the heavy brown woollen cloak that miss treason had made for her and grabbed the black pointy hat that hung on the back of the farmhouse door .  there was a sort of communal grunt from the people who   d crowded into the kitchen  and some of them backed away .  we want a witch now  we need a witch now  but   we   ll back away now  too .   that was the magic of the pointy hat .  it was what miss treason called    boffo .      tiffany aching stepped out into the narrow corridor that had been cut through the snow filled farmyard where the drifts were more than twice the height of a man .  at least the deep snow kept off the worst of the wind  which was made of knives .   a track had been cleared all the way to the paddock  but it had been heavy going .  when there are fifteen feet of snow everywhere  how can you clear it .  where can you clear it to .   she waited by the cart sheds while the men hacked and scraped at the snowbanks .  they were tired to the bone by now  they   d been digging for hours .   the important thing was     but there were lots of important things .  it was important to look calm and confident  it was important to keep your mind clear  it was important not to show how pants wettingly scared you were    .   she held out a hand  caught a snowflake  and took a good look at it .  it wasn   t one of the normal ones  oh no .  it was one of his special snowflakes .  that was nasty .  he was taunting her .  now she could hate him .  she   d never hated him before .  but he was killing the lambs .   she shivered and pulled the cloak around her .      this i choose to do     she croaked  her breath leaving little clouds in the air .  she cleared her throat and started again .     this i choose to do .  if there is a price  this i choose to pay .  if it is my death  then i choose to die .  where this takes me  there i choose to go .  i choose .  this i choose to do .      it wasn   t a spell  except in her own head  but if you couldn   t make spells work in your own head  you couldn   t make them work at all .   tiffany wrapped her cloak around her against the clawing wind and watched dully as the men brought straw and wood .  the fire started slowly  as if frightened to show enthusiasm .   she   d done this before  hadn   t she .  dozens of times .  the trick was not that hard when you got the feel of it  but she   d done it with time to get her mind right  and anyway  she   d never done it with anything more than a kitchen fire to warm her freezing feet .  in theory it should be just as easy with a big fire and a field of snow  right .   right .   the fire began to roar up .  her father put his hand on her shoulder .  tiffany jumped .  she   d forgotten how quietly he could move .      what was that about choosing .     he said .  she   d forgotten what good hearing he had  too .      it   s a   witch thing     she answered  trying not to look at his face .     so that if this   doesn   t work  it   s no one   s fault but mine .     and this is my fault  she added to herself .  it   s unfair  but no one said it wasn   t going to be .   her father   s hand caught her chin and gently turned her head around .  how soft his hands are  tiffany thought .  big man   s hands but soft as a baby   s  because of the grease on the sheep   s fleeces .      we shouldn   t have asked you  should we       he said .   yes  you should have asked me  tiffany thought .  the lambs are dying under the dreadful snow .  and i should have said no  i should have said i   m not that good yet .  but the lambs are dying under the dreadful snow .   there will be other lambs  said her second thoughts .   but these aren   t those lambs  are they .  these are the lambs that are dying  here and now .  and they   re dying because i listened to my feet and dared to dance with the wintersmith .      i can do it     she said .   her father held her chin and stared into her eyes .      are you sure  jiggit .     he asked .  it was the nickname her grandmother had had for her   granny aching  who never lost a lamb to the dreadful snow .  he   d never used it before .  why had it risen up in his mind now .      yes .     she pushed his hand away  and broke his gaze before she could burst into tears .      i   haven   t told your mother this yet     said her father very slowly  as if the words required enormous care     but i can   t find your brother .  i think he was trying to help .  abe swindell said he saw him with his little shovel .  er   i   m sure he   s all right  but   keep an eye open for him  will you .  he   s got his red coat on .      his face  with no expression at all  was heartbreaking to see .  little wentworth  nearly seven years old  always running after the men  always wanting to be one of them  always trying to help   how easily a small body could get overlooked    .  the snow was still coming fast .  the horribly wrong snowflakes were white on her father   s shoulders .  it   s these little things you remember when the bottom falls out of the world  and you   re falling     that wasn   t just unfair  that was   cruel .   remember the hat you wear .  remember the job that is in front of you .  balance .  balance is the thing .  hold balance in the center  hold the balance    .   tiffany extended her numb hands to the fire  to draw out the warmth .      remember  don   t let the fire go out     she said .      i   ve got men bringing up wood from all over     said her father .     i told    em to bring all the coal from the forge  too .  it won   t run out of feeding  i promise you .      the flame danced and curved toward tiffany   s hands .  the trick was  the trick  the trick   was to fold the heat somewhere close  draw it with you and   balance .  forget everything else .      i   ll come with       her father began .      no .  watch the fire .     tiffany shouted  too loud  frantic with fear .     you will do what i say .      i am not your daughter today .  her mind screamed .  i am your witch .  i will protect you .   she turned before he could see her face and ran through the flakes  along the track that had been cut toward the lower paddocks .  the snow had been trodden down into a lumpy  hummocky path  made slippery with fresh snow .  exhausted men with shovels pressed themselves into the snowbanks on either side rather than get in her way .   she reached the wider area where other shepherds were digging into the wall of snow .  it tumbled in lumps around them .      stop .  get back .     her voice shouted  while her mind wept .   the men obeyed quickly .  the mouth that had given that order had a pointy hat above it .  you didn   t argue with that .   remember the heat  the heat  remember the heat  balance  balance     this was witching cut to the bone .  no toys  no wands  no boffo  no headology  no tricks .  all that mattered was how good you were .   but sometimes you had to trick yourself .  she wasn   t the summer lady and she wasn   t granny weatherwax .  she needed to give herself all the help she could .   she pulled the little silver horse out of her pocket .  it was greasy and stained  and she   d meant to clean it  but there had been no time  no time    .   like a knight putting on his helmet  she fastened the silver chain around her neck .   she should have practiced more .  she should have listened to people .  she should have listened to herself .   she took a deep breath and held out her hands on either side of her  palms up .  on her right hand a white scar glowed .      thunder on my right hand     she said .     lightning in my left hand .  fire behind me .  frost in front of me .      she stepped forward until she was only a few inches away from the snowbank .  she could feel its coldness already pulling the heat out of her .  well  so be it .  she took a few deep breaths .  this i choose to do    .      frost to fire     she whispered .   in the yard  the fire went white and roared like a furnace .   the snow wall spluttered and then exploded into steam  sending chunks of snow into the air .  tiffany walked forward slowly .  snow pulled back from her hands like mist at sunrise .  it melted in the heat of her  becoming a tunnel in the deep drift  fleeing from her  writhing around her in clouds of cold fog .   yes .  she smiled desperately .  it was true .  if you had the perfect center  if you got your mind right  you could balance .  in the middle of the seesaw is a place that never moves    .   her boots squelched over warm water .  there was fresh green grass under the snow  because the awful storm had been so late in the year .  she walked on  heading to where the lambing pens were buried .   her father stared at the fire .  it was burning white hot  like a furnace  eating through the wood as if driven by a gale .  it was collapsing into ashes in front of his eyes    .   water was pouring around tiffany   s boots now .   yes .  but don   t think about it .  hold the balance .  more heat .  frost to fire .   there was a bleat .   sheep could live under the snow  at least for a while .  but as granny aching used to say  when the gods made sheep  they must   ve left their brains in their other coat .  in a panic  and sheep were always just an inch from panicking  they   d trample their own lambs .   now ewes and lambs appeared  steaming and bewildered as the snow melted around them  as if they were sculptures left behind .   tiffany moved on  staring straight ahead of her  only just aware of the excited cries of the men behind her .  they were following her  pulling the ewes free  cradling the lambs    .   her father yelled at the other men .  some of them were hacking at a farm cart  throwing the wood down into the white hot flames .  others were dragging furniture up from the house .  wheels  tables  straw bales  chairs   the fire took everything  gulped it down  and roared for more .  and there wasn   t any more .   no red coat .  no red coat .  balance  balance .  tiffany waded on  water and sheep pouring past her .  the tunnel ceiling fell in a splashing and slithering of slush .  she ignored it .  fresh snowflakes fell down through the hole and boiled in the air above her head .  she ignored that  too .  and then  ahead of her   a glimpse of red .   frost to fire .  the snow fled  and there he was .  she picked him up  held him close  sent some of her heat into him  felt him stir  whispered     it weighed at least forty pounds .  at least forty pounds .      wentworth coughed and opened his eyes .  tears falling like melting snow  she ran over to a shepherd and thrust the boy into his arms .      take him to his mother .  do it now .     the man grabbed the boy and ran  frightened of her fierceness .  today she was their witch .   tiffany turned back .  there were more lambs to be saved .   her father   s coat landed on the starving flames  glowed for a moment  then fell into gray ashes .  the other men were ready  they grabbed the man as he went to jump after it and pulled him back  kicking and shouting .   the flint cobbles had melted like butter .  they spluttered for a moment  then froze .   the fire went out .   tiffany aching looked up  into the eyes of the wintersmith .   and up on the roof of the cart shed  the small voice belonging to wee dangerous spike said     ach  crivens .          all this hasn   t happened yet .  it might not happen at all .  the future is always a bit wobbly .  any little thing  like the fall of a snowflake or the dropping of the wrong kind of spoon  can send it spinning off along a new path .  or perhaps not .   where it all began was last autumn  on the day with a cat in it    .       chapter two      miss treason      this is tiffany aching  riding a broomstick through the mountain forests a hundred miles away .  it   s a very old broomstick  and she   s flying it just above the ground  it   s got two smaller broomsticks stuck on the back like training wheels  to stop it from tipping over .  it belongs  appropriately  to a very old witch called miss treason  who   s even worse at flying than tiffany and is     years old .   tiffany is slightly more than one hundred years younger than that  taller than she was even a month ago  and not as certain of anything at all as she was a year ago .   she is training to be a witch .  witches usually wear black  but as far as she could tell  the only reason that witches wore black was that they   d always worn black .  this did not seem a good enough reason  so she tended to wear blue or green .  she didn   t laugh with scorn at finery because she   d never seen any .   you couldn   t escape the pointy hat  though .  there was nothing magical about a pointy hat except that it said that the woman underneath it was a witch .  people paid attention to a pointy hat .   even so  it was hard to be a witch in the village where you   d grown up .  it was hard to be a witch to people who knew you as    joe aching   s girl    and had seen you running around with only your undershirt on when you were two years old .   going away had helped .  most people tiffany knew hadn   t been more than ten miles away from the spot where they were born  so if you   d gone to mysterious foreign parts  that made you a bit mysterious  too .  you came back slightly different .  a witch needed to be different .   witching was turning out to be mostly hard work and really short on magic of the zap .  glingle glingle glingle variety .  there was no school and nothing that was exactly like a lesson .  but it wasn   t wise to try to learn witching all by yourself  especially if you had a natural talent .  if you got it wrong  you could go from ignorant to cackling in a week    .   when you got right down to it  it was all about cackling .  no one ever talked about this  though .  witches said things like    you can never be too old  too skinny  or too warty     but they never mentioned the cackling .  not properly .  they watched out for it  though  all the time .   it was all too easy to become a cackler .  most witches lived by themselves  cat optional  and might go for weeks without ever seeing another witch .  in those times when people hated witches  they were often accused of talking to their cats .  of course they talked to their cats .  after three weeks without an intelligent conversation that wasn   t about cows  you   d talk to the wall .  and that was an early sign of cackling .      cackling     to a witch  didn   t just mean nasty laughter .  it meant your mind drifting away from its anchor .  it meant you losing your grip .  it meant loneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people   s problems driving you crazy a little bit at a time  each bit so small that you   d hardly notice it  until you thought that it was normal to stop washing and wear a kettle on your head .  it meant you thinking that the fact you knew more than anyone else in your village made you better than them .  it meant thinking that right and wrong were negotiable .  and  in the end  it meant you    going to the dark     as the witches said .  that was a bad road .  at the end of that road were poisoned spinning wheels and gingerbread cottages .   what stopped this was the habit of visiting .  witches visited other witches all the time  sometimes traveling quite a long way for a cup of tea and a bun .  partly this was for gossip  of course  because witches love gossip  especially if it   s more exciting than truthful .  but mostly it was to keep an eye on one another .   today tiffany was visiting granny weatherwax  who was in the opinion of most witches  including granny herself  the most powerful witch in the mountains .  it was all very polite .  no one said     not gone bats  then .     or    certainly not .  i   m as sharp as a spoon .     they didn   t need to .  they understood what it was all about  so they talked of other things .  but when she was in a mood  granny weatherwax could be hard work .   she sat silently in her rocking chair .  some people are good at talking  but granny weatherwax was good at silence .  she could sit so quiet and still that she faded .  you forgot she was there .  the room became empty .   it upset people .  it was probably meant to .  but tiffany had learned silence too  from granny aching  her real grandmother .  now she was learning that if you made yourself really quiet  you could become almost invisible .   granny weatherwax was an expert .   tiffany thought of it as the i   m not here spell  if it was a spell .  she reasoned that everyone had something inside them that told the world they were there .  that was why you could often sense when someone was behind you  even if they were making no sound at all .  you were receiving their i am here signal .   some people had a very strong one .  they were the people who got served first in shops .  granny weatherwax had an i am here signal that bounced off the mountains when she wanted it to  when she walked into a forest  all the wolves and bears ran out the other side .   she could turn it off  too .   she was doing that now .  tiffany was having to concentrate to see her .  most of her mind was telling her that there was no one there at all .   well  she thought  that   s about enough of that .  she coughed .  suddenly granny weatherwax had always been there .      miss treason is very well     said tiffany .      a fine woman     said granny .      oh  yes .         she has her funny ways     said tiffany .      we   re none of us perfect     said granny .      she   s trying some new eyes     said tiffany .      that   s good .         they   re a couple of ravens    .         it   s just as well     said granny .      better than the mouse she usually uses     said tiffany .      i expect they are .      there was a bit more of this  until tiffany began to get annoyed at doing all the work .  there was such a thing as common politeness  after all .  oh well  she knew what to do about it now .      mrs .  earwig   s written another book     she said .      i heard     said granny .  the shadows in the room maybe grew a little darker .   well  that explained the sulk .  even thinking about mrs .  earwig made granny weatherwax angry .  mrs .  earwig was all wrong to granny weatherwax .  she wasn   t born locally  which was almost a crime to begin with .  she wrote books  and granny weatherwax didn   t trust books .  and mrs .  earwig  pronounced    ah wij     at least by mrs .  earwig  believed in shiny wands and magical amulets and mystic runes and the power of the stars  while granny weatherwax believed in cups of tea  dry biscuits  washing every morning in cold water  and  well  she believed mostly in granny weatherwax .   mrs .  earwig was popular among the younger witches  because if you did witchcraft her way  you could wear so much jewelry that you could barely walk .  granny weatherwax wasn   t popular with anyone much        except when they needed her .  when death was standing by the cradle or the axe slipped in the woods and blood was soaking into the moss  you sent someone hurrying to the cold  gnarly little cottage in the clearing .  when all hope was gone  you called for granny weatherwax  because she was the best .   and she always came .  always .  but popular .  no .  need is not the same as like .  granny weatherwax was for when things were serious .   tiffany did like her  though  in an odd kind of way .  she thought granny weatherwax liked her  too .  she let tiffany call her granny to her face  when all the other young witches had to call her mistress weatherwax .  sometimes tiffany thought that if you were friendly to granny weatherwax  she tested you to see how friendly you would stay .  everything about granny weatherwax was a test .      the new book is called first flights in witchcraft     she went on  watching the old witch carefully .   granny weatherwax smiled .  that is  her mouth went up at the corners .      hah .     she said .     i   ve said it before and i   ll say it again  you can   t learn witchin    from books .  letice earwig thinks you can become a witch by goin    shoppin    .     she gave tiffany a piercing look  as if she were making up her mind about something .  then she said     an    i   ll wager she don   t know how to do this .      she picked up her cup of hot tea  curling her hand around it .  then she reached out with her other hand and took tiffany   s hand .      ready .     said granny .      for wha       tiffany began  and then she felt her hand get hot .  the heat spread up her arm  warming it to the bone .      feelin    it .         yes .      the warmth died away .  and granny weatherwax  still watching tiffany   s face  turned the teacup upside down .   the tea dropped out in one lump .  it was frozen solid .   tiffany was old enough not to say     how did you do that .     granny weatherwax didn   t answer silly questions or  for that matter  many questions at all .      you moved the heat     tiffany said .     you took the heat out of the tea and moved it through you to me  yes .         yes  but it never touched me     said granny triumphantly .     it   s all about balance  do you see .  balance is the trick .  keep the balance and       she stopped .     you   ve ridden on a seesaw .  one end goes up  one end goes down .  but the bit in the middle  right in the middle  that stays where it is .  upness and downness go right through it .  don   t matter how high or low the ends go  it keeps the balance .     she sniffed .     magic is mostly movin    stuff around .         can i learn that .         i daresay .  it   s not hard  if you get your mind right .         can you teach me .         i just have .  i showed you .         no  granny  you just showed me how to do it  not   how to do it .         can   t tell you that .  i know how i do it .  how you do it   ll be different .  you   ve just got to get your mind right .         how do i do that .         how should i know .  it   s your mind     snapped granny .     put the kettle on again  will you .  my tea   s gone cold .      there was something almost spiteful about all this  but that was granny .  she took the view that if you were capable of learning  you   d work it out .  there was no point in making it easy for people .  life wasn   t easy  she said .      an    i see you   re still wearing that trinket     said granny .  she didn   t like trinkets  a word she used to mean anything metal a witch wore that wasn   t there to hold up  shut  or fasten .  that was    shoppin    .      tiffany touched the little silver horse she wore around her neck .  it was small and simple  and it meant a lot to her .      yes     she said calmly .     i still am .         what have you got in that basket .     granny said now  which was unusually rude .  tiffany   s basket was on the table .  it had a present in it  of course .  everyone knew you took a small present along when you went visiting  but the person you were visiting was supposed to be surprised when you gave it to her  and say things like    oooh  you shouldn   t have .         i brought you something     said tiffany  swinging the big black kettle onto the fire .      you   ve got no call to be bringing me presents  i   m sure     said granny sternly .      yes  well     said tiffany  and left it at that .   she heard granny lift the lid of the basket .  there was a kitten in it .      her mother is pinky  the widow cable   s cat     said tiffany  to fill the silence .      you shouldn   t have     growled the voice of granny weatherwax .      it was no trouble .     tiffany smiled at the fire .      i can   t be havin    with cats .         she   ll keep the mice down     said tiffany  still not turning around .      don   t have mice .      nothing for them to eat  thought tiffany .  aloud  she said     mrs .  earwig   s got six big black cats .     in the basket  the white kitten would be staring up at granny weatherwax with the sad  shocked expression of all kittens .  you test me  i test you  tiffany thought .      i don   t know what i shall do with it  i   m sure .  it   ll have to sleep in the goat shed     said granny weatherwax .  most witches had goats .   the kitten rubbed against granny   s hand and went meep .   when tiffany left  later on  granny weatherwax said good bye at the door and very carefully shut the kitten outside .   tiffany went across the clearing to where she   d tied up miss treason   s broomstick .   but she didn   t get on  not yet .  she stepped back up against a holly bush  and went quiet until she wasn   t there anymore  until everything about her said  i   m not here .   everyone could see pictures in the fire and in clouds .  you just turned that the other way around .  you turned off that bit of yourself that said you were there .  you dissolved .  anyone looking at you would find you very hard to see .  your face became a bit of leaf and shadow  your body a piece of tree and bush .  the other person   s mind would fill in the gaps .   looking like just another piece of holly bush  she watched the door .  the wind had got up  warm but worrisome  shaking the yellow and red leaves off the sycamore trees and whirring them around the clearing .  the kitten tried to bat a few of them out of the air and then sat there  making sad little mewling noises .  any minute now  granny weatherwax would think tiffany had gone and would open the door and        forgot something .     said granny by her ear .   she was the bush .      er   it   s very sweet .  i just thought you might  you know  grow to like it     said tiffany  but she was thinking  well  she could have got here if she ran  but why didn   t i see her .  can you run and hide at the same time .      never you mind about me  my girl     said the witch .     you run along back to miss treason and give her my best wishes  right now .  but      and her voice softened a little      that was good hiding you did just then .  there   s many as would not have seen you .  why  i hardly heard your hair growin    .      when tiffany   s stick had left the clearing  and granny weatherwax had satisfied herself in other little ways that she had really gone  she went back inside  carefully ignoring the kitten again .   after a few minutes  the door creaked open a little .  it may have been just a draft .  the kitten trotted inside    .       all witches were a bit odd .  tiffany had got used to odd  so that odd seemed quite normal .  there was miss level  for example  who had two bodies  although one of them was imaginary .  mistress pullunder  who bred pedigreed earthworms and gave them all names   well  she was hardly odd at all  just a bit peculiar  and anyway earthworms were quite interesting in a basically uninteresting kind of way .  and there had been old mother dismass  who suffered from bouts of temporal confusion  which can be quite strange when it happens to a witch  her mouth never moved in time with her words  and sometimes her footsteps came down the stairs ten minutes before she did .   but when it came to odd  miss treason didn   t just take the cake  but a packet of biscuits too  with sprinkles on the top  and also a candle .   where to start  when things were wall to wall odd    .   miss eumenides treason had gone blind when she was sixty years old .  to most people that would have been a misfortune  but miss treason was skilled at borrowing  a particular witch talent .   she could use the eyes of animals  reading what they saw right out of their minds .   she   d gone deaf when she was seventy five  but she   d got the hang of it by now and used any ears she could find running around .   when tiffany had first gone to stay with her  miss treason had used a mouse for seeing and hearing  because her old jackdaw had died .  it was a bit worrying to see an old woman striding around the cottage with a mouse in her outstretched hand  and very worrying if you said something and the mouse was swung around to face you .  it was amazing how creepy a little pink wriggly nose could be .   the new ravens were a lot better .  somebody in one of the local villages had made the old woman a perch that fitted across her shoulders  one bird on either side  and with her long white hair the effect was very  well  witchy  although a bit messy down the back of her cloak by the end of the day .   then there was her clock .  it was heavy and made of rusty iron by someone who was more blacksmith than watchmaker  which was why it went clonk clank instead of tick tock .  she wore it on her belt and could tell the time by feeling the stubby little hands .   there was a story in the villages that the clock was miss treason   s heart  which she   d used ever since her first heart died .  but there were lots of stories about miss treason .   you had to have a high threshold for odd to put up with her .  it was traditional that young witches traveled around and stayed with older witches to learn from a lot of experts in exchange for what miss tick the witch finder called    some help with the chores     which meant    doing all the chores .     mostly  they left miss treason   s after one night .  tiffany had stuck it out for three months so far .   oh  and sometimes  when she was looking for a pair of eyes to look through  miss treason would creep into yours .  it was a strange prickly sensation  like having someone invisible looking over your shoulder .   yes   perhaps miss treason didn   t just take the cake  a packet of biscuits with sprinkles on the top  and a candle  but also the trifle  the sandwiches  and a man who made amusing balloon animals afterward .   she was weaving at her loom when tiffany came in .  two beaks turned to face her .      ah  child     said miss treason in a thin  cracked voice .     you have had a good day .         yes  miss treason     said tiffany obediently .      you have seen the girl weatherwax and she is well .     click clack went the loom .  clonk clank went the clock .      quite well     said tiffany .  miss treason didn   t ask questions .  she just told you the answers .     the girl weatherwax     tiffany thought  as she started to get their supper .  but miss treason was very old .   and very scary .  it was a fact .  you couldn   t deny it .  she didn   t have a hooked nose and she did have all her teeth  even if they were yellow  but after that she was a picture book wicked witch .  and her knees clicked when she walked .  and she walked very fast  with the help of two sticks  scuttling around like a big spider .  that was another strange thing  the cottage was full of cobwebs  which miss treason ordered tiffany never to touch  but you never saw a spider .   there was the thing about black  too .  most witches liked black  but miss treason even had black goats and black chickens .  the walls were black .  the floor was black .  if you dropped a stick of licorice  you   d never find it again .  and  to tiffany   s dismay  she had to make her cheeses black  which meant painting the cheeses with shiny black wax .  tiffany was an excellent cheesemaker and it did keep them moist  but tiffany distrusted black cheeses .  they always looked as though they were plotting something .   and miss treason didn   t seem to need sleep .  she hadn   t got much use for night and day now .  when the ravens went to bed  she   d summon up an owl and weave by owl sight .  an owl was particularly good  she said  because it   d keep turning its head to watch the shuttle of the loom .  click clack went the loom  and clonk clank went the clock  right back at it .   miss treason  with her billowing black cloak and bandaged eyes and wild white hair     miss treason with her two sticks  wandering the cottage and garden in the dark and frosty night  smelling the memory of flowers    .   all witches had some particular skill  and miss treason delivered justice .   people would come from miles around to bring her their problems   i know it   s my cow but he says it   s his .   she says it   s her land but my father left it to me .    and miss treason would sit at the click clacking loom with her back to the room full of anxious people .  the loom worried them .  they watched it as though they were afraid of it  and the ravens watched them .   they would stutter out their cases  um ing and ah ing  while the loom rattled away in the flickering candlelight .  oh  yes   the candlelight     the candleholders were two skulls .  one had the word enochi carved on it  the other had the word athootita .    the words meant    guilt    and    innocence .     tiffany wished she didn   t know that .  there was no way that a girl brought up on the chalk should know that  because the words were in a foreign language  and an ancient one  too .  she knew them because of dr .  sensibility bustle  d .  m .  phil .   b .  el l .   patricius professor of magic at unseen university  who was in her head .    well  a tiny part of him  at least .    a couple of summers ago she had been taken over by a hiver  a   thing that had been collecting minds for millions of years .  tiffany managed to get it out of her head  but a few fragments had stayed tangled up in her brain .  one of these was a tiny lump of ego and a mix of memories that were what remained of the late dr .  bustle .  he wasn   t much trouble  but if she looked at anything in a foreign language  she could read it   or  rather  hear dr .  bustle   s reedy voice translating it for her .  that seemed to be about all that was left of him  but she tried to avoid getting undressed in front of a mirror .    the candles had dripped wax all over the skulls  and people would keep glancing at them the whole time they were in the room .   and then  when all the words had been said  the loom would stop with a shock of sudden silence  and miss treason would turn around in her big heavy chair  which had wheels on it  and remove the black blindfold from her pearly gray eyes and say      i have heard .  now i shall see .  i shall see what is true .      some people would actually run away at this point  when she stared at them in the light from the skulls .  those eyes that could not see your face could somehow see your mind .  when miss treason was looking right through you  you could only be truthful or very  very stupid .   so no one ever argued with miss treason .   witches were not allowed to be paid for using their talents  but everyone who came to have a dispute settled by miss treason brought her a present  usually food but sometimes clean used clothing  if it was black  or a pair of old boots if they were her size .  if miss treason gave judgment against you  it was really not a good idea  everyone said  to ask for your present back  as being turned into something small and sticky often offends .   they said if you lied to miss treason  you would die horribly within a week .  they said that kings and princes came to see miss treason at night  asking questions about great affairs of state .  they said that in her cellar was a heap of gold  guarded by a demon with skin like fire and three heads that would attack anyone it saw and eat their noses .   tiffany suspected that at least two of these beliefs were wrong .  she knew the third one wasn   t true  because one day she   d gone down into the cellar  with a bucket of water and a poker  just in case   and there was nothing there but piles of potatoes and carrots .  and a mouse  watching her carefully .   tiffany wasn   t scared  much .  for one thing  unless the demon was good at disguising itself as a potato  it probably didn   t exist .  and another thing was that although miss treason looked bad and sounded bad and smelled like old locked wardrobes  she didn   t feel bad .   first sight and second thoughts  that   s what a witch had to rely on  first sight to see what   s really there  and second thoughts to watch the first thoughts to check that they were thinking right .  then there were the third thoughts  which tiffany had never heard discussed and therefore kept quiet about  they were odd  seemed to think for themselves  and didn   t turn up very often .  and they were telling her that there was more to miss treason than met the eye .   and then one day  when she was dusting  tiffany knocked over the skull called enochi .      and suddenly tiffany knew a lot more about miss treason than miss treason probably wanted anyone to know .   tonight  as they were eating their stew  with black beans   miss treason said     the wind is rising .  we must go soon .  i would not trust the stick above the trees on a night like this .  there may be strange creatures about .         go .  we   re going out .     tiffany asked .  they never went out in the evenings  which was why the evenings always felt a hundred years long .      indeed we are .  they will be dancing tonight .         who will .         the ravens will not be able to see and the owl will get confused     miss treason went on .     i will need to use your eyes .         who will be dancing  miss treason .     said tiffany .  she liked dancing  but no one seemed to dance up here .      it is not far  but there will be a storm .      so that was that  miss treason wasn   t going to tell .  but it sounded interesting .  besides  it would probably be an education to see anyone miss treason thought was strange .   of course  it did mean miss treason would put her pointy hat on .  tiffany hated this bit .  she   d have to stand in front of miss treason and stare at her  and feel the little tingle in her eyes as the ancient witch used her as a kind of mirror .   the wind was roaring in the woods like a big dark animal by the time they   d finished supper .  it barged the door out of tiffany   s hands when she opened it and blew around the room  making the cords hum on the loom .      are you sure about this  miss treason .     she said  trying to push the door shut .      don   t you say that to me .  you will not say that to me .  the dance must be witnessed .  i have never missed the dance .     miss treason looked nervous and edgy .     we must go .  and you must wear black .         miss treason  you know i don   t wear black     said tiffany .      tonight is a night for black .  you will wear my second best cloak .      she said it with a witch   s firmness  as if the idea of anyone disobeying had never crossed her mind .  she was     years old .  she   d had a lot of practice .  tiffany didn   t argue .   it isn   t that i have anything against black  tiffany thought as she fetched the second best cloak  but it   s just not me .  when people say witches wear black  they actually mean that old ladies wear black .  anyway  it   s not as if i   m wearing pink or something    .   after that she had to wrap miss treason   s clock in pieces of blanket  so that the clonk clank became clonk clank .  there was no question of leaving it behind .  miss treason always kept the clock close to her .   while tiffany got herself ready  the old woman wound the clock up with a horrible graunching noise .  she was always winding it up  sometimes she stopped to do it in the middle of a judgment  with a room full of horrified people .   there was no rain yet  but when they set out the air was full of twigs and flying leaves .  miss treason sat sidesaddle on the broom  hanging on for dear life  while tiffany walked along towing it by means of a piece of clothesline .   the sunset sky was still red  and a gibbous moon was high  but the clouds were being whipped across it  filling the woods with moving shadows .  branches knocked together  and tiffany heard the creak and crash as  somewhere in the dark  one fell to the ground .      are we going to the villages .     tiffany yelled above the din .      no .  take the path through the forest .     shouted miss treason .   ah  thought tiffany  is this the famous    dancing around without your drawers on    that i   ve heard so much about .  actually  not very much about  because as soon as anyone mentions it  someone else tells them to shut up  so i really haven   t heard much about it at all  but haven   t heard in a very meaningful way .   it was something people thought witches did  but witches didn   t think they did it .  tiffany had to admit she could see why .  even hot summer nights weren   t all that warm  and there were always hedgehogs and thistles to worry about .  besides  you just couldn   t imagine someone like granny weatherwax dancing around without   well  you just couldn   t imagine it  because if you did  it would make your head explode .   the wind died down as she took the forest track  still towing the floating miss treason .  but the wind had brought cold air with it and then left it behind .  tiffany was glad of the cloak  even if it was black .   she trudged on  taking different tracks when miss treason told her to  until she saw firelight through the trees  in a little dip in the land .      stop here and help me down  girl     said the old witch .     and listen carefully .  there are rules .  one  you will not talk  two  you will look only at the dancers  three  you will not move until the dance is finished .  i will not tell you twice .         yes  miss treason .  it   s very cold up here .         and will get colder .      they headed for the distant light .  what good is a dance you can only watch .  tiffany wondered .  it didn   t sound like much fun .      it isn   t meant to be fun     said miss treason .   shadows moved across the firelight  and tiffany heard the sound of men   s voices .  then  as they reached the edge of the sunken ground  someone threw water over the fire .   there was a hiss  and a cloud of smoke and steam rose among the trees .  it happened in a moment and left a shock behind .  the only thing that had seemed alive here had died .   dry fallen leaves crunched under her feet .  the moon  in a sky swept clean now of clouds  made little silver shapes on the forest floor .   it was some time before tiffany realized that there were six men standing in the middle of the clearing .  they must have been wearing black  against the moonlight they looked like man shaped holes into nothing .  they were in two lines of three  facing each other  but were so still that after a while tiffany wondered if she was imagining them .   there was the thud of a drumbeat  bom   bom   bom .   it went on for half a minute or so  and then stopped .  but in the silence of the cold woods the beat went on inside tiffany   s head  and perhaps that wasn   t the only head it thundered in  because the men were gently nodding their heads  to keep the beat .   they began to dance .   the only noise was of their boots hitting the ground as the shadow men wove in and out .  but then tiffany  her head full of the silent drum  heard another sound .  her foot was tapping  all by itself .   she   d heard this beat before  she   d seen men dancing like this .  but it had been on warm days in bright sunshine .  they   d worn little bells on their clothes .      this is a morris dance .     she said  not quite under her breath .      shush .     hissed miss treason .      but this isn   t the right           be silent .      blushing and angry in the dark  tiffany took her eyes off the dancers and defiantly looked around the clearing .  there were other shadows crowding in  human or at least human shaped  but she couldn   t see them clearly and maybe that was just as well .   it was getting colder  she was sure .  white frost was crackling across the leaves .   the beat went on .  but it seemed to tiffany that it wasn   t alone now  but had picked up other beats  and echoes from inside her head .   miss treason could shush all she liked .  it was a morris dance .  but it was out of time .   the morris men came to the village sometime in may .  you could never be sure when  because they had to call at lots of villages along the chalk  and every village had a pub  which slowed them down .   they carried sticks and wore white clothes with bells on them  to stop them from creeping up on people .  no one likes an unexpected morris dancer .  tiffany would wait outside the village with the other children and dance behind them all the way in .   and then they used to dance on the village green to the beat of a drum  banging their sticks together in the air  and then everyone would go to the pub and summer would come .   tiffany hadn   t been able to work out how that last bit happened .  the dancers danced  and then summer came   that was all anybody seemed to know .  her father said that there had once been a year when the dancers hadn   t turned up  and a cold wet spring had turned into a chilly autumn  with the months between being filled with mists and rain and frosts in august .   the sound of the drums filled her head now  making her feel dizzy .  they were wrong  there was something wrong     and then she remembered the seventh dancer  the one they called the fool .  he was generally a small man  wearing a battered top hat and bright rags sewn all over his clothes .  mostly he wandered around holding out the hat and grinning at people until they gave him money for beer .  but sometimes he   d put the hat down and whirl off into the dancers .  you   d expect there to be a massive collision of arms and legs  but it never happened .  jumping and twirling among the sweating men  he always managed to be where the other dancers weren   t .   the world was moving around her .  she blinked .  the drums in her head were like thunder now  and there was one beat as deep as oceans .  miss treason was forgotten .  so was the strange  mysterious crowd .  now there was only the dance itself .   it twisted in the air like a living thing .  but there was a space in it  moving around .  it was where she should be  she knew it .  miss treason had said no  but that had been a long time ago and how could miss treason understand .  what could she know .  when did she last dance .  the dance was in tiffany   s bones now  calling to her .  six dancers were not enough .   she ran forward and jumped into the dance .   the eyes of the dancing men glared at her as she skipped and danced between them  always being where they weren   t .  the drums had her feet  and they went where the beat sent them .   and then      there was someone else there .   it was like the feeling of someone behind her   but it was also the feeling of someone in front of her  and beside her  and above her  and below her  all at once .   the dancers froze  but the world spun .  the men were just black shadows  darker outlines in the darkness .  the drumbeats stopped  and there was one long moment as tiffany turned gently and silently  arms out  feet not touching the ground  her face turned toward stars that were as cold as ice and sharp as needles .  it felt   wonderful .   a voice said     who are you .     it had an echo  or perhaps two people had said it at almost the same time .   the beat came back  suddenly  and six men crashed into her .       a few hours later  in the small town of dogbend  down on the plains  the citizens threw a witch into the river with her arms and legs tied together .   this sort of thing never happened in the mountains  where witches had respect  but down on the wide plains there were still people dumb enough to believe the nastier stories .  besides  there wasn   t much to do in the evenings .   however  it probably wasn   t often that the witch was given a cup of tea and some biscuits before her ducking .   it had happened here because the people of dogbend did it by the book .   the book was called  magavenatio obtusis .    the townspeople didn   t know how the book had arrived .  it had just turned up one day  on a shelf in one of the shops .   they knew how to read  of course .  you had to have a certain amount of reading and writing to get on in the world  even in dogbend .  but they didn   t trust books much  or the kind of people who read them .   this one  though  was a book on how to deal with witches .  it looked pretty authoritative  too  without too many long  and therefore untrustworthy  words  like    marmalade .     at last  they told one another  this is what we need .  this is a sensible book .  okay  it isn   t what you   d expect  but remember that witch last year .  we ducked her in the river and then tried to burn her alive .  only she was too soggy  and got away .  let   s not go through that again .   they paid particular attention to this bit       it is very important  having caught your witch  not to harm her in any way  yet .   .  on no account set fire to her .  this is an error beginners often fall into .  it just makes the witch mad and she comes back even stronger .  as everyone knows  the other way to get rid of a witch is to throw her into a river or pond .     this is the best plan     first  imprison her overnight in a moderately warm room and give her as much soup as she asks for .  carrot and lentil might do  but for best results we recommend leek and potato made with a good beef stock .  this has been proven to seriously harm her magical powers .  do not give her tomato soup   it will make her very powerful .     to be on the safe side  put a silver coin in each of her boots .  she will not be able to pull the coins out because they will burn her fingers .     provide her with warm blankets and a pillow .  this will trick her into going to sleep .  lock the door and see that no one enters .     about one hour before dawn  go into the room .  now you might think the way to do this would be to rush in shouting .  nothing could be further from the truth .  tiptoe in gently  leave a cup of tea by the sleeping witch  tiptoe back to the doorway  and cough quietly .  this is important .  if awakened suddenly  she could get very nasty indeed .     some authorities recommend chocolate biscuits with the tea  others say that ginger biscuits will be enough .  if you value your life  do not give her plain biscuits  because sparks will fly out of her ears .  when she awakes  recite this powerful mystic rune  which will stop her from turning into a swarm of bees and flying away     iti sapit eyi ma nass .     when she has finished the tea and biscuits  tie her hands and feet in front of her with rope using no .    bosun   s knots and throw her in the water .     important safety note  do this before it starts getting light .  do not stay to watch .       of course  this time some people did .  and what they saw was the witch sinking and not coming up again  while her wicked pointy hat floated away .  then they went home for breakfast .   in this particular river  nothing much happened for several minutes more .  then the pointy hat started to move toward a thick patch of reeds .  it stopped there  and rose very slowly .  a pair of eyes peered out from underneath the brim    .   when she was sure that there was no one about  miss perspicacia tick  teacher and witch finder  crawled up the bank on her stomach and then legged it away at high speed into the woods just as the sun came up .  she   d left a bag with a clean dress and some fresh underwear stuck in a badger   s sett  along with a box of matches  she never carried matches in her pocket if there was a danger of being caught  in case it gave people ideas  .   well  she thought  as she dried out in front of a fire  things could have been worse .  thank goodness the village still had someone left who could read  or else she would have been in a pretty pickle .  maybe it was a good idea that she   d had the book printed in big letters .   it was in fact miss tick who had written witch hunting for dumb people  and she made sure that copies of it found their way into those areas where people still believed that witches should be burned or drowned .   since the only witch ever likely to pass through these days was miss tick herself  it meant that if things did go wrong  she   d get a good night   s sleep and a decent meal before being thrown into the water .  the water was no problem at all to miss tick  who had been to the quirm college for young ladies  where you had to have an icy dip every morning to build moral fiber .  and a no .    bosun   s knot was very easy to undo with your teeth  even underwater .   oh  yes  she thought  as she emptied her boots  and she   d got two silver sixpences  too .  really  the people of the village of dogbend were getting very stupid indeed .  of course  that   s what happened when you got rid of your witches .  a witch was just someone who knew a bit more than you did .  that   s what the name meant .  and some people didn   t like anyone who knew more than they did  so these days the wandering teachers and the traveling librarians steered clear of the place .  the way things were going  if the people of dogbend wanted to throw stones at anyone who knew more than them  they   d soon have to throw them at the pigs .   the place was a mess .  unfortunately there was a girl aged eight there who was definitely showing promise  and miss tick dropped in sometimes to keep an eye on her .  not as a witch  obviously  because although she liked a cold dip in the morning  you could have too much of a good thing .  she disguised herself as a humble apple seller  or a fortune teller .   witches don   t usually do fortune telling  because if they did  they   d be too good at it .  people don   t want to know what   s really going to happen  only that it   s going to be nice .  but witches don   t add sugar .    unfortunately the spring on miss tick   s stealth hat had gone wrong while she was walking down the main street and the point had popped up .  even miss tick hadn   t been able to talk her way out of that one .  oh well  she   d have to make other arrangements now .  witch finding was always dangerous .  you had to do it  though .  a witch growing up all alone was a sad and dangerous child    .   she stopped  and stared at the fire .  why had she just thought about tiffany aching .  why now .   working quickly  she emptied her pockets and started a shamble .   shambles worked .  that was about all you could say about them for certain .  you made them out of some string and a couple of sticks and anything you had in your pocket at the time .  they were a witch   s equivalent of those knives with fifteen blades and three screwdrivers and a tiny magnifying glass and a thing for extracting earwax from chickens .   you couldn   t even say precisely what they did  although miss tick thought they were a way of finding out what things the hidden bits of your own mind somehow knew .  you had to make a shamble from scratch every time  and only from things in your pockets .  there was no harm in having interesting things in your pockets  though  just in case .   after less than a minute miss tick had crafted a shamble out of       one twelve inch ruler    one bootlace    one piece of secondhand string    some black thread    one pencil    one pencil sharpener    a small stone with a hole in it    a matchbox containing a mealworm called roger  along with a scrap of bread for him to eat  because every shamble must contain something living    about half a packet of mrs .  sheergold   s lubricated throat lozenges    a button      it looked like a cat   s cradle  or maybe the tangled strings of a very strange puppet .   miss tick stared at it  waiting for it to read her .  then the ruler swung around  the throat sweets exploded in a little cloud of red dust  the pencil shot away and stuck in miss tick   s hat  and the ruler was covered in frost .   that was not supposed to happen .       miss treason sat downstairs in her cottage and watched tiffany sleeping in the low bedroom above her .  she did this through a mouse  which was sitting on the tarnished brass bedstead .  beyond the gray windows  miss treason hadn   t bothered to clean them for fifty three years  and tiffany hadn   t been able to shift all the dirt   the wind howled among the trees  even though it was mid afternoon .   he   s looking for her  she thought as she fed a piece of ancient cheese to another mouse on her lap .  but he won   t find her .  she is safe here .   then the mouse looked up from the cheese .  it had heard something .      i told yez .  she   s here somewhere  fellas .         i dinna see why we canna just talk tae the ol    hag .  we get along fine wi    hags .         mebbe  but this one is a terrrrrible piece o    work .  they say she   s got a fearsome demon in her tattie cellar .      miss treason looked puzzled .     them .     she whispered to herself .  the voices were coming from beneath the floor .  she sent the mouse scurrying across the boards and into a hole .      i dinna want to disappoint ye  but we   s in a cellar right here  and it   s full o    tatties .      after a while a voice said     so where izzit .         mebbe it   s got the day off .         what   s a demon need a day off for .         tae gae an    see its ol    mam an    dad  mebbe .         oh  aye .  demons have mams  do they .         crivens .  will ye lot stop arguin    .  she might hear us .         nae  she   s blind as a bat and deaf as a post  they say .      mice have very good hearing .  miss treason smiled as the hurrying mouse came out in the rough old stone wall of the cellar  near the floor .   she looked through its eyes .  it could see quite well in the gloom  too .   a small group of little men was creeping across the floor .  their skins were blue and covered with tattoos and dirt .  they all wore very grubby kilts  and each one had a sword  as big as he was  strapped to his back .  and they all had red hair  a real orange red  with scruffy pigtails .  one of them wore a rabbit skull as a helmet .  it would have been more scary if it hadn   t kept sliding over his eyes .   in the room above  miss treason smiled again .  so they   d heard of miss treason .  but they hadn   t heard enough .   as the four little men squirmed through an old rat hole to get out of the cellar  they were watched by two more mice  three different beetles  and a moth .  they tiptoed carefully across the floor  past an old witch who was clearly asleep   right up until she banged on the arms of her chair and bellowed      jings .  i see you there  ye wee schemies .      the feegles reacted in instant panic  colliding with one another in shock and awe .      i dinna remember tellin    ye tae move .     shouted miss treason  grinning horribly .      oh  waily  waily  waily .  she   s got the knowin    o    the speakin    .     someone sobbed .      ye   re nac mac feegles  right .  but i dinna ken the clan markin   s .  calm doon  i ain   t gonna deep fry ye .  you .  what   s your name .         ah   m rob anybody  big man o    the chalk hill clan     said the one with the rabbit skull helmet .     and           aye .  big man  are ye .  then ye   ll do me the courtesy an    tak    off yon bony bonnet ere ye speak tae me .     said miss treason  enjoying herself no end .     an    stannit up straight .  i will have nae slouchin    in this hoose .      instantly all four feegles stood to rigid attention .      right .     said miss treason .     an    who are the rest o    yez .         this is my brother daft wullie  miss     said rob anybody  shaking the shoulder of the feegle who was an instant wailer .  he was staring in horror at enochi and athootita .      an    the other two of you   i mean  twa    o    ye .     said miss treason .     you  there .  i mean ye .  ye have the mousepipes .  are ye a gonnagle .         aye  mistress     said a feegle who looked neater and cleaner than the others  although it had to be said that there were things living under old logs that were cleaner and neater than daft wullie .      and your name is    .         awf   ly wee billy bigchin  mistress .         you   re staring hard at me  awf   ly wee billy bigchin     said miss treason .     are ye afraid .         no  mistress .  i wuz admirin    ye .  it does my heart good tae see a witch so   witchy .         it does  does it .     said miss treason suspiciously .     are ye sure ye   re no    afraid o    me  mr .  billy bigchin .         no  mistress .  but i will be if it makes ye happy     said billy carefully .      hah .     said miss treason .     well  i see we have   hae a clever one here .  who is your big friend  mr .  billy .      billy elbowed big yan in the ribs .  despite his size  which for a feegle was huge  he was looking very nervous .  like a lot of people with big muscles  he got edgy about people who were strong in other ways .      he   s big yan  mistress     billy bigchin supplied  while big yan stared at his feet .      i see he   s got a necklace o    big teeth     said miss treason .     human teeth .         aye  mistress .  four  mistress .  one for every man he   s knocked out .         are you talking about human men .     asked miss treason in astonishment .      aye  mistress     said billy .     mostly he drops on    em heidfirst oot o    a tree .  he has a verra tough heid     he added  in case this wasn   t clear .   miss treason sat back .     and now you will kindly explain why ye were creepin    aboot here in my hoose     she said .     come along  now .      there was a tiny  tiny pause before rob anybody said happily     oh  weel  that   s easy .  we wuz huntin    the haggis .         no  you weren   t     said miss treason sharply     because a haggis is a pudding of sheep   s offal and meat  well spiced and cooked in a sheep   s stomach .         ah  that is only when ye canna find the real thing  mistress     said rob anybody carefully .        tis no    a patch on the real thing .  oh  a canny beast is the haggis  which makes its burrows in tattie cellars    .         and that   s the truth .  you were hunting the haggis .  is it  daft wullie .     said miss treason  her voice suddenly sharp .  all eyes  including a pair belonging to an earwig  turned to the luckless wullie .      er   aye   oooh   aarg   waily  waily  waily .     moaned daft wullie  and dropped to his knees .     please dinna do somethin    horrible tae me  mistress .     he begged .     yon earwiggy is givin    me a dreadful look .         very well  we shall start again     said miss treason .  she reached up and tore off her blindfold .  the feegles stepped back as she touched the skulls on either side of her .      i do not need eyes to smell a lie when it comes calling     she said .     tell me why you are here .  tell me   again .      rob anybody hesitated for a moment .  this was  in the circumstances  very brave of him .  then he said        tis aboot the big wee hag  mistress  we came .         the big wee   oh  you mean tiffany .         aye .         we is under one o    them big birds     said daft wullie  keeping his eyes averted from the witch   s blind stare .      he means a geas  mistress     said rob anybody  glaring at his brother .     it   s like a              a tremendous obligation that you cannot disobey     said miss treason .     i ken what a geas is .  but why .      miss treason had heard a lot of things in     years  but now she listened in astonishment to a story about a human girl who had  for a few days at least  been the kelda of a clan of nac mac feegles .  and if you were their kelda  even for a few days  they   d watch over you   forever .      an    she   s the hag o    our hills     said billy bigchin .     she cares for them  keeps them safe .  but        he hesitated  and rob anybody continued     our kelda is havin    dreams .  dreams o    the future .  dreams o    the hills all froze an    everyone deid an    the big wee hag wearin    a crown o    ice .         my goodness .         aye  an    there wuz more .     said billy  throwing out his arms .     she saw a green tree growin    in a land o    ice .  she saw a ring o    iron .  she saw a man with a nail in his heart .  she saw a plague o    chickens an    a cheese that walks like a man .      there was silence  and then miss treason said     the first two  the tree and the ring  no problem there  good occult symbolism .  the nail  too  very metaphorical .  i   m a bit doubtful about the cheese   could she mean horace .    and the chickens   i   m not sure you can have a plague of chickens  can you .         jeannie wuz verra firm about them     said rob anybody .     she   s dreamed many strange and worryin    things  so we thought we might just see how the big wee hag wuz gettin    along .      miss treason   s various eyes stared at him .  rob anybody stared back with an expression of ferocious honesty  and did not flinch .      this seems an honorable enterprise     she said .     why start by lying .         oh  the lie wuz goin    tae be a lot more interestin        said rob anybody .      the truth of the matter seems quite interesting to me     said miss treason .      mebbe  but i wuz plannin    on puttin    in giants an    pirates an    magic weasels     rob declared .     real value for the money .         oh well     said miss treason .     when miss tick brought tiffany to me  she did say she was guarded by strange powers .         aye     said rob anybody proudly .     that   d be us  right enough .         but miss tick is a rather bossy woman     said miss treason .     i am sorry to say i didn   t listen much to what she said .  she is always telling me that these girls are really keen to learn  but mostly they are just flibbertigibbets who want to be a witch to impress the young men  and they run away after a few days .  this one doesn   t  oh no .  she runs toward things .  did you know she tried to dance with the wintersmith .  .         aye .  we ken .  we were there     said rob anybody .      you were .         aye .  we followed yez .         no one saw you there .  i would have known if they did     miss treason said .      aye .  weel  we   re good at no one seein    us     said rob anybody  smiling .     it   s amazin     the people who dinna see us .         she actually tried to dance with the wintersmith     miss treason repeated .     i told her not to .         ach  people   re always tellin    us not tae do things     said rob anybody .     that   s how we ken what   s the most interestin    things tae do .      miss treason stared at him with the eyes of one mouse  two ravens  several moths  and an earwig .      indeed     she said  and sighed .     yes .  the trouble with being this old  you know  is that being young is so far away from me now that it seems sometimes that it happened to someone else .  a long life is not what it   s cracked up to be  that is a fact .  it           the wintersmith is seekin    for the big wee hag  mistress     said rob anybody .     we saw her dancin    wi    the wintersmith .  now he is seekin    her .  we can hear him in the howl o    the wind .         i know     said miss treason .  she stopped  and listened for a moment .     the wind has dropped     she stated .     he   s found her .      she snatched up her walking sticks and scuttled toward the stairs  going up them with amazing speed .  feegles swarmed past her into the bedroom  where tiffany lay on a narrow bed .   a candle burned in a saucer at each corner of the room .      but how has he found her .     miss treason demanded .     i had her hidden .  you  blue men  fetch wood now .     she glared at them .     i said fetch        she heard a couple of thumps .  dust was settling .  the feegles were watching miss treason expectantly .  and sticks  a lot of sticks  were piled in the tiny bedroom fireplace .      ye did well     she said .     an    not tae soon .      snowflakes were drifting down the chimney .   miss treason crossed her walking sticks in front of her and stamped her foot hard .      wood burn  fire blaze .     she shouted .  the wood in the grate burst into flame .  but now frost was forming on the window  ferny white tendrils snapping across the glass with a crackling sound .      i am not putting up with this at my age .     said the witch .   tiffany opened her eyes  and said     what   s happening .          chapter three      the secret of boffo      it is not good  being in a sandwich of bewildered dancers .  they were heavy men .  tiffany was aching all over .  she was covered in bruises  including one the shape of a boot that she wasn   t going to show to anyone .   feegles filled every flat surface in miss treason   s weaving room .  she was working at her loom with her back to the room because  she said  this helped her think  but since she was miss treason  her position didn   t matter much .  there were plenty of eyes and ears she could use  after all .  the fire burned hot  and there were candles everywhere .  black ones  of course .   tiffany was angry .  miss treason hadn   t shouted  hadn   t even raised her voice .  she   d just sighed and said    foolish child     which was a whole lot worse  mostly because that   s just what tiffany knew she   d been .  one of the dancers had helped bring her back to the cottage .  she couldn   t remember anything about that at all .   a witch didn   t do things because they seemed a good idea at the time .  that was practically cackling .  you had to deal every day with people who were foolish and lazy and untruthful and downright unpleasant  and you could certainly end up thinking that the world would be considerably improved if you gave them a slap .  but you didn   t because  as miss tick had once explained  a  it would make the world a better place for only a very short time  b  it would then make the world a slightly worse place  and c  you   re not supposed to be as stupid as they are .   her feet had moved  and she   d listened to them .  she ought to have been listening to her head .  now she had to sit by miss treason   s fire with a tin hot water bottle on her lap and a shawl around her .      so the wintersmith is a kind of god .     she said .      that kind o    thing  yes     said billy bigchin .     but not the prayin    to kinda god .  he just   makes winters .  it   s his job  ye ken .         he   s an elemental     said miss treason from her loom .      aye     said rob anybody .     gods  elementals  demons  spirits   sometimes it   s hard to tell    em apart wi   oot a map .         and the dance is to welcome winter .     said tiffany .     that doesn   t make sense .  the morris dance is to welcome the coming of the summer  yes  that   s           are you an infant .     said miss treason .     the year is round .  the wheel of the world must spin .  that is why up here they dance the dark morris  to balance it .  they welcome the winter because of the new summer deep inside it .      click clack went the loom .  miss treason was weaving a new cloth  of brown wool .      well  all right     said tiffany .     we welcomed it   him .  that doesn   t mean he   s supposed to come looking for me .         why did you join the dance .     miss treason demanded .      er   there was a space  and           yes .  a space .  a space not intended for you .  not for you  foolish child .  you danced with him  and now he wants to meet such a bold girl .  i have never heard of such a thing .  i want you to fetch the third book from the right on the second shelf from the top of my bookcase .     she handed tiffany a heavy black key .     can you manage to do even that .      witches didn   t need to slap the stupid  not when they had a sharp tongue that was always ready .   miss treason also had several shelves of books  which was unusual for one of the older witches .  the shelves were high up  the books looked big and heavy  and up until now miss treason had forbidden tiffany to dust them  let alone unlock the big black iron band that secured them to the shelves .  people who came here always gave them a nervous look .  books were dangerous .   tiffany unlocked the bands and wiped away the dust .  ah   the books were  like miss treason  not everything they seemed .  they looked like magic books  but they had names like an encyclopaedia of soup .  there was a dictionary .  next to it the book miss treason had asked for was covered in cobwebs .   still blushing with shame and anger  tiffany got the book down  fighting to get it free of the webs .  some of them went pling .  as they snapped  and dust fell off the top of the pages .  when she opened it  it smelled old and parchmenty  like miss treason .  the title  in gold lettering that had almost rubbed away  was chaffinch   s ancient and classical mythology .  it was full of bookmarks .      pages eighteen and nineteen     said miss treason  her head not moving .  tiffany turned to them .         the dacne of the sneasos    .     she said .     is that supposed to be    the dance of the seasons    .         regrettably  the artist  don weizen de yoyo  whose famous masterpiece that was  did not have the same talent with letters as he had with painting     said miss treason .     they worried him  for some reason .  i notice you mention the words before the pictures .  you are a bookish child .      the picture was   strange .  it showed two figures .  tiffany hadn   t seen masquerade costumes .  there wasn   t the money at home for that sort of thing .  but she   d read about them  and this was pretty much what she   d imagined .   the page showed a man and a woman   or  at least  things that looked like a man and a woman .  the woman was labeled    summer    and was tall and blond and beautiful  and therefore to the short  brown haired tiffany was a figure of immediate distrust .  she was carrying what looked like a big basket shaped like a shell  which was full of fruit .   the man     winter     was old and bent and gray .  icicles glittered on his beard .      ach  that   s wha    the wintersmith would look like  sure enough     said rob anybody  strolling across the page .     ol    frosty .         him .     said tiffany .     that   s the wintersmith .  he looks a hundred years old .         a youngster  eh .     said miss treason nastily .      dinna let him kiss ye  or yer nose might turn blue and fall off .     said daft wullie cheerfully .      daft wullie  don   t you dare say things like that .     said tiffany .      i wuz just tryin    to lighten the mood  ye ken     said wullie  looking sheepish .      that   s an artist   s impression  of course     said miss treason .      what does that mean .     said tiffany  staring at the picture .  it was wrong .  she knew it .  this wasn   t what he was like at all    .      it means he made it up     said billy bigchin .     he wouldna ha    seen him  noo  would he .  no one   s seen the wintersmith .         yet .     said daft wullie .      wullie     said rob anybody  turning to his brother     ye ken i told ye aboot makin    tactful remarks .         aye  rob  i ken weel     said wullie obediently .      what ye just said wuz not one o    them     said rob .   wullie hung his head .     sorry  rob .      tiffany clenched her fists .     i didn   t mean all this to happen .      miss treason turned her chair with some solemnity .      then what did you mean .  will you tell me .  did you dance out of youth   s inclination to disobey old age .  to mean is to think .  did you think at all .  others have joined in the dance before now .  children  drunkards  youths for a silly bet   nothing happened .  the spring and autumn dances are   just an old tradition  most people would say .  just a way of marking when ice and fire exchange their dominion over the world .  some of us think we know better .  we think something happens .  for you  the dance became real  and something has happened .  and now the wintersmith is seeking you .         why .     tiffany managed .      i don   t know .  when you were dancing  did you see anything .  hear anything .      how could you describe the feeling of being everywhere and everything .  tiffany wondered .  she didn   t try .      i   thought i heard a voice  or maybe two voices     she mumbled .     er  they asked me who i was .         int ter rest ting     said miss treason .     two voices .  i will consider the implications .  what i can   t understand is how he found you .  i will think about that .  in the meantime  i expect it would be a good idea to wear warm clothing .         aye     said rob anybody     the wintersmith canna abide the heat .  oh  i   ll be forgettin    my ain heid next .  we brought a wee letter from that hollow tree down in the forest .  gi    it to the big wee hag  wullie .  we picked it up on the way past .         a letter .     said tiffany  as the loom clacked behind her and daft wullie began to pull a grubby  rolled up envelope from his spog .      it   s from that wee heap o    jobbies at the castle back hame     rob went on  as his brother hauled .     he says he bides fine and hopes ye do likewise  an    he   s lookin    forward to you bein    back hame soon  an    there   s lots o    stuff about how the ships are doin    an    suchlike  no    verra interestin    in ma opinion  an    he   s writ s .  w .  a .  l .  k .  on the bottom  but we havena worked out what that means yet .         you read my letter .     said tiffany in horror .      oh  aye     said rob with pride .     nae problem .  billy bigchin here gave me a wee hint with some o    the longer words  but it was mostly me  aye .     he beamed  but the grin faded as he watched tiffany   s expression .     ach  i ken you   re a wee bitty upset that we opened yon envelope thingy     he explained .     but that   s okay     cuz we glued it up again wi    slug .  ye wouldna ever know it   d been read .      he coughed  because tiffany was still glaring at him .  all women were a bit scary to the feegles  and witches were the worst .  at last  when he was really nervous  tiffany said     how did you know where that letter would be .      she glanced sideways at daft wullie .  he was chewing the edge of his kilt .  he only ever did this when he was frightened .      er   would you accept a wee bittie lie .     rob said .      no .         it   s interestin    .  there   s dragons an    unicorns in it           no .  i want the truth .         ach  it   s so boring .  we go to the baron   s castle an    read the letters ye sent him  an     an    ye said the postman knows to leave letters tae you in the hollow tree by the waterfall     said rob .   if the wintersmith had got into the cottage  the air couldn   t have been any colder .      he keeps the letters fra    ye in a box under his       rob began  and then shut his eyes as tiffany   s patience parted with a twang even louder than miss treason   s strange cobwebs .      don   t you know it   s wrong to read other people   s letters .     she demanded .      er       rob anybody began .      and you broke into the baron   s cast           ah  ah  ah  no  no  no .     said rob  jumping up and down .     ye canna get us on that one .  we just walked in through one of them little wee slits for the firin    o    the arrows           and then you read my personal letters sent personally to roland .     said tiffany .     they were personal .         oh  aye     said rob anybody .     but dinna fash yersel      we willna tell anyone what was in    em .         we ne   er tell a soul what   s in yer diary  after all     said daft wullie .     not e   en the bits wi    the flowers ye draw aroound them .      miss treason is grinning to herself behind me  tiffany thought .  i just know she is .  but she   d run out of nasty tones of voice .  you did that after talking to the feegles for any length of time .   you were their kelda  her second thoughts reminded her .  they think they have a solemn duty to protect you .  it doesn   t matter what you think .  they   re going to make your life sooo complicated .      don   t read my letters     she said     and don   t read my diary  either .         okay     said rob anybody .      promise .         oh  aye .         but you promised last time .         oh  aye .         cross your heart and hope to die .         oh  aye  nae problemo .         and that   s the promise of an untrustworthy  lying  stealing feegle  is it .     said miss treason .     because ye believe ye   re deid already  do ye no    .  that   s what ye people think  right .         oh  aye  mistress     said rob anybody .     thank ye for drawin    ma attention tae that .         in fact  rob anybody  ye ha    nae intention o    keepin    any promise at all .         aye  mistress     said rob proudly .     not puir wee weak promises like that .  becuz  ye see     tis oor solemn destiny to guard the big wee hag .  we mus    lay doon oor lives for her if it comes to it .         how can ye do that when ye   re deid already .     said miss treason sharply .      that   s a bit o    a puzzler  right enough     said rob     so probably we   ll lay doon the lives o    any scunners who do wrong by her .      tiffany gave up and sighed .     i   m almost thirteen     she said .     i can look after myself .         hark at miss self reliant     said miss treason  but not in a particularly nasty way .     against the wintersmith .         what does he want .     said tiffany .      i told you .  perhaps he wants to find out what kind of girl was so forward as to dance with him .     said miss treason .      it was my feet .  i said i didn   t mean to .      miss treason turned around in her chair .  how many eyes is she using .  tiffany   s second thoughts wondered .  the feegles .  the ravens .  the mice .  all of them .  how many of me is she seeing .  is she watching me with mice  or insects with dozens of glittery eyes .      oh  that   s all right then     said miss treason .     once again  you didn   t mean it .  a witch takes responsibility .  have you learned nothing  child .      child .  that was a terrible thing to say to anyone who was almost thirteen .  tiffany felt herself going red again .  the horrible hotness spread inside her head .   that was why she walked across the room  opened the front door  and stepped outside .   a fluffy snow was falling  very gently .  when tiffany looked into the pale gray sky  she saw the flakes drifting down in soft  feathery clusters  it was the kind of snow that people back home on the chalk called    granny aching shearing her sheep .      tiffany felt the flakes melting on her hair as she walked away from the cottage .  miss treason was shouting from the doorway  but she walked on  letting the snow cool her blushes .   of course this is stupid  she told herself .  but being a witch is stupid .  why do we do it .  it   s hard work for not much reward .  what   s a good day for miss treason .  when someone brings her a secondhand pair of old boots that fit properly .  what does she know about anything .   where is the wintersmith  then .  is he here .  i   ve only got miss treason   s word for it .  that and a made up picture in a book .      wintersmith .     she shouted .   you could hear the snow falling .  it made a strange little noise  like a faint  cold sizzle .      wintersmith .      there was no reply .   well  what had she expected .  a big booming voice .  mr .  spiky the icicle man .  there was nothing but the softness of white snow falling patiently among dark trees .   she felt a bit silly now  but satisfied  too .  this was what a witch did .  she faced what she was afraid of  and then it held no more fear .  she was good at this .   she turned   and saw the wintersmith .   remember this  said her third thoughts  cutting in .  every little detail is important .   the wintersmith was      nothing .  but the snow outlined him .  it flowed around him in lines  as if traveling on an invisible skin .  he was just a shape  and nothing more  except perhaps for two tiny pale purple gray dots in the air  where you might expect to find eyes .   tiffany stood still  her mind frozen  her body waiting to be told what to do .   the hand made of falling snow was reaching toward her now  but very slowly  as you would reach out toward an animal you do not want to frighten .  there was   something  some strange sense of things unsaid because there was no voice to say them  a sense of striving  as if the thing were putting heart and soul into this moment  even if it did not know the meaning of heart or soul .   the hand stopped about a foot away from her .  it was formed into a fist  and now it turned over and the fingers opened .   something gleamed .  it was the white horse  made of silver  on a fine silver chain .   tiffany   s hand flew to her throat .  but she   d had it on last night .  before she went   to   watch   the   dance    .   it must have come off .  and he   d found it .   that   s interesting  said her third thoughts that busied themselves with the world in their own way .  you can   t see what   s hidden inside an invisible fist .  how does that work .  and why are those little purple gray blurs in the air where you   d expect to find eyes .  why aren   t they invisible .   that   s third thoughts for you .  when a huge rock is going to land on your head  they   re the thoughts that think  is that an igneous rock  such as granite  or is it sandstone .   that part of tiffany   s brain that was a little less precise at the moment watched the silver horse dangle on its chain .   her first thought was  take it .   her second thought was  don   t take it .  it   s a trap .   her third thought was  really don   t take it .  it will be colder than you can imagine .   and then the rest of her overruled the thoughts entirely and said  take it .  it   s part of who you are .  take it .  when you hold it  you think of home .  take it .   she held out her right hand .   the horse dropped into it .  instinctively she closed her fingers over it .  it was indeed colder than she could have imagined  and it burned .   she screamed .  the wintersmith   s snowy outline became a flurry of flakes .  the snow around her feet erupted with a cry of    crivens .     as a mass of feegles grabbed her feet and carried her  upright  across the clearing and back in through the cottage   s doorway .   tiffany forced her hand open and  with trembling fingers  pulled the silver horse off her palm .  it left a perfect print  a white horse on pink flesh .  it wasn   t a burn  it was a   freeze .   miss treason   s chair rumbled around on its wheels .      come here  child     she ordered .   still clasping her hand  trying to force back the tears  tiffany walked over to her .      stand right here by my chair  this instant .      tiffany did so .  this was no time to be disobedient .      i wish to look in your ear     said miss treason .     brush your hair aside .      tiffany held back her hair  and winced when she heard the tickle of mouse whiskers .  then the creature was taken away .      ah  i am surprised     said miss treason .     i can see nothing .         er   what were you expecting to see .     tiffany ventured .      daylight .     snapped miss treason  so loudly that the mouse scuttled away .     have you no brains at all  child .         ah dunno if anyone is interested     said rob anybody     but i think yon wintersmith has offskied .  an    it   s stopped snowin    .      no one was listening .  when witches row  they concentrate .      it was mine .         a trinket .         no .         o    course  this may not be the best time tae tell ye       rob went on  miserably .      you think you need it to be a witch .         yes .         a witch needs no devices .         you   ve used shambles .         used  yes .  don   t need .  not need .         ah mean  it   s quite meltin    awa       rob said  smiling nervously .   anger grabbed tiffany   s tongue .  how dare this stupid old crone talk about not needing things .      boffo .     she shouted .     boffo  boffo  boffo .      silence slammed down .  after a while miss treason looked past tiffany and said     ye wee feegle schemies .  get oot o    here right noo .  ah   ll ken it if ye don   t .  this is hag business .      the room filled with a sort of whooshing noise  and the door to the kitchen slammed shut .      so     said miss treason     you know about boffo  do you .         yes     said tiffany  breathing heavily .     i do .         very well .  and have you told anyone    .     miss treason paused and raised a finger to her lips .  then she banged a stick on the floor .     ah said get oot  ye scunners .  off intae the woods w    ye .  check that he   s really gang awa    .  i   ll see yer guilt through yer own een if ye defy me .      from below there was the sound of a lot of potatoes rumbling as the feegles scrambled out through the little ventilation grill .      now they   ve gone     said miss treason .     they   ll stay gone  too .  boffo will see to that .      somehow  in the space of a few seconds  miss treason had become more human and a lot less scary .  well   slightly less scary .      how did you find out .  did you go looking for it .  did you go prowling and rummaging .     said miss treason .      no .  i   m not like that .  i found out by accident one day when you were having a nap .     tiffany rubbed her hand .      does that hurt a lot .     said miss treason  leaning forward .  she might be blind  but   like all the senior witches who knew what they were doing   she noticed everything .      no  not now .  it did  though .  look  i           then you will learn to listen .  do you think the wintersmith has gone .         he just seemed to vanish   i mean  vanish even more .  i think he just wanted to give me back my necklace .         do you think that is the sort of thing the spirit of winter  who commands the blizzard and the frost  would really do .         i don   t know  miss treason .  he   s the only one i   ve met .         you danced with him .         i didn   t know i was going to .         nevertheless .      tiffany waited  and then said     nevertheless what .         just general neverthelessness .  the little horse led him to you .  but he   s not here now   you   re right about that .  i   d know if he was .      tiffany walked up to the front door  hesitated for just a moment  and then opened it and went out into the clearing .  there was a bit of snow here and there  but the day was turning into just another one of those gray skyed winter days .   i   d know if he was  too  she thought .  and he isn   t .  and her second thoughts said  oh .  how do you know .      we   ve both touched the horse     she said under her breath .   she looked around at the empty branches and the sleeping trees  fiddling with the silver chain in her hand .  the forests were curling in on themselves  ready for the winter .   he   s out there  but not close .  he must be very busy  with a whole winter to make    .   she said     thank you .     automatically  because her mother had always said that politeness costs nothing  and went back in .  it was very hot inside now  but miss treason always had a huge log pile built by the secret of boffo .  the local woodcutters always kept the pile high .  a chilly witch might get nasty .      i should like a cup of black tea     said the old woman as tiffany walked in  looking thoughtful .   she waited until tiffany was washing out the cup  then said     have you heard the stories about me  child .     the voice was kindly .  there had been shouts  there had been things said that might have been better put  there had been temper and defiance .  but they were there together  with nowhere else to go .  the quiet voice was a peace offering  and tiffany was glad of it .      er  that you have a demon in the cellar .     tiffany answered  her mind still full of puzzles .     and you eat spiders .  and get visited by kings and princes .  and that any flower planted in your garden blooms black .         oh  do they say so .     said miss treason  looking delighted .     i haven   t heard that last one .  how nice .  and did you hear that i walk around at night in the dark time of the year and reward those who have been good citizens with a purse of silver .  but if they have been bad  i slit open their bellies with my thumbnail like this .      tiffany leaped backward as a wrinkled hand twisted her around and miss treason   s yellow thumbnail scythed past her stomach .  the old woman looked terrifying .      no .  no  i haven   t heard that one .     she gasped  pressing up against the sink .      what .  and it was a wonderful story  with real historical antecedents .     said miss treason  her vicious scowl becoming a smile .     and the one about me having a cow   s tail .         a cow   s tail .  no .         really .  how very vexing     said miss treason  lowering her finger .     i fear the art of storytelling has got into a pretty bad way in these parts .  i really shall have to do something .         this is just another kind of boffo  right .     said tiffany .  she wasn   t totally sure .  miss treason had looked pretty scary with that thumbnail .  no wonder girls left so quickly .      ah  you do have a brain  after all .  of course it is .  boffo  yes .  a good name for it .  boffo  indeed .  the art of expectations .  show people what they want to see  show    em what they think should be there .  i have a reputation to keep up  after all .      boffo  tiffany thought .  boffo  boffo  boffo .   she went over to the skulls  picked one up  and read the label underneath  just like she   d done a month ago       ghastly skull no .    price    .     the boffo novelty   joke shop  no .     tenth egg street  ankh morpork     if it   s a laugh   it   s a boffo .             very lifelike  aren   t they     said miss treason  clicking back to her chair     if you can say that about a skull  of course .  the shop sold a wonderful machine for making spiderwebs .  you poured in this sticky stuff  d   you see  and with practice quite good webs could be made .  can   t abide creepy crawlies  but of course i   ve got to have the webs .  did you notice the dead flies .         yes     said tiffany  glancing up .     they   re raisins .  i thought you had vegetarian spiders .         well done .  nothing wrong with your eyes  at least .  i got my hat from there  too .     wicked old witch number three  a must for scary parties     i think it was .  i   ve still got their catalogue somewhere  if you   re interested .         do all witches buy from boffo .     asked tiffany .      only me  at least around here .  oh  and i believe old mistress breathless over in two falls used to buy warts from there .         but   why .     said tiffany .      she couldn   t grow them .  just couldn   t grow them at all  poor woman .  tried everything .  face like a baby   s bottom  her whole life .         no  i meant  why do you want to seem so      tiffany hesitated  and went on      awful .         i have my reasons     said miss treason .      but you don   t do those things the stories say you do  do you .  kings and princes don   t come to consult you  do they .         no  but they might     said miss treason stoutly .     if they got lost  for example .  oh  i know all about those stories .  i made up most of them .         you made up stories about yourself .         oh  yes .  of course .  why not .  i couldn   t leave something as important as that to amateurs .         but people say you can see a man   s soul .      miss treason chuckled .     yes .  didn   t make that one up .  but i   ll tell you  for some of my parishioners i   d need a magnifying glass .  i see what they see  i hear with their ears .  i knew their fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers .  i know the rumors and the secrets and the stories and the truths .  and i am justice to them  and i am fair .  look at me .  see me .      tiffany looked   and looked past the black cloak and the skulls and the rubber cobwebs and the black flowers and the blindfold and the stories  and saw a little deaf and blind old lady .   boffo made the difference   not just the silly party stuff  but boffo thinking   the rumors and the stories .  miss treason had power because people thought she did .  it was like the standard witch   s hat .  but miss treason was taking boffo much  much further .      a witch needs no devices  miss treason     tiffany said .      don   t get smart with me  child .  didn   t the girl weatherwax tell you all this .  oh  yes  you don   t need a wand or a shamble or even a pointy hat to be a witch .  but it helps a witch to put on a show .  people expect it .  they   ll believe in you .  i didn   t get where i am today by wearing a woolly bobble hat and a gingham apron .  i look the part .  i        there was a crash from outside  in the direction of the dairy .      our little blue friends .     said miss treason  raising her eyebrows .      no  they   re absolutely forbidden to go into any dairy i work in     tiffany began  heading for the door .     oh dear  i hope it   s not horace           i told you he   d be nothing but trouble  did i not .     miss treason shouted as tiffany hurried away .   it was horace .  he   d squeezed out of his cage again .  he could make himself quite runny when he wanted to .   there was a broken butter dish on the floor  but although it had been full of butter  there was none there now .  there was just a greasy patch .   and  from the darkness under the sink  there came a sort of high speed grumbling noise  a kind of mnnamnamnam    .      oh  you   re after butter now  are you  horace .     said tiffany  picking up the dairy broom .     that   s practically cannibalism  you know .      still  it was better than mice  she had to admit .  finding little piles of mouse bones on the floor was a bit distressing .  even miss treason had not been able to work that one out .  a mouse she happened to be looking through would be trying to get at the cheeses and then it would all go dark .   that was because horace was a cheese .   tiffany knew that lancre blue cheeses were always a bit on the lively side  and sometimes had to be nailed down  but   well  she was highly skilled at cheese making  even though she said it herself  and horace was definitely a champion .  the famous blue streaks that gave the variety its wonderful color were really pretty  although tiffany wasn   t sure they should glow in the dark .   she prodded the shadows with the end of the broom .  there was a crack  and when she pulled the stick out again  two inches were missing from the end .  then there was a ptooi .  noise and the missing piece of handle bounced off the wall on the other side of the room .      no more milk for you  then     said tiffany  straightening up  and she thought   he came to give me the horse back .  the wintersmith did that .   um     that is quite   impressive  when you think about it .   i mean  he   s got to organize avalanches and gales and come up with new shapes for snowflakes and everything  but he spared a bit of time just to come and give me my necklace back .  um     and he just stood there .   and then he just vanished   i mean vanished even more .   um     she left horace muttering under the sink and made tea for miss treason  who was back at her weaving .  then she quietly went up to her room .   tiffany   s diary was three inches thick .  annagramma  another local trainee witch and one of her friends  more or less   said that she should really call it her book of shadows and write it on vellum using one of the special magical inks sold at zakzak stronginthearm   s magical emporium at popular prices   at least  prices that were popular with zakzak .   tiffany couldn   t afford one .  you could only trade witchcraft   you weren   t supposed to sell it .  miss treason didn   t mind her selling cheeses  but even so paper was expensive up here  and the wandering peddlers never had very much to sell .  they usually had an ounce or two of green copperas  though  which could make a decent ink if you mixed it with crushed oak galls or green walnut shells .   the diary was now as thick as a brick with extra pages tiffany had glued in .  she   d worked out that she could make it last two more years if she wrote small .   on the leather cover she had  with a hot skewer  drawn the words    feegles keep out .  .     it had never worked .  they looked upon that sort of thing as an invitation .  she wrote parts of the diary in code these days .  reading didn   t come naturally to the chalk hill feegles  so surely they   d never get the hang of a code .   she looked around carefully  in any case  and unlocked the huge padlock that secured a chain around the book .  she turned to today   s date  dipped her pen in the ink  and wrote     met t  .      yes  a snowflake would be a good code for the wintersmith .   he just stood there  she thought .   and he ran away because i screamed .   which was a good thing  obviously .   um     but   i wish i hadn   t screamed .   she opened her hand .  the image of the horse was still there  as white as chalk  but there was no pain at all .   tiffany gave a little shiver and pulled herself together .  so .  she had met the spirit of winter .  she was a witch .  it was the sort of thing that sometimes happened .  he   d politely given her back what was hers  and then he   d gone .  there was no call to get soppy about it .  there were things to do .   then she wrote     ltr frm r .      she very carefully opened the letter from roland  which was easy because slug slime isn   t much of a glue .  with any luck she could even reuse the envelope .  she hunched over the letter so that no one could read it over her shoulder .  finally she said     miss treason  will you get out of my face  please .  i need to use my eyeballs privately .      there was a pause and then a mutter from downstairs  and the tickling behind her eyes went away .   it was always   good to get a letter from roland .  yes  they were often about the sheep  and other things of the chalk  and sometimes there   d be a dried flower inside  a harebell or a cowslip .  granny aching wouldn   t have approved of that  she always said that if the hills had wanted people to pick the flowers  they would have grown more of them .   the letters always made her homesick .   one day miss treason had said     this young man who writes to you   is he your beau .     and tiffany had changed the subject until she had time to look up the word in the dictionary and then more time to stop blushing .   roland was   well  the thing about roland was   the main thing about   well  the point was   he was there .   okay  when she   d first really met him  he had been a rather useless  rather stupid lump  but what could you expect .  he   d been the prisoner of the queen of the elves for a year  to start with  fat as butter and half crazy on sugar and despair .  besides  he   d been brought up by a couple of haughty aunts  his father   the baron   being mostly more interested in horses and dogs .   he   d more and less changed since then  more thoughtful  less rowdy  more serious  less stupid .  he   d also had to wear glasses  the first ever seen on the chalk .   and he had a library .  more than a hundred books .  actually  it belonged to the castle  but no one else seemed interested in it .   some of the books were huge and ancient  with wooden covers and huge black letters and colored pictures of strange animals and far off places .  there was waspmire   s book of unusual days  crumberry   s why things are not otherwise  and all but one volume of the ominous encyclopaedia .  roland had been astonished to find that she could read foreign words  and she   d been careful not to tell him it was all done with the help of what remained of dr .  bustle .   the thing was   the fact was   well  who else had they got .  roland couldn   t  just couldn   t have friends among the village kids  what with him being the son of the baron and everything .  but tiffany had the pointy hat now  and that counted for something .  the people of the chalk didn   t like witches much  but she was granny aching   s granddaughter  right .  no tellin    what she   d learned from the ol    girl  up at the shepherding hut .  and they do say she showed those witches up in the mountains what witchin   s all about  eh .  remember the lambing last year .  she prit near brought dead lambs back to life just by lookin    at    em .  and she   s an aching  and they   ve got these hills in their bones .  she   s all right .  she   s ours  see .   and that was fine  except that she didn   t have any old friends anymore .  kids back home who   d been friendly were now   respectful  because of the hat .  there was a kind of wall  as if she   d grown up and they hadn   t .  what could they talk about .  she   d been to places they couldn   t even imagine .  most of them hadn   t even been to twoshirts  which was only half a day away .  and this didn   t worry them at all .  they were going to do the jobs their fathers did  or raise children like their mothers did .  and that was fine  tiffany added hurriedly to herself .  but they hadn   t decided .  it was just happening to them  and they didn   t notice .   it was the same up in the mountains .  the only people of her own age she could actually talk to were other witches in training like annagramma and the rest of the girls .  it was useless trying to have a real conversation with people in the villages  especially the boys .  they just looked down and mumbled and shuffled their feet  like people at home when they had to talk to the baron .   actually  roland did that too  and he went red every time she looked at him .  whenever she visited the castle  or walked on the hills with him  the air was full of complicated silences   just like it had been with the wintersmith .   she read the letter carefully  trying to ignore the grubby feegle fingerprints all over it .  he   d been kind enough to include several spare sheets of paper .   she smoothed one out  very carefully  stared at the wall for a while  and then began to write .   down in the scullery   horace the cheese had come out from behind the slop bucket .  now he was in front of the back door .  if a cheese ever looked thoughtful  horace looked thoughtful now .       in the tiny village of twoshirts  the driver of the mail coach was having a bit of a problem .  a lot of mail from the countryside around twoshirts ended up at the souvenir shop there  which also acted as the post office .   usually the driver just picked up the mailbag  but today there was a difficulty .  he frantically turned over the pages of the book of post office regulations .   miss tick tapped her foot .  this was getting on his nerves .      ah  ah  ah     said the coachman triumphantly .     says here no animals  birds  dragons  or fish .         and which one of them do you think i am .     asked miss tick icily .      ah  well  right  well  human is kind of like animal  right .  i mean  look at monkeys  right .         i have no wish to look at monkeys     said miss tick .     i have seen the sort of things they do .      the coachman clearly spotted that this was a road not to go down  and turned the pages furiously .  then he beamed .      ah  ah  ah .     he said .     how much do you weigh  miss .         two ounces     said miss tick .     which by chance is the maximum weight of a letter that can be sent to the lancre and near hinterland area for ten pence .     she pointed to the two stamps gummed to her lapel .     i have already purchased my stamps .         you never weigh two ounces .     said the coachman .     you   re a hundred and twenty pounds at least .      miss tick sighed .  she   d wanted to avoid this  but twoshirts wasn   t dogbend  after all .  it lived on the highway  it watched the world go past .  she reached up and pressed the button that worked her hat .      would you like me to forget you just said that .     she asked .      why .     said the coachman .   there was a pause while miss tick stared blankly at him .  then she turned her eyes upward .      excuse me     she said .     this is always happening  i   m afraid .  it   s the duckings  you know .  the spring rusts .      she reached up and banged the side of the hat .  the hidden pointy bit shot up  scattering paper flowers .   the coachman   s eyes followed it .     oh     he said .   and the thing about pointy hats was this  the person under one was definitely a witch or a wizard .  oh  someone who wasn   t could probably get a pointy hat and go out wearing it  and they   d be fine right up until the moment when they met a real pointy hat owner .  wizards and witches don   t like impostors .  they also don   t like being kept waiting .      how much do i weigh now  pray .     she asked .      two ounces .     said the coachman quickly .   miss tick smiled .     yes .  and not one scruple more .  a scruple being  of course  a weight of twenty grains  or one twenty fourth of an ounce .  i am in fact   unscrupulous .      she waited to see if this extremely teachery joke was going to get a smile but didn   t mind when it didn   t .  miss tick rather liked being smarter than other people .   she got on the coach .   as the coach climbed up into the mountains  snow started to fall .  miss tick  who knew that no two snowflakes are alike  didn   t pay them any attention .  if she had done so  she   d have felt slightly less smart .       tiffany slept .  a fire glowed in the bedroom grate .  downstairs  miss treason   s loom wove its way through the night    .   small blue figures crept across the bedroom floor and  by forming a feegle pyramid  reached the top of the little table tiffany used as a desk .   tiffany turned over in bed and made a little snfgl noise .  the feegles froze  just for a moment  and then the bedroom door swung gently shut behind them .   a blue blur raised a trail of dust on the narrow stairs  across the loom room floor  out into the scullery  and through a strange cheese shaped hole in the outside door .  from then on it was a trail of disturbed leaves leading deep into the woods  where a small fire burned .  it lit the faces of a horde of feegles  although it may not have wanted to .   the blur stopped and became about six feegles  two of them carrying tiffany   s diary .   they laid it down carefully .      we   re well oot o    that hoose     said big yan .     dija see dem bigjob skulls .  there   s a hag ye wouldna want tae cross in a hurry .         ach  i see she   s got one o    they paddly locks again     said daft wullie  walking around the diary .      rob  i canna help thinkin    that it   s no    right tae read this     said billy bigchin  as rob put his arm into the keyhole .     it   s pers   nal .         she   s oor hag .  what   s pers   nal tae her is pers   nal tae us     said rob matter of factly  fishing around inside the lock .     besides  she must want someone tae read it     cuz she wrote things doon .  nae point in writin    stuff doon if ye dinna want it read .  it   s a sheer waste o    pencil .         mebbe she wanted tae read it hersel        said billy doubtfully .      oh  aye .  why   d she want tae do that .     said rob scornfully .     she already kens what   s in it .  an    jeannie wants tae know what she   s thinkin    aboot the baron   s lad .      there was a click  and the padlock opened .  the assembled feeglehood watched carefully .   rob turned the rustling pages and grinned .      ach  she   s writ here  oh  the dear feegles ha    turned up again     he said .  this met with general applause .      ach  what a kind girl she is tae write that     said billy bigchin .     can i see .      he read  oh dear  the feegles have turned up again .      ah     he said .  billy bigchin had come with jeannie all the way from the long lake clan .  the clan there was more at home with the reading and writing  and since he was the gonnagle  he was expected to be good at both .   the chalk hill feegles  on the other hand  were more at home with the drinkin     stealin     and fightin     and rob anybody was good at all three .  but he   d learned to read and write because jeannie had asked him to .  he did them with a lot more optimism than accuracy  billy knew .  when he was faced with a long sentence  he tended to work out a few words and then have a great big guess .      the art o    readin    is all aboot understandin    whut the wurds is tryin    tae say  right .     said rob .      aye  mebbe     said big yan     but is there any wurd there tae tell us that the big wee hag is sweet on that heap o    jobbies doon in the stone castle .         ye ha    a verra ro mantic nature     said rob .     and the answer is  i canna tell .  they writes some bits o    their letters in them wee codies .  that   s a terrible thing tae do to a reader .  it   s hard enough readin    the normal words  wi   oot somebody jumblin    them all up .         it   ll be a baaaad look oot fra    us all if the big wee hag starts mindin    boys instead o    gettin    the knowin    o    the hagglin        said big yan .      aye  but the boy willna be interested in marryin        said slightly mad angus .      he might be one day     said billy bigchin  who   d made a hobby of watching humans .     most bigjob men get married .         they do .     said a feegle in astonishment .      oh  aye .         they want tae get married .         a lot o    them do  aye     said billy .      so there   s nae more drinkin     stealin     an    fightin    .         hey  ah   m still allowed some drinkin    an    stealin    an    fightin    .     said rob anybody .      aye  rob  but we canna help noticin    ye also have tae do the explainin     too     said daft wullie .   there was a general nodding from the crowd .  to feegles  explaining was a dark art .  it was just so hard .      like  when we come back from drinkin     stealin     an    fightin     jeannie gives ye the pursin    o    the lips     daft wullie went on .   a moan went up from all the feegles     ooooh  save us from the pursin    o    the lips .         an    there   s the foldin    o    the arms     said wullie  because he was even scaring himself .      oooooh  waily  waily  waily  the foldin    o    the arms .     the feegles cried  tearing at their hair .      not tae mention the tappin    o    the feets    .     wullie stopped  not wanting to mention the tappin    o    the feets .      aargh .  oooooh .  no    the tappin    o    the feets .     some of the feegles started to bang their heads on trees .      aye  aye  aye  but     said rob anybody desperately     what youse dinna ken is that this is part o    the hiddlins o    husbandry .      feegles looked at one another .  there was silence except for the creak of a small tree as it fell over .      we never heard o    any sich thing  rob     said big yan .      well  an    ah   m no    surprised .  who   d tell ye .  ye ain   t married .  ye dinna get the po et ic symmi tree o    the whole thing .  gather roound    til i tell ye    .      rob looked around to see if anyone apart from about five hundred feegles was watching him  and went on     see   first ye get the drinkin    an    the fightin    an    the stealin     okay .  an    when you get back tae the mound  it   s time for the tappin    o    the feets           ooooooo .            an    the foldin    o    the arms           aaaargh .            an     o    course  the pursin    o    the lips an    will ye scunners knock it off wi    the groanin    before i starts bangin    heids together .  right .      all the feegles fell silent  except for one      oh  waily  waily  waily .  ohhhhhhh .  aaarrgh .  the pursin      o      the        he stopped and looked around in embarrassment .      daft wullie .     said rob anybody with icy patience .      aye  rob .         ye ken i told yez there wuz times ye should listen to whut i was sayin    .         aye  rob .         that wuz one o    them times .      daft wullie hung his head .     sorry  rob .         aye .  now  where wuz i   oh  aye   we get the lips an    the arms an    the feets  okay .  an    then           it   s time for the explainin    .     said daft wullie .      aye .     snapped rob anybody .     any one o    youse mudlins want to be the one who dares tae do the explainin    .      he looked around .   the feegles shuffled backward .      wi    the kelda a pursin    an    a foldin    an    a tappin        rob went on in a voice of doom     an    that look in her bonny eye that says     this explanation had better be really guid    .  well .  do ye .      by now feegles were crying and chewing the edges of their kilts in terror .      no  rob     they murmured .      no  aye .     said rob anybody triumphantly .     ye wouldna .  that   s because you don   t have the knowin    o    the husbandry .         i heard jeannie say ye come up with explanations no other feegle in all the world would try     said daft wullie admiringly .      aye  that   s quite likely     said rob  swelling with pride .     an    feegles has got a fine tradition o    huge explanations .         she said some of your explainin    is so long an    twisty  by the time ye   ve got to the end  she canna recall how they started     daft wullie went on .      it   s a nat   ral gift   i wouldna wanta boast     said rob  waving his hand modestly .      i can   t see bigjobs bein    good at explainin        said big yan .     they   re verra slow thinkers .         they still get wed  though     said billy bigchin .      aye  and yon boy in the big castle is bein    too friendly wi    the big wee hag     said big yan .     his da is gettin    old an    sick  and soon yon boy will own a big stone castle an    the wee bittie papers that says that he owns the hills .         jeannie   s afeared that if he   s got the wee bittie papers that says he owns the hills     billy bigchin continued     he might go daft and think they belong to him .  an    we know where that   ll lead  right .         aye     said big yan .     plowin    .      it was a dreaded word .  the old baron had once planned to plow a few of the flatter areas of the chalk  because wheat was fetching high prices and there was no money in sheep  but granny aching had been alive then and had changed his mind for him .   but some pastures around the chalk were being plowed up already .  there was money in wheat .  the feegles took it for granted that roland would take to the plow  too .  wasn   t he brought up by a couple of vain  scheming  and unpleasant aunts .      i dinna trust him     said slightly mad angus .     he reads books an    such .  he disna care aboot the land .         aye     said daft wullie     but if he wuz wed tae the big wee hag  he   d no    think o    the plow     cuz the big wee hag would soon gi   e him the pursin    o    the arms           it   s the foldin    o    the arms .     snapped rob anybody .   all the feegles looked around fearfully .      ooooooh  not the foldin    o    th           shut up .     rob yelled .     ah   m ashamed o    yez .  it   s up tae the big wee hag tae marry who she wants tae .  is that no    so  gonnagle .         hmm .     said billy  looking upward .  he caught a snowflake .      i said the big wee hag can wed who she wants  right .      billy was staring at the snowflake .      billy .     said rob .      what .     he said  as if waking up .     oh   yes .  do ye think she wants tae marry the wintersmith .         the wintersmith .     said rob .     he canna marry anyone .  he   s like a spirit   there   s nothin    tae him .         she danced with him .  we saw her     said billy  catching another flake and inspecting it .      just girlish high spirits .  anyway  why should the big wee hag think anything o    the wintersmith .         i have reason tae believe     said the gonnagle slowly  as more flakes danced down     that the wintersmith is thinkin    a lot aboot the big wee hag    .          chapter four      snowflakes      they say that there can never be two snowflakes that are exactly alike  but has anyone checked lately .   snow fell gently in the darkness .  it piled up on rooftops  it kissed its way between the branches of trees  it settled on the forest floor with a gentle sizzle and smelled sharply of tin .   granny weatherwax always checked the snow .  she stood at her doorway  with the candlelight streaming out around her  and caught flakes on the back of a shovel .   the white kitten watched the snowflakes .  that   s all it did .  it didn   t bat them with a paw  it just watched  very intently  each flake spiral down until it landed .  then the kitten would watch it some more  until it was sure the entertainment was over  before it looked up and selected another flake .   it was called you  as in    you .  stop that .     and    you .  get off there .     when it came to names  granny weatherwax didn   t do fancy .   granny looked at the snowflakes and smiled in her not exactly nice way .      come back in  you     she said  and shut the door .   miss tick was shivering by the fire .  it wasn   t very big   just big enough .  however  there was the smell of bacon and pease pudding coming from a small pot on the embers  and beside the small pot was a much larger one from which came the smell of chicken .  miss tick didn   t often get chicken  so she lived in hope .   it had to be said that granny weatherwax and miss tick did not get on well with each other .  senior witches often don   t .  you could tell that they didn   t by the way they were extremely polite all the time .      the snow is early this year  mistress weatherwax     said miss tick .      indeed it is  miss tick     said granny weatherwax .     and so   interesting .  have you looked at it .         i   ve seen snow before  mistress weatherwax     said miss tick .     it was snowing all the way up here .  i had to help push the mail coach .  i saw altogether too much snow .  but what are we going to do about tiffany aching .         nothing  miss tick .  more tea .         she is rather our responsibility .         no .  she   s hers  first and last .  she   s a witch .  she danced the winter dance .  i saw her do it .         i   m sure she didn   t mean to     said miss tick .      how can you dance and not mean it .         she   s young .  the excitement probably ran away with her feet .  she didn   t know what was going on .         she should have found out     said granny weatherwax .     she should have listened .         i   m sure you always did what you were told when you were almost thirteen  mistress weatherwax     said miss tick with just a hint of sarcasm .   granny weatherwax stared at the wall for a moment .     no     she said .     i made mistakes .  but i didn   t make excuses .         i thought you wanted to help the child .         i   ll help her to help herself .  that is my way .  she   s danced into the oldest story there is  and the only way out is through the other end .  the only way  miss tick .      miss tick sighed .  stories  she thought .  granny weatherwax believes the world is all about stories .  oh well  we all have our funny little ways .  except me  obviously .      of course .  it   s just that she   s so   normal     miss tick said aloud .     when you consider what she   s done  i mean .  and she thinks so much .  and now that she   s come to the attention of the wintersmith  well           she fascinates him     said granny weatherwax .      that   s going to be a big problem .         which she will have to solve .         and if she can   t .         then she   s not tiffany aching     said granny weatherwax firmly .     ah  yes  she   s in the story now  but she don   t know it .  look at the snow  miss tick .  they say that no two snowflakes are alike .  how could they know something like that .  oh  they thinks they   re so smart .  i   ve always wanted to catch    em out .  an    i have done .  go outside now  and look at the snow .  look at the snow  miss tick .  every flake the same .          tiffany heard the knocking and opened the tiny bedroom window with difficulty .  snow had built up on the sill  soft and fluffy .      we didna want tae wake ye     said rob anybody     but awf   ly wee billy said you ought tae see this .      tiffany yawned .     what am i looking for .     she muttered .      catch some o    yon flakes     said rob .     no  not on yer hand   they   ll melt tae soon .      in the gloom tiffany felt around for her diary .  it wasn   t there .  she looked on the floor  in case she   d knocked it off .  then a match flared as rob anybody lit a candle  and there was the diary  looking as though it had always been there but  she noticed  also being suspiciously cold to the touch .  rob looked innocent  a sure sign of guilt .   tiffany saved the questions for later and poked the diary out of the window .  flakes settled on it  and she lifted it closer to her eyes .      they look just like any ordin       she began  and then stopped  and then said     oh  no   this must be a trick .         aye .  well  ye could call it that     said rob .     but it   s his trick  ye ken .      tiffany stared at falling flakes drifting in the light of the candle .   every one of them was tiffany aching .  a little  frozen  sparkling tiffany aching .   downstairs  miss treason burst out laughing .       the doorknob on the door to the tower bedroom was rattled angrily .  roland de chumsfanleigh  pronounced chuffley  it wasn   t his fault  carefully paid it no attention .      what are you doing in there  child .     said a muffled voice peevishly .      nothing  aunt danuta     said roland  without turning around from his desk .  one of the advantages of living in a castle was that rooms were easy to lock  his door had three iron locks and two bolts that were as thick as his arm .      your father is calling out for you  you know .     said another voice  with even more peeve .      he whispers  aunt araminta     roland said calmly  carefully writing an address on an envelope .     he only cries out when you set the doctors on him .         it   s for his own good .         he cries out     roland repeated  and then licked the flap on the envelope .   aunt araminta rattled the doorknob again .      you are a very ungrateful child .  you will starve  you know .  we will get the guards to batter this door down .      roland sighed .  the castle had been built by people who did not like to have their doors battered down  and anyone trying to do that here would have to carry the battering ram up a narrow spiral staircase with no room at the top to turn around  and then find a way to knock down a door four planks thick and made of oak timbers so ancient  it was like iron .  one man could defend this room for months  if he had provisions .  he heard some more grumbling outside and then the echo of the aunts    shoes as they went down the tower .  then he heard them screaming at the guards again .   it wouldn   t do them much good .  sergeant roberts and his guards  were edgy about taking orders from the aunts .  everyone knew  though  that if the baron died before the boy was twenty one  the aunts would legally run the estate until he was .  and while the baron was very ill  he was not dead .  it was not a happy time to be a disobedient guard  but the sergeant and his men survived the anger of the aunts by being  when their orders justified it  deaf  stupid  forgetful  confused  ill  lost  or   in the case of kevin   foreign .   for now  roland kept his excursions for the small hours  when no one was around and he could pillage the kitchen .  that   s when he went in to see his father .  the doctors kept the old man dosed with something  but roland held his hand for a while for the comfort that it gave .  if he found jars of wasps or leeches  he threw them into the moat .   he stared at the envelope .  perhaps he ought to tell tiffany about this  but he didn   t like to think about it .  it would worry her and she might try to rescue him again  and that wouldn   t be right .  this was something he had to face .  besides  he wasn   t locked in .  they were locked out .  while he held the tower  there was a place where they couldn   t poke and pry and steal .  he   d got what was left of the silver candlesticks under his bed  along with what remained of the antique silver cutlery     gone to be valued     they   d said  and his mother   s jewel box .  he   d been a bit late finding that  it was missing her wedding ring and the silver and garnet necklace his grandmother had left to her .   but tomorrow he   d get up early and ride over to twoshirts with the letter .  he liked writing them .  they turned the world into a nicer place  because you didn   t have to include the bad bits .   roland sighed .  it would have been nice to tell tiffany that in the library he   d found a book called sieges and survival by the famous general callus tacticus  who invented    tactics     which was interesting  .  who   d have thought such an ancient book could be so useful .  the general had been very firm about having provisions  so roland had plenty of small potatoes  large sausages  and heavy dwarf bread  which was handy to drop on people .   he glanced across the room  where there was a portrait of his mother that he had carried up from the cellar where they had left it     waiting to be cleaned     they said  .  right beside it  if you knew what you were looking for  an area of wall about the size of a small door looked lighter than the rest of the stones .  the candlestick next to it looked slightly lopsided  too .   there were lots of advantages to living in a castle .   outside  it began to snow .       the nac mac feegles peered out at the fluffy flakes from the thatch of miss treason   s cottage .  by the light that managed to leak out from the grubby windows below  they watched the tiny tiffanys whirl past .      say it wi    snowflakes     said big yan .     hah .      daft wullie snatched a spiraling flake .     ye gotta admit he   s done the wee pointy hat really well     he said .     he must like the big wee hag a lot .         it disna make any sense .     said rob anybody .     he   s the winter .  he   s all the snow an    ice an    storms an    frosts .  she   s just a wee big girl .  ye canna say that   s an ideal match .  whut do ye say  billy .  billy .      the gonnagle was chewing the end of his mousepipes while staring at the flakes with a faraway look in his eyes .  but somehow rob   s voice broke into his thoughts  because he said     whut does he ken aboot people .  he   s no    as alive as a wee insect  yet he   s as powerful as the sea .  an    he   s sweet on the big wee hag .  why .  whut can she be tae him .  whut will he do next .  i tell ye this  snowflakes is just the beginning .  we must watch oot  rob .  this may become verra bad    .          up in the mountains                  tiffany achings landed lightly on the old packed snow on a ridge and began an avalanche that carried away more than a hundred trees and a hunting lodge .  this wasn   t tiffany   s fault .   it wasn   t her fault that people slipped on packed layers of her  or couldn   t open the door because she was piled up outside it  or got hit by handfuls of her thrown by small children .  most of her had melted by breakfast time the next day  and besides  no one noticed anything strange except witches who don   t take people   s word for things  and a lot of kids no one listened to .   even so  tiffany woke up feeling very embarrassed .   miss treason didn   t help at all .      at least he likes you     she said while she ferociously wound up her clock .      i wouldn   t know about that  miss treason     said tiffany  really not wanting this conversation at all .  she was washing the dishes at the sink  her back to the old woman  and she was glad that miss treason could not see her face   and  if it came to it  that she couldn   t see miss treason   s face  either .      what will your young man say about it  i wonder .         what young man is that  miss treason .     said tiffany  as stonily as she could manage .      he writes you letters  girl .      and i expect you read them with my eyes  tiffany thought .     roland .  he   s just a friend   sort of     she said .      a sort of friend .      i   m not going into this  tiffany thought .  i bet she   s grinning .  it   s not her business  anyway .      yes     she said     that   s right  miss treason .  a sort of friend .      there was a long silence  which tiffany used to scrub out the bottom of an iron saucepan .      it is important to have friends     said miss treason  in a voice that was somehow smaller than it had been .  it sounded as though tiffany had won .     when you have finished  dear  please be kind enough to fetch me my shamble bag .      tiffany did so  and hurried off into the dairy .  it was always good to get in there .  it reminded her of home  and she could think better .  she     there was a cheese shaped hole in the bottom of the door  but horace was back in his broken cage  making a very faint mnmnmnmn noise that may have been cheese snores .  she left him alone and dealt with the morning   s milk .   at least it wasn   t snowing .  she felt herself blushing  and tried to stop herself from even thinking about it .   and there was going to be a coven meeting tonight .  would the other girls know .  hah .  of course they would .  witches paid attention to snow  especially if it was going to be embarrassing for somebody .      tiffany .  i wish to speak with you     miss treason called out .   miss treason had hardly ever called her tiffany before .  it was quite worrying to hear her say the name .   miss treason was holding up a shamble .  her seeing eye mouse was dangling awkwardly among the bits of bone and ribbon .      this is so inconvenient     she said  and raised her voice .     ach  ye mudlins .  c   mon oot .  i ken ye   re there .  i can see ye lookin    at me .      feegle heads appeared from behind very nearly everything .      good .  tiffany aching  sit down .      tiffany sat down quickly .      at a time like this  too     said miss treason  laying down the shamble .     this is so inconvenient .  but there is no doubt .     she paused for a moment and said     i will die the day after tomorrow .  on friday  just before half past six in the morning .      it was an impressive statement  and did not deserve this reply     oh  that   s a shame  tae be missin    the weekend like that     said rob anybody .     are ye goin    somewhere nice .         but   but   you can   t die .     tiffany burst out .     you   re a hundred and thirteen years old  miss treason .         you know  that is very probably the reason  child     said miss treason calmly .     didn   t anyone tell you that witches have forewarning when they   re going to die .  anyway  i like a good funeral .         oh aye  ye canna beat a good wake     said rob anybody .     wi    lots o    boozin    an    dancin    an    greetin    an feastin    an    boozin    .         there may be some sweet sherry     said miss treason .     as for feasting  i always say you cannot go far wrong with a ham roll .         but you can   t just       tiffany began  and stopped as miss treason turned her head fast  like a chicken does .         leave you like this .     she said .     is that what you were going to say .         er  no     tiffany lied .      you   ll have to move in with someone else  of course     said miss treason .     you   re not really senior enough to take on a cottage  not when there   s older girls waiting           you know i don   t want to spend my life in the mountains  miss treason     tiffany said quickly .      oh yes  miss tick did tell me     said the old witch .     you want to go back to your little chalk hills .         they   re not little .     tiffany snapped  louder than she   d meant to .      yes  this has been a bit of a trying time all around     said miss treason very calmly .     i shall write some letters  which you will take down to the village  and then you shall have your afternoon off .  we shall hold the funeral tomorrow afternoon .         sorry .  you mean before you die .     said tiffany .      why  of course .  i don   t see why i shouldn   t have some fun .         good thinkin    .     said rob anybody .     that   s the kind o    sensible detail people usually fails tae consider .         we call it a going away party     said miss treason .     just for witches  of course .  other people tend to get a bit nervous   i can   t think why .  and on the bright side  we   ve got that splendid ham that mr .  armbinder gave us last week for settling the ownership of the chestnut tree  and i   d love to try it .          an hour later tiffany set out  with her pockets full of notes to butchers and bakers and farmers in the local villages .   she was a bit surprised at the reception she got .  they seemed to think it was all a joke .      miss treason   s not going to go dying at her time of life     said a butcher  weighing out sausages .     i heard that death   s come for her before and she slammed the door on him .         thirteen dozen sausages  please     said tiffany .     cooked and delivered .         are you sure she   s going to die .     said the butcher  uncertainty clouding his face .      no .  but she is     said tiffany .   and the baker said     don   t you know about that clock of hers .  she had it made when her heart died .  it   s like a clockwork heart  see .         really .     said tiffany .     so if her heart died  and she had a new one made of clockwork  how did she stay alive while the new heart was being made .         oh  that   d be by magic  obviously     said the baker .      but a heart pumps blood  and miss treason   s clock is outside her body     tiffany pointed out .     there   s no   tubes    .         it pumps the blood by magic     said the baker  speaking slowly .  he gave her an odd look .     how can you be a witch if you don   t know this stuff .      it was the same everywhere else .  it was as if the idea of there being no miss treason was the wrong shape to put in anyone   s head .  she was     years old  and they argued that it was practically unheard of for anyone to die aged     .  it was a joke  they said  or she   d got a scroll signed in blood that meant she   d live forever  or you   d have to steal her clock before she   d die  or every time the grim reaper came for her she lied about her name or sent him to another person  or maybe she was just feeling a bit unwell    .   by the time tiffany was finished  she was wondering if it really was going to happen .  yet miss treason had seemed so certain .  and if you were      the amazing thing wasn   t that you were going to die tomorrow but that you were still alive today .   with her head full of gloomy thoughts  she set out to the coven meeting .   once or twice she thought she could feel feegles watching her .  she never knew how she could feel this  it was a talent you learned .  and you learned to put up with it  most of the time .   all the other young witches were there by the time she arrived  and they had even got a fire lit .   some people think that    coven    is a word for a group of witches  and it   s true that   s what the dictionary says .  but the real word for a group of witches is an    argument .      in any case  most of the witches tiffany had met never used the word .  mrs .  earwig did  though  almost all the time .  she was tall and thin and rather chilly  and wore silver spectacles on a little chain  and used words like    avatar    and    sigil .     and annagramma  who ran the coven because she   d invented it and had the tallest hat and sharpest voice  was her star pupil  and her only one  .   granny weatherwax always said that what mrs .  earwig did was wizard magic with a dress on  and annagramma certainly dragged a lot of books and wands along to the meetings .  mostly  the girls did a few ceremonies to keep her quiet  because for them the real purpose of the coven was to see friends  even if they were friends simply because they were  really  the only people you could talk to freely because they had the same problems and would understand what you were moaning about .   they always met out in the woods  even in the snow .  there was always enough wood lying around for a fire  and they all dressed up warm as a matter of course .  even in the summer  comfort on a broomstick at any height meant more layers of underclothing than anyone would dare guess at  and sometimes a couple of hot water bottles held on with string .   at the moment three small fireballs circled the fire .  annagramma had made them .  you could slay enemies with them  she   d said .  they made the others uneasy .  it was wizard magic  showy and dangerous .  witches preferred to cut enemies dead with a look .  there was no sense in killing your enemy .  how would she know you   d won .   dimity hubbub had brought a huge tray of inside out cake .  it was just the thing to put a coating on your ribs against the cold .   tiffany said     miss treason told me she   s going to die on friday morning .  she said she just knows .         that   s a shame     said annagramma in a that   s not really a shame tone of voice .     she was very old  though .         she still is     said tiffany .      um  it   s called the call     said petulia gristle .     old witches know when they   re going to die .  no one knows how it works .  they just do .         has she still got those skulls .     said lucy warbeck  who had her hair piled up on her head with a knife and fork stuck in it .     i couldn   t stand them .  they seemed to be  like  looking at me all the time .         it was her using me as a mirror that made me leave     said lulu darling .     does she still do that .      tiffany sighed .     yes .         i said flatly that i wouldn   t go     said gertruder tiring  poking the fire .     did you know that if you leave a witch without permission  no other witch will take you on  but if you leave miss treason even after only one night  no one says anything about it and they just find you another place .         mrs .  earwig says things like skulls and ravens is going far too far     said annagramma .     everyone around there is literally frightened out of their lives .         um  what   s going to happen to you .     said petulia to tiffany .      i don   t know .  i suppose i   ll go somewhere else .         poor you     said annagramma .     miss treason didn   t say who   ll take over the cottage  by any chance .     she added  as if she   d only just thought of the question .   the sound that followed was the silence made by half a dozen pairs of ears listening so hard they were nearly creaking .  there were not a lot of young witches coming up  it was true  but witches lived a long time  and getting your own cottage was the prize .  that   s when you started getting respect .      no     said tiffany .      not even a hint .         no .         she didn   t say it was going to be you  did she .     said annagramma sharply .  her voice could be really annoying .  it could make    hello    sound like an accusation .      no .         anyway  you   re too young .         actually  there   s no  you know  actual age limit     said lucy warbeck .     nothing written down  anyway .         how do you know that .     annagramma snapped .      i asked old mrs .  pewmire     said lucy .   annagramma   s eyes narrowed .     you asked her .  why .      lucy rolled her eyes .     because i wanted to know  that   s all .  look  everyone knows you   re the oldest and the   you know  most trained .  of course you   ll get the cottage .         yes     said annagramma  watching tiffany .     of course .         that   s  um  sorted out  then     said petulia  more loudly than necessary .     did you have a lot of snow last night .  old mother blackcap said it was unusual .      tiffany thought  oh dear  here we go    .      we often get it this early up here     said lucy .      i thought it was a bit fluffier than usual     said petulia .     quite pretty  if you like that sort of thing .         it was just snow     said annagramma .     hey  did any of you hear what happened to the new girl who started with miss tumult .  ran away screaming after an hour .     she smiled  not very sympathetically .      um  was it the frog .     petulia asked .      no  not the frog .  she didn   t mind the frog .  it was unlucky charlie .         he can be scary     lucy agreed .   and that was it  tiffany realized  as the gossip ran on .  someone who was practically a kind of god had made billions of snowflakes that looked like her   and they hadn   t noticed .    which was a good thing  obviously     of course it was .  the last thing she wanted was teasing and stupid questions  of course .  well  of course        but   well   it would have been nice if they   d known  if they   d said    wow     if they   d been jealous or frightened or impressed .  and she couldn   t tell them  or at least she couldn   t tell annagramma  who   d make a joke of it and almost but not exactly say that she was making it up .   the wintersmith had visited her and been   impressed .  it was a bit sad if the only people who knew about this were miss treason and hundreds of feegles  especially since   she shuddered   by friday morning it would only be known by hundreds of little blue men .   to put it another way  if she didn   t tell someone else who was at least the same size as her and alive  she would burst .   so she told petulia  on the way home .  they had to go the same way  and they both flew so slowly that at night it was easier to walk  since you didn   t hit so many trees .   petulia was plump and reliable and already the best pig witch in the mountains  a fact that means a lot where every family owns a pig .  and miss treason had said that soon the boys would be running after her  because a girl who knows her pigs would never want for a husband .   the only problem with petulia was that she always agreed with you and always said what she thought you wanted to hear .  but tiffany was a bit cruel and just told her all the facts .  she got a few wows  which she was pleased with .   after a while petulia said     that must have been very  um  interesting .     and that was petulia for you .      what shall i do .         um   do you need to do anything .     said petulia .      well  sooner or later people are going to notice that all snowflakes are shaped like me .         um  are you worried that they won   t .     said petulia  so innocently that tiffany laughed .      but i   ve got this feeling that it   s not going to stop with snowflakes .  i mean  he is everything to do with wintertime .         and he ran away when you screamed       said petulia thoughtfully .      that   s right .         and then he did something sort of   silly .         what .         the snowflakes     said petulia helpfully .      well  i wouldn   t say that  exactly     said tiffany  a bit hurt .     not exactly silly .         then it   s all obvious     said petulia .     he   s a boy .         what .         a boy .  you know what they are .     said petulia .     blush  grunt  mumble  wibble .  they   re pretty much all the same .         but he   s millions of years old and he acts like he   s never seen a girl before .         um  i don   t know .  has he ever seen a girl before .         he must have .  what about summer .     said tiffany .     she   s a girl .  well  a woman .  according to a book i   ve seen  anyway .         i suppose all you can do is wait to see what he does next  then .  sorry .  i   ve never had snowflakes made in my honor    .  er  we   re here    .      they   d reached the clearing where miss treason lived  and petulia began to look a bit nervous .      um   all these stories about her       she said  looking at the cottage .     are you all right there .         was one of them about what she can do with her thumbnail .     asked tiffany .      yes .     said petulia  shuddering .      she made that one up .  don   t tell anyone  though .         why would anyone make up a story like that about themselves .      tiffany hesitated .  pigs couldn   t be fooled by boffo  so petulia hadn   t run across it .  and she was amazingly honest  which tiffany was coming to learn was a bit of a drawback in a witch .  it wasn   t that witches were actually dishonest  but they were careful about what kind of truth they told .      i don   t know     she lied .     anyway  you have to cut through quite a lot of a person before anything falls out .  and skin is quite tough .  i don   t think it   s possible .      petulia looked alarmed .     you tried .         i practiced with my thumbnail on a big ham this morning  if that   s what you mean     said tiffany .  you have to check things  she thought .  i heard the story that miss treason has wolf   s teeth  and people tell that to one another even though they   ve seen her .      um   i   ll come and help tomorrow  of course     said petulia  nervously looking at tiffany   s hands in case there were going to be any more thumbnail experiments .     going away parties can be quite jolly  really .  but  um  if i was you  i   d tell mr .  wintersmith to go away .  that   s what i did when davey lummock started getting  um  too romantic .  and i told him that i was  um  walking out with makky weaver   don   t tell the others .         isn   t he the one who talks about pigs all the time .         well  pigs are very interesting     said petulia reproachfully .     and his father  um  has got the biggest pig breeding farm in the mountains .         that   s something worth thinking about  definitely     said tiffany .     ouch .         what happened .     said petulia .      oh  nothing .  my hand really twinged there for a moment .     tiffany rubbed it .     part of the healing  i suppose .  see you tomorrow .      tiffany went indoors .  petulia carried on through the forest .   from up near the roof came the sounds of a conversation .      didja hear what the fat girl said .         aye  but pigs are no    that interestin    .         oh  i dinna ken aboot that .  a verra useful animal is the pig .  you can eat every part o    it  ye ken  except for the squeal .         ach  ye   re wrong there .  ye can use the squeal .         dinna be daft .         aye  ye can so .  ye make up a pie crust  right  an    ye put in a lot o    ham  right  an    then ye catch the squeal  put the top on the pie before he can escape  right  an    bung it straight in the oven .         i ne   er heard o    such a thing as that .         have ye no    .  it   s called squeal and ham pie .         there   s nae such thing .         why not .  there   s bubble and squeak  right .  an    a squeak is wee compared tae a squeal .  i reckon you could           if youse mudlins dinna listen  i   ll put ye inna pie .     yelled rob anybody .  the feegles muttered into silence  and on the other side of the clearing the wintersmith watched with purple gray eyes .  he watched until a candle was lit in an upstairs room  and watched the orange glow until it went out .   then  walking unsteadily on new legs  he went toward the flower patch where  in the summer  roses had grown .       if you went to zakzak stronginthearm   s magical emporium  you   d see crystal balls of all sizes but more or less only one price  which was a great deal of money .  since most witches  and particularly the good ones  had not much money at all  they made use of other things  like the glass floats off old fishing nets or a saucer of black ink .   there was a puddle of black ink on granny weatherwax   s table now .  it had been in the saucer  but things had wobbled a bit when granny and miss tick had banged their heads together trying to look in the saucer at the same time .      did you hear that .     said granny weatherwax .     petulia gristle asked the important question  and she just didn   t think about it .         i   m sorry to say i missed it too     said miss tick .  you  the white kitten  jumped up onto the table  walked carefully through the puddle of ink  and dropped into miss tick   s lap .      stop that  you     said granny weatherwax in a vague sort of way  as miss tick stared down at her dress .      it hardly shows up     said miss tick  but in fact four perfect cat footprints were very clear .  witches    dresses start out black but soon fade to shades of gray because of frequent washings or  in the case of miss tick  regular dips in various ponds and streams .  they got threadbare and ragged  too  and their owners liked that .  it showed you were a working witch  not a witch for show .  four black kitten footprints in the middle of your dress suggested you were a bit wussy  though .  she lowered the cat to the floor  where it trotted over to granny weatherwax  rubbed up against her  and tried to meep more chicken into existence .      what was the important thing .     said miss tick .      i   m asking you as one witch to another  perspicacia tick  has the wintersmith ever met a girl .         well     said miss tick     i suppose the classic representation of summer might be called a           but do they ever meet .     asked granny weatherwax .      in the dance  i suppose .  just for a moment     said miss tick .      and at that moment  that very moment  in dances tiffany aching     said granny weatherwax .     a witch who won   t wear black .  no  it   s blue and green for her  like green grass under a blue sky .  she calls to the strength of her hills  all the time .  an    they calls to her .  hills that was once alive  miss tick .  they feels the rhythm of the dance  an    so in her bones does she  if she did but know it .  and this shapes her life  even here .  she could not help but tap her feet .  the land taps its feet to the dance of the seasons .         but she       miss tick began  because no teacher likes to hear anyone else talk for very long .      what happened in that moment .     granny weatherwax went on  unstoppably .     summer  winter  and tiffany .  one spinning moment .  and then they part .  who knows what got tangled .  suddenly  the wintersmith is acting so stupid  he might even be a wee bit   human .         what has she got herself into .     said miss tick .      the dance  miss tick .  the dance that never ends .  an    she can   t change the steps  not yet .  she has to dance to his tune for a while .         she   s going to be in a lot of danger     miss tick said .      she has the strength of her hills     said granny .      soft hills  though     said miss tick .     easily worn down .         but the heart of the chalk is flint  remember .  it cuts sharper than any knife .         snow can cover the hills     said miss tick .      not forever .         it did once     said miss tick  fed up with playing games .     for thousands of years  at least .  an age of ice .  great beasts wallowed and sneezed across the world .         that   s as may be     said granny weatherwax  a glint in her eye .     o    course  i wasn   t around then .  in the meantime  we must watch our girl .      miss tick sipped her tea .  staying with granny weatherwax was a bit of a trial .  last night   s pot of chicken scraps had turned out to be not for her but for you .  the witches had good thick pease pudding and bacon soup without   and this was important   the bacon .  granny kept a big lump of fat bacon on a string and had taken it out  carefully dried it  and put it away for another day .  despite her hunger  miss tick was impressed .  granny could shave the skin off a second .      i hear that miss treason has heard her call     she said .      yes .  funeral tomorrow     said granny weatherwax .      that   s a difficult steading  over there     said miss tick .     they   ve had miss treason for a long  long time .  it   ll be a tricky task for a new witch .         she   ll be a difficult   act to follow  indeed     said granny weatherwax .      act .     said miss tick .      i meant life  of course     said granny weatherwax .      whom will you put in there .     asked miss tick  because she liked to be first with the news .  she also made a point of saying    whom    whenever she could .  she felt it was more literate .      miss tick  that is not up to me     said granny sharply .     we have no leaders in witchcraft  you know that .         oh indeed     said miss tick  who also knew that the leader the witches did not have was granny weatherwax .     but i know that mrs .  earwig will be proposing young annagramma  and mrs .  earwig has quite a few followers these days .  it   s probably those books she writes .  she makes witchcraft sound exciting .         you know i don   t like witches who try to impose their will on others     said granny weatherwax .      quite     said miss tick  trying not to laugh .      i shall  however  drop a name into the conversation     said granny weatherwax .   with a clang  i expect  thought miss tick .     petulia gristle has shaped up very well     she said .     a good all around witch .         yes  but mostly all around pigs     said granny weatherwax .     i was thinking about tiffany aching .         what .     said miss tick .     don   t you think that child has enough to cope with .      granny weatherwax smiled briefly .     well  miss tick  you know what they say  if you want something done  give it to someone who   s busy .  and young tiffany might be very busy soon     she added .      why do you say that .     said miss tick .      hmm .  well  i can   t be sure  but i will be very interested to see what happens to her feet    .          tiffany didn   t sleep much on the night before the funeral .  miss treason   s loom had clicked and clacked all through the night  because she had an order for bedsheets she wanted to complete .   it was just getting light when tiffany gave up and got up  in that order .  at least she could get the goats mucked out and milked before she tackled the other chores .  there was snow  and a bitter wind was blowing it across the ground .   it wasn   t until she was carting a barrowload of muck to the compost heap  which was steaming gently in the gray light  that she heard the tinkling .  it sounded a bit like the wind chimes miss pullunder had around her cottage  only they were tuned to a note that was uncomfortable for demons .   it was coming from the place where the rose bed was in summer .  it grew fine  old roses  full of scent and so red they were nearly  yes  black .   the roses were blooming again .  but they        how do you like them  sheep girl .     said a voice .  it didn   t arrive in her head  it wasn   t her thoughts  any of them  and dr .  bustle didn   t wake up until at least ten .  it was her own voice  from her own lips .  but she hadn   t thought it  and she hadn   t meant to say it .   now she was running back to the cottage .  she hadn   t decided to do that either  but her legs had taken over .  it wasn   t fear  not exactly  it was just that she very much wanted to be somewhere other than in the garden with the sun not up and the snow blowing and filling the air with ice crystals as fine as fog .   she ran through the scullery door and collided with a dark figure  which said     um  sorry     and therefore was petulia .  she was the kind of person who apologized if you trod on her foot .  right now there was no sight more welcome .      sorry  i was called out to deal with a difficult cow and  um  it wasn   t worth going back to bed     petulia said  and then added     are you all right .  you don   t look it .         i heard a voice in my mouth .     said tiffany .   petulia gave her an odd look and might just have stepped an inch or so backward .      you mean in your head .     she asked .      no .  i can deal with those .  my mouth said words all by itself .  and come and see what   s grown in the rose garden .  you won   t believe it .      there were roses .  they were made of ice so thin that  if you breathed on them  they melted away and left nothing but the dead stalks they   d grown on .  and there were dozens of them  waving in the wind .      even the heat of my hand near them makes them drip     said petulia .     do you think it   s your wintersmith .         he   s not mine .  and i can   t think of any other way they   d turn up .         and you think he  um  spoke to you .     said petulia  plucking another rose .  ice particles slid off her hat every time she moved .      no .  it was me .  i mean  my voice .  but it didn   t sound like him .  i mean  like i think he   d sound .  it was a bit snide  like annagramma when she   s in a mood .  but it was my voice .         how do you think he   d sound .     said petulia .   the wind gusted across the clearing  making the pine trees shake and roar .         tiffany   be mine        after a little while petulia coughed and said     um  was it just me  or did that sound like    .         not just you     whispered tiffany  standing very still .      ah     said petulia  in a voice as bright and brittle as a rose of ice .     well  i think we should get indoors now  yes .  um  and get all the fires lit and some tea made  yes .  and then start getting things ready  because quite soon a lot of people will be turning up .      a minute later they were in the cottage  with the doors bolted and every candle spluttering into life .   they didn   t talk about the wind or the roses .  what would be the point .  besides  there was a job to be done .  work  that   s what helps .  work  and think and talk later  don   t gabble now like frightened ducks .  they even managed to get another layer of grime off the windows .   all through the morning people arrived from the village with the things miss treason had ordered .  people were walking across the clearing .  the sun was out  even if it was as pale as a poached egg .  the world was belonging to   normality .  tiffany caught herself wondering if she was wrong about things .  were there roses .  there were none now  the fragile petals had not survived even the dawn   s weak light .  had the wind spoken .  then she met petulia   s gaze .  yes  it had happened .  but for now there was a funeral to feed .   the girls had already got to work on the ham rolls  with three sorts of mustard  but however far wrong you couldn   t go with a ham roll  if that was all you were giving seventy or eighty hungry witches  you were going all the way past wrong and were heading into absolute party disaster .  so barrows were arriving with loaves and roasts of beef  and jars of pickled cucumbers so big that they looked like drowned whales .  witches are very keen on pickles  as a rule  but the food they like best is free food .  yes  that   s the diet for your working witch  lots of food that someone else is paying for  and so much of it that there is enough to shove in your pockets for later .   as it turned out  miss treason wasn   t paying for it either .  no one would take any money .  they wouldn   t leave  either  but hung about by the back door looking worried until they could have a word with tiffany .  the conversation  when she could spare the time from slicing and spreading  would go something like this      she   s not really dying  is she .         yes .  at around half past six tomorrow morning .         but she   s very old .         yes .  i think that   s sort of why  you see .         but what will we do without her .         i don   t know .  what did you do before she was here .         she was always here .  she knew everything .  who   s going to tell us what to do now .      and then they   d say     it   s not going to be you  is it .     and give her a look that said  we hope not .  you don   t even wear a black dress .   after a while tiffany got fed up with this and in a very sharp voice asked the next person  a woman delivering six cooked chickens     what about all those stories about her slitting open bad people   s bellies with her thumbnail  then .         er  well  yes  but it was never anyone we knew     said the woman virtuously .      and the demon in the cellar .         so they say .  o    course  i never saw it pers   nally .     the woman gave tiffany a worried look .     it is down there  isn   t it .      you want it to be  tiffany thought .  you actually want there to be a monster in the cellar .   but as far as tiffany knew  what was in the cellar this morning was a lot of snoring feegles who had been boozin    .  if you put a lot of feegles in a desert  within twenty minutes they   d find a bottle of something dreadful to drink .      believe me  madam  you wouldn   t want to wake what   s down there now     she said  giving the woman a worried smile .   the woman seemed satisfied with that but suddenly looked concerned again .      and the spiders .  she really eats spiders .     she asked .      well  there   s lots of webs     said tiffany     but you never see a spider .         ah  right     said the woman  as if she   d been let into a big secret .     say what you like  miss treason   s been a real witch .  with skulls .  i expect you have to polish    em  eh .  ha .  she could spit your eye out as soon as look at you .         she never did  though     said a man delivering a huge tray of sausages .     not to anyone local  anyway .         that   s true     the woman admitted reluctantly .     she was very gracious in that respect .         ah  she was a proper old time witch  miss treason     said the sausage man .     many a man has widdled in his boots when she   s turned the sharp side of her tongue on him .  you know that weaving she   s always doing .  she weaves your name into the loom  that   s what she does .  and if you tell her a lie  your thread breaks and you drop down dead on the spot .         yes  that happens all the time     said tiffany  thinking  this is amazing .  boffo has a life of its own .      well  we don   t get witches like her these days     said a man delivering four dozen eggs .     these days it   s all airy fairy and dancin    around without your drawers on .      they all looked inquiringly at tiffany .      it   s wintertime     she said coldly .     and i   ve got to get on with my work .  the witches will be here soon .  thank you very much .      while they were putting the eggs on to boil  she told petulia about it .  it didn   t come as a surprise .      um  they   re proud of her     petulia said .     i   ve heard them boasting about her up at the pig market in lancre .         they boast .         oh  yes .  like  you think old mistress weatherwax is tough .  ours has got skulls .  and a demon .  she   s gonna live forever    cuz she   s got a clockwork heart she winds up every day .  and she eats spiders  sure of it .  how d   you like them poisoned apples  huh .      boffo works all by itself  tiffany thought  once you get it started .  our baron is bigger than your baron  our witch is witchier than your witch    .       chapter five      miss treason   s big day      the witches started arriving around four o   clock  and tiffany went out into the clearing to do air traffic control .  annagramma arrived by herself  looking very pale and wearing more occult jewelry than you could imagine .  and there was a difficult moment when mrs .  earwig and granny weatherwax arrived at the same time  and circled in a ballet of careful politeness as each waited for the other to land .  in the end  tiffany directed them into different corners of the clearing and hurried away .   there was no sign of the wintersmith  and she was sure she   d know if he was near .  he   d gone far away  she hoped  arranging a gale or conducting a blizzard .  the memory of that voice in her mouth remained  awkward and worrying .  like an oyster dealing with a piece of grit  tiffany coated it with people and hard work .   now the day was just another pale  dry  early winter   s day .  apart from the food  nothing else at the funeral had been arranged .  witches arrange themselves .  miss treason sat in her big chair  greeting old friends and old enemies alike .   the cottage was far too small for them all  so they spilled out into the garden in gossiping groups  like a flock of old crows or  possibly  chickens .  tiffany didn   t have much time to talk  because she was kept too busy carrying trays .   but something was going on  she could tell .  witches would pause and turn to watch her as she staggered past  and then turn back to their group and the level of hubbub in the group would rise a bit .  groups would come together and separate again .  tiffany recognized this .  the witches were making a decision .   lucy warbeck sidled up to her while she was bringing out a tray of tea  and whispered  as if it were a guilty secret     mistress weatherwax has suggested you  tiff .         no .         it   s true .  they   re talking about it .  annagramma   s having a fit .         are you sure .         positive .  best of luck .         but i don   t want the       tiffany pushed the tray into lucy   s arms .     look  can you take that around for me  please .  they   ll just grab as you go past .  i   ve got to get the  er  put the things in  er   got things to do    .      she hurried down the steps to the cellar  which was suspiciously empty of feegles  and leaned against the wall .   granny weatherwax must be cackling  rules or no rules .  but her second thoughts crept up to whisper  you could do it  though .  she may be right .  annagramma annoys people .  she talks to them as if they are children .  she   s interested in magic  sorry  magik with a    k      but people get on her nerves .  she   ll make a mess of it  you know she will .  she just happens to be tall and wears lots of occult jewelry and looks impressive in a pointy hat .   why would granny suggest tiffany .  oh  she was good .  she knew she was good .  but didn   t everyone know she didn   t want to spend her life up here .  well  it had to be annagramma  didn   t it .  witches tended to be cautious and traditional  and she was the oldest of the coven .  okay  a lot of witches didn   t like mrs .  earwig  but granny weatherwax didn   t exactly have many friends either .   she went back upstairs before she could be missed  and tried to be inconspicuous as she sidled through the crowd .   she saw mrs .  earwig and annagramma as the center of one group  the girl looked worried  and hurried over when she caught sight of tiffany .  she was red in the face .      have you heard anything .     she demanded .      what .  no .     said tiffany  starting to pile up used plates .      you   re trying to take the cottage away from me  aren   t you .     annagramma was nearly crying .      don   t be silly .  me .  i don   t want a cottage at all .         so you say .  but some of them are saying you should get it .  miss level and miss pullunder have spoken up for you .         what .  i couldn   t possibly follow miss treason .         well  of course that   s what mrs .  earwig is telling everyone     said annagramma  settling down a bit .     completely unacceptable  she says .      i took the hiver through the dark door  tiffany thought  as she viciously scraped food scraps into the garden for the birds .  the white horse came out of the hill for me .  i got my brother and roland back from the queen of the elves .  and i danced with the wintersmith  who turned me into ten billion snowflakes .  no  i don   t want to be in a cottage in these damp woods  i don   t want to be a kind of slave to people who can   t be bothered to think for themselves  i don   t want to wear midnight and make people afraid of me .  there is no name for what i want to be .  but i was old enough to do all those things  and i was acceptable .   but she said     i don   t know what this is about .      at which point she felt someone looking at her  and she knew  if she turned around  that it would be granny weatherwax .   her third thoughts   the ones that paid attention out of the corner of her ear and the edge of her eye all the time   told her  something is going on .  all you can do about it is be yourself .  don   t look around .      you   re really not interested .     said annagramma uncertainly .      i   ve come up here to learn witching     said tiffany stiffly .     and then i   m going to go home .  but   are you sure you want the cottage .         well  of course .  every witch wants a cottage .         but they   ve had years and years of miss treason     tiffany pointed out .      then they   ll just have to get used to me     said annagramma .     i expect they   ll be pretty glad to see the back of skulls and cobwebs and being frightened .  i know she   s got the local people really scared of her .         ah     said tiffany .      i   ll be a new broom     said annagramma .     frankly  tiffany  after that old woman  just about anyone would be popular .         er  yes       said tiffany .     tell me  annagramma  have you ever worked with any other witch .         no  i   ve always been with mrs .  earwig .  i   m her first pupil  you know     annagramma added proudly .     she   s very exclusive .         and she doesn   t go around the villages much  does she .     said tiffany .      no .  she concentrates on the higher magik .     annagramma wasn   t particularly observant and was very vain  even by the standard of witches  but now she looked a little less confident .     well  someone has to .  we can   t all tramp around bandaging cut fingers  you know     she added .     is there a problem .         hmm .  oh  no .  i   m sure you   ll get on well     said tiffany .     er   i know my way around the place  so if you need any help  just ask .         oh  i   m sure i   ll get things sorted out to my liking     said annagramma  whose boundless self confidence couldn   t stay squashed for long .     i   d better go .  by the way  it looks as though the food is running low .      she swept away .   the big vats on the trestle table just inside the door were indeed looking a bit empty .  tiffany saw one witch stuff four hard boiled eggs into her pocket .      good afternoon  miss tick     she said loudly .      ah  tiffany     said miss tick smoothly  turning around without the least sign of embarrassment .     miss treason has just been telling us how well you have been doing here .         thank you  miss tick .         she says that you have a fine eye for hidden detail     miss tick went on .   like the labels on skulls  tiffany thought .     miss tick     she said     do you know anything about people wanting me to take over the cottage .         oh  that   s all been decided     said miss tick .     there was some suggestion that it should be you  since you   re already here  but really  you are still young  and annagramma has had much more experience .  i   m sorry  but           that   s not fair  miss tick     said tiffany .      now  now  tiffany  that   s not the sort of thing a witch says       miss tick began .      i don   t mean not fair to me  i mean unfair to annagramma .  she   s going to make a mess of it  isn   t she .      just for the skin of a moment miss tick looked guilty .  it really was a very short space of time indeed  but tiffany spotted it .      mrs .  earwig is certain that annagramma will do a very good job     said miss tick .      are you .         remember whom you are talking to  please .         i   m talking to you  miss tick .  this is   wrong .     tiffany   s eyes blazed .   she saw movement out of the corner of her eye .  an entire plate of sausages was moving across the white cloth at very high speed .      and that is stealing     she growled  leaping after it .   she chased after the dish as  skimming a few inches above the ground  it rounded the cottage and disappeared behind the goat shed .  she plunged after it .   there were several plates lying on the leaves behind the shed .  there were potatoes  oozing butter  and a dozen ham rolls  and a pile of boiled eggs  and two cooked chickens .  everything except the sausages in the dish  which was now stationary  had a gnawed look .   there was absolutely no sign of the feegles .  that was how she could tell they were there .  they always hid from her when they knew she was angry .   well  this time she was really angry .  not at the feegles  much   although the stupid hiding trick got on her nerves  but at miss tick and granny weatherwax and annagramma and miss treason  for dying   and the wintersmith himself  for a lot of reasons she hadn   t had time to sort out yet  .   she stepped back and went quiet .   there was always a feeling of sinking slowly and peacefully  but this time it was like a dive into darkness .   when she opened her eyes  it felt as if she were looking through windows into a huge hall .  sound seemed to be coming from a long way away  and there was an itching between her eyes .   feegles appeared  from under leaves  behind twigs  even from under plates .  their voices sounded as though they were underwater .      ach  crivens .  she   s done some big hagglin    on us .         she   s ne   er done that before .      hah  i   m hiding from you  thought tiffany .  bit of a change  eh .  hmm  i wonder if i can move .  she took a step sideways .  the feegles didn   t seem to see it .      she   s gonna jump oot on us any moment .  ooohhh  waily        ha .  if i could walk up to granny weatherwax like this  she   d have to be so impressed     the itch on tiffany   s nose was getting worse  and there was a feeling that was similar to  but fortunately not yet the same as  the need to visit the privy .  it meant  something is going to happen soon  so it would be a good idea to be ready for it .   the sound of the voices began to get clearer  and little blue and purple spots ran across her vision .   and then there was something that  if it had made a noise  would have gone wwwhamp .  it was like the popping you got in your ears after a high broomstick flight .  she reappeared in the middle of the feegles  causing immediate panic .      stop stealing the funeral meats right now  you wee scuggers .     she shouted .   the feegles stopped and stared at her .  then rob anybody said     socks wi   oot feets .      there was one of those moments   you got a lot of them around the feegles   when the world seems to have got tangled up and it is so important to unravel the knot before you can go any further .      what are you talking about .     asked tiffany .      scuggers     said rob anybody .     they   re like socks wi   oot feets in    em .  for keepin    yer legs warm  ye ken .         you mean like legwarmers .     said tiffany .      aye  aye  that would be a verra guid name for    em  it bein    what they do     said rob .     in point o    fact  mebbe the term ye meant to use wuz    thievin    scunners     which means              us     said daft wullie helpfully .      oh .  yes .  thank you     said tiffany quietly .  she folded her arms and then shouted     right  you thieving scunners .  how dare you steal miss treason   s funeral meats .         oh  waily waily  it   s the foldin    o    the arms  the foooldin    o    the aaaarmss .     cried daft wullie  dropping to the ground and trying to cover himself with leaves .  around him feegles started to wail and cower  and big yan began to bang his head on the rear wall of the dairy .      now then  ye must all stay calm .     yelled rob anybody  turning around and waving his hands desperately at his brothers .      there   s the pursin    o    the lips .     a feegle shouted  pointing a shaking finger at tiffany   s face .     she   s got the knowin    o    the pursin    o    the lips .     tis doom come upon us a    .      the feegles tried to run  but since they were panicking again  they mostly collided with one another .      i   m waiting for an explanation .     said tiffany .   the feegles froze  and every face turned toward rob anybody .      an explanation .     he said  shifting uneasily .     oh  aye .  an explanation .  nae problemo .  an explanation .  er   what kind would you like .         what kind .  i just want the truth .         aye .  oh .  the truth .  are you sure .     rob ventured rather nervously .     i can do much more interestin    explanations than that           out with it .     snapped tiffany  tapping her foot .      ach  crivens  the tappin    o    the feets has started .     moaned daft wullie .     there   s gonna be witherin    scoldin    at any moment .      and that was it .  tiffany burst out laughing .  you couldn   t look at a bunch of frightened nac mac feegles and not laugh .  they were so bad at it .  one sharp word and they were like a basket of scared puppies  only smellier .   rob anybody gave her a lopsided grin .      weel  all the big hags is doin    it too     he said .     the wee fat one   s thieved fifteen ham rolls .     he added admiringly .      that   d be nanny ogg     said tiffany .     yes  she always carries a string bag up her knicker leg .         ach  this is no    a proper wake     said rob anybody .     there should be singin    an    boozin    an    the flexin    o    the knees  no    all this standin    aroond gossipin    .         well  gossiping   s part of witchcraft     said tiffany .     they   re checking to see if they   ve gone batty yet .  what is the flexin    o    the knees .         the dancin     ye ken     said rob .     the jigs an    reels .     tis no    a good wake unless the hands is flingin    an    the feets is twinklin    an    the knees is flexin    an    the kilts is flyin    .      tiffany had never seen the feegles dance  but she had heard them .  it sounded like warfare  which was probably how it ended up .  the flyin    o    the kilts sounded a bit worrying  though  and reminded her of a question she had never quite dared to ask up until now .      tell me   is there anything worn under the kilt .      from the way the feegles went quiet again  she got the feeling that this was not a question they liked being asked .   rob anybody narrowed his eyes .  the feegles held their breath .      not necessarily     he said .       at last the funeral was over  possibly because there was nothing left to eat and drink .  many of the departing witches were carrying small packages .  that was another tradition .  a lot of things in the cottage were the property of the cottage  and would pass on to the next witch  but everything else got passed on to the soon to be late witch   s friends .  since the old witch would be alive when this happened  it saved squabbling .   that was the thing about witches .  they were  according to granny weatherwax     people what looks up .     she didn   t explain .  she seldom explained .  she didn   t mean people who looked at the sky  everyone did that .  she probably meant that they looked up above the everyday chores and wondered     what   s all this about .  how does it work .  what should i do .  what am i for .     and possibly even     is there anything worn under the kilt .     perhaps that was why odd  in a witch  was normal        but they   d squabble like polecats over a silver spoon that wasn   t even silver .  as it was  several were waiting impatiently by the sink for tiffany to wash some big dishes that miss treason had promised to them  and which had held the funeral roast potatoes and sausage rolls .   at least there was no problem with leftovers .  nanny ogg  a witch who   d invented leftover sandwiches soup  was waiting in the scullery with her big string bag and a bigger grin .      we were going to have the rest and potatoes for supper     said tiffany angrily  but with a certain amount of interest .  she   d met nanny ogg before and quite liked her  but miss treason had said  darkly  that nanny ogg was    a disgusting old baggage .     that sort of comment attracts your attention .      fair enough     said nanny ogg as tiffany placed her hand on the meat .     you did a good job here today  tiff .  people notice that .      she was gone before tiffany could recover .  one of them had very nearly said thank you .  amazing .   petulia helped her bring the big table indoors and finish the tidying up .  she hesitated  though  before she left .      um   you will be all right  will you .     she said .     it   s all a bit   strange .         we   re supposed to be no strangers to strangeness     said tiffany primly .     anyway  you   ve sat up with the dead and dying  haven   t you .         oh  yes .  mostly pigs  though .  some humans .  um   i don   t mind staying  if you like     petulia added in a leaving as soon as possible voice .      thank you .  but after all  what   s the worst that can happen .      petulia stared at her and then said     well  let me think   a thousand vampire demons  each one with enormous           i   ll be fine     said tiffany quickly .     don   t you worry at all .  good night .      tiffany shut the door and then leaned on it with her hand over her mouth until she heard the gate click .  she counted to ten to make sure that petulia had got some distance and then risked taking her hand away .  by then the scream that had been patiently waiting to come out had dwindled to something like    unk .      this was going to be a very strange night .   people died .  it was sad  but they did .  what did you do next .  people expected the local witch to know .  so you washed the body and did a few secret and squelchy things and dressed them in their best clothes and laid them out with bowls of earth and salt beside them  no one knew why you did this bit  not even miss treason  but it had always been done  and you put two pennies on their eyes    for the ferryman    and you sat with them the night before they were buried  because they shouldn   t be left alone .   exactly why was never properly explained  although everyone got told the story of the old man who was slightly less dead than everybody thought and got up off the spare bed in the middle of the night and got back into bed with his wife .   the real reason was probably a lot darker than that .  the start and finish of things was always dangerous  lives most of all .   but miss treason was a wicked ol    witch .  who knew what might happen .  hang on  tiffany told herself  don   t you believe the boffo .  she   s really just a clever old lady with a catalogue .   in the other room miss treason   s loom stopped .   it often did .  but this evening the sudden silence it made was louder than usual .   miss treason called out     what do we have in the larder that needs eating up .      yes  this is going to be a very odd night  tiffany told herself .   miss treason went to bed early .  it was the first time tiffany had ever known her not to sleep in a chair .  she   d put on a long white nightdress  too  the first time tiffany had seen her not in black .   there was a lot still to do .  it was traditional that the cottage should be left sparkling clean for the next witch  and although it was hard to make black sparkle  tiffany did her best .  actually  the cottage was always pretty clean  but tiffany scraped and scrubbed and polished because it put off the moment when she   d have to go and talk to miss treason .  she even took down the fake spiderwebs and threw them on the fire  where they burned with a nasty blue flame .  she wasn   t sure what to do with the skulls .  finally  she wrote down everything she could remember about the local villages  when babies were due  who was very ill and what with  who was feuding  who was    difficult     and just about every other local detail she thought might be helpful to annagramma .  anything to just put off the moment    .   at last there was nothing for it but to climb the narrow stairs and say     is everything all right  miss treason .      the old woman was sitting up in bed  scribbling .  the ravens were perched on the bedposts .      i   m just writing a few thank you letters     she said .     some of those ladies today came quite a long way and will be having a chilly ride back .            thank you for coming to my funeral    letters .     asked tiffany weakly .      indeed .  and they   re not often written  you may be sure of that .  you know the girl annagramma hawkin will be the new witch here .  i am sure she would like you to stay on .  at least for a while .         i don   t think that would be a good idea     said tiffany .      quite     said miss treason smiling .     i suspect the girl weatherwax has arrangements in mind .  it will be interesting to see how mrs .  earwig   s brand of witchcraft suits my silly people  although it may be best to observe events from behind a rock .  or  in my case  under it .      she put the letters aside  and both the ravens turned to look at tiffany .      you have been here with me only three months .         that   s right  miss treason .         we have not talked  woman to woman .  i should have taught you more .         i   ve learned a lot  miss treason .     and that was true .      you have a young man  tiffany .  he sends you letters and packages .  you go into lancre town every week to send letters to him .  i fear you live not where you love .      tiffany said nothing .  they   d been through this before .  roland seemed to fascinate miss treason .      i was always too busy to pay attention to young men     said miss treason .     they were always for later and then later was too late .  pay attention to your young man .         erm   i did say he   s not actually my       tiffany began  feeling herself start to blush .      but do not become a strumpet like mrs .  ogg     said miss treason .      i   m not very musical     said tiffany uncertainly .   miss treason laughed .     you have a dictionary  i believe     she said .     a strange but useful thing for a girl to have .         yes  miss treason .         on my bookshelf you will find a rather larger dictionary .  an unexpurgated dictionary .  a useful thing for a young woman to have .  you may take it  and one other book .  the others will remain with the cottage .  you may also have my broomstick .  everything else  of course  belongs to the cottage .         thank you very much  miss treason .  i   d like to take that book about mythology .         ah  yes .  chaffinch .  a very good choice .  it has been a great help to me and will  i suspect  be of particular assistance to you .  the loom must stay  of course .  annagramma hawkin will find it useful .      tiffany doubted this .  annagramma wasn   t very practical at all .  but it was probably not the time to say so .   miss treason leaned back against the cushions .      they think you wove names into your cloth     said tiffany .      that .  oh  it   s true .  there   s nothing magical about it .  it   s a very old trick .  any weaver can do it .  you won   t be able to read it  though  without knowing how it was done .     miss treason sighed .     oh  my silly people .  anything they don   t understand is magic .  they think i can see into their hearts  but no witch can do that .  not without surgery  at least .  no magic is needed to read their little minds  though .  i   ve known them since they were babes .  i remember when their grandparents were babes .  they think they   re so grown up .  but they   re still no better than babies in the sandpit  squabbling over mud pies .  i see their lies and excuses and fears .  they never grow up  not really .  they never look up and open their eyes .  they stay children their whole lives .         i   m sure they   ll miss you     said tiffany .      ha .  i   m the wicked ol    witch  girl .  they feared me  and did what they were told .  they feared joke skulls and silly stories .  i chose fear .  i knew they   d never love me for telling    em the truth  so i made certain of their fear .  no  they   ll be relieved to hear the witch is dead .  and now i shall tell you something vitally important .  it is the secret of my long life .      ah  thought tiffany  and she leaned forward .      the important thing     said miss treason     is to stay the passage of the wind .  you should avoid rumbustious fruits and vegetables .  beans are the worst  take it from me .         i don   t think i understand       tiffany began .      try not to fart  in a nutshell .         in a nutshell i imagine it would be pretty unpleasant .     said tiffany nervously .  she couldn   t believe she was being told this .      this is no joking matter     said miss treason .     the human body only has so much air in it .  you have to make it last .  one plate of beans can take a year off your life .  i have avoided rumbustiousness all my days .  i am an old person and that means what i say is wisdom .     she gave the bewildered tiffany a stern look .     do you understand  child .      tiffany   s mind raced .  everything is a test .     no     she said .     i   m not a child and that   s nonsense  not wisdom .      the stern look cracked into a smile .     yes     said miss treason .     total gibberish .  but you   ve got to admit it   s a corker  all the same  right .  you definitely believed it  just for a moment .  the villagers did last year .  you should have seen the way they walked about for a few weeks .  the strained looks on their faces quite cheered me up .  how are things with the wintersmith .  all gone quiet  has it .      the question was like a sharp knife in a slice of cake  and arrived so suddenly that tiffany gasped .      i woke up early and wondered where you were     said miss treason .  it was so easy to forget that she used other people   s ears and eyes all the time  in an absentminded sort of way .      did you see the roses .     asked tiffany .  she hadn   t felt the telltale tickle  but she hadn   t exactly had much time for anything but worry .      yes .  fine things     said miss treason .     i wish i could help you  tiffany  but i   m going to be otherwise occupied .  and romance is an area where i cannot offer much advice .         romance .     said tiffany  shocked .      the girl weatherwax and miss tick will have to guide you     miss treason went on .     i must say  though  that i suspect that neither of them has jousted much in the lists of love .         lists of love .     said tiffany .  it was getting worse .      can you play poker .     miss treason asked .      pardon .         poker .  the card game .  or cripple mr .  onion .  chase my neighbor up the passage .  you must have sat up with the dead and dying before .         well  yes .  but i   ve never played cards with them .  anyway  i don   t know how to play .         i   ll teach you .  there   s a pack of cards in the bottom drawer of the dresser .  go and fetch them .         is this like gambling .  my father said that people shouldn   t gamble .      miss treason nodded .     good advice  my dear .  don   t worry .  the way i play poker isn   t like gambling at all    .          when tiffany awoke with a jolt  playing cards sliding off her dress and onto the floor  the cold gray light of morning filled the room .   she peered at miss treason  who was snoring like a pig .   what was the time .  it was six at least .  what should she do .   nothing .  there was nothing to do .   she picked up the ace of wands and stared at it .  so that was poker  was it .  well  she hadn   t been too bad at it  once she   d worked out that it was all about making your face tell lies .  for most of the time the cards were just something to do with your hands .   miss treason slept on .  tiffany wondered if she should get some breakfast  but it seemed such a        the ancient kings of djelibeybi  who are buried in pyramids     said miss treason from the bed     used to believe that they could take things with them into the next world .  such things as gold and precious stones and even slaves .  on that basis  please make me a ham sandwich .         er   you mean    .     tiffany began .      the journey after death is quite a long one     said miss treason  sitting up .     i may get hungry .         but you   ll just be a soul .         well  perhaps a ham sandwich has a soul  too     said miss treason  as she swung her skinny legs out of the bed .     i   m not sure about the mustard  but it   s worth a try .  hold still there .     this was because she had picked up her hairbrush and was using tiffany as a mirror .  the fiercely concentrated glare a few inches away was as much as tiffany could bear on a morning like this .      thank you   you may go and make the sandwich     said miss treason  laying the brush aside .     i will now get dressed .      tiffany hurried out and washed her face in the basin in her room  she always did that after the eyeballing  but she   d never plucked up the courage to object  and now certainly wasn   t the time to start .   as she dried her face  she thought she heard a muffled sound outside and went over to the window .  there was frost on     oh  no   oh   no   no .  he was at it again .   the frost ferns spelled the word    tiffany .     over and over .   she grabbed a rag and wiped them off  but the ice only formed again  thicker .   she hurried downstairs .  the ferns were all over the windows  and when she tried to wipe them off  the rag froze to the glass .  it creaked when she pulled at it .   her name  all over the window .  over all the windows .  maybe over all the windows in all the mountains .  everywhere .   he   d come back .  that was dreadful .   but also  just a bit   cool    .   she didn   t think the word  because as far as tiffany knew the word meant    slightly cold .     but she thought the thought  even so .  it was a hot little thought .      in my day young men would just carve the girl   s initials on a tree     said miss treason  coming down the stairs one careful step at a time .  too late  tiffany felt the tickle behind her eyes .      it   s not funny  miss treason .  what shall i do .         i don   t know .  if possible  be yourself .      miss treason bent down creakily and opened her hand .  the seeing eye mouse hopped down onto the floor  turned  and stared at her with tiny black eyes for a moment .  she prodded it with a finger .     go on  off you go .  thank you     she said  and then it scuttled off to a hole .   tiffany helped her upright  and the old witch said     you   re starting to snivel  aren   t you .         well  it   s all a bit       tiffany began .  the little mouse had looked so lost and forlorn .      don   t cry     said miss treason .     living this long   s not as wonderful as people think .  i mean  you get the same amount of youth as everyone else  but a great big extra helping of being very old and deaf and creaky .  now  blow your nose and help me on with the ravens    perch .         he might still be out there       tiffany mumbled  as she eased the perch onto the thin shoulders .   then she rubbed at the window again and saw shapes and movement .      oh   they came       she said .      what .     said miss treason .  she stopped .     there   s lots of people out there .         er   yes     said tiffany .      what do you know about this  my girl .         well  you see  they kept asking when           fetch my skulls .  they mustn   t see me without my skulls .  how does my hair look .     said miss treason  frantically winding up her clock .      it looks nice           nice .  nice .  are you mad .  mess it up this minute .     miss treason demanded .     and fetch my most raggedy cloak .  this one   s far too clean .  move yourself  child .      it took several minutes to get miss treason ready  and a lot of the time was spent convincing her that taking the skulls out in daylight might be dangerous  in case they got dropped and someone saw the labels .  then tiffany opened the door .   a murmur of conversation crashed into silence .   there were people in a crowd all around the door .  as miss treason stepped forward  it parted to leave a clear path .   to her horror  tiffany saw a dug grave on the other side of the clearing .  she hadn   t expected that .  she wasn   t sure what she had expected  but a dug grave wasn   t it .      who dug    .         our blue friends     said miss treason .     i asked them to .      and then the crowd started to cheer .  women hurried forward with big bunches of yew  holly  and mistletoe  the only green things growing .  people were laughing .  people were crying .  they clustered around the witch  forcing tiffany out to the edge of the crowd .  she went quiet and listened .      we don   t know what we   ll do without you  miss treason .          i don   t think we   ll get another witch as good as you  miss treason .          we never thought you   d go  miss treason .  you brought my ol    granddad into the world .         walking into the grave  tiffany thought .  well  that   s style .  that is   solid gold boffo .  they   ll remember that for the rest of their lives        in that case you shall keep all the puppies but one       miss treason had stopped to organize the crowd .     the custom is to give that one to the owner of the dog .  you should have kept the bitch in  after all  and minded your fences .  and your question  mister blinkhorn .      tiffany stood up straight .  they were bothering her .  even this morning .  but she   wanted to be bothered .  being bothered was her life .      miss treason .     she snapped  pushing her way through the mob .     remember you have an appointment .      it wasn   t the best thing to say  but a lot better than     you said you were going to die in about five minutes    time .      miss treason turned and looked uncertain for a moment .      oh  yes     she said .     yes  indeed .  we had better get on .     then  still talking to mr .  blinkhorn about some complex problem concerning a fallen tree and someone   s shed  and with the rest of the crowd trailing after her  she let tiffany walk her gently to the graveside .      well  at least you   ve got a happy ending  miss treason     tiffany whispered .  it was a silly thing to say and deserved what it got .      we make happy endings  child  day to day .  but you see  for the witch there are no happy endings .  there are just endings .  and here we are    .      best not to think  thought tiffany .  best not to think you   re climbing down an actual ladder into an actual grave .  try not to think about helping miss treason down the ladder onto the leaves that are piled up at one end .  do not let yourself know you   re standing in a grave .   down here  the horrible clock seemed to clank even louder  clonk clank  clonk clank    .   miss treason trod the leaves down a bit and said cheerfully     yes  i can see myself being quite comfortable here .  listen  child  i told you about the books  did i not .  and there is a small gift for you under my chair .  yes  this seems adequate .  oh  i forgot        clonk clank  clonk clank   went the clock  sounding much louder down there .   miss treason stood on tiptoe and poked her head over the edge of the hole .     mr .  easy .  you owe two months    rent to the widow langley .  understand .  mr .  plenty  the pig belongs to mrs .  frumment  and if you don   t give it back to her  i shall come back and groan under your window .  mistress fullsome  the dogelley family have had right of passage over the turnwise pasture since even i cannot remember  and you must   you must        clon   k .   there was a moment  one long moment  when the sudden silence of the clock not ticking anymore filled the clearing like thunder .   slowly miss treason sagged down onto the leaves .   it took a few dreadful seconds for her brain to start working  and then tiffany screamed at the people clustered above     go back  all of you .  give her some air .      she knelt down as they backed hurriedly away .   the smell of the raw soil was sharp in the air .  at least miss treason seemed to have died with her eyes shut .  not everyone did .  tiffany hated having to shut them for people  it was like killing them all over again .      miss treason .     she whispered .  that was the first test .  there were a lot of them  and you had to do them all  speak to them  raise an arm  check the pulses including the one behind the ear  check for breath with a mirror   and she   d always been so nervous about getting them wrong that the first time she   d had to go out to deal with someone who looked dead   a young man who   d been in a horrible sawmill accident   she   d done every single test  even though she   d had to go and find his head .   there were no mirrors in miss treason   s cottage .   in that case she        should think .  this is miss treason here .  and i heard her wind her clock up only a few minutes ago .   she smiled .      miss treason .     she said  very close to the woman   s ear .     i know you   re in there .      and that   s when the morning  which had been sad  weird  odd  and horrible  became   boffo all the way .   miss treason smiled .      have they gone .     she inquired .      miss treason .     said tiffany sternly .     that was a terrible thing to do .         i stopped my clock with my thumbnail     said miss treason proudly .     couldn   t disappoint them  eh .  had to give    em a show .         miss treason     said tiffany severely     did you make up the story about your clock .         of course i did .  and it   s a wonderful bit of folklore  a real corker .  miss treason and her clockwork heart .  might even become a myth  if i   m lucky .  they   ll remember miss treason for thousands of years .      miss treason closed her eyes again .      i   ll certainly remember you  miss treason     said tiffany .     i will really  because        the world had gone gray  and was getting grayer .  and miss treason had gone very still .      miss treason .     said tiffany  nudging her .     miss treason .      miss eumenides treason  aged one hundred and eleven .   tiffany heard the voice inside her head .  it didn   t seem to have come through her ears .  and she   d heard it before  making her quite unusual .  most people hear the voice of death only once .   miss treason stood up  without the creak of even one bone .  and she looked just like miss treason  solid and smiling .  what now lay on the dead leaves was  in this strange light  just a shadow .   but a very tall dark figure was standing beside her .  it was death himself .  tiffany had seen him before  in his own land beyond the dark door  but you didn   t need to have met him before to know who he was .  the scythe  the long hooded robe  and of course the bundle of hourglasses were all clues .      where are your manners  child .     said miss treason .   tiffany looked up and said     good morning .      good morning  tiffany aching  aged thirteen  said death in his no voice .  i see you are in good health .      a little curtsy would be in order too     said miss treason .   to death .  thought tiffany .  granny aching wouldn   t have liked that .  never bend the knee to tyrants  she would say .   at last  miss eumenides treason  we must walk together .  death took her gently by the arm .      hey  wait a minute .     said tiffany .     miss treason is one hundred and thirteen .         er   i adjusted it slightly for professional reasons     said miss treason .     one hundred and eleven sounds so   adolescent .     as if to hide her ghostly embarrassment  she plunged her hand into her pocket and pulled out the spirit of the ham sandwich .      ah  it worked     she said .     i know i   where has the mustard gone .      mustard is always tricky  said death as they began to fade .      no mustard .  what about pickled onions .      pickles of all sorts don   t seem to make it .  i   m sorry .  behind them  the outline of a door appeared .      no relishes in the next world .  that   s dreadful .  what about chutneys .     said the vanishing miss treason .   there   s jam .  jam works .      jam .  jam .  with ham .      and they were gone .  the light went back to normal .  sound came back .  time came back .   once again the thing to do was not to think too deeply  just keep her thoughts nice and level and focused on what she had to do .   watched by the people still hovering around the clearing  tiffany went and got some blankets  bundling them up so that when she carried them back to the grave  no one would notice that the two boffo skulls and the spiderweb making machine were tucked inside .  then with miss treason and the secret of boffo safely tucked away  she filled in the grave  and at this point a couple of men ran and helped her   right until there came  from under the soil   clonk clank .  clonk .   the men froze .  so did tiffany  but her third thoughts cut in with  don   t worry .  remember  she stopped it .  a falling stone or something must have started it going again .   she relaxed and said sweetly     that was probably just her saying good bye .      the rest of the soil got shoveled in really quickly .   and now i   m part of the boffo  tiffany thought  as the people hurried back to their villages .  but miss treason worked very hard for them .  she deserves to be a myth  if that   s what she wants .  and i   ll bet  i   ll bet that on dark nights they   ll hear her    .   but now there was nothing but the wind in the trees .   she stared at the grave .   someone should say something .  well .  she was the witch  after all .   there wasn   t much religion on the chalk or in the mountains .  the omnians came and had a prayer meeting about once a year  and sometimes a priest from the nine day wonderers or the see of little faith or the church of small gods would come by on a donkey .  people went to listen  if a priest sounded interesting or went red and shouted  and they sang the songs if they had a good tune .  and then they went home again .      we are small people     her father had said .     it ain   t wise to come to the attention of the gods .      tiffany remembered the words he had said over the grave of granny aching  what seemed like a lifetime ago .  on the summer turf of the downlands  with the buzzards screaming in the sky  they had seemed to be all there was to say .  so she said them now          if any ground is consecrate  this ground is .     if any day is holy  it is this day .          she saw a movement  and then billy bigchin  the gonnagle  scrambled onto the turned earth of the grave .  he gave tiffany a solemn look  then unslung his mousepipes and began to play .   humans could not hear the mousepipes very well because the notes were too high  but tiffany could feel them in her head .  a gonnagle could put many things into his music  and she felt sunsets  and autumns  and the mist on hills and the smell of roses so red they were nearly black    .   when he had finished  the gonnagle stood in silence for a moment  looked at tiffany again  then vanished .   tiffany sat on a stump and cried a bit  because it needed to be done .  then she went and milked the goats  because someone had to do that  too .       chapter six      feet and sprouts      in the cottage  the beds were airing  the floors had been swept  and the log basket was full .  on the kitchen table the inventory was laid out  so many spoons  so many pans  so many dishes  all lined up in the dingy light .  tiffany packed some of the cheeses  though .  she   d made them  after all .   the loom was silent in its room  it looked like the bones of some dead animal  but under the big chair was the package miss treason had mentioned  wrapped in black paper .  inside it was a cloak woven of brown wool so dark that it was almost black .  it looked warm .   that was it  then .  time to go .  if she lay down and put her ear to a mousehole  she could hear widespread snoring coming from the cellar .  the feegles believed that after a really good funeral  everyone should be lying down .  it wasn   t a good idea to wake them .  they   d find her .  they always did .   was that everything .  oh  no  not quite .  she took down the unexpurgated dictionary and chaffinch   s mythology  with the    dacne of the sneasos    in it  and went to tuck them into a bag under the cheeses .  as she did so  the pages flipped like cards and several things dropped out onto the stone floor .  some of them were faded old letters  which she tucked back inside for now .   there was also the boffo catalogue .  the cover had a grinning clown on it  and the words       the boffo novelty   joke company .  .  .  .  .   guffaws  jokes  chuckles  japes galore .  .  .   if it   s a laugh  it   s a boffo .  .  .   be the life of the party with our novelty gift pack .  .  .   special offer this month  half price off red noses .  .  .       yes  you could spend years trying to be a witch  or you could spend a lot of money with mr .  boffo and be one as soon as the postman arrived .   fascinated  tiffany turned the pages .  there were skulls  glow in the dark     extra  and fake ears and pages of hilarious noses  ghastly dangling booger free on noses over     and masks  as boffo would say  galore .  .  .  mask no .      for example  was  wicked witch de luxe  with mad greasy hair  rotting teeth  and hairy warts  supplied loose  stick them where you like .  .  .   .  miss treason had obviously stopped short of buying one of these  possibly because the nose looked like a carrot but probably because the skin was bright green .  she could also have bought scary witch hands     a pair  with green skin and black fingernails  and smelly witch feet      .   tiffany tucked the catalogue back into the book .  she couldn   t leave it for annagramma to find  or the secret of miss treason   s boffo would be out .   and that was it  one life  ended and neatly tidied away .  one cottage  clean and empty .  one girl  wondering what was going to happen next .     arrangements    would be made .   clonk clank .   she didn   t move  didn   t look around .  i   m not going to be boffo   d  she told herself .  there   s an explanation for that noise that has nothing to do with miss treason .  let   s see   i cleaned the fireplace  right .  and i leaned the poker next to it .  but unless you get it just right  it always falls over sooner or later in a sneaky kind of way .  that   s it .  when i turn and look behind me  i   ll see that the poker has fallen over and is lying in the grate and therefore the noise wasn   t caused by any kind of ghostly clock at all .   she turned around slowly .  the poker was lying in the grate .   and now  she thought  it would be a good idea to go outside into the fresh air .  it   s a bit sad and stuffy in here .  that   s why i want to go out  because it   s sad and stuffy .  it   s not at all because i   m afraid of any imaginary noises .  i   m not superstitious .  i   m a witch .  witches aren   t superstitious .  we are what people are superstitious of .  i just don   t want to stay .  i felt safe here when she was alive   it was like sheltering under a huge tree   but i don   t think it is safe anymore .  if the wintersmith makes the trees shout my name  well  i   ll cover my ears .  the house feels like it   s dying and i   m going outside .   there was no point in locking the door .  the local people were nervous enough about going inside even when miss treason was alive .  they certainly wouldn   t set foot inside now  not until another witch had made the place her own .   a weak  runny egg kind of sun was showing through the clouds  and the wind had blown the frost away .  but a brief autumn turned to winter quickly up here  from now on there would always be the smell of snow in the air .  up in the mountains the winter never ended .  even in the summer  the water in the streams was ice cold from the melting snow .   tiffany sat down on the old stump with her ancient suitcase and a sack and waited for the arrangements .  annagramma would be here pretty soon  you could bet on that .   the cottage already looked abandoned .  it seemed like     it was her birthday .  the thought pushed itself to the front .  yes  it would be today .  death had got it right .  the one big day in the year that was totally hers  and she had forgotten about it in all the excitement  and now it was already two thirds over .   had she ever told petulia and the others when her birthday was .  she couldn   t remember .   thirteen years old .  but she   d been thinking of herself as    nearly thirteen    for months now .  pretty soon she   d be    nearly fourteen .      she was just about to enjoy a bit of self pity when there was a stealthy rustling behind her .  she turned so quickly that horace the cheese leaped backward .      oh  it   s you     said tiffany .     where have you been  you naughty bo   cheese .  i was worried sick .      horace looked ashamed  but it was quite hard to see how he managed it .      are you going to come with me .     she asked .   horace was immediately surrounded by a feeling of yesness .      all right .  you must get in the sack .     tiffany opened it  but horace backed away .      well  if you are going to be a naughty chee       she began  and stopped .  her hand was itching .  she looked up   at the wintersmith .   it had to be him .  at first he was just swirling snow in the air  but as he strode across the clearing  he seemed to come together  become human  become a young man with a cloak billowing out behind him and snow on his hair and shoulders .  he wasn   t transparent this time  not entirely  but something like ripples ran across him  and tiffany thought she could see the trees behind him  like shadows .   she took a few hurried steps backward  but the wintersmith was crossing the dead grass with the speed of a skater .  she could turn and run  but that would mean she was  well  turning and running  and why should she do that .  she hadn   t been the one scribbling on people   s windows .   what should she say  what should she say .      now  i really appreciated you finding my necklace     she said  backing away again .     and the snowflakes and roses were really very   it was very sweet .  but   i don   t think that we   well  you   re made of cold and i   m not   i   m a human  made of   human stuff .         you must be her     said the wintersmith .     you were in the dance .  and now you are here  in my winter .      the voice wasn   t right .  it sounded   fake  somehow  as if the wintersmith had been taught to say the sound of words without understanding what they were .      i   m a her     she said uncertainly .     i don   t know about    must be .     er   please  i   m really sorry about the dance  i didn   t mean to  it just seemed so        he   s still got the same purple gray eyes  she noticed .  purple gray  in a face sculpted from freezing fog .  a handsome face  too .     look  i never meant to make you think       she began .      meant .     said the wintersmith  looking astonished .     but we don   t mean .  we are .         what do you   mean .         crivens .         oh  no       muttered tiffany as feegles erupted from the grass .   the feegles didn   t know the meaning of the word    fear .     sometimes tiffany wished they   d read a dictionary .  they fought like tigers  they fought like demons  they fought like giants .  what they didn   t do was fight like something with more than a spoonful of brain .   they attacked the wintersmith with swords  heads  and feet  and the fact that everything went through him as if he were a shadow didn   t seem to bother them .  if a feegle aimed a boot at a misty leg and ended up kicking himself in his own head  then it had been a good result .   the wintersmith ignored them  like a man paying no attention to butterflies .      where is your power .  why are you dressed like this .     the wintersmith demanded .     this is not as it should be .      he stepped forward and grabbed tiffany   s wrist hard  much harder than a ghostly hand should be able to do .      it is wrong .     he shouted .  above the clearing the clouds were moving fast .   tiffany tried to pull away .     let me go .         you are her .     the wintersmith shouted  pulling her toward him .   tiffany hadn   t known where the shout came from  but the slap came from her hand  thinking for itself .  it caught the figure on the cheek so hard that for a moment the face blurred  as if she   d smeared a painting .      don   t come near me .  don   t touch me .     she screamed .   there was a flicker behind the wintersmith .  tiffany couldn   t see it clearly because of the icy haze and her own anger and terror  but something blurred and dark was moving toward them across the clearing  wavering and distorted like a figure seen through ice .  it loomed behind the transparent figure for one dark moment  and then became granny weatherwax  in the same space as the wintersmith   inside him .   he screamed for a second  and exploded into a mist .   granny stumbled forward  blinking .      urrrgh .  it   ll take a while to get the taste of that out of my head     she said .     shut your mouth  girl   something might fly into it .      tiffany shut her mouth .  something might fly into it .      what   what did you do to him .     she managed .      it .     snapped granny  rubbing her forehead .     it   s an it  not a he .  an it that thinks it   s a he .  now give me your necklace .         what .  but it   s mine .         do you think i want an argument .     granny weatherwax demanded .     does it say on my face i want an argument .  give it to me now .  don   t you dare defy me .         i won   t just        granny weatherwax lowered her voice and  in a piercing hiss much worse than a scream  said     it   s how it finds you .  do you want it to find you again .  it   s just a fog now .  how solid do you think it will become .      tiffany thought about that strange face  not moving like a real one should  and that strange voice  putting words together as if they were bricks    .   she undid the little silver clasp and held up the necklace .   it   s just boffo  she told herself .  every stick is a wand  every puddle is a crystal ball .  this is just a   a thing .  i don   t need it to be me .   yes  i do .      you must give it to me     said granny softly .     i can   t take it .      she held out her hand  palm up .   tiffany dropped the horse into it and tried not to see granny weatherwax   s fingers as a closing claw .      very well     said granny  satisfied .     now we must go .         you were watching me     said tiffany sullenly .      all morning .  you could have seen me if you   d thought to look     said granny .     but you didn   t do a bad job at the burial  i   ll say that .         i did a good job .         that   s what i said .         no     said tiffany  still trembling .     you didn   t .         i   ve never held with skulls and suchlike     said granny  ignoring this .     artificial ones  at any rate .  but miss treason        she stopped  and tiffany saw her stare at the treetops .      is that him again .     she asked .      no     said granny  as if this were something to be disappointed about .     no  that   s young miss hawkin .  and mrs .  letice earwig .  didn   t hang about  i see .  and miss treason hardly cooled down .     she sniffed .     some people might have had the common decency not to snatch .      the two broomsticks landed a little way off .  annagramma looked nervous .  mrs .  earwig looked like she always did  tall  pale  very well dressed  wearing lots of occult jewelry and an expression that said you were slightly annoying her but she was being gracious enough not to let it show .  and she always looked at tiffany  when she ever bothered to look at her at all  as if tiffany were some kind of strange creature that she didn   t quite understand .   mrs .  earwig was always polite to granny  in a formal and chilly way .  it made granny weatherwax mad  but that was the way of witches .  when they really disliked one another  they were as polite as duchesses .   as the other two approached  granny bowed low and removed her hat .  mrs .  earwig did the same thing  only the bow was a little lower .   tiffany saw granny glance up and then bow lower still  by about an inch .   mrs .  earwig managed to go half an inch farther down .   tiffany and annagramma exchanged a hopeless glance over the straining backs .  sometimes this sort of thing could go on for hours .   granny weatherwax gave a grunt and straightened up .  so did mrs .  earwig  red in the face .      blessin   s be upon our meetin        said granny in a calm voice .  tiffany winced .  this was a declaration of hostilities .  yelling and prodding with the fingers was perfectly ordinary witch arguing  but speaking carefully and calmly was open warfare .      how kind of you to greet us     said mrs .  earwig .      i hopes i sees you in good health .         i keep well  miss weatherwax .     annagramma shut her eyes .  that was a kick in the stomach  by witch standards .      it   s mistress weatherwax  mrs .  earwig     said granny .     as i believes you know .         why  yes .  of course it is .  i am so sorry .     these vicious blows having been exchanged  granny went on     i trust miss hawkin will find everything to her likin    .         i   m sure that       mrs .  earwig stared at tiffany  her face a question .      tiffany     said tiffany helpfully .      tiffany .  of course .  what a lovely name    .  i   m sure that tiffany has done her very best     said mrs .  earwig .     however  we shall shrive and consecrate the cottage  in case of   influences .      i already scrubbed and scrubbed everything .  tiffany thought .      influences .     said granny weatherwax .  even the wintersmith could not have managed a voice so icy .      and disquieting vibrations     said mrs .  earwig .      oh  i know about those     said tiffany .     it   s the loose floorboard in the kitchen .  if you tread on it  it makes the dresser wobble .         there has been talk of a demon     said mrs .  earwig  gravely ignoring this .     and   skulls .         but       tiffany began  and granny   s hand squeezed her shoulder so hard she stopped .      deary  deary me     said granny  still holding on tightly .     skulls  eh .         there are some very disturbing stories     said mrs .  earwig  watching tiffany .     of the darkest nature  mistress weatherwax .  i feel that the people in this steading have been very badly served  indeed .  dark forces have been unleashed .      tiffany wanted to yell  no .  it was all stories .  it was all boffo .  she watched over them .  she stopped their stupid arguments  she remembered their laws  she scolded their silliness .  she couldn   t do that if she was just a frail old lady .  she had to be a myth .  but granny   s grip kept her silent .      strange forces are certainly at work     said granny weatherwax .     i wish you well in your endeavors  mrs .  earwig .  if you will excuse me .         of course  mis   tress weatherwax .  may good stars attend you .         may the road slow down to meet your feet     said granny .  she stopped gripping tiffany so hard but nevertheless almost dragged her around the side of the cottage .  the late miss treason   s broomstick was leaning against the wall .      tie your stuff on quickly .     she commanded .     we must move .         is he going to come back .     asked tiffany  struggling to tie the sack and old suitcase onto the bristles .      not yet .  not soon  i think .  but it will be looking for you .  and it will be stronger .  dangerous to you  i believe  and those around you .  you have such a lot to learn .  you have such a lot to do .         i thanked him .  i tried to be nice to him .  why is he still interested in me .         because of the dance     said granny .      i   m sorry about that .         not good enough .  what does a storm know of sorrow .  you must make amends .  did you really think that space was left there for you .  oh  this is so tangled .  how are your feet .      tiffany  angry and bewildered  stopped with one leg half over the stick .      my feet .  what about my feet .         do they itch .  what happens when you take your boots off .         nothing .  i just see my socks .  what have my feet got to do with anything .         we shall find out     said granny  infuriatingly .     now  come along .      tiffany tried to get the stick to rise  but it barely cleared the dead grass .  she looked around .  the bristles were covered with nac mac feegles .      dinna mind us     said rob anybody .     we   ll hold on tight .         an    dinna make it too bumpy     cuz i feel like the top o    mah heid   s come off     said daft wullie .      do we get meals on this flight .     said big yan .     i   m fair boggin    for a wee drink .         i can   t take you all .     said tiffany .     i don   t even know where i   m going .      granny weatherwax glared at the feegles .     you   ll have to walk .  we   re travelin    to lancre town .  the address is tir nani ogg  the square .         tir nani ogg     said tiffany .     isn   t that    .         it means nanny ogg   s place     said granny  as feegles dropped off the broomstick .     you   ll be safe there .  well  more or less .  but we must make a stop on the way .  we must put that necklace as far away from you as we can .  and i know how to do that .  oh  yes .          the nac mac feegle jogged through the afternoon woods .  local wildlife had found out about feegles  so the fluffy woodland creatures had all dived for their burrows or climbed high into the trees  but after a while big yan called a halt and said     there   s somethin    trackin    us .         don   t be daft     said rob anybody .     there   s nothin    left in these woods that   s mad enough tae hunt feegles .         i know what i   m sensin        said big yan stubbornly .     i can feel it in my watter .  there   s somethin    creepin    up on us right noo .         weel  i   m not one tae argue wi    a man   s watter     said rob wearily .     okay  lads  spread oot inna big circle .      swords drawn  the feegles spread out  but after a few minutes there was a general muttering .  there was nothing to see  nothing to hear .  a few birds sang  at a safe distance .  peace and quiet  unusual in the vicinity of feegles  was everywhere .      sorry  big yan  but i   m thinkin    yer watter is no    on the button this time     said rob anybody .   it was at this point that horace the cheese dropped from a branch onto his head .       a lot of water flowed under the big bridge at lancre  but from up here you could barely see it because of the spray coming from the waterfalls a little farther on  spray that hovered in the freezing air .  there was white water all through the deep gorge  and then the river leaped the waterfall like a salmon and hit the plains below like a thunderstorm .  from the base of the falls you could follow the river all the way past the chalk  but it moved in wide  lazy curves  and it was quicker to fly in a straight line .   tiffany had flown up it just once  when miss level had first brought her into the mountains .  since then she   d always taken the long way down  cruising just above the zigzagging coach road .  flying out over the edge of that furious torrent into a sudden drop full of cold damp air and then pointing the stick almost straight down was pretty high on her list of things she never intended to do  ever .   now granny weatherwax stood on the bridge  the silver horse in her hand .      it   s the only way     she said .     it   ll end up at the bottom of the deep sea .  let the wintersmith look for you there .      tiffany nodded .  she wasn   t crying  which is not the same as  well  not crying .  people walked around not crying all the time and didn   t think about it at all .  but now  she did .  she thought  i   m not crying    .   it made sense .  of course it made sense .  it was all boffo .  every stick is a wand  every puddle is a crystal ball .  no thing had any power that you didn   t put there .  shambles and skulls and wands were like   shovels and knives and spectacles .  they were like   levers .  with a lever you could lift a big rock  but the lever didn   t do any work .      it has to be your choice     said granny .     i can   t make it for you .  but it   s a small thing  and while you have it  it will be dangerous .         you know  i don   t think he wanted to hurt me .  he was just upset     said tiffany .      really .  do you want to meet it upset again .      tiffany thought about that strange face .  there had been the shape of a human there   more or less   but it was as if the wintersmith had heard of the idea of being human but hadn   t found out how to do it yet .      you think he   ll harm other people .     she asked .      he is the winter  child .  it   s not all pretty snowflakes  is it .      tiffany held out her hand .     give it back to me  please .      granny handed it over with a shrug .   it lay in tiffany   s hand  on the strange white scar .  it was the first thing she had ever been given that wasn   t useful  that wasn   t supposed to do something .   i don   t need this  she thought .  my power comes from the chalk .  but is that what life   s going to be like .  nothing that you don   t need .      we should tie it to something that   s light     she said in a matter of fact voice .     otherwise it will get caught on the bottom .      after some rooting around in the grass near the bridge  she found a stick and wrapped the silver chain around it .   it was noon .  tiffany had invented the word noonlight because she liked the sound of it .  anyone could be a witch at midnight  she   d thought  but you   d have to be really good to be a witch by noonlight .   good at being a witch  anyway  she thought now as she walked back onto the bridge .  not good at being a happy person .   she threw the necklace off the bridge .   she didn   t make a big thing of it .  it would have been nice to say that the silver horse glittered in the light  seemed to hang in the air for a moment before falling the long fall .  perhaps it did  but tiffany didn   t look .      good     said granny weatherwax .      is it all over now .     said tiffany .      no .  you danced into a story  girl  one that tells itself to the world every year .  it   s the story about ice and fire  summer and winter .  you   ve made it wrong .  you   ve got to stay to the end and make sure it turns out right .  the horse is just buyin    you time  that   s all .         how much time .         i don   t know .  this hasn   t happened before .  time to think  at least .  how are your feet .          the wintersmith was moving through the world without  in any human sense  moving at all .  wherever winter was  he was too .   he was trying to think .  he   d never had to do this before  and it hurt .  up until now humans had just been parts of the world that moved around in strange ways and lit fires .  now he was spinning himself a mind  and everything was new .   a human   made of human stuff   that was what she had said .   human stuff .  he had to make himself of human stuff for the beloved .  in the chill of morgues and the wreckage of ships  the wintersmith rode the air searching for human stuff .  and what was it .  dirt and water  mostly .  leave a human long enough and even the water would go  and there would be nothing but a few handfuls of dust that blew away in the wind .   so  since water did not think  all the work was being done by the dust .   the wintersmith was logical  because ice was logical .  water was logical .  wind was logical .  there were rules .  so what a human was all about was   the right kind of dust .   and  while he was searching for it  he could show her how strong he was .       that evening tiffany sat on the edge of her new bed  the clouds of sleep rising in her brain like thunderheads  and yawned and stared at her feet .   they were pink  and had five toes each .  they were pretty good feet  considering .   normally when people met you  they   d say things like    how are you .     nanny ogg had just said     come on in .  how   s your feet .      suddenly everyone was interested in her feet .  of course  feet were important  but what did people expect to happen to them .   she swung them back and forth on the ends of her legs .  they didn   t do anything strange  so she got into bed .   she hadn   t slept properly for two nights .  she hadn   t really understood that until she   d reached tir nani ogg  when her brain had started to spin of its own accord .  she   d talked to mrs .  ogg  but it was hard to remember what about .  voices had banged in her ears .  now  at last  she had nothing to do but sleep .   it was a good bed  the best she   d ever slept in .  it was the best room she   d ever been in  although she   d been too tired to explore it .  witches didn   t go in much for comfort  especially in spare bedrooms  but tiffany had grown up on an ancient bed where the springs went gloing every time she moved  and with care she could get them to play a tune .   this mattress was thick and yielding .  she sank into it as if it were very soft  very warm  very slow quicksand .   the trouble is  you can shut your eyes but you can   t shut your mind .  as she lay in the dark  it squiggled pictures inside her head  of clocks that went clonk clank  of snowflakes shaped like her  of miss treason striding through the nighttime forest  seeking bad people with her yellow thumbnail ready .   myth treason     she drifted through these scrambled memories into dull whiteness .  but it got brighter  and took on detail  little areas of black and gray .  they began to move gently from side to side    .   tiffany opened her eyes  and everything became clear .  she was standing on a   a boat  no  a big sailing ship .  there was snow on the decks  and icicles hung from the rigging .  it was sailing in the washing up water light of dawn  on a silent gray sea full of floating ice and clouds of fog .  the rigging creaked  the wind sighed in the sails .  there was no one to be seen .      ah .  this appears to be a dream .  let me out  please     said a familiar voice .      who are you .     said tiffany .      you .  cough  please .      tiffany thought  well  if this is a dream   and she coughed .   a figure grew up out of the snow on the deck .  it was her  and she was looking around thoughtfully .      are you me too .     tiffany asked .  strangely  here on the freezing deck  it didn   t seem that  well  strange .      hmm .  oh  yes     said the other tiffany  still staring intently at things .     i   m your third thoughts .  remember .  the part of you that never stops thinking .  the bit that notices little details .  it   s good to be out in fresh air .  hmm .         is there something wrong .         well  this clearly appears to be a dream .  if you would care to look  you   ll see that the steersman in yellow oilskins up there at the wheel is the jolly sailor off the wrappers of the tobacco that granny aching used to smoke .  he always comes into our mind when we think about the sea  yes .      tiffany looked up at the bearded figure  who gave her a cheerful wave .      yes  that   s certainly him .     she said .      but i don   t think this is our dream  exactly     said the third thoughts .     it   s too   real .      tiffany reached down and picked up a handful of snow .      feels real     she said .     feels cold .     she made a snowball and threw it at herself .      i really wish i wouldn   t do that     said the other tiffany  brushing the snow off her shoulder .     but you see what i mean .  dreams are never as   nondreamlike as this .         i know what i mean     said tiffany .     i think they   re going to be real  and then something weird turns up .         exactly .  i don   t like it all .  if this is a dream  then something horrible is going to happen    .      they looked ahead of the ship .  there was a dismal  dirty bank of fog there  spreading out across the sea .      there   s something in the fog .     said the tiffanys together .   they turned and scurried up the ladder to the man at the wheel .      keep away from the fog .  please don   t go near it .     tiffany shouted .   the jolly sailor took his pipe out of his mouth and looked puzzled .      a good smoke in any weather .     he said to tiffany .      what .         it   s all he can say .     said her third thoughts  grabbing the wheel .     remember .  that   s what he says on the label .      the jolly sailor pushed her away gently .     a good smoke in any weather     he said soothingly .     in any weather .         look  we only want to       tiffany began  but her third thoughts  without a word  put a hand on her head and turned her around .   something was coming out of the fog .   it was an iceberg  a large one  at least five times as high as the ship  as majestic as a swan .  it was so big that it was causing its own weather .  it seemed to be moving slowly  there was white water around its base .  snow fell around it .  streamers of fog trailed behind it .   the jolly sailor   s pipe dropped out of his mouth as he stared .      a good smoke .     he swore .   the iceberg was tiffany .  it was a tiffany hundreds of feet high  formed of glittering green ice  but it was still a tiffany .  there were seabirds perched on her head .      it can   t be the wintersmith doing this .     said tiffany .     i threw the horse away .     she cupped her hands to her mouth and shouted     i threw the horse away .      her voice echoed off the looming ice figure .  a few birds took off from the huge cold head  screaming .  behind tiffany  the ship   s wheel spun .  the jolly sailor stamped a foot and pointed to the white sails above them .      a good smoke in any weather .     he commanded .      i   m sorry  i don   t know what you mean .     said tiffany desperately .   the man pointed to the sails and made frantic pulling motions with his hands .      a good smoke .         sorry  i just can   t understand you .      the sailor snorted and ran off toward a rope  which he hauled on in a great hurry .      it   s gotten weird     said her third thoughts quietly .      well  yes  i should think a huge iceberg shaped like me is a           no  that   s just strange .  this is weird     said her third thoughts .     we   ve got passengers .  look .     she pointed .   down on the main deck there was a row of hatches with big iron grids on them  tiffany hadn   t noticed them before .   hands  hundreds of them  pale as roots under a log  groping and waving  were thrusting through the grids .      passengers .     tiffany whispered in horror .     oh  no        and then the screaming started .  it would have been better  but not a lot better  if it had been cries of    help .  and    save us     but instead it was just screaming and wailing  just the sounds of people in pain and fear     no .      come back inside my head     she said grimly .     it   s too distracting to have you running around outside .  right now .         i   ll walk in from behind you     said her third thoughts .     then it won   t seem so        tiffany felt a twinge of pain  and a change in her mind  and thought  well  i suppose it could have been a lot messier .   okay .  let me think .  let all of me think .   she watched the desperate hands  waving like weeds underwater  and thought  i   m in something like a dream  but i don   t think it   s mine .  i   m on a ship  and we   re going to get killed by an iceberg that   s a giant figure of me .   i think i liked it better when i was snowflakes    .   whose dream is this .      what is this about  wintersmith .     she asked  and her third thoughts  back where they should be  commented  it   s amazing  you can even see your own breath in the air .      is this a warning .     tiffany shouted .     what do you want .      you for my bride  said the wintersmith .  the words just arrived in her memory .   tiffany   s shoulders sank .   you know this isn   t real  said her third thoughts .  but it may be the shadow of something real    .   i shouldn   t have let granny weatherwax send rob anybody away like that        crivens .  shiver me timber .     shouted a voice behind her .  and then there was the usual clamor      it   s    timbers     ye dafty .         aye .  but i can only find one .         splice the big plank .  daft wullie   s just walked intae the watter .         the big puddin    .  i told him  just the one eye patch .         with a yo hoho and a ho yoyo        feegles erupted from the cabin behind tiffany  and rob anybody stopped in front of her as the rest streamed past .  he saluted .      sorry we   re a wee bittie late  but we had to find the black patches     he said .     there   s sich a thing as style  ye ken .      tiffany was speechless  but only for a moment .  she pointed .      we   ve got to stop this ship from hitting that iceberg .         just that .  nae problemo .     rob looked past her to the looming ice giantess and grinned .     he   s got yer nose just right  eh .         just stop it .  please .     tiffany pleaded .      aye aye .  c   mon  lads .      watching the feegles working was like watching ants  except that ants didn   t wear kilts and shout    crivens .     all the time .  maybe it was because they could make one word do so much work that they seemed to have no problem at all with the jolly sailor   s orders .  they swarmed across the deck .  mysterious ropes were pulled .  sails moved and billowed to a chorus of    a good smoke .     and    crivens .      now the wintersmith wants to marry me  tiffany thought .  oh  dear .   she   d sometimes wondered if she   d get married one day  but she was definite that now was too soon for    one day .     yes  her mother had been married when she was still fourteen  but that was the sort of thing that happened in the olden days .  there were a lot of things to be done before tiffany ever got married  she was very clear about that .   besides  when you thought about it   yuk .  he wasn   t even a person .  he   d be too     thud .  went the wind in the sails .  the ship creaked and leaned over  and everyone was shouting at her .  mostly they shouted     the wheel .  grab the wheel right noo .     although there was also a desperate    a good smoke in any weather .     in there too .   tiffany turned to see the wheel spinning in a blur .  she made a snatch at it and got thumped across the fingers by the spokes  but there was a length of rope coiled nearby and she managed to lasso the wheel with a loop and jerk it to a halt without sliding along the deck too much .  then she grabbed the wheel and tried to turn it the other way .  it was like pushing a house  but it did move  very slowly at first and then faster as she put her back into it .   the ship came around .  she could feel it moving  beginning to head a little bit away from the iceberg  not directly for it .  good .  things were going right at last .  she spun the wheel some more  and now the huge cold wall was sliding past  filling the air with mist .  everything was going to be all right after     the ship hit the iceberg .   it started with a simple crack .  as a spar caught on an outcrop  but then others smashed as the ship scraped along the side of the ice .  then there were some sharp splintering noises as the ship ground onward  and bits of plank shot up on columns of foaming water .  the top of a mast broke off  dragging sails and rigging with it .  a lump of ice smashed onto the deck a few feet away from tiffany  showering her with needles .      this isn   t how it   s supposed to go .     she panted  hanging on to the wheel .   marry me  said the wintersmith .   churning white water roared across the foundering ship .  tiffany held on for a moment longer  then the cold surf covered her   except that it was suddenly not cold  but warm .  but it was still stopping her from breathing .  in the darkness she tried to fight her way to the surface  until the blackness was suddenly pulled aside  her eyes filled with light  and a voice said     i   m sure these mattresses are far too soft  but you can   t tell mrs .  ogg a thing .      tiffany blinked .  she was in bed  and a skinny woman with worried hair and a rather red nose was standing by it .      you were tossing and turning like a mad thing     the woman said  putting a steaming mug on the small table by the bed .     one day someone will suffikate  mark my words .      tiffany blinked again .  i   m supposed to think  oh  it was just a dream .  but it wasn   t just a dream .  not my dream .      what time is it .     she managed .      about seven     said the woman .      seven .     tiffany pushed the sheets back .     i   ve got to get up .  mrs .  ogg will be wanting her breakfast .         i shouldn   t think so .  i took it to her in bed not ten minutes ago     said the woman  giving tiffany a look .     and i   m off home .     she sniffed .     drink your tea before it gets cold .     and with that she marched toward the door .      is mrs .  ogg ill .     asked tiffany  looking everywhere for her socks .  she   d never heard of anyone who wasn   t really old or very ill having a meal in bed .      ill .  i don   t think she   s had a day   s illness in her life     said the woman  managing to suggest that in her opinion this was unfair .  she shut the door .   even the bedroom floor was smooth   not made smooth by centuries of feet that had worn down the planks and taken all the splinters out  but because someone had sanded and varnished it .  tiffany   s bare feet stuck to it slightly .  there was no dust to be seen  no spiderwebs anywhere .  the room was bright and fresh and exactly unlike any room in a witch   s cottage ought to be .      i   m going to get dressed     she said to the air .     are there any feegles in here .         ach  no     said a voice from under the bed .   there was some frantic whispering and the voice said     that is tae say  there   s hardly any o    us here at a    .         then shut your eyes     said tiffany .   she got dressed  taking occasional sips of the tea as she did so .  tea brought to your bedside when you weren   t ill .  that sort of thing happened to kings and queens .   and then she noticed the bruise on her fingers .  it didn   t hurt at all  but the skin was blue where the ship   s wheel had hit it .  right        feegles .     she said .      crivens  ye   ll nae be foolin    us a second time     said the voice from under the bed .      get out here where i can see you  daft wullie .     tiffany commanded .      it   s real hagglin     miss  the way ye always ken it   s me .      after some more urgent whispering  daft wullie   for it was indeed he   trooped out with two more feegles and horace the cheese .   tiffany stared .  all right  he was a blue cheese  so he was about the same color as a feegle .  and he acted like a feegle  no doubt about that .  why  though  had he got a grubby strip of feegle tartan around him .      he kinda found us     said daft wullie  putting his arm around as much of horace as was possible .     can i keep him .  he understands evera word i say .         that   s amazing  because i don   t     said tiffany .     look  were we in a shipwreck last night .         oh  aye .  sorta .         sort of .  was it real or wasn   t it .         oh  aye     said the feegle nervously .      which .     tiffany insisted .      kinda real  and kinda not real  in a real unreal sorta way     said daft wullie  squirming a bit .     i don   t have the knowin    o    the right wurdies    .         are all you feegles okay .         oh aye  miss     said daft wullie  brightening up .     nae problemo .  it wuz only a dream ship on a dream sea  after a    .         and a dream iceberg .     said tiffany .      ach  no .  the iceberg was real  mistress .         i thought so .  are you sure .         aye .  we   re good at the knowin    o    stuff like that     said daft wullie .     that   s so  eh  lads .     the other two feegles  in total awe of being in the presence of the big wee hag without the safety of hundreds of brothers around them  nodded at tiffany and then tried to shuffle behind each other .      a real iceberg shaped like me is floating around on the sea .     said tiffany in horror .     getting in the way of shipping .         aye .  could be     said daft wullie .      i   m going to get into so much trouble .     said tiffany  standing up .   there was a snapping noise  and the end of one of the floorboards leaped out of the floor and hung there  bouncing up and down with a rocking chair noise .  it had ripped out two long nails .      and now this     said tiffany weakly .  but the feegles and horace had vanished .   behind tiffany someone laughed  although it was maybe more of a chuckle  deep and real and with just a hint that maybe someone had told a rude joke .      those little devils can   t half run  eh .     said nanny ogg  ambling into the room .     now then  tiff  i wants you to turn around slowly and go and sit on your bed with your feet off the ground .  can you do that .         of course  mrs .  ogg     said tiffany .     look  i   m sorry about           poo  what   s a floorboard more or less .     said nanny ogg .     i   m much more worried about esme weatherwax .  she said there might be something like this .  ha  she was right and miss tick was wrong .  there   ll be no living with her after this .  she   ll have her nose so far in the air  her feet won   t touch the ground .      with a spioioioiiing .  sound  another floorboard sprang up .      and it might be a good idea if yours didn   t either  miss     nanny ogg added .     i   ll be back in half a tick .      that turned out to be the same length of time as twenty seven seconds  when nanny returned carrying a pair of violently pink slippers with bunny rabbits on them .      my second best pair     she said as  behind her  a board went plunk .  and hurled four big nails into the far wall .  the boards that had already sprung up were beginning to sprout what looked a lot like leaves .  they were thin and weedy  but leaves were what they were .      is it me doing this .     asked tiffany nervously .      i daresay esme will want to tell you all about it herself     said nanny  helping tiffany   s feet into the slippers .     but what you   ve got here  miss  is a bad case of ped fecundis .     in the back of tiffany   s memory dr .  sensibility bustle  d .  m .  phil .   b .  el l .   stirred in his sleep for a moment and took care of the translation .      fertile feet .     said tiffany .      well done .  i didn   t expect anything to happen to floorboards  mind you  but it makes sense  when you think about it .  they   re made of wood  after all  so they   re tryin    to grow .         mrs .  ogg .     said tiffany .      yes .         please .  i haven   t got a clue what you   re talking about .  i keep my feet very clean .  and i think i   m a giant iceberg .      nanny ogg gave her a slow  kind look .  tiffany stared into dark  twinkling eyes .  don   t try to trick her or hold anything back from those eyes  said her third thoughts .  everyone says she   s been granny weatherwax   s best friend since they were girls .  and that means that under all those wrinkles must be nerves of steel .      kettle   s on downstairs     said nanny brightly .     why don   t you come down and tell me all about it .      tiffany had looked up    strumpet    in the unexpurgated dictionary  and found it meant    a woman who is no better than she should be    and    a lady of easy virtue .     this  she decided after some working out  meant that mrs .  gytha ogg  known as nanny  was a very respectable person .  she found virtue easy  for one thing .  and if she was no better than she should be  then she was just as good as she ought to be .   she had a feeling that miss treason hadn   t meant this  but you couldn   t argue with logic .   nanny ogg was good at listening  at least .  she listened like a great big ear  and before tiffany realized it  she was telling her everything .  everything .  nanny sat on the opposite side of the big kitchen table  puffing gently at a pipe with a hedgehog carved on it .  sometimes she   d ask a little question  like    why was that .     or    and then what happened .     and off they   d go again .  nanny   s friendly little smile could drag out of you things you didn   t know you knew .   while they talked  tiffany   s third thoughts scanned the room out of the corners of her eyes .   it was wonderfully clean and bright  and there were ornaments everywhere   cheap  jolly ones  the sort that have things like    to the world   s best mum    on them .  and where there weren   t ornaments  there were pictures of babies and children and families .   tiffany had thought that only grand folk lived in homes like this .  there were oil lamps .  there was a bath  made of tin  hanging conveniently on a hook outside the privy .  there was a pump actually indoors .  but nanny ambled around in her rather worn black dress  not grand at all .   from the best chair in the room of ornaments  a large gray cat watched tiffany with a half open eye that glinted with absolute evil .  nanny had referred to him as    greebo   don   t mind him  he   s just a big old softie     which tiffany knew enough to interpret as    he   ll have his claws in your leg if you go anywhere near him .      tiffany talked as she hadn   t talked to anyone before .  it must be a kind of magic  her third thoughts concluded .  witches soon picked up ways of controlling people with their voices  but nanny ogg listened at you .      this lad roland who is not your young man     said nanny  when tiffany had paused for breath .     thinking of marrying him  are you .      don   t lie  her third thoughts insisted .      i   well  your mind comes up with all kinds of things when you   re not paying attention  doesn   t it .     said tiffany .     it   s not like thinking .  anyway  all the other boys i   ve met just stare at their stupid feet .  petulia says it   s because of the hat .         well  taking it off helps     said nanny ogg .     mind you  so did a low cut bodice  when i was a girl .  stopped    em lookin    at their stupid feet  i don   t mind telling you .      tiffany saw the dark eyes locked onto her .  she burst out laughing .  mrs .  ogg   s face broke into a huge grin that should have been locked up for the sake of public decency  and for some reason tiffany felt a lot better .  she   d passed some kind of test .      mind you  that probably wouldn   t work with the wintersmith  of course     said nanny  and the gloom came down again .      i didn   t mind the snowflakes     said tiffany .     but the iceberg   i think that was a bit much .         showing off in front of the girls     said nanny  puffing at her hedgehog pipe .     yes  they do that .         but he can kill people .         he   s winter .  it   s what he does .  but i reckon he   s in a bit of a tizzy because he   s never been in love with a human before .         in love .         well  he probably thinks he is .      once again the eyes watched her carefully .      he   s an elemental  and they   re simple  really     nanny ogg went on .     but he   s trying to be human .  and that   s complicated .  we   re packed with stuff he doesn   t understand   can   t understand  really .  anger  for example .  a blizzard is never angry .  the storm don   t hate the people who die in it .  the wind is never cruel .  but the more he thinks about you  the more he   s having to deal with feelings like this  and there   s none can teach him .  he   s not very clever .  he   s never had to be .  and the interesting thing is that you are changin    too        there was a knocking at the door .  nanny ogg got up and opened it .  granny weatherwax was there  with miss tick peering over her shoulder .      blessings be upon this house     said granny  but in a voice that suggested that if blessings needed to be taken away  she could do that  too .      quite probably     said nanny ogg .      it   s ped fecundis  then .     granny nodded at tiffany .      looks like a bad case .  the floorboards started growing after she walked over them in bare feet .         ha .  have you given her anything for it .     said granny .      i prescribed a pair of slippers .         i really don   t see how avatarization could be taking place  not when we   re talking about elementals  it makes no       miss tick began .      do stop wittering  miss tick     said granny weatherwax .     i notices you witter when things goes wrong  and it is not being a help .         i don   t want to worry the child  that   s all     said miss tick .  she took tiffany   s hand  patted it  and said     don   t you worry  tiffany  we   ll           she   s a witch     said granny sternly .     we just have to tell her the truth .         you think i   m turning into a   a goddess .     said tiffany .   it was worth it to see their faces .  the only mouth not in an o was the one belonging to granny weatherwax  which was smirking .  she looked like someone whose dog has just done a rather good trick .      how did you work that out .     granny asked .   dr .  bustle had a guess  avatar  an incarnation of a god .  but i   m not going to tell you that  tiffany thought .     well  am i .     she said .      yes     said granny weatherwax .     the wintersmith thinks you are   oh  she   s got a lot of names .  the lady of the flowers is a nice one .  or the summer lady .  she makes the summertime  just like he makes the winter .  he thinks you   re her .         all right     said tiffany .     but we know he   s wrong  don   t we .         er   not quite as wrong as we   d like     said miss tick .       most of the feegles had camped out in nanny ogg   s barn  where they were holding a council of war  except that it was about something that isn   t quite the same thing .      what we   ve got here     rob anybody pronounced     is a case o    romance .         what   s that  rob .     asked a feegle .      aye  is it like how wee babbies are made .     asked daft wullie .     ye told about that last year .  it wuz verra interestin     although a bit far fetched tae my mind .         no    exactly     said rob anybody .     an    it   s kinda hard tae describe .  but i reckon yon wintersmith wants to romance the big wee hag and she disna ken what tae do aboot it .         so it is like how babbies are made .     said daft wullie .      no     cuz even beasties know that but only people know aboot romancin        said rob .     when a bull coo meets a lady coo  he disna have tae say     my heart goes bang bang bang when i see your wee face        cuz it   s kinda built intae their heads .  people have it more difficult .  romancin    is verra important  ye ken .  basically it   s a way the boy can get close to the girl wi   oot her attackin    him and scratchin    his eyes oot .         i dinna see how we can teach her any o    that stuff     said slightly mad angus .      the big wee hag reads books     said rob anybody .     when she sees a book she just canna help herself .  an    i     he added proudly     have a plan .      the feegles relaxed .  they always felt happier when rob had a plan  especially since most plans of his boiled down to screaming and rushing at something .      tell us aboot the plan  rob     said big yan .      ah   m glad ye asked me     said rob .     the plan is  we   ll find her a book aboot romancin    .         an    how will we find this book  rob .     asked billy bigchin uncertainly .  he was a loyal gonnagle  but he was also bright enough to get nervous whenever rob anybody had a plan .   rob anybody airily waved a hand .     ach     he said     we ken this trick .  a    we need is a big hat an    coat an    a coat hanger an    a broom handle .         oh aye .     said big yan .     well  i   m not bein    doon in the knee again .          with witches everything is a test .  that   s why they tested tiffany   s feet .   i bet that i   m the only person in the world about to do this  she thought as she lowered both her feet into a tray of soil that nanny had hastily shoveled up .  granny weatherwax and miss tick were both sitting on bare wooden chairs  despite the fact that the gray cat greebo was occupying the whole of one big saggy armchair .  you didn   t want to wake up greebo when he wanted to sleep .      can you feel anything .     asked miss tick .      it   s a bit cold  that   s all   oh   something   s happening    .      green shoots appeared around her feet  and grew quickly .  then they went white at the base and gently pushed tiffany   s feet aside as they began to swell .      onions .     said granny weatherwax scornfully .      well  they were the only seeds i could find quickly     said nanny ogg  poking at the glistening white bulbs .     good size .  well done  tiff .      granny looked shocked .     you   re not going to eat those  are you  gytha .     she said accusingly .     you are  aren   t you .  you   re going to eat them .      nanny ogg  standing up with a bunch of onions in each pudgy hand  looked guilty  but only for a moment .      why not .     she said stoutly .     fresh vegetables are not to be sneezed at in the winter .  and anyway  her feet are nice and clean .         it   s not seemly     said miss tick .      it didn   t hurt     said tiffany .     all i had to do was put my feet on the tray for a moment .         yes  she says it didn   t hurt     nanny ogg insisted .     now  i think i might have some old carrot seeds in the kitchen drawer       she saw the expressions on the faces of the others .     all right  all right  then .  there   s no need to look like that     she said .     i was just tryin    to point out the silver lining  that   s all .         someone please tell me what is happening to me .     tiffany wailed .      miss tick is going to give you the answer in some long words     said granny .     but they boils down to this  it   s the story happening .  it   s making you fit into itself .      tiffany tried not to look like someone who didn   t understand a word that she had just heard .      i could do with a little bit of the fine detail  i think     she said .      i think i   ll get some tea brewed     said nanny ogg .       chapter seven      on with the dance      the wintersmith and the summer lady   danced .  the dance never ended .   winter never dies .  not as people die .  it hangs on in late frost and the smell of autumn in a summer evening  and in the heat it flees to the mountains .   summer never dies .  it sinks into the ground  in the depths  winter buds form in sheltered places and white shoots creep under dead leaves .  some of it flees into the deepest  hottest deserts  where there is a summer that never ends .  to animals they were just the weather  just part of everything .   but humans arose and gave them names  just as people filled the starry sky with heroes and monsters  because this turned them into stories .  and humans loved stories  because once you   d turned things into stories  you could change the stories .  and there was the problem  right there .   now the lady and the wintersmith danced around the year  changing places in the spring and autumn  and it had worked for thousands of years  right up until the time a girl couldn   t control her feet and had arrived in the dance at exactly the wrong time .   but the story had life  too .  it was like a play now .  it would roll on around the year  and if one of the players wasn   t the real actress but just some girl who   d wandered onto the stage  well  that was too bad .  she   d have to wear the costume and speak the lines and hope that there was going to be a happy ending .  change the story  even if you don   t mean to  and the story changes you .   miss tick used a lot more words than this  like    anthropomorphic personification     but this was what ended up in tiffany   s head .      so   i   m not a goddess .     she said .      oh  i wish i had a blackboard .     miss tick sighed .     they really don   t survive the water  though  and of course the chalks get so soggy           what we think happened in the dance     granny weatherwax began in a loud voice     is that you and the summer lady got   mixed up .         mixed up .         you may have some of her talents .  the myth of the summer lady says that flowers grow wherever she walks     said granny weatherwax .      where e   er     said miss tick primly .      what .     snapped granny  who was now pacing up and down in front of the fire .      it   s    where e   er she walks     in fact     said miss tick .     it   s more   poetical .         hah     granny said .     poetry .      am i going to get into trouble about this .  tiffany wondered .     and what about the real summer lady .  is she going to be angry .     she asked .   granny weatherwax stopped pacing and looked at miss tick  who said     ah  yes   er   we are exploring every possibility           that means we don   t know     said granny .     that   s the truth of it .  this is about gods  see .  but yes  since you ask  they can be a bit touchy .         i didn   t see her in the dance     said tiffany .      did you see the wintersmith .         well   no     said tiffany .  how could she describe that wonderful  endless  golden  spinning moment .  it went beyond bodies and thoughts .  but it had sounded as though two people had said     who are you .     she pulled her boots back on .     er   where is she now .     she asked as she tied the laces .  perhaps she   d have to run .      she   s probably gone back underground for the winter .  the summer lady doesn   t walk above ground in winter .         up until now     said nanny ogg cheerfully .  she seemed to be enjoying this .      aah  mrs .  ogg has put her finger on the other problem     said miss tick .     the  er  wintersmith and the summer lady are  uh  that is  they   ve never       she looked imploringly at nanny ogg .      they   ve never met except in the dance     said nanny .     but now here you are  and you feel like the summer lady to him  walking around as bold as brass in the wintertime  so you might be   how shall i put it    .            exciting his romantic propensities     said miss tick quickly .      i wasn   t going to describe it quite like that     said nanny ogg .      yes  i suspects you weren   t .     said granny .     i suspects you was going to use language .      tiffany definitely heard the capital    l     which entirely suggested that the language she was thinking of was not to be uttered in polite company .   nanny stood up and tried to look haughty  which is hard to do when you have a face like a happy apple .      i was actually going to draw tiff   s attention to this     she said  taking an ornament off the crowded mantelpiece .  it was a little house .  tiffany had glanced at it before  it had two little doorways at the front and  at the moment  a tiny little wooden man with a top hat .      it   s called a weather house     nanny said  handing it to tiffany .     i don   t know how it works   there   s a bit of special string or something   but there   s a little wooden man who comes out if it   s going to rain and a little wooden woman who comes out when it   s going to be sunny .  but they   re on a little pivoty thing  see .  they can never be out at the same time  see .  never .  an    i can   t help wonderin     when the weather   s changin     if the little man sees the little woman out of the corner of his eye and wonders           is this about sex .     asked tiffany .   miss tick looked at the ceiling .  granny weatherwax cleared her throat .  nanny gave a huge laugh that would have embarrassed even the little wooden man .      sex .     she said .     between summer and winter .  now there   s a thought .         don   t   think   it     said granny weatherwax sternly .  she turned to tiffany .     he   s fascinated by you  that   s what it is .  and we don   t know how much of the summer lady   s power is in you .  she might be quite weak .  you   ll have to be a summer in winter until winter ends     she added flatly .     that   s justice .  no excuses .  you made a choice .  you get what you chose .         couldn   t i just go and find her and say i   m sorry    .     tiffany began .      no .  the old gods ain   t big on    sorry        said granny  pacing up and down again .     they know it   s just a word .         you know what i think .     said nanny .     i think she   s watchin    you  tiff .  she   s sayin    to herself     who   s this hoity toity young madam steppin    into my shoes .  well  let   s make her walk a mile in    em and see how she likes it .            mrs .  ogg may have something there     said miss tick  who was leafing through chaffinch   s mythology .     the gods expect you to pay for your mistakes .      nanny ogg patted tiffany   s hand .     if she wants to see what you can do  show her what you can do  tiff  eh .  that   s the way .  surprise her .         you mean the summer lady .     said tiffany .   nanny winked .     oh  and the summer lady  too .      there was what sounded very much like the start of a laugh from miss tick before granny weatherwax glared at her .   tiffany sighed .  it was all very well to talk about choices  but she had no choice here .      all right .  what else can i expect apart from   well  the feet .         i   m  er  checking     said miss tick  still thumbing through the book .     ah   it says here that she was  i mean is  fairer than all the stars in heaven    .      they all looked at tiffany .      you could try doing something with your hair     said nanny ogg after a while .      like what .     said tiffany .      like anything  really .         apart from the feet and doing something with my hair     said tiffany sharply     is there anything else .         says here  quoting a very old manuscript     she waketh the grasses in aprill and filleth the beehives with honey swete        miss tick reported .      how do i do that .         i don   t know  but i suspect that happens anyway     said miss tick .      and the summer lady gets the credit .         i think she just has to exist for it to happen  really     said miss tick .      anything else .         er  yes .  you have to make sure the winter ends     said miss tick .     and  of course  deal with the wintersmith .         and how do i do that .         we think that you just have to   be there     said granny weatherwax .     or perhaps you   ll know what to do when the time comes .      meep .      be where .     said tiffany .      everywhere .  anywhere .         granny  your hat squeaked     said tiffany .     it went meep .         no it didn   t     granny said sharply .      it did  you know     said nanny ogg .     i heard it too .      granny weatherwax grunted and pulled off her hat .  the white kitten  curled around her tight bun of hair  blinked in the light .      i can   t help it     granny muttered .     if i leave the dratted thing alone  it goes under the dresser and cries and cries .     she looked around at the others as if daring them to say anything .     anyway     she added     it keeps m    head warm .      on his chair  the yellow slit of greebo   s left eye opened lazily .      get down  you     said granny  lifting the kitten off her head and putting it on the floor .     i daresay mrs .  ogg has got some milk in the kitchen .         not much     said nanny .     i   ll swear something   s been drinking it .      greebo   s eye opened all the way  and he began to growl softly .      you sure you know what you   re doing  esme .     said nanny ogg  reaching for a cushion to throw .     he   s very protective of his territory .      you the kitten sat on the floor and washed her ears .  then  as greebo got to his feet  she fixed him with an innocent little stare and took a flying leap onto his nose  landing on it with all her claws out .      so is she     said granny weatherwax  as greebo erupted from the chair and hurtled around the room before disappearing into the kitchen .  there was a crash of saucepans followed by the groioioioing of a saucepan lid spinning into silence on the floor .   the kitten padded back into the room  hopped into the empty chair  and curled up .      he brought in half a wolf last week     said nanny ogg .     you haven   t been hexperimenting  on that poor kitten  have you .         i wouldn   t dream of such a thing     said granny .     she just knows her own mind  that   s all .     she turned to tiffany .     i don   t reckon the wintersmith will be worrying about you too much for a while     she said .     the big winter weather will be on us soon .  that   ll keep him busy .  in the meantime  mrs .  ogg will teach you   things she knows .      and tiffany thought  i wonder how embarrassing this is going to be .       deep in the snow  in the middle of a windswept moorland  a small band of traveling librarians sat around their cooling stove and wondered what to burn next .   tiffany had never been able to find out much about the librarians .  they were a bit like the wandering priests and teachers who went even into the smallest  loneliest villages to deliver those things   prayers  medicine  facts   that people could do without for weeks at a time but sometimes needed a lot of all at once .  the librarians would loan you a book for a penny  although they often would take food or good secondhand clothes .  if you gave them a book  you got ten free loans .   sometimes you   d see two or three of their wagons parked in some clearing and could smell the glues they boiled up to repair the oldest books .  some of the books they loaned were so old that the printing had been worn gray by the pressure of people   s eyeballs reading it .   the librarians were mysterious .  it was said they could tell what book you needed just by looking at you  and they could take your voice away with a word .   but here they were searching the shelves for t .  h .  mouse holder   s famous book survival in the snow .   things were getting desperate .  the oxen that pulled the wagon had broken their tethers and run off in the blizzard  the stove was nearly out  and worst of all  they were down to their last candles  which meant that soon they would not be able to read books .      it says here in k .  pierpoint poundsworth   s among the snow weasels that the members of the ill fated expedition to whale bay survived by making soup of their own toes     said deputy librarian grizzler .      that   s interesting     said senior librarian swinsley  who was rummaging on the shelf below .     is there a recipe .         no  but there may be something in superflua raven   s book cooking in dire straits .  that   s where we got yesterday   s recipe for nourishing boiled socks surprise       there was a thunderous knocking at the door .  it was a two part door that allowed only the top half to be opened  so that a ledge on the bottom half could be a sort of small desk for stamping books .  snow came through the crack as the knocking continued .      i hope that   s not the wolves again     said mr .  grizzler .     i got no sleep at all last night .         do they knock .  we could check in the habits of wolves by captain w .  e .  lightly     said senior librarian swinsley     or perhaps you could just open the door .  quickly .  the candles are going out .      grizzler opened the top half of the door .  there was a tall figure on the steps  hard to see in the fitful  cloud strained moonlight .      ah   m lookin    for romance     it rumbled .   the deputy librarian thought for a moment  and then said     isn   t it a bit chilly out there .         aren   t ye the people wi    all dem books .     the figure demanded .      yes  indeed   oh  romance .  yes  certainly .     said mr .  swinsley  looking relieved .     in that case  i think you   ll want miss jenkins .  forward please  miss jenkins .         it looks like youse is freezin    in there     said the figure .     dem   s icicles hanging from der ceilin    .         yes .  however  we have managed to keep them off the books     said mr .  swinsley .     ah  miss jenkins .  the  er  gentleman is looking for romance .  your department  i think .         yes  sir     said miss jenkins .     what kind of romance were you looking for .         oh  one wi    a cover on  ye ken  and wi    pages wi    all wurdies on    em     said the figure .   miss jenkins  who was used to this sort of thing  disappeared into the gloom at the other end of the wagon .      dese scunners are total loonies .     said a new voice .  it appeared to come from somewhere on the person of the dark book borrower  but much lower than the head .      pardon .     said mr .  swinsley .      ach  nae problemo     said the figure quickly .     ah   m sufferin    from a grumblin    knee     tis an old trouble           why don   t they be burnin    all dem books  eh .     the unseen knee grumbled .      sorry aboot this  ye know how knees can let a man doon in public  i   m a martyr to dis one     said the stranger .      i know how it is .  my elbow acts up in wet weather     said mr .  swinsley .  there was some sort of fight going on in the nether regions of the stranger  who was shaking like a puppet .      that will be one penny     miss jenkins said .     and i will need your name and address .      the dark figure shuddered .     oh  i   we ne   er give out oor name an    address .     it said quickly .     it is against oor religion  ye ken .  er   i dinna wanta be a knee aboot this  but why is ye all here freezin    tae death .         our oxen wandered off  and alas  the snow   s too deep to walk through     said mr .  swinsley .      aye .  but youse got a stove an    all them dry ol    books     said the dark figure .      yes  we know     said the librarian  looking puzzled .   there was the kind of wretched pause you get when two people aren   t going to understand each other   s point of view at all .  then      tell ye what  me an      ma knee   will go an    fetch yer cows for ye  eh .     said the mysterious figure .     got tae be worth a penny  eh .  big yan  you   ll feel the rough side o    my hand in a minit .      the figure dropped out of sight .  snow flew up in the moonlight .  for a moment it sounded as if a scuffle were going on  and then a sound like    crivens .     disappearing into the distance .   the librarians were about to shut the door when they heard the terrified bellows of the oxen  getting louder very quickly .   two curling waves of snow came across the glittering moors .  the creatures rode them like surfers  yelling at the moon .  the snow settled down a few feet away from the wagon .  there was a blue and red blur in the air  and the romantic book was whisked away .   but what was really odd  the librarians agreed  was that when the oxen had come speeding toward them  they had appeared to be traveling backward .       it was hard to be embarrassed by nanny ogg  because her laugh drove embarrassment away .  she wasn   t embarrassed about anything .   today tiffany  with extra pairs of socks on to avoid unfortunate floral incidents  went with her    around the houses     as it was known to witches .      you did this for miss treason .     asked nanny as they stepped out .  there were big fat clouds massing around the mountains  there would be a lot more snow tonight .      oh yes .  and for miss level and miss pullunder .         enjoyed it  did you .     said nanny  wrapping her cloak around her .      sometimes .  i mean  i know why we do it  but sometimes you get fed up with people being stupid .  i quite like doing the medicine stuff .         good with the herbs  are you .         no .  i   m very good with the herbs .         oh  there   s a bit of swank  eh .     said nanny .      if i didn   t know i was good with herbs  i   d be stupid  mrs .  ogg .         that   s right .  good .  it   s good to be good at something .  now  our next little favor is           giving an old lady a bath  as much as was possible with a couple of tin basins and some washcloths .  and that was witchcraft .  then they looked in on a woman who   d just had a baby  and that was witchcraft  and a man with a very nasty leg injury that nanny ogg said was doing very well  and that was witchcraft too  and then in an out of the way group of huddled little cottages  they climbed the cramped wooden stairs to a tiny little bedroom where an old man shot at them with a crossbow .      you old devil  ain   t you dead yet .     said nanny .     you   re looking well .  i swear  the man with the scythe must   ve forgotten where you live .         i   m a waitin    for him  mrs .  ogg .     said the old man cheerfully .     if i   m gonna go  i   ll take    im with me .         this is my girl tiff .  she   s learnin    the witchin        said nanny  raising her voice .     this is mr .  hogparsley  tiff   tiff .     she snapped her fingers in front of tiffany   s eyes .      huh .     said tiffany .  she was still staring in horror .   the twang of the bow as nanny opened the door had been bad enough  but for a fraction of a second  she would have sworn that an arrow had gone right through nanny ogg and stuck in the door frame .      shame on you for firing at a young lady  bill     said nanny severely  plumping up his pillows .     and mrs .  dowser says you   ve been shootin    at her when she comes up to see you     she added  putting her basket down by the bed .     that   s no way to treat a respectable woman who brings you your meals  is it .  for shame .         sorry  nanny     muttered mr .  hogparsley .     it   s just that she   s skinny as a rake and wears black .     tis an easy mistake to make in poor light .         mr .  hogparsley here is lying in wait for death  tiff     said nanny .     mistress weatherwax helped you make the special traps and arrows  ain   t that right  bill .         traps .     whispered tiffany .  nanny just nudged her and pointed down .  the floorboards were covered in ferociously spiked mantraps .   they were all drawn in charcoal .      i said isn   t that right  bill .     nanny repeated  raising her voice .     she helped you with the traps .         she did that .     said mr .  hogparsley .     hah .  i wouldn   t want to get on the wrong side o    her .         right  so no shootin    arrows at anyone except death  right .  otherwise mistress weatherwax won   t make you any more     said nanny  putting a bottle on the old wooden box that was mr .  hogparsley   s bedside table .     here   s some of your jollop  freshly mixed up .  where did she tell you to keep the pain .         it   s sitting up here on my shoulder  missus  being no trouble .      nanny touched the shoulder  and seemed to think for a moment .     it   s a brown and white squiggle .  sort of oblong .         that   s right  missus     said mr .  hogparsley  pulling at the cork on the bottle .     it wiggles away there and i laughs at it .     the cork popped out .  suddenly  the room smelled of apples .      it   s gettin    big     said nanny .     mistress weatherwax will be along tonight to take it away .         right you are  missus     said the old man  filling a mug to the brim .      try not to shoot her  all right .  it only makes her mad .      it was snowing again when they stepped out of the cottage  big feathery flakes that meant business .      i reckon that   s it for today     nanny announced .     i   ve got things to see to over in slice  but we   ll take the stick tomorrow .         that arrow he fired at us       said tiffany .      imaginary     said nanny ogg  smiling .      it looked real for a moment .      nanny ogg chuckled .     it   s amazing what esme weatherwax can make people imagine .         like traps for death .         oh  yes .  well  it gives the old boy an interest in life .  he   s on his way to the door .  but at least esme   s seen to it that there   s no pain .         because it   s floating over his shoulder .     said tiffany .      yep .  she put it just outside his body for him  so it don   t hurt     said nanny  the snow crunching under her feet .      i didn   t know you could do that .         i can do it for small stuff  toothaches and the like .  esme   s the champion for it  though .  we   re none of us too proud to call her in .  y   know  she   s very good at people .  funny  really     cuz she doesn   t like    em much .      tiffany glanced at the sky  and nanny was the kind of inconvenient person who notices everything .      wondering if lover boy is goin    to drop in .     she said with a big grin .      nanny .  really .         but you are  aren   t you .     said nanny  who knew no shame .     o    course  he   s always around  when you think about it .  you   re walking through him  you feel him on your skin  you stamp him off your boots when you go indoors           just don   t talk like that  please .     said tiffany .      besides  what   s time to an elemental .     nanny chattered .     and i suppose snowflakes don   t just make themselves  especially when you   ve got to get the arms and legs right    .      she   s looking at me out of the corner of her eye to see if i   m going red  tiffany thought .  i know it .   then nanny nudged her in the ribs and laughed one of her laughs that would make a rock blush .      good for you .     she said .     i   ve had a few boyfriends myself that i   d have loved to stamp off my boots .          tiffany was just getting ready for bed that night when she found a book under her pillow .   the title  in fiery red letters  was passion   s plaything by marjory j .  boddice  and in smaller print were the words  gods and men said their love was not to be  but they would not listen .  .  a tortured tale of a tempestuous romance by the author of sundered hearts .  .  .   the cover showed  up close  a young woman with dark hair and clothes that were a bit on the skimpy side in tiffany   s opinion  both hair and clothes blowing in the wind .  she looked desperately determined  and also a bit chilly .  a young man on a horse was watching her some distance away .  it appeared that a thunderstorm was blowing up .   strange .  there was a library stamp inside  and nanny didn   t use the library .  well  it wouldn   t hurt to read a bit before blowing the candle out .   tiffany turned to page one .  and then to page two .  when she got to page nineteen she went and fetched the unexpurgated dictionary .   she had older sisters and she knew some of this  she told herself .  but marjory j .  boddice had got some things laughably wrong .  girls on the chalk didn   t often run away from a young man who was rich enough to own his own horse   or not for long and not without giving him a chance to catch up .  and megs  the heroine of the book  clearly didn   t know a thing about farming .  no young man would be interested in a woman who couldn   t dose a cow or carry a piglet .  what kind of help would she be around the place .  standing around with lips like cherries wouldn   t get the cows milked or the sheep sheared .   and that was another thing .  did marjory j .  boddice know anything about sheep .  this was a sheep farm in the summertime  wasn   t it .  so when did they shear the sheep .  the second most important occasion in a sheep farm   s year and it wasn   t worth mentioning .   of course  they might have a breed like habbakuk polls or lowland cobbleworths that didn   t need shearing  but these were rare and any sensible author would surely have mentioned it .   and the scene in chapter five  where megs left the sheep to fend for themselves while she went gathering nuts with roger   well  how stupid was that .  they could have wandered anywhere  and they were really stupid to think they   d find nuts in june .   she read on a bit further  and thought  oh .  i see .  hmm .  hah .  not nuts at all  then .  on the chalk  that sort of thing was called    looking for cuckoo nests .      she stopped there to go downstairs to fetch a fresh candle  got back into bed  let her feet warm up again  and went on reading .   should megs marry sulky dark eyed william  who already owned two and a half cows  or should she be swayed by roger  who called her    my proud beauty    but was clearly a bad man because he rode a black stallion and had a mustache .   why did she think she had to marry either of them .  tiffany wondered .  anyway  she spent too much time leaning meaningfully against things and pouting .  wasn   t anyone doing any work .  and if she always dressed like that  she   d catch a chill .   it was amazing what those men put up with .  but it made you think .   she blew out the candle and sank gently under the eiderdown  which was as white as snow .       snow covered the chalk .  it fell around the sheep  making them look a dirty yellow .  it covered the stars but glowed by its own light .  it stuck to the windows of the cottages  blotting out the orange candlelight .  but it would never cover the castle .  the castle stood on a mound a little way from the village  a tower of stone ruling all those thatched homes .  they looked as if they had grown from the land  but the castle nailed it down .  it said  i own .   in his room  roland wrote carefully .  he ignored the hammering from outside .   annagramma  petulia  miss treason   tiffany   s letters were full of faraway people with strange sounding names .  sometimes he tried to imagine them  and wondered if she was making them up .  the whole witchcraft business seemed   well  not as advertised .  it seemed like        do you hear this  you wicked boy .     aunt danuta sounded triumphant .     now it   s barred from this side too .  hah .  this is for your own good  you know .  you will stay in there until you are ready to apologize .         like hard work  to be honest .  worthy  though  visiting the sick and everything  but very busy and not very magical .  he   d heard of    dancing around without your drawers on    and tried his best not to imagine it  but in any case there didn   t seem to be anything like that .  even broomstick rides sounded        and we know about your secret passage now  oh yes .  it   s being walled up .  no more thumbing your nose at people who are doing their very best for you .         dull .  he paused for a moment  staring blankly at the carefully stacked piles of loaves and sausages beside his bed .  i ought to get some onions tonight  he thought .  general tacticus says they are unsurpassable for the proper operation of the digestive system if you can   t find fresh fruit .   what to write  what to write   yes .  he   d tell her about the party .  he   d only gone because his father  in one of his good moments  had asked him to .  it was important to keep in with the neighbors but not with the relatives .  it   d been quite nice to get out  and he   d been able to leave his horse at mr .  gamely   s stable  where the aunts wouldn   t think of looking for it .  yes   she   d enjoy hearing about the party .   the aunts were shouting again  about locking the door to his father   s room .  and they were blocking the secret passage .  that meant that all he was left with was the loose stone that came out behind the tapestry in the next room  the wobbly flagstone that could let him drop down into the room below  and  of course  the chain outside the window that let him climb all the way down to the ground .  and on his desk  on top of general tacticus   s book  was a complete set of shiny new castle keys .  he   d got mr .  gamely to make them for him .  the blacksmith was a thoughtful man who could see the sense in being friendly to the next baron .   he could come and go as he liked  whatever they did .  they could bully his father  they could shout all they pleased  but they would never own him .   you could learn a lot from books .       the wintersmith was learning .  it was a hard  slow task when you had to make your brain out of ice .  but he had learned about snowmen .  they were built by the smaller kinds of humans .  that was interesting .  apart from the ones in pointy hats  the bigger humans didn   t seem to hear him .  they knew invisible creatures didn   t speak to them out of the air .   the small ones  though  hadn   t found out what was impossible .   in the big city was a big snowman .   actually  it would be more honest to call it a slushman .  technically it was snow  but by the time it had spiraled down through the big city   s fogs  smogs  and smokes  it was already a sort of yellowish gray  and then most of what ended up on the pavement was what had been thrown up from the gutter by cart wheels .  it was  at best  a mostly snowman .  but three grubby children were building it anyway  because building something that you could call a snowman was what you did .  even if it was yellow .   they   d done their best with what they could find and had given him two horse droppings for eyes and a dead rat for a nose .   at which point the snowman spoke to them  in their heads .   small humans  why do you do that .   the boy who might have been the older boy looked at the girl who might have been the older girl .     i   ll tell you i heard that if you say you heard it too     he said .   the girl was still young enough not to think    snowmen can   t talk    when one of them had just spoken to her  so she said to it     you have to put them in to make you a snowman  mister .      does that make me human .      no     cuz       she hesitated .      you ain   t got innards     said the third and smallest child  who might have been the younger boy or the younger girl  but who was spherical with so many layers of clothing that it was quite impossible to tell .  it did have a pink woolly hat with a bobble on it  but that didn   t mean anything .  someone did care about it  though  because they   d embroidered    r    and    l    on its mittens     f    and    b    on the front and back of its coat     t    on top of the bobble hat  and probably    u    on the underside of its rubber boots .  that meant that while you couldn   t know what it was  you could be certain it was the right way up and which way it was facing .   a cart went by  throwing up another wave of slush .   innards .  said the secret voice of the snowman .  made of special dust  yes .  but what dust .      iron     said the possibly older boy promptly .     enough iron to make a nail .         oh  yeah  that   s right  that   s how it goes     said the possibly older girl .     we used to skip to it .  er      iron enough to make a nail   water enough to drown a cow              a dog     said the possibly older boy .     it   s    water enough to drown a dog  sulfur enough to stop the fleas .     it   s    poison enough to kill a cow .         what is this .  the wintersmith asked .      it   s   like   an old song     said the possibly older boy .      more like a sort of poem .  everyone knows it     said the possibly older girl .         s called    these are the things that make a man        said the child who was the right way up .   tell me the rest of it  the wintersmith demanded  and on the freezing pavement they did  as much as they knew .   when they   d finished  the possibly older boy said hopefully     is there any chance you can take us flying .      no  said the wintersmith .  i have things to find .  things that make a man .       one afternoon  when the sky was growing cold  there was a frantic knocking on nanny   s door .  it turned out to be caused by annagramma  who almost fell into the room .  she looked terrible  and her teeth were chattering .   nanny and tiffany stood her by the fire  but she started talking before her teeth had warmed up .      skkkkulls .     she managed .   oh dear  thought tiffany .      what about them .     she said  as nanny ogg hurried in from the kitchen with a hot drink .      mmmmmiss trrreason   s skkkkulls .         yes .  what about them .      annagramma took a swig from the mug .     what did you do with them .     she gasped  cocoa dribbling down her chin .      buried them .         oh  no .  why .         they were skulls .  you can   t just leave skulls lying about .      annagramma looked around wildly .     can you lend me a shovel  then .         annagramma .  you can   t dig up miss treason   s grave .         but i need some skulls .     annagramma insisted .     the people there   well  it   s like the olden days .  i whitewashed that place with my own hands .  have you any idea how long it takes to whitewash over black .  they complained .  they won   t have anything to do with crystal therapy  they just frown and say miss treason gave them sticky black medicine that tasted horrible but worked .  and they keep on asking me to sort out stupid little problems  and i don   t have a clue what they   re about .  and this morning there was this old man who   s dead and i   ve got to lay him out and sit up with him tonight .  well  i mean  that   s so   yuk    .      tiffany glanced at nanny ogg  who was sitting in her chair and puffing gently on her pipe .  her eyes were gleaming .  when she saw tiffany   s expression  she winked and said     i   ll leave you girls to have a little chat  shall i .         yes  please  nanny .  and please don   t listen at the door .         to a private conversation .  the very idea .     said nanny  and went into the kitchen .      will she listen .     whispered annagramma .     i   ll just die if mistress weatherwax finds out .      tiffany sighed .  did annagramma know anything .     of course she   ll listen     she said .     she   s a witch .         but she said she wouldn   t .         she   ll listen  but she   ll pretend she hasn   t and she won   t tell anyone     said tiffany .     it   s her cottage  after all .      annagramma looked desperate .     and on tuesday i   ve probably got to go and deliver a baby out in some valley somewhere .  an old woman came and gabbled at me about it .         that   ll be mrs .  owslick     said tiffany .     i did leave some notes  you know .  didn   t you read them .         i think perhaps mrs .  earwig tidied them away     annagramma said .      you should have looked at them .  it took me an hour to write them all down .     said tiffany reproachfully .     three pieces of paper .  look  calm down  will you .  didn   t you learn anything about midwifery .         mrs .  earwig said giving birth is a natural action and nature should be allowed to take its course     said annagramma  and tiffany was sure she heard a snort from behind the kitchen door .     i know a soothing chant  though .         well  i expect that will be a help     said tiffany weakly .      mrs .  earwig said the village women know what to do     said annagramma hopefully .     she says to trust in their peasant wisdom .         well  mrs .  obble was the old woman who called  and she has just got simple peasant ignorance     said tiffany .     she puts leaf mold on wounds if you don   t watch her .  look  just because a woman   s got no teeth doesn   t mean she   s wise .  it might just mean she   s been stupid for a very long time .  don   t let her anywhere near mrs .  owslick until after the baby .  it   s not going to be an easy birth as it is .         well  i know plenty of spells that will help           no .  no magic .  only to take away pain .  surely you know that .         yes  but mrs .  earwig says           why don   t you go and ask mrs .  earwig to help you then .      annagramma stared at tiffany .  that sentence had come out a bit louder than intended .  and then annagramma   s face slid into what she probably thought was a friendly expression .  it made her look slightly mad .      hey  i   ve got a great idea .     she said  as bright as a crystal that was about to shatter .     why don   t you come back to the cottage and work for me .         no .  i   ve got other work to do .         but you   re so good at the messy stuff  tiffany     said annagramma in a syrupy voice .     it seems to come naturally to you .         i started at the lambing when i was small  that   s why .  small hands can get inside and untangle things .      and now annagramma had that hunted look she got when she was dealing with anything she didn   t immediately understand .      inside the sheep .  you mean up its           yes .  of course .         untangle things .         sometimes the lambs try to get born backward     said tiffany .      backward     muttered annagramma weakly .      and it can be worse if there   s twins .         twins       then annagramma said  as if spotting the flaw     but look  i   ve seen lots of pictures of shepherds and sheep and there   s never anything like that .  i thought it was all just   standing around and watching the sheep eat grass .      there were times when you could feel that the world would be a better place if annagramma got the occasional slap around the ear .  the silly unthinking insults  her huge lack of interest in anyone other than herself  the way she treated everyone as if they were slightly deaf and a bit stupid   it could make your blood boil .  but you put up with it because every once in a while you saw through it all .  inside there was this worried  frantic little face watching the world like a bunny watching a fox  and screaming at it in the hope that it would go away and not hurt her .  and a meeting of witches  who were supposed to be clever  had handed her this steading that would be a hard job for anyone .   it didn   t make sense .   no  it didn   t make sense .      it only happens when there   s a difficult lambing     said tiffany  while her mind raced .     and that means it   s out in the dark and the cold and the rain .  artists never seem to be around then .  it   s amazing .         why are you looking at me like that .     said annagramma .     like i   m not here .      tiffany blinked .  all right  she thought  how am i supposed to deal with this .      look  i   ll come and help you with the laying out     she said  as calmly as she could manage .     and i expect i can help with mrs .  owslick .  or ask petulia .  she   s good .  but you   ll have to do the watching by yourself .         sitting up all night with a dead person .     said annagramma  and shivered .      you can take a book to read     said tiffany .      i suppose i could draw a circle of protection around the chair       annagramma muttered .      no     said tiffany .     no magic .  mrs .  earwig must have told you this .         but a circle of protection           it draws attention .  something might turn up to see why it   s there .  don   t worry  it   s just to make the old people happy .         er   when you say that something might turn up       annagramma began .   tiffany sighed .     all right  i   ll sit up with you  just this once     she said .  annagramma beamed .      and as for skulls     said tiffany     just wait a moment .     she went upstairs and got the boffo catalogue  which she   d hidden in her old suitcase .  she came back with it carefully rolled up and handed it over .     don   t look at it now     she said .     wait until you   re alone .  you might find it gives you ideas .  okay .  i   ll come and meet you around seven tonight .      when annagramma had gone  tiffany sat and counted under her breath .  when she   d got to five  nanny ogg came and vigorously dusted a few ornaments before saying     oh  has your little friend gone .         do you think i   m being silly .     said tiffany .   nanny stopped pretending to do housework .     i don   t know what you   re talkin    about  not havin    listened     she said     but if i had been listenin     i   d think you won   t get any thanks  that   s what i   d think .         granny shouldn   t have meddled     said tiffany .      shouldn   t have  eh .     said nanny  her face blank .      i   m not stupid  nanny     said tiffany .     i   ve worked it out .         worked it out  have you .  there   s a clever girl     said nanny ogg  sitting down in her chair .     and what is it you   ve worked out then .      this was going to get difficult .  nanny was usually cheerful all the time .  when she went solemn  like she was now  it could make you nervous .  but tiffany pressed on .      i couldn   t take on a cottage     she said .     oh  i can do most of the everyday stuff  but you need to be older to run a steading .  there   s things people won   t tell you if you   re thirteen  hat or not .  but granny put it about that she was suggesting me  and so everyone saw it as a contest between me and annagramma  right .  and they chose her because she   s older and sounds really competent .  and now it   s all falling apart .  it   s not her fault she was taught magic instead of witchcraft .  granny just wants her to fail so that everyone will know that mrs .  earwig is a bad teacher .  and i don   t think that   s good .         i wouldn   t be too quick to decide what it is esme weatherwax wants  if i was you     said nanny ogg .     i won   t say a word  mind you .  you go off and help your friend if you want  but you   ve still got to work for me  okay .  that   s only fair .  how   s the feet .         they feel fine  nanny .  thank you for asking .          more than a hundred miles away  mr .  fusel johnson knew nothing about tiffany  nanny ogg  or indeed anything very much except for clocks and watches  which he made for a living .  he also knew how to lime wash a kitchen  which was an easy and cheap way to get a nice white look even if the stuff was a bit runny .  and therefore he had no idea why several handfuls of the white powder fountained up out of the mixing bowl before he could add the water  hung in the air for a moment like a ghost  and vanished up the chimney .  in the end he put it down to too many trolls moving into the area .  this wasn   t very logical  but such beliefs generally aren   t .   and the wintersmith thought  lime enough to make a man .       that night tiffany sat up with annagramma and old mr .  tissot  except that he was lying down because he was dead .  tiffany had never liked watching over the dead .  it wasn   t exactly something you could like .  it was always a relief when the sky turned gray and the birds started to sing .   sometimes  in the night  mr .  tissot made little noises .  except  of course  it wasn   t mr .  tissot  who   d met death hours ago .  it was just the body he   d left behind  and the sounds it made were really no different from the noises made by an old house as it cooled down .   it was important to remember these things around two o   clock in the morning .  vitally important  when the candle flickered .   annagramma snored .  no one with a nose that small should be able to make a snore that loud .  it was like ripping planks .  whatever evil spirits might be around on this night  that sound would probably scare them away .   it wasn   t the gnh gnh gnh part that was so bad  and tiffany could live with the bloooooorrrrt .  it was the gap between them  after the gnh gnh gnh had wound up but before the long letdown of the bloooooorrrrt .  that really got on her nerves .  it was never the same length twice .  sometimes there was gnh gnh gnh bloooooorrrrt .   one right after the other  and then there might be such a huge gap after gnh gnh gnh that tiffany found herself holding her breath while she waited for the bloooooorrrrt .  it wouldn   t have been so bad if annagramma had stuck to one length of pause .  sometimes she stopped altogether  and there was blessed silence until a festival of bloorts began  usually with a faint mni mni lip smacking sound as annagramma shifted position in her chair .   where are you  flower lady .  what are you .  you should be sleeping .   the voice was so faint that tiffany might not have heard it at all if she hadn   t been all tensed up waiting for the next gnh gnh gnh .  and here it came     gnh gnh gnh .   let me show you my world  flower lady .  let me show you all the colors of ice .   bloooooorrrrt .   about three quarters of tiffany thought  oh  no .  will he find me if i reply .  no .  if he could find me  he   d be here .  my hand isn   t itching .   the other quarter thought  a god or godlike being is talking to me and i could really do without the snoring  annagramma  thank you so much .   gnh gnh gnh .      i said i was sorry     she whispered into the dancing candlelight .     i saw the iceberg .  it was very   er   nice of you .      i have made many more .   bloooooorrrrt .   many more icebergs  thought tiffany .  great big freezing  floating mountains that look like me  dragging fog banks and snowstorms behind them .  i wonder how many ships will run into them .      you shouldn   t have gone to all that trouble     she whispered .   now i am growing stronger .  i am listening and learning .  i am understanding humans .   outside the cottage window a thrush began to sing .  tiffany blew out the candle  and gray light crept into the room .   listening and learning   how could a blizzard understand things .   tiffany  flower lady .  i am making myself a man .   there was a complicated grunting as annagramma   s gnh gnh gnh and bloooooorrrrt .  ran into each other and she woke up .      ah     she said  stretching her arms and yawning .  she looked around .     well  that seemed to go well .      tiffany stared at the wall .  what did he mean  making himself a man .  surely he        you didn   t fall asleep  did you  tiffany .     said annagramma in what she probably thought was a playful voice .     not even for one tiny little second .         what .     said tiffany  glaring at the wall .     oh   no .  i didn   t .      people were moving around downstairs .  after a little while there was a creaking on the stairs and the low door was pushed open .  a middle aged man  looking sheepishly at the floor  uttered     mam says would you ladies like some breakfast .         oh  no  we couldn   t possibly take what little you have       annagramma began .      yes  please  we will be grateful     said tiffany  louder and quicker .  the man nodded  and shut the door .      oh  how could you say that .     said annagramma  as his footsteps creaked down .     these are poor people .  i thought you would           shut up  will you .     snapped tiffany .     just shut up and wake up .  these are real people .  they   re not some kind of  of  of idea .  we will go down there and we will eat breakfast and we   ll say how good it is and then we will thank them and they will thank us and we will go .  and that will mean everyone has done the right thing by custom  and that will be what   s important to them .  besides  they don   t think they   re poor  because everyone around here is poor .  but they   re not so poor they can   t afford to do the right things .  that would be poor .      annagramma was staring at her with her mouth open .      be careful what you say next     said tiffany  breathing heavily .     in fact  don   t say anything .      breakfast was ham and eggs .  it was eaten in polite silence .  after that  in the same silence except that it was outdoors  they flew back to what people would probably always think of as miss treason   s cottage .   there was a small boy loitering outside .  as soon as they landed  he blurted out     mrs .  obble says the baby   s on the way an    she said you   d give me a penny for goin    .         you have got a bag  haven   t you .     said tiffany  turning to annagramma .      yes  er  lots .         i mean a call out bag .  you know  you keep it by the door with everything in it that you   ll need if        tiffany saw the terrified look on the girl   s face .     okay  so you haven   t got a bag .  we   ll just have to do the best we can .  give him a penny and let   s go .         can we get anyone to help if it goes wrong .     annagramma asked as they left the ground .      we are the help     said tiffany simply .     and since this is your steading  i   m giving you the really tough job           which was keeping mrs .  obble occupied .  mrs .  obble wasn   t a witch  although most people thought she was .  she looked like one   that is  she looked like someone who   d bought everything in the boffo catalogue on the day of the special offer on hairy warts   and she was mildly crazy and should not have been allowed within a mile of any mother who was going to have her first baby  since she would very conscientiously tell them  or cackle at them  anyway  about all the things that could go wrong in a way that made it sound as if they would all go wrong .  she wasn   t a bad nurse  though  once you stopped her from putting a leaf mold poultice on everything .   things went noisily and with a certain amount of fuss  but nothing like mrs .  obble had predicted  and the result was a baby boy  who was not a bouncing baby but only because tiffany caught him  annagramma didn   t know how to hold babies .   she did look good in a pointy hat  though  and since she was clearly older than tiffany and did hardly any of the work  the other women assumed she was in charge .   tiffany left her holding the baby  the right way up  this time  and looking proud  and began the long flight back through the woods to tir nani ogg .  it was a crisp evening  but there was a bit of wind that blew stinging snow crystals off the trees .  it was an exhausting journey and very  very cold .  he can   t know where i am  she repeated to herself as she flew back in the dusk .  and he   s not very clever .  winter has to end sometime  right .   er   how .  said her second thoughts .  miss tick said you just have to be there  but surely you have to do something else .   i suppose i   ll have to walk around with my shoes off  tiffany thought .   everywhere .  her second thoughts wondered  as she swerved between the trees .   it   s probably like being a queen  her third thoughts said .  she just has to sit in a palace and maybe do a bit of driving around in a big coach and waving  and all over a huge kingdom monarching is going on .   but as she avoided more trees  she also tried to avoid the little scurrying thought that was trying to creep into her mind  sooner or later  one way or the other  he will find you   and how can he make himself a man .       assistant postmaster groat did not believe in doctors .  they made you ill  he thought .  so he put sulfur in his socks every morning and he was proud to say that he had never had a day   s illness in his life .  this may have been because not many people cared to come very close to him  because of the smell .  something did  though .  a gale roared into his post office when he was opening the door one morning and blew his socks clean off .    and no one heard the wintersmith say     sulfur enough to make a man .          nanny ogg was sitting by the fire when tiffany came in  stamping snow off her boots .      you look frozen all through     nanny said .     you need a glass of hot milk with a drop of brandy in it  that   s what you need .         ooh  yyess       tiffany managed through chattering teeth .      get me one too  then  will you .     said nanny .     only joking .  you get warmed up  i   ll see to the drink .      tiffany   s feet felt like blocks of ice .  she knelt by the fire and stretched out her hand to the stockpot on its big black hook .  it bubbled all the time .   get your mind right  and balance .  reach out and cup your hands around it  and concentrate  concentrate  on your freezing boots .   after a while her toes felt warm and then        ow .     tiffany pulled her hands away and sucked at her fingers .      didn   t have your mind right     said nanny ogg from the doorway .      well  you know  that   s just a bit difficult when you   ve had a long day and you didn   t sleep much and the wintersmith is looking for you     snapped tiffany .      the fire doesn   t care     said nanny  shrugging .     hot milk coming up .      things were a little better when tiffany had warmed up .  she wondered how much brandy nanny had added to the milk .  nanny had done one for herself  with probably some milk added to the brandy .      isn   t this nice and cozy     said nanny after a while .      is this going to be the talk about sex .     said tiffany .      did anyone say there was going to be one .     said nanny innocently .      i kind of got the feeling     said tiffany .     and i know where babies come from  mrs .  ogg .         i should hope so .         i know how they get there  too .  i live on a farm and i   ve got a lot of older sisters .         ah  right     said nanny .     well  i see you   re pretty well prepared for life  then .  not much left for me to tell you  i expect .  and i   ve never had a god pay any attention to me  as far as i can recall .  flattered  are you .         no .     tiffany looked into nanny   s smile .     well  a bit     she admitted .      and frightened of him .         yes .         well  the poor thing hasn   t quite got it right yet .  he started off so well  with the ice roses and everything  and then he wanted to show you his muscles .  typical .  but you shouldn   t be frightened of him .  he should be frightened of you .         why .  because i   m pretending to be the flower woman .         because you   re a girl .  it   s a poor lookout if a bright girl can   t wind a boy around her little finger .  he   s smitten with you .  you could make his life a misery with a word .  why  when i was a girl  a young man nearly threw himself off the lancre bridge because i spurned his advances .         he did .  what happened .         i unspurned    em .  well  he looked so pretty standing there  and i thought  that   s a good looking bum on him if ever i saw one .     nanny sat back .     and think about poor ol    greebo .  he   ll fight anything .  but esme   s little white kitten leaped straight at him  and now the poor dear won   t come into this room without peering around the door to check that she   s not here .  you should see his poor little face when he does  too .  it   s all wrinkled up .  o    course  he could tear her into bits with one claw  but he can   t now    cuz she   s fixed his head .         you   re not saying i should try to tear the wintersmith   s face off  are you .         no  no  you don   t have to be as blunt as that .  give him a little hope .  be kind but firm           he wants to marry me .         good .         good .         that means he wants to stay friendly .  don   t say no  don   t say yes .  act like a queen .  he   s got to learn to show you some respect .  what are you doing .         writing this down     said tiffany  scribbling in her diary .      you don   t need to write it down  love     said nanny .     it   s written down in you somewhere .  on a page you haven   t read yet  i reckon .  which reminds me  these came when you were out .     nanny fished down among the seat cushions and pulled out a couple of envelopes .     my boy shawn is the postman  so he knew you   d moved .      tiffany nearly snatched them out of her hand .  two letters .     like him  do you .  your young man in the castle .     said nanny .      he   s a friend who writes to me     said tiffany haughtily .      that   s right  that   s just the look and voice you need for dealing with the wintersmith .     said nanny  looking delighted .     who does he think he is  daring to talk to you .  that   s the way .         i shall read them in my room     said tiffany .   nanny nodded .     one of the girls did us a lovely casserole     she said  famously  nanny never remembered the names of her daughters in law  .     yours is in the oven .  i   m off to the pub .  early start tomorrow .          alone in her room  tiffany read the first letter .   to the unaided eye  not much happened on the chalk .  it had avoided history .  it was a place of small things .  tiffany enjoyed reading about them .   the second letter seemed to be much the same as the first one   until the bit about the ball .  he   d gone to a ball .  it was at the house of lord diver  who was a neighbor .  he   d danced with his daughter  who was called iodine because lord diver thought that was a nice name for a girl .  they   d had three dances .  .  and ice cream .  .  iodine had shown him her watercolors .  .  .   how could he sit there and write such things .  .  .  .   tiffany   s eyes moved on  over the everyday news like the bad weather and what had happened to old aggie   s leg  but the words didn   t enter her head because it was on fire .   who did he think he was  dancing with another girl .   you danced with the wintersmith  her third thoughts said .   all right  but what about the watercolors .   the wintersmith showed you the snowflakes  said her third thoughts .   but i was just being polite .   perhaps he was just being polite  too .   all right  but i know those aunts  tiffany thought furiously .  they   ve never liked me  because i   m only a farm girl .  and lord diver   s very rich and his daughter is his only child .  they   re scheming .   how could he sit there and write as if eating ice cream with another girl was a perfectly normal thing to do .  that was as bad as   well  something pretty bad  at least .   as for looking at her watercolors     he   s just a boy you happen to write to  said her third thoughts .   yes  well     yes  well   what .  her third thoughts persisted .  they were getting on tiffany   s nerves .  your own brains ought to have the decency to be on your side .   just    yes  well       okay .  she thought angrily .   you   re not being very sensible about this .   oh  really .  well  i   ve been sensible all day .  i   ve been sensible for years .  i think i   m owed five minutes of being really unreasonably angry  don   t you .   there   s some casserole downstairs  and you haven   t eaten since breakfast  said her third thoughts .  you   ll feel better after you   ve eaten something .   how can i eat stew when people are looking at watercolors .  how dare he look at watercolors .   but her third thoughts were right   not that this made things any better .  if you   re going to be angry and miserable  you might as well be so on a full stomach .  she went downstairs and found the casserole in the oven .  it smelled good .  nothing but the best for dear ol    mum .   she opened the cutlery drawer for a spoon .  the drawer stuck .  she rattled it  pulled at it  and swore a few times  but it stayed stuck .      oh  yes  go ahead     said a voice behind her .     see how much help that is .  don   t be sensible and stick your hand under the top and carefully free up the stuck item .  oh no .  rattle and curse  that   s the way .      tiffany turned .   there was a skinny  tired looking woman standing by the kitchen table .  she seemed to be wearing a sheet draped around her and was smoking a cigarette .  tiffany had never seen a woman smoke a cigarette before  but especially never a cigarette that burned with a fat red flame and gave off sparks .      who are you  and what are you doing in mrs .  ogg   s kitchen .     tiffany said sharply .   this time it was the woman who looked surprised .      you can hear me .     she said .     and see me .         yes .     tiffany snarled .     and this is a food preparation area  you know .         you   re not supposed to be able to see me .         well  i   m looking at you .         hold on a minute     said the woman  frowning at tiffany .     you   re not just a human  are you    .     she squinted oddly for a moment and then said     oh  you   re her .  am i right .  the new summer .         never mind me  who are you .     said tiffany .     and it was only one dance .         anoia  goddess of things that get stuck in drawers     said the woman .     pleased to meet you .     she took another puff at the flaming cigarette  and there were more sparks .  some of them dropped on the floor but didn   t seem to do any damage .      there   s a goddess just for that .     said tiffany .      well  i find lost corkscrews and things that roll under furniture     said anoia offhandedly .     sometimes things that get lost under sofa cushions  too .  they want me to do stuck zippers  and i   m thinking about that .  but mostly i manifest whensoever people rattle stuck drawers and call upon the gods .     she puffed on her cigarette .     got any tea .         but i didn   t call on anyone .         you did     said anoia  blowing more sparks .     you cussed .  sooner or later  every curse is a prayer .     she waved the hand that wasn   t holding the cigarette and something in the drawer went pling .     it   ll be all right now .  it was the egg slicer .  everyone has one  and no one knows why .  did anyone in the world ever knowingly go out one day and buy an egg slicer .  i don   t think so .      tiffany tried the drawer .  it slid out easily .      about that tea .     said anoia  sitting down .   tiffany put the kettle on .     you know about me .     she asked .      oh  yes     said anoia .     it   s been quite some time since a god fell in love with a mortal .  everyone wants to see how it turns out .         fell in love .         oh  yes .         and you mean the gods are watching .         well  of course     said anoia .     most of the big ones don   t do anything else these days .  but i   m supposed to do zippers  oh yes  and my hands get very stiff in this weather .      tiffany glanced at the ceiling  which was now full of smoke .      they   re watching all the time .     she said  aghast .      i heard you   re getting more interest than the war in klatchistan  and that was pretty popular     said anoia  holding out her red hands .     look  chilblains .  not that they care  of course .         even when i   m having a   wash .     said tiffany .   the goddess laughed nastily .     yes .  and they can see in the dark  too .  best not to think about it .      tiffany looked up at the ceiling again .  she had been hoping for a bath tonight .      i   ll try not to     she said darkly  and added     is it   hard  being a goddess .         it has its good days     said anoia .  she stood with her cigarette arm cupped at the elbow by her other hand  holding the flaming  sparking thing close to her face .  now she took a sharp pull  raised her head  and blew a cloud of smoke out to join the smog on the ceiling .  sparks fell out of it like rain .     i haven   t been doing drawers long .  i used to be a volcano goddess .         really .     said tiffany .     i   d never have guessed .         oh  yes .  it was good work  apart from the screaming     said anoia  and then added in a bitter tone of voice     ha .  and the god of storms was always raining on my lava .  that   s men for you  dear .  they rain on your lava .         and look at watercolors     said tiffany .   anoia   s eyes narrowed .     someone else   s watercolors .         yes .         men .  they   re all the same     said anoia .     take my advice  dear  and show mr .  wintersmith the door .  he   s only an elemental  after all .      tiffany glanced at the door .      give him the boot  dear  send him packing and change the locks .  let   s have summer all year round like the hot countries do .  grapes all over the place  eh .  coconuts on every tree .  hah  when i was in the volcano game  i couldn   t move for mangoes .  kiss good bye to snow and fog and slush .  have you got the thingy yet .         the thingy .     said tiffany  looking worried .      it   ll turn up  i daresay     said anoia .     i hear it can be a bit tricky to   oops  i hear rattling  must fly  don   t worry  i won   t tell him where you are        she vanished .  so did the smoke .   not knowing what else to do  tiffany ladled out a plate of hearty meat and vegetables and ate it .  so   she could see gods now .  and they knew about her .  and everyone wanted to give her advice .   it was not a good idea to come to the attention of those in high places  her father had said .   but it was impressive .  in love with her  eh .  and telling everyone .  but he was really an elemental  not a proper god at all .  all he knew was how to move wind and water around .   even so   huh .  some people have elementals running after them .  oh yes .  how about that .  if people were stupid enough to dance around with girls who painted watercolors to lead honest men to their doom  well  she could be haughty to people who were almost gods .  she ought to mention that in a letter  except that of course she wasn   t going to be writing to him now .  hah .       and a few miles away old mother blackcap  who made her own soap out of animal fat and potash made  indeed  from plant ashes  felt a bar of soap snatched from her hand just as she was about to boil some sheets .  the tub of water froze solid  too .   being a witch  she immediately said     there   s a strange thief about .      and the wintersmith said     potash enough to make a man .          chapter eight      the horn of plenty      that night  after nanny ogg had gone to bed  tiffany did have the bath she   d been looking forward to .  this was not something to be taken lightly .  first  the tin bath had to be fetched from its hook on the back of the privy  which was at the bottom of the garden  and dragged through the dark  freezing night to a place of honor in front of the fire .  then kettles had to be heated over the fire and on the black kitchen stove  and getting even six inches of warm water was an effort .  afterward  the water all had to be scooped out and into the sink and the bath moved into a corner  ready to be taken outside in the morning .  when you had to do all that  you might as well scrub every inch .   tiffany did one extra thing  she wrote private .  .  on a piece of cardboard and wedged it in the hanging lamp in the center of the room so that it could be read only from above .  she wasn   t sure it would put off any inquisitive gods  but she felt better for doing it .   that night she slept without dreaming .  in the morning snow had put a fresh coating on the drifts  and a couple of nanny ogg   s grandchildren were building her a snowman on the lawn .  they came in after a while and demanded a carrot for the nose and two lumps of coal for the eyes .   nanny took her to the isolated village of slice  where people were always glad and surprised to see someone they weren   t related to .  nanny ogg ambled from cottage to cottage along the paths cut in the snow  drinking enough cups of tea to float an elephant and doing witchcraft in small ways .  mostly it seemed to just consist of gossip  but once you got the hang of it  you could hear the magic happening .  nanny ogg changed the way people thought  even if it was only for a few minutes .  she left people thinking they were slightly better people .  they weren   t  but as nanny said  it gave them something to live up to .   then there was another night without dreams  but tiffany woke up with a snap at half past five  feeling   odd .   she rubbed the frost off the window and saw the snowman by moonlight .   why do we do it .  she wondered .  as soon as there   s snow  we build snowmen .  we do worship the wintersmith  in a way .  we make the snow human    .  we give him coal eyes and a carrot nose to bring him alive .  oh  and i see the children gave him a scarf .  that   s what a snowman needs  a scarf to keep him warm    .   she went down into the silent kitchen  and for want of anything else to do she scrubbed the table .  doing something with her hands helped her think .   something had changed  and it was her .  she   d been worrying about what he would do and what he would think  as if she were just a leaf being blown about by the wind .  she dreaded hearing his voice in her head  where he had no right to be .   well  not now .  not anymore .   he ought to be worried about her .   yes  she   d made a mistake .  yes  it was her fault .  but she wasn   t going to be bullied .  you couldn   t let boys go around raining on your lava and ogling other people   s watercolors .   find the story  granny weatherwax always said .  she believed that the world was full of story shapes .  if you let them  they controlled you .  but if you studied them  if you found out about them   you could use them  you could change them    .   miss treason had known all about stories  yes .  she   d spun them like a spiderweb  to give herself power .  and they worked because people wanted to believe them .  and nanny ogg told a story  too .  fat  jolly nanny ogg  who liked a drink  and another drink  thank you kindly  and was everyone   s favorite grandmother   but those twinkling little eyes could bore into your head and read all your secrets .   even granny aching had a story .  she   d lived in the old shepherding hut  high on the hills  listening to the wind blowing over the turf .  she was mysterious  alone   and the stories floated up and gathered around her  all those stories about her finding lost lambs even though she was dead  all those stories about her  still  watching over people    .   people wanted the world to be a story  because stories had to sound right and they had to make sense .  people wanted the world to make sense .   well  her story wasn   t going to be the story of a little girl who got pushed around .  there was no sense in that .   except   he   s not actually bad .  the gods in the mythology  they seemed to get the hang of being human   a bit too human  sometimes   but how could a snowstorm or a gale ever find out .  he was dangerous and scary   but you couldn   t help feeling sorry for him    .   someone hammered on nanny ogg   s back door .  it turned out to be a tall figure in black .      wrong house     said tiffany .     no one here is even a bit sick .      a hand raised the black hood  and from its depths a voice hissed     it   s me  annagramma .  is she in .         mrs .  ogg   s not up yet     said tiffany .      good .  can i come in .      at the kitchen table  over a cup of warming tea  annagramma revealed all .  life in the woods was not going well .      two men came to see me about some stupid cow they both think they own .     she said .      that   ll be joe broomsocket and shifty adams .  i left you a note about them  too     said tiffany .     whenever one or other of them gets drunk  they argue about that cow .         what am i supposed to do about it .         nod and smile .  wait until the cow dies  miss treason always said .  or one of the men     said tiffany .     it   s the only way .         and a woman came to see me with a sick pig .         what did you do about it .         i told her i don   t do pigs .  but she burst into tears  so i tried bangle   s universal nostrum on it .         you used that on a pig .     said tiffany  shocked .      well  the pig witch uses magic  so i don   t see why       annagramma began defensively .      she knows what works .     said tiffany .      it was perfectly all right when i got it down out of the tree .  she didn   t have to make all that fuss .  i   m sure the bristles will grow back .  in time .         it wasn   t a spotted pig  was it .  and a woman with a squint .     tiffany asked .      yes .  i think so .  does it matter .         mrs .  stumper is very attached to that pig     said tiffany reproachfully .     she brings him up to the cottage about once a week .  it   s usually just an upset stomach .  she feeds him too much .         really .  then i won   t open the door to her next time     said annagramma firmly .      no  let her in .  really  it   s all because she   s lonely and wants to chat .         well  i should think i   ve got better things to do with my time than listen to an old lady who just wants to talk     said annagramma indignantly .   tiffany looked at her .  where did you start  apart from banging the girl   s head on the table until the brain started working .      listen very carefully     she said .     i mean to her  not just to me .  you   ve got no better use of your time than to listen to old ladies who want to talk .  everyone tells things to witches .  so listen to everyone and don   t say much and think about what they say and how they say it and watch their eyes    .  it becomes like a big jigsaw puzzle  but you   re the only one who can see all the pieces .  you   ll know what they want you to know  and what they don   t want you to know  and even what they think no one knows .  that   s why we go around the houses .  that   s why you will go around the houses  until you   re part of their lives .         all this just to get some power over a crowd of farmers and peasants .      tiffany spun around and kicked a chair so hard that it broke a leg .  annagramma backed away quickly .      what did you do that for .         you   re clever   you guess .         oh  i forgot   your father is a shepherd           good .  you remembered .     tiffany hesitated .  certainty was pouring into her brain  courtesy of her third thoughts .  suddenly she knew annagramma .      and your father .     she asked .      what .     annagramma instinctively drew herself up .     oh  he owns several farms           liar .         well  perhaps i should say he is a farmer       the girl began  nervousness beginning to show .      liar .      annagramma backed away .     how dare you talk to me like           how dare you not tell me the truth .      in the pause that opened  tiffany heard everything   the faint crackle of wood in the stove  the sound of mice in the cellar  her own breathing roaring like the sea in a cave    .      he works for a farmer  all right .     said annagramma quickly  and then looked shocked at her own words .     we don   t have any land  we don   t even own the cottage .  there   s the truth  if you want it .  happy now .         no .  but thank you     said tiffany .      are you going to tell the others .         no .  it doesn   t matter .  but granny weatherwax wants you to make a mess of all this  do you understand .  she   s got nothing against you       tiffany hesitated  then went on     i mean  nothing more than she has against everyone .  she just wants people to see that mrs .  earwig   s style of witchcraft doesn   t work .  this is just like her .  she   s not said a word against you  she   s just let you have exactly what you wanted .  it   s like a story .  everyone knows that if you get exactly what you wish for  it all goes bad .  and you wished for a cottage .  and you   re going to mess it up .         i just need another day or two to get the hang           why .  you   re a witch with a cottage .  you   re supposed to be able to deal with it .  why take it on if you couldn   t do it .      you   re supposed to be able to deal with it  sheep girl .  why take it on if you couldn   t do it .      so you   re not going to help me .     annagramma glared at tiffany  and then her expression  most unusually  softened a bit and she said     are you all right .      tiffany blinked .  it   s horrible to have your own voice echo back at you from the other side of your mind .      look  i haven   t got time     she said weakly .     maybe the others can   help out .         i don   t want them to know .     panic cut curves on annagramma   s face .   she can do magic  tiffany thought .  she   s just not good at witchcraft .  she   ll make a mess of it .  she   ll make a mess of people .   she gave in .     all right  i can probably spare some time .  there   s not many chores to do at tir nani ogg .  and i   ll explain things to the others .  they   ll have to know .  they   ll probably help .  you learn fast   you could pick up the basic stuff in a week or so .      tiffany watched annagramma   s face .  she was actually thinking about it .  if she were drowning and you threw her a rope  she   d complain if it was the wrong color    .      well  if they are just helping me       annagramma said  brightening up .   you could almost admire the girl for the way she could rearrange the real world in her head .  another story  thought tiffany  it   s all about annagramma .      yes  we   ll be helping you .     she sighed .      perhaps we could even tell people that you girls are coming to me to learn things .     said annagramma hopefully .   people said that you should always count up to ten before losing your temper .  but if it was annagramma you were dealing with  you had to know some bigger numbers  like perhaps a million .      no     said tiffany     i don   t think we   ll do that .  you are the one doing the learning .      annagramma opened her mouth to argue  saw the look on tiffany   s face  and decided not to .      er  yes     she said .     of course .  er   thank you .      that was a surprise .      they probably will help     said tiffany .     it won   t look good if one of us fails .      to her amazement  the girl really was crying .     it   s just that i didn   t really think they were my friends    .             i don   t like her     said petulia  who was knee deep in pigs .     she calls me the pig witch .         well  you are a pig witch     said tiffany  who was standing outside the pigpen .  the big shed was full of pigs .  the noise was nearly as bad as the smell .  fine snow  like dust  was falling outside .      yes  but when she says it  there   s a good deal too much pig and not enough witch     said petulia .     every time she opens her mouth  i think i   ve done something wrong .     she waved a hand in a pig   s face and muttered a few words .  the animal   s eyes crossed and it opened its mouth .  it got a large dose of green liquid from a bottle .      we can   t just leave her to struggle     said tiffany .     people might get hurt .         well  that wouldn   t be our fault  would it .     said petulia  dosing another pig .  she cupped her hands and shouted over the din to a man at the other end of the pens     fred  this lot   s done .     then she climbed out of the pen  and tiffany saw that she   d got her dress tucked up to her waist and was wearing a pair of heavy leather britches under it .      they   re making a real fuss this morning     she said .     sounds like they   re getting a bit frisky .         frisky .     said tiffany .     oh   yes .         listen  you can hear the boars yelling in their shed     said petulia .     they can smell the spring .         but it   s not even hogswatch yet .         it   s the day after tomorrow .  anyway the springtime sleeps under the snow  my dad always says     said petulia  washing her hands in a bucket .   no ums  said tiffany   s third thoughts .  when she   s working  petulia never says    um .     she   s certain of things when she   s working .  she stands up straight .  she   s in charge .      look  it will be our fault if we can see something wrong and don   t do anything about it     said tiffany .      oh  annagramma again     said petulia .  she shrugged .     look  i can go over there maybe once a week after hogswatch and show her some of the basic stuff .  will that make you happy .         i   m sure she   ll be grateful .         i   m sure she won   t be .  have you asked any of the others .         no .  i thought that if they knew you   d agreed  they probably would  too     said tiffany .      hah .  well  i suppose that at least we can say we tried .  you know  i used to think annagramma was really clever because she knew a lot of words and could do sparkly spells .  but show her a sick pig and she   s useless .      tiffany told her about mrs .  stumper   s pig and petulia looked shocked .      we can   t have that sort of thing     she said .     in a tree .  perhaps i   ll try to drop in this afternoon then .     she hesitated .     you know granny weatherwax won   t be happy about this .  do we want to be caught between her and mrs .  earwig .         are we doing the right thing or not .     said tiffany .     anyway  what   s the worst she could do to us .      petulia gave a short laugh with no humor in it at all .     well     she said     first  she could make our           she won   t .         i wish i was as sure as you     said petulia .     all right  then .  for mrs .  stumper   s pig .          tiffany flew above the treetops  and the occasional high twig brushed against her boots .  there was just enough winter sunshine to make the snow crisp and glittery  like a frosted cake .   it had been a busy morning .  the coven hadn   t been very interested in helping annagramma .  the coven itself seemed a long time ago .  it had been a busy winter .      all we did was muck about while annagramma bossed us around     dimity hubbub had said  while grinding minerals and very carefully tipping them  a bit at a time  into a tiny pot being heated by a candle .     i   m too busy to mess around with magic .  it never did anything useful .  you know her trouble .  she thinks you can be a witch by buying enough things .         she just needs to learn how to deal with people     said tiffany .   at this point  the pot exploded .      well  i think we can safely say that wasn   t your everyday toothache cure     said dimity  picking bits of pot out of her hair .     all right  i can spare the odd day  if petulia   s doing it .  but it won   t do much good .      lucy warbeck was lying full length and fully clothed in a tin bath full of water when tiffany came by .  her head was all the way under the surface  but when she saw tiffany peering in  she held up a sign saying i   m not drowning .  miss tick had said she would make a good witch finder  so she was training hard .      i don   t see why we should help annagramma     she said as tiffany helped her get dry .     she just likes putting people down with that sarcastic voice of hers .  anyway  what   s it to you .  you know she doesn   t like you .         i thought we   ve always got on   more or less     said tiffany .      really .  you can do stuff she can   t even attempt .  like that thing where you go invisible   you do it and you make it look easy .  but you come along to the meetings and act like the rest of us and help clear up afterward  and that drives her mad .         look  i don   t understand what you   re going on about .      lucy picked up another towel .     she can   t stand the idea that someone   s better than her but doesn   t crow about it .         why should i do that .     said tiffany  bewildered .      because that   s what she   d do  if she was you     said lucy  carefully pushing the knife and fork back into her piled up hair .      she thinks you   re laughing at her .  and now  oh my word  she   s got to depend on you .  you might as well have pushed pins up her nose .      but petulia had signed up  and so lucy and the rest of them did  too .  petulia had become the big success story since she   d won the witch trials with her famous pig trick two years ago .  she   d been laughed at   well  by annagramma  and everyone else had sort of grinned awkwardly   but she   d stuck to what she was good at and people were saying that she   d got skills with animals that even granny weatherwax couldn   t match .  she   d got solid respect  too .  people didn   t understand a lot of what witches did  but anyone who could get a sick cow back on its feet   well  that person was someone you looked up to .  so for the whole coven  after hogswatch  it was going to be all about annagramma time .   tiffany flew back toward tir nani ogg with her head spinning .  she   d never thought anyone could be envious of her .  okay  she   d picked up one or two things  but anyone could do them .  you just had to be able to switch yourself off .   she   d sat on the sand of the desert behind the door  she   d faced dogs with razor teeth   they were not things she wanted to remember .  and on top of all that  there was the wintersmith .   he couldn   t find her without the horse  everyone was sure of that .  he could speak in her head  and she could speak to him  but that was a kind of magic and didn   t have anything to do with maps .   he   d been quiet for a while .  he was probably building icebergs .   she landed the broomstick on a small bald hill among the trees .  there was no cottage to be seen .   she climbed off the stick but held on to it  just in case .   the stars were coming out .  the wintersmith liked clear nights .  they were colder .   and the words came .  they were her words in her voice and she knew what they meant  but they had a sort of echo .      wintersmith .  i command you .      as she blinked at the high toned way the words had sounded  the reply came back .   the voice was all around her .   who commands the wintersmith .      i am the summer lady .     well  she thought  i   m a sort of stand in .   then why do you hide from me .      i fear your ice .  i fear your chill .  i run from your avalanches .  i hide from your storms .     ah  right .  this is goddess talk .   live with me in my world of ice .      how dare you order me .  don   t you dare to order me .      but you chose to dwell in my winter    .  the wintersmith sounded uncertain .      i go where i please .  i make my own way .  i seek the leave of no man .  in your country you will honor me   or there will be a reckoning .     and that bit is mine  tiffany thought  pleased to get a word in .   there was a long silence  filled with uncertainty and puzzlement .  then the wintersmith said  how may i serve you  my lady .      no more icebergs looking like me .  i don   t want to be a face that sinks a thousand ships .      and the frost .  may we share the frosts .  and the snowflakes .      not the frosts .  you must not write my name on windows .  that can only lead to trouble .      but i may be permitted to honor you in snowflakes .      er       tiffany stopped .  goddesses shouldn   t say    er     she was sure of that .      snowflakes will be   acceptable     she said .  after all  she thought  it   s not as though they have my name on them .  i mean  most people won   t notice  and if they do they won   t know it   s me .   then there will be snowflakes  my lady  until the time we dance again .  and we will  for i am making myself a man .   the voice of the wintersmith   went .   tiffany was alone again among the trees .   except   she wasn   t .      i know you   re still there     she said  her breath leaving a sparkle in the air .     you are  aren   t you .  i can feel you .  you   re not my thoughts .  i   m not imagining you .  the wintersmith has gone .  you can speak with my mouth .  who are you .      the wind made snow fall from the trees nearby .  the stars twinkled .  nothing else moved .      you are there     said tiffany .     you   ve put thoughts in my head .  you   ve even made my own voice speak to me .  that   s not going to happen again .  now that i know the feeling  i can keep you out .  if you have anything to say to me  say it now .  when i leave here  i will shut my mind to you .  i will not let        how does it feel to be so helpless  sheep girl .      you are summer  aren   t you .     said tiffany .   and you are like a little girl dressing in her mother   s clothes  little feet in big shoes  dress trailing in the dirt .  the world will freeze because of a silly child     tiffany did   something that it would be impossible for her to describe  and the voice ended up like a distant insect .   it was lonely on the hill  and cold .  and all you could do was keep going .  you could scream  cry  and stamp your feet  but apart from making you feel warmer  it wouldn   t do any good .  you could say it was unfair  and that was true  but the universe didn   t care because it didn   t know what    fair    meant .  that was the big problem about being a witch .  it was up to you .  it was always up to you .       hogswatch came  with more snow and some presents .  nothing from home  even though some coaches were getting through .  she told herself there was probably a good reason  and tried to believe it .   it was the shortest day of the year  which was convenient because it fitted neatly with the longest night .  this was the heart of winter  but tiffany didn   t expect the present that arrived the next day .   it had been snowing hard  but the evening sky was pink and blue and freezing .   it came out of the pink evening sky with a whistling noise and landed in nanny ogg   s garden  throwing up a shower of dirt and leaving a big hole .      well  that   s good bye to the cabbages     said nanny  looking out the window .   steam was rising from the hole when they went outside  and there was a strong smell of sprouts .   tiffany peered through the steam .  dirt and stalks covered the thing  but she could make out something rounded .   she let herself slide farther into the hole  right down amid the mud and steam and the mysterious thing .  it wasn   t very hot now  and as she scraped stuff away  she began to have a nasty feeling that she knew what it was .   it was  she was sure  the    thingy    that anoia had talked about .  it looked mysterious enough .  and as it emerged from the mud  she knew she   d seen it before .      are you all right down there .  i can   t see you for all this steam .     nanny ogg called .  by the sound of it  the neighbors had come running  there was some excited chattering .   tiffany quickly scraped mud and mashed cabbages over the arrival and called up     i think this might explode .  tell everyone to get indoors .  and then reach down and grab my hand  will you .      there was some shouting above her and the sound of running feet .  nanny ogg   s hand appeared  waving around in the fog  and between them they got tiffany out of the hole .      shall we hide under the kitchen table .     said nanny as tiffany tried to brush mud and cabbage off her dress .  then nanny winked .     if it is going to explode .      her son shawn came around the house with a bucket of water in each hand and stopped  looking disappointed that there was nothing to do with them .      what was it  mum .     he panted .   nanny looked at tiffany  who said     er   a giant rock fell out of the sky .         giant rocks can   t stay up in the sky  miss .     said shawn .      i expect that   s why this one fell down  lad     said nanny briskly .     if you want to do something useful  you can stand guard and make sure nobody comes near it .         what shall i do if it explodes  mum .         come and tell me  will you .     said nanny .   she hurried tiffany into the cottage  shut the door behind them  and said     i   m a dreadful ol    liar  tiff  and it takes one to know one .  what   s down there .         well  i don   t think it   s going to explode     said tiffany .     and if it did  i think the worse that   d happen is that we   d be covered in coleslaw .  i think it   s the cornucopia .      there was the sound of voices outside and the door was flung open .      blessings be upon this house     said granny weatherwax  stamping snow off her boots .     your boy said i shouldn   t come in  but i think he was wrong .  i came as quick as i could .  what   s happened .         we   ve got cornucopias     said nanny ogg     whatever they are .          it was later that evening .  they   d waited until it was dark before pulling the cornucopia out of the hole .  it was a lot lighter than tiffany had expected  in fact it had an air about it of something very  very heavy which  for reasons of its own  had become light just for a while .   now it was on the kitchen table  wiped clean of mud and cabbages .  tiffany thought it looked vaguely alive .  it was warm to the touch and seemed to vibrate slightly under her fingers .      according to chaffinch     she said  with the mythology open on her lap     the god blind io created the cornucopia from a horn of the magical goat almeg to feed his two children by the goddess bisonomy  who was later turned into a shower of oysters by epidity  god of things shaped like potatoes  after insulting resonata  goddess of weasels  by throwing a mole at her shadow .  it is now the badge of office of the summer goddess .         i always said there used to be far too much of that sort of thing in the old days     said granny weatherwax .   the witches stared at the thing .  it did look a bit like a goat horn  but much larger .      how does it work .     said nanny ogg .  she stuck her head inside it and shouted    hello .     helloes came back  echoing for a long time  as if they had gone much farther than you would expect them to .      looks like a great big seashell to me     was the opinion of granny weatherwax .  the kitten you padded around the giant thing  sniffing daintily at it .   greebo was hiding behind the saucepans on the top shelf .  tiffany checked .       i don   t think anyone knows     she said .     but the other name for it is the horn of plenty .         a horn .  can you play a tune on it .     asked nanny .      i don   t think so     said tiffany .     it contains   er   things .         what sort of things .     said granny weatherwax .      well  technically   everything     said tiffany .     everything that grows .      she showed them the picture in the book .  all sorts of fruits  vegetables  and grain were spilling from the cornucopia   s wide mouth .      mostly fruit  though     said nanny .     not many carrots  but i suppose they   re up in the pointy end .  they   d fit better there .         typical artist     said granny .     he just painted the showy stuff in the front .  too proud to paint an honest potato .     she poked at the page with an accusing finger .     and what about these cherubs .  we   re not going to get them too  are we .  i don   t like to see little babies flying through the air .         they turn up a lot in old paintings     said nanny ogg .     they put them in to show it   s art and not just naughty pictures of ladies with not many clothes on .         well  they   re not fooling me     said granny weatherwax .      go on  tiff  give it a go     said nanny ogg  walking around the table .      i don   t know how .     said tiffany .     there aren   t any instructions .      and then  too late  granny shouted     you .  come out of there .      but with a flick of her tail the white kitten trotted inside .   they banged on the horn .  they held it upside down and shook it .  they tried shouting down it .  they put a saucer of milk in front of it and waited .  the kitten didn   t return .  then nanny ogg prodded gently inside the cornucopia with a mop  which to no one   s great surprise went farther inside the cornucopia than there was cornucopia on the outside .      she   ll come out when she   s hungry     she said reassuringly .      not if she finds something to eat in there     said granny weatherwax  peering into the dark .      i shouldn   t think she   ll find cat food     said tiffany  examining the picture closely .     there may be milk  though .         you .  come out of there this minute .     granny commanded in a voice fit to shake mountains .   there was a distant meep .      perhaps she   s got stuck .     said nanny .     i mean  it   s like a spiral  growing smaller at the end  right .  cats ain   t very big at goin    backward .      tiffany saw the look on granny   s face and sighed .      feegles .     she said to the room in general .     i know there are some of you in this room .  come out  please .      feegles appeared from behind every ornament .  tiffany tapped the cornucopia .      can you get a little kitten out of here .     she asked .      just that .  aye  nae problemo     said rob anybody .     i wuz hopin    it was gonna be something difficult .      the nac mac feegles disappeared into the horn at a trot .  their voices died away .  the witches waited .   they waited some more .   and some more .      feegles .     shouted tiffany into the hole .  she thought she heard a very distant  very faint    crivens .         if it can produce grain  they might have found beer in there     said tiffany .     and that means they   ll only run out when the beer runs out too .         cats can   t feed on beer .     snapped granny weatherwax .      well  i   m fed up with waiting     said nanny .     look  there   s a little hole in the pointy end  too .  i   m going to blow into it .      she tried to  at least .  her cheeks went big and red and her eyes bulged  and it was pretty clear that if the horn didn   t blow  then she would   at which point  the horn gave up .  there was a distant and unmistakably curly rumbling noise  which got louder and louder .      i can   t see anything yet     said granny  looking into the wide mouth of the horn .   tiffany pulled her away just as you galloped out of the cornucopia with her tail straight out and her ears flattened .  she skidded across the table  leaped onto granny weatherwax   s dress  scrambled onto her shoulder  and turned and spat defiance .   with a cry of    crivvvvvvvvens .     feegles poured out of the horn .      behind the sofa  everyone .     yelled nanny .     run .      now the rumble was like thunder .  it grew and grew and then        stopped .   in the silence  three pointy hats rose from behind the sofa .  small blue faces rose from behind everything .   then there was a noise very similar to pwat .  and something small and wizened rolled out of the mouth of the horn and dropped onto the floor .  it was a very dried up pineapple .   granny weatherwax brushed some dust off her dress .      you   d better learn to use this     she said to tiffany .      how .         don   t you have any idea .         no .         well  it   s turned up for you  madam  and it   s dangerous .      tiffany gingerly picked up the cornucopia  and again there was that definite feeling of some hugely heavy thing pretending  very successfully  to be light .      maybe it needs some magic word     suggested nanny ogg .     or there   s somewhere special that you press    .      as tiffany turned it in the light  something gleamed for a moment .      hold on  these look like words     she said .  she read   all that you desire  i give upon a name  murmured the memory of dr .  bustle .   the next line said   i grow  i shrink  dr .  bustle translated .      i think i might have an idea     she said  and in memory of miss treason she declared     ham sandwich .      nothing happened .   then dr .  bustle lazily translated  and tiffany said   with a fwlap a ham sandwich sailed out of the mouth of the cornucopia and was expertly caught by nanny  who bit into it .      not bad at all .     she announced .     try a few more .      said tiffany  and there was the kind of sound you get when you disturb a cave full of bats .      stop .     she yelled  but nothing stopped .  then dr .  bustle whispered and she shouted   there were a   lot of sandwiches .  the pile reached the ceiling  in fact .  only the tip of nanny ogg   s hat was visible  but there were some muffled noises farther down the heap .   an arm thrust out  and nanny ogg forced her way through the wall of bread and sliced pig  chewing thoughtfully .      no mustard  i notice .  hmm .  well  we can see that everyone around here has a good supper tonight     she said .     and i can see i   m going to have to make an awful lot of soup  too .  best not to try it again in here  though  all right .         i don   t like it at all     snapped granny weatherwax .     where does all that stuff come from  eh .  magic food never fed anyone properly .         it   s not magic  it   s a god thing     said nanny ogg .     like manners from heaven  that sort of stuff .  i expect it   s made out of raw firmament .      in fact it   s merely a living metaphor for the boundless fecundity of the natural world  whispered dr .  bustle in tiffany   s head .      you don   t get manners from heaven     said granny .      this was in foreign parts  a long time ago     said nanny  turning to tiffany .     if i was you  dear  i   d take it out into the woods tomorrow and see what it can do .  although  if you don   t mind  i could really do with some fresh grapes right now .         gytha ogg  you can   t use the cornucopia of the gods as a   a larder .     said granny .     the feet business was bad enough .         but it is one     said nanny ogg innocently .     it   s the larder .  it   s  like  everything waiting to grow next spring .      tiffany put it down very carefully .  there was something   alive about the cornucopia .  she wasn   t at all sure that it was just some magical tool .  it seemed to be listening .   as it touched the tabletop  it began to shrink until it was the size of a small vase .         scuse me .     said rob anybody .     but does it do beer .         beer .     said tiffany  without thinking .   there was a trickling noise .  all eyes turned to look at the vase .  brown liquid was foaming over the lip .   then all the eyes turned to granny weatherwax  who shrugged .      don   t look at me     she said sourly .     you   re going to drink it anyway .      it is alive  tiffany thought  as nanny ogg hurried off to find some more mugs .  it learns .  it   s learned my language    .       around midnight  tiffany woke up because a white chicken was standing on her chest .  she pushed it off and reached down for her slippers  and found only chickens .  when she got the candle alight  she saw half a dozen chickens on the end of the bed .  the floor was covered in chickens .  so were the stairs .  so was every room down below .  in the kitchen  chickens had overflowed into the sink .   they weren   t making much noise  just the occasional werk a chicken makes when it   s a bit uncertain about things  which is more or less all the time .   the chickens were shuffling along patiently to make room .  werk .  they were doing this because the cornucopia  now grown just a bit bigger than a full grown chicken  was gently firing out a chicken every eight seconds .  werk .   as tiffany watched  another one landed on the mountain of ham sandwiches .  werk .   marooned on top of the cornucopia was you  looking very puzzled .  werk .  and in the middle of the floor granny weatherwax snored gently in the big armchair  surrounded by fascinated hens .  werk .  apart from the snoring  the chorus of werks  and the rustle of shuffling chickens  it was all very peaceful in the candlelight .  werk .   tiffany glared at the kitten .  she rubbed up against things when she wanted to be fed  didn   t she .  werk .  and made meep noises .  werk .  and the cornucopia could work out languages  couldn   t it .  werk .   now she whispered     no more chickens     and after a few seconds the flow of chickens ceased .  werk .   but she couldn   t really leave it like that .  she shook granny by the shoulder and  as the old woman awoke  she said     the good news is a lot of the ham sandwiches have gone   er    .      werk .       chapter nine      green shoots      it was much colder the next morning  a numb dull coldness that could practically freeze the flames on a fire .   tiffany let the broomstick settle between the trees a little way from nanny ogg   s cottage .  the snow hadn   t drifted much here  but it came up to her knees  and cold had put a crispness on it that crackled like a stale loaf when tiffany trod it .   in theory she was out in the woods to get the hang of the cornucopia  but really she was there to keep it out of the way .  nanny ogg hadn   t been too upset about the chickens .  after all  she now owned five hundred hens  which were currently standing around in her shed going werk .  but the floors were a mess  there were chicken doo dahs even on the banisters  and as granny had pointed out  in a whisper   supposing someone had said    sharks    .   the cornucopia lay on her lap while she sat on a stump among snow covered trees .  once the forest had been pretty .  now it was hateful .  dark trunks against snowdrifts  a striped world of black and white  bars against the light .  she longed for horizons .   funny   the cornucopia was always very slightly warm  even out here  and seemed to know in advance what size it ought to be .     i grow  i shrink     thought tiffany .  and i   m feeling pretty small .   what next .  what now .  she   d kept hoping that the   the power would drop on her  just like the cornucopia had done .  it hadn   t .   there was life under the snow .  she felt it in her fingertips .  somewhere down there  out of reach  was the real summer .  using the cornucopia as a scoop  she scraped away at the snow until she reached dead leaves .  there was life down there in the white webs of fungi and pale  new roots .  a half frozen worm crawled slowly away and burrowed under a leaf skeleton  fine as lace .  beside it was an acorn .   the woods weren   t silent .  they were holding their breath .  they were all waiting for her  and she didn   t know what to do .   i   m not the summer lady  she told herself .  i can never be her .  i   m in her shoes  but i can never be her .  i might be able to make a few flowers grow  but i can never be her .  she   ll walk across the world and oceans of sap will rise in these dead trees and a million tons of grass will grow in a second .  can i do that .  no .  i   m a stupid child with a handful of tricks  that   s all .  i   m just tiffany aching  and i   m aching to go home .   feeling guilty about the worm  she breathed some warm air on the soil and then pushed the leaves back to cover it .  as she did so  there was a wet little sound  like the snapping of a frog   s fingers  and the acorn split .  a white shoot escaped from it and grew more than half an inch as she watched it .   hurriedly she made a hole in the mold with her fingers  pushed the acorn in  and patted the soil back again .   someone was watching her .  she stood up and turned around quickly .  there was no one to be seen  but that didn   t mean a thing .      i know you   re there .     she said  still turning around .     whoever you are .      her voice echoed among the black trees .  even to her it sounded thin and scared .   she found herself raising the cornucopia .      show yourself     she quavered     or        what .  she wondered .  i   ll fill you full of fruit .   some snow fell off a tree with a thump  making her jump and then feel even more foolish .  now she was flinching at the fall of a handful of snowflakes .  a witch ought never to be frightened in the darkest forest  granny weatherwax had once told her  because she should be sure in her soul that the most terrifying thing in the forest was her .   she raised the cornucopia and said  half heartedly     strawberry    .      something shot out of the cornucopia with a pfut and made a red stain on a tree twenty feet away .  tiffany didn   t bother to check  it always delivered what you asked for .   which was more than she could say for herself .   and on top of everything else  it was her day to visit annagramma .  tiffany sighed deeply .  she   d probably get that wrong too .   slowly  astride her broomstick  she disappeared among the trees .   after a minute or two  a green shoot thrust up from the patch of soil that she had breathed on  grew to a height of about six inches  and put out two green leaves .   footsteps approached .  they were not as crunchy as footsteps on frozen snow usually are .   there was a crunch now  though  of someone kneeling on the frosted leaves .   a pair of skinny but powerful hands gently dragged and sculpted the snow and leaves together to make a tall  thin wall around the shoot  enclosing it and protecting it from the wind like a soldier in a castle .   a small white kitten tried to nuzzle at it and was carefully lifted out of the way .   then granny weatherwax walked back into the woods  leaving no footprints .  you never teach anyone else everything you know .       days went by .  annagramma learned  but it was a struggle .  it was hard to teach someone who wouldn   t admit that there was anything she didn   t know  so there were conversations like this      you know how to prepare placebo root  do you .         of course .  everyone knows that .     and this was not the time to say     okay then  show me     because she   d mess around for a while and then say she had a headache .  this was the time to say     good  watch me to see if i   m doing it right     and then do it perfectly .  and you   d add things like     as you know  granny weatherwax says that practically anything works instead of placebo root  but it   s best to use the real thing if you can get it .  if prepared in syrup  it   s an amazing remedy for minor illnesses  but of course you already know this .      and annagramma would say     of course .      a week later  in the forests  it was so cold some older trees exploded in the night .  they hadn   t seen that for a long time  the older people said .  it happened when the sap froze  then tried to expand .   annagramma was as vain as a canary in a room full of mirrors and panicked instantly when faced with anything she didn   t know  but she was sharp at picking things up  and very good at appearing to know more than she really did  which is a valuable talent for a witch .  once  tiffany noticed the boffo catalogue open on the table with some things circled .  she asked no questions .  she was too busy .   a week after that  wells froze .   tiffany went around the villages with annagramma a few times and knew that she would make it  eventually .  she   d got built in boffo .  she was tall and arrogant and acted as if she knew everything even when she didn   t have a clue .  that would get her a long way .  people listened to her .   they needed to .  there were no roads open now  between cottages  people had cut tunnels full of cold blue light .  anything that needed to be moved was moved by broomstick .  that included old people .  they were lifted  bedclothes  walking sticks  and all  and moved into other houses .  people packed together stayed warmer  and could pass the time by reminding one another that  however cold this was  it wasn   t as cold as the cold you got when they were young .   after a while  they stopped saying that .   sometimes it would thaw  just a little  and then freeze again .  that fringed every roof with icicles .  at the next thaw  they stabbed the ground like daggers .   tiffany didn   t sleep  at least  she didn   t go to bed .  none of the witches did .  the snow got trampled down into ice that was like rock  so a few carts could be moved about  but there still weren   t enough witches to go around or enough hours in the day .  there weren   t enough hours in the day and the night put together .  petulia had fallen asleep on her stick and ended up in a tree two miles away .  tiffany slid off once and landed in a snowdrift .   wolves entered the tunnels .  they were weak with hunger  and desperate .  granny weatherwax put a stop to them and never told anyone how she   d done it .   the cold was like being punched  over and over again  day and night .  all over the snow were little dark dots that were dead birds  frozen out of the air .  other birds had found the tunnels and filled them with twittering  and people fed them scraps because they brought a false hope of spring to the world        because there was food .  oh  yes  there was food .  the cornucopia ran day and night .   and tiffany thought  i should have said no to snowflakes    .       there was a shack  old and abandoned .  and there was  in the rotted planks  a nail .  if the wintersmith had had fingers  they would have been shaking .   this was the last thing .  there had been so much to learn .  it had been so hard  so hard .  who would have thought a man was made of stuff like chalk and soot and gases and poisons and metals .  but now ice formed under the rusty nail  and the wood groaned and squeaked as the ice grew and forced it out .   it spun gently in the air  and the voice of the wintersmith could be heard in the wind that froze the treetops     iron enough to make a man .      high up in the mountains the snow exploded .  it mounded up into the air as if dolphins were playing under it  shapes forming and disappearing    .   then  as suddenly as it had risen  the snow settled again .  but now there was a horse there  white as snow  and on its back a rider  glittering with frost .  if the greatest sculptor the world had ever known had been told to build a snowman  this is what it would have looked like .   something was still going on .  the shape of the horse and man still crawled with movement as they grew more and more lifelike .  details settled .  colors crept in  always pale  never bright .   and there was a horse  and there was a rider  shining in the comfortless light of the midwinter sun .   the wintersmith extended a hand and flexed his fingers .  color is  after all  merely a matter of reflection  the fingers took on the color of flesh .   the wintersmith spoke .  that is  there were a variety of noises  from the roar of a gale to the rattle of the sucking of the surf on a pebble shore after a wrecking storm at sea .  somewhere among them all was a tone that seemed right .  he repeated it  stretched it  stirred it around  and turned it into speech  playing with it until it sounded right .   he said     tasbnlerizwip .  ggokyziofvva .  wiswip .  nananana   nyip   nap   ah    .  ah .  it is to speak .     the wintersmith threw back his head and sang the overture to   berwald winter by the composer wotua doinov .  he   d overheard it once when driving a roaring gale around the rooftops of an opera house  and had been astonished to find that a human being  nothing more really than a bag of dirty water on legs  could have such a wonderful understanding of snow .      snova poxolodalo .     he sang to the freezing sky .   the only slight error the wintersmith made  as his horse trotted through the pine trees  was in singing the instruments as well as the voices .  he sang  in fact  the whole thing  and rode like a traveling orchestra  making the sounds of the singers  the drums  and the rest of the orchestra all at once .   to smell the trees .  to feel the pull of the ground .  to be solid .  to feel the darkness behind your eyes and know it was you .  to be   and know yourself to be   a man .   he had never felt like this before .  it was exhilarating .  there was so much of   of everything  coming at him from every direction .  the thing with the ground  for example .  it tugged  all the time .  standing upright took a lot of thinking about .  and the birds .  the wintersmith had always seen them as nothing more than impurities in the air  interfering with the flow of the weather  but now they were living things just like him .  and they played with the tug of the wind  and owned the sky .   the wintersmith had never seen before  never felt before  never heard before .  you could not do those things unless you were   apart  in the dark behind the eyes .  before  he hadn   t been apart  he   d been a part  a part of the whole universe of tug and pressure  sound and light  flowing  dancing .  he   d run storms against mountains forever  but he   d never known what a mountain was until today .   the dark behind the eyes   what a precious thing .  it gave you your   you ness .  your hand  with those laughable waggly things on it  gave you touch  the holes on either side of your head let in sound  the holes at the front let in the wonderful smell .  how clever of holes to know what to do .  it was amazing .  when you were an elemental  everything happened all together  inside and outside  in one big   thing .   thing .  that was a useful word   thing .  thing was anything the wintersmith couldn   t describe .  everything was   things  and they were exciting .   it was good to be a man .  oh  he was mostly made of dirty ice  but that was just better organized dirty water  after all .   yes  he was human .  it was so easy .  it was just a matter of organizing things .  he had senses  he could move among humans  he could   search .  that was how to search for humans .  you became one .  it was so hard to do it as an elemental  it was hard even to recognize a human in the churning thing ness of the physical world .  but a human could talk to other humans with the holes for the sound .  he could talk to them and they would not suspect .   and now that he was human  there would be no going back .  king winter .   all he needed was a queen .       tiffany woke up because someone was shaking her .      tiffany .      she   d gone to sleep in nanny ogg   s cottage with her head against the cornucopia .  from somewhere close there was a strange pif noise  like a dry drip .  pale blue snowlight filled the room .   as she opened her eyes  granny weatherwax was gently pushing her back into her chair .      you   ve been sleeping since nine o   clock  my girl     she said .     time to go home  i think .      tiffany looked around .     i am here  aren   t i .     she said  feeling dizzy .      no  this is nanny ogg   s house .  and this is a bowl of soup        tiffany woke up .  there was a blurry bowl of soup in front of her .  it looked   familiar .      when did you last sleep in a bed .     said a wavering  shadowy figure .   tiffany yawned .     what day is this .         tuesday     said granny weatherwax .      mmm   what   s a tuesday .      tiffany woke up for the third time and was grabbed and pulled upright .      there     said the voice of granny weatherwax .     this time stay awake .  drink soup .  get warm .  you need to go home .      this time tiffany   s stomach took control of a hand and a spoon and  by degrees  tiffany warmed up .   granny weatherwax sat opposite  the kitten you on her lap  watching tiffany until the soup was gone .      i expected too much from you     she said .     i   d hoped that as the days grew longer  you   d find more power .  that ain   t no fault of yours .      the pif noises were getting more frequent .  tiffany looked down and saw barley dripping out of the cornucopia .  the number of grains increased even as she watched .      you set it on barley before you fell asleep     said granny .     it slows right down when you   re tired .  just as well  really  otherwise we   d have been eaten alive by chickens .         it   s about the only thing i   ve got right     said tiffany .      oh  i don   t know .  annagramma hawkin seems to be showing promise .  lucky in her friends  from what i hears .     if miss treason had tried to play poker against granny weatherwax   s face  she would have lost .   the patter of the new grains suddenly became much louder in the silence .      look  i       tiffany began .   granny sniffed .     i   m sure no one has to explain themselves to me     she said virtuously .     will you promise me that you   ll go home .  a couple of coaches got through this morning  and i hear it   s not too bad yet  down on the plains .  you go back to your chalk country .  you   re the only witch they   ve got .      tiffany sighed .  she did want to go home  more than anything .  but it would be like running away .      it might be like running to     said granny  picking up her old habit of replying to something that hadn   t actually been said .      i   ll go tomorrow then     said tiffany .      good .     granny stood up .     come with me .  i wants to show you something .      tiffany followed her through a snow tunnel that came out near the edge of the forest .  the snow had been packed down here by people dragging firewood home  and once you got a little way from the edge of the forest  the drifts weren   t too bad  a lot of snow hung in the trees  filling the air with cold blue shadows .      what are we looking for .     asked tiffany .   granny weatherwax pointed .   there was a splash of green in the white and gray .  it was young leaves on an oak sapling a couple of feet high .  when tiffany crunched her way through the snow crust and reached out to touch it  the air felt warm .      do you know how you managed that .     asked granny .      no .         me neither .  i couldn   t do it .  you did  girl .  tiffany aching .         it   s just one tree     said tiffany .      ah  well .  you have to start small  with oak trees .      they stared in silence at the tree for a few moments .  the green seemed to reflect off the snow around it .  winter stole color  but the tree glowed .      and now we   ve all got things to do     said granny  breaking the spell .     you  i believe  would normally be heading for miss treason   s old place about now .  i   d expect no less of you    .          there was a coaching inn .  it was busy  even at this time in the morning .  the fast mail coach had made a quick stop for fresh horses after the long haul into the mountains  and another one  bound for down on the plains  was waiting for the passengers .  the breath of horses filled the air with steam .  drivers stamped their feet .  sacks and packages were being loaded .  men bustled around with nosebags .  some bandy legged men just hung around  smoking and gossiping .  in fifteen minutes the inn   s yard would be empty again  but for now everyone was too busy to pay much attention to one more stranger .   afterward they all told different stories  contradicting one another at the tops of their voices .  probably the most accurate account came from miss dymphnia stoot  the innkeeper   s daughter  who was helping her father serve breakfast      well  he  like  came in  and right there i could see he was odd .  he walked funny  you know  lifting his legs like a trotting horse does .  also  he was kind of like shiny .  but we get all sorts here  and it does not pay to make pers   nal remarks .  we had a bunch of werewolves in here last week and they were just like you and me except we had to put their plates on the floor    .  all right  yes  this man   well  he sat down at a table and said     i am a human just like you .     he came out with it  just like that .      of course  no one else paid attention  but i told him i was glad to hear it and what did he want to eat  because the sausages was particular fine this morning  and he said he could only eat cold food  which was funny    cuz everyone was grumbling about how cold it was in the room now  and it   s not like there wasn   t a big fire burning .  anyway   actually we did have some cold sausage left in the pantry and they were a bit on the turn  if you know what i mean  so i gave them to him  and he chewed one for a bit and then he says  with his mouth full if you please     this is not what i expected .  what do i do now .     and i said you swallow and he said     swallow .     and i said  yes  you swallow it down into your stomach  right  and he said  spraying bits of sausage all over the place     oh  a hollow bit .     and sort of like wavers and then he says     ah  i am a human .  i have successfully eaten human sausages .     and i said there was no need to be like that  they were made of mostly pig  same as always .      then he says what is he supposed to do with them now and i says it   s not my place to tell him and that will be two pennies please and he puts down a gold coin so i curtsy because  well  you never know .  then he says     i am a human just like you .  where are the pointy humans who fly through the sky .     which was a funny way of putting it to my mind  but i told him if it was witches he wanted  there was plenty of    em over the lancre bridge  and he said     name of treason .     and i said i heard she was dead but with witches who can say .  and off he went .  all the time he had this  like  smile  all shiny and a bit worrying .  something wrong with his clothes  too  like they were stuck to him or something .  but you can   t be too choosy in this business .  we had some trolls in here yesterday .  they can   t eat our food  you know  being kind of like walking rocks  but we gave them a slap up meal of broken cups and grease .  but he was a rum    un .  the place got a lot warmer after he left  too .          expect no less of you     the words kept tiffany warm as she flew over the trees .  the fire in her head burned with pride but contained one or two big crackly logs of anger .   granny had known .  had she planned it .  because it looked good  didn   t it .  all the witches would know .  mrs .  earwig   s pupil couldn   t cope  but tiffany aching organized all the other girls to help out and didn   t tell anyone .  of course  among witches  not telling anyone was a sure way of getting things found out .  witches were very good at listening to what you weren   t saying .  so annagramma held on to her cottage  and mrs .  earwig was embarrassed and granny would be smug .  all that work and rushing around  to let granny feel smug .  well  and for mrs .  stumper   s pig and everyone else  of course .  that made it complicated .  if you could  you did what needed to be done .  poking your nose in was basic witchcraft .  she knew it .  granny knew she knew it .  so tiffany had scurried around like a little clockwork mouse    .   there would be a reckoning .   the clearing was full of snow in great icy drifts  but a path had been worn to the cottage  she was pleased to see .   there was something new .  there were people standing by miss treason   s grave  and some of the snow had been scraped off .   oh no  tiffany thought as she circled down  please say she hasn   t gone looking for the skulls .   it turned out to be  in some ways  worse .   she recognized the people around the grave .  they were villagers  and they gave tiffany the defiant  worried stares of people scared half to death by the small but possibly angry pointy hat in front of them .  and there was something about the very deliberate way they weren   t looking at the mound that instantly drew her attention to it .  it was covered in little torn scraps of paper  pinned down with sticks .  they fluttered in the wind .   she snatched up a couple       miss treason please keep my boy joe save at see .     miss treason  im goin bald pleas help .     miss treason  please find our girl becky what run away im sorry .       there were more .  and just as she was about to speak sharply to the villagers for still bothering miss treason  she remembered the packets of jolly sailor tobacco that the shepherds even now left on the turf where the old shepherding hut had been .  they didn   t write their petitions down  but they were there all the same  floating in the air      granny aching  who herds the clouds in the blue sky  please watch my sheep .        granny aching  cure my son .        granny aching  find my lambs .      they were the prayers of small people  too afraid to bother the gods in their high places .  they trusted in what they knew .  they weren   t right or wrong .  they were just   hopeful .   well  miss treason  she thought  you   re a myth now  as sure as anything .  you might even make it to goddess .  it   s not much fun  i can tell you .      and has becky been found .     she said  turning to the people .   a man avoided her gaze as he said     i reckon miss treason   ll understand why the girl won   t be wantin    to come home anytime soon .      oh  thought tiffany  one of those reasons .      any news of the boy  then .     she said .      ah  that one worked     said a woman .     his mum got a letter yesterday sayin    he   d been in a dreadful shipwreck but was picked up alive  which only goes to show .      tiffany didn   t ask what it was that it went to show .  it was enough that it had gone to show it .      well  that   s good     she said .      but lots of poor seamen got drownded     the woman went on .     they hit an iceberg in the fog .  a big floating mountain of ice shaped like a woman  they said .  what d   you think of that .         i expect if they   d been at sea long enough  anything would look like a woman  eh .     said the man  and chuckled .  the women gave him a look .      he didn   t say who she   if she looked like  you know   anyone .     said tiffany  trying to sound nonchalant .      depends where they were looking       the man began cheerfully .      you ought to wash your brain out with soap and water     said the woman  prodding him sharply in the chest .      er  no  miss     he said  looking down at his feet .     he just said her head was all covered with seagull   poo  miss .      this time  tiffany tried not to sound relieved .  she looked down at the fluttering bits of paper on the grave and back to the woman  who was trying to hide what might be a fresh request behind her back .      do you believe in this stuff  mrs .  carter .      the woman suddenly looked flustered .     oh no  miss  of course not .  but it   s just that   well  you know    .      it makes you feel better  thought tiffany .  it   s something you can do when there   s nothing more to be done .  and who knows  it might work .  yes  i know .  it   s     her hand itched .  and now she realized that it had been itching for a while .      oh yes .     she said under her breath .     you dare .         are you all right  miss .     said the man .  tiffany ignored him .  a rider was approaching and snow followed after him  spreading and widening behind him like a cloak  soundless as a wish  thick as fog .   without taking her eyes off him  tiffany reached into her pocket and gripped the tiny cornucopia .  hah .   she walked forward .   the wintersmith dismounted from his snow white horse when it had drawn level with the old cottage .   tiffany stopped about twenty feet away  her heart pounding .      my lady     said the wintersmith  and bowed .   he looked   better  and older .      i warn you .  i   ve got a cornucopia and i   m not afraid to use it .     said tiffany .  but she hesitated .  he did look almost human  except for that fixed  strange grin .     how did you find me .     she said .      for you i have learned     said the figure .     i learned how to search .  i am human .      really .  but his mouth doesn   t look right  said her third thoughts .  it   s pale inside  like snow .  that   s not a boy there .  it just thinks it is .   one big pumpkin  her second thoughts urged .  they get really hard at this time of year .  shoot him now .   tiffany herself  the one on the outside  the one who could feel the air on her face  thought  i can   t just do that .  all he   s doing is standing there talking .  all this is my fault .   he wants never ending winter  said her third thoughts .  everyone you know will die .   she was sure the eyes of the wintersmith could see right into her mind .   the summer kills the winter  the third thoughts insisted .  that   s how it works .   but not like this  tiffany thought .  i know it   s not supposed to be like this .  it feels wrong .  it   s not the right   story .  the king of winter can   t be killed by a flying pumpkin .   the wintersmith was watching her carefully .  thousands of tiffany shaped flakes were falling around him .      we will finish the dance now .     he said .     i am human  just like you .     he held out a hand .      do you know what human is .     said tiffany .      yes .  easy .  iron enough to make a nail .     said the wintersmith promptly .  he beamed  as if he   d done a trick successfully .     and now  please  we dance    .      he took a step forward .  tiffany backed away .   if you dance now  her third thoughts warned  that will be the end of it .  you   ll be believing in yourself and trusting in your star  and big twinkly things thousands of miles up in the sky don   t care if they twinkle on everlasting snow .      i   m   not ready     tiffany said  hardly above a whisper .      but time is passing     said the wintersmith .     i am human  i know these things .  are you not a goddess in human form .      the eyes bored into her .   no  i   m not  she thought .  i   ll always be just   tiffany aching .   the wintersmith drew closer  his hand still outstretched .      time to dance  lady .  time to finish the dance .      thoughts leaked out away from tiffany   s grasp .  the eyes of the wintersmith filled her mind with nothing but whiteness  like a field of pure snow    .      aaaiiiiieeeee .      the door of old miss treason   s cottage flew open and   something came out  staggering through the snow .   it was a witch .  you could not mistake it .  she   it was probably a she  but some things are so horrible that worrying about how to address a letter to them is silly   had a hat with a point that curled like a snake .  it was on top of dripping strands of mad  greasy hair  which were perched on a nightmare of a face .  it was green  like the hands that waved black fingernails that were really terrible claws .   tiffany stared .  the wintersmith stared .  the people stared .   as the horrible screaming  lurching thing drew nearer  the details got clearer  like the brown rotting teeth and the warts .  lots of warts .  even the warts on the warts had warts .   annagramma had sent off for everything .  part of tiffany wanted to laugh  even now  but the wintersmith snatched at her hand        and the witch grabbed his shoulder .      don   t you take hold of her like that .  how dare you .  i   m a witch  you know .      annagramma   s voice wasn   t easy on the ear at the best of times  but when she was frightened or angry  it had a whine that bored right into the head .      let go of her  i say     screamed annagramma .  the wintersmith looked stunned .  having to listen to annagramma in a rage was hard for someone who hadn   t had ears for very long .      let her go     she yelled .  then she threw a fireball .   she missed .  possibly she meant to .  a ball of flaming gas whizzing nearby usually makes most people stop what they are doing .  but most people don   t melt .   the wintersmith   s leg dropped off .   later  on the journey through the blizzard  tiffany wondered how the wintersmith worked .  he was made of snow  but he could make it walk and talk .  that must mean he had to think about it all the time .  he had to .  humans didn   t have to think about their bodies all the time  because their bodies knew what to do .  but snow doesn   t even know how to stand up straight .   annagramma was glaring at him as if he   d done something really annoying .   he looked around  as if puzzled  cracks appearing across his chest  and then he was just crumbling snow  collapsing into glittery crystals .   the snow began to pour down now  as if the clouds were being squeezed .   annagramma pulled the mask to one side and stared first at the heap and then at tiffany .      all right     she said     what just happened .  was he supposed to do that .         i was coming to see you and   that   s the wintersmith .     was all that tiffany could manage at that point .      you mean like   the wintersmith .     said annagramma .     isn   t he just a story .  what is he after you for .     she added accusingly .      it   s   he   i       tiffany began  but there was nowhere to start .     he   s real .  i   ve got to get away from him .     she said .     i   ve got to get away .  it takes too long to explain .      for a horrible moment she thought annagramma was still going to demand the whole story  but she reached out and grabbed tiffany   s hand with a black rubber claw .      then get out of here right now .  oh  no  you   ve still got miss treason   s old broom .  totally useless .  use mine .     she dragged tiffany toward the cottage  as the snowflakes thickened .         iron enough to make a nail    .     said tiffany  trying to keep up .  she couldn   t think of anything else to say  and it was suddenly very important .     he thought he was human           i   ve only knocked over his snowman  you fool .  he   ll be back .         yes  but iron enough  you see  to        a green hand slapped her face  but this hurt less than it might because of the rubber .      don   t babble .  i thought you were clever .  i really don   t know what this is about  but if i had that thing after me  i wouldn   t stand around babbling .     annagramma pulled across the wicked witch de luxe mask with free dangling booger  adjusted the hang of the booger  and turned to the villagers  who   d been rooted to the spot all this time .     what are you all staring at .  haven   t you ever seen a witch before .     she shouted .     go back home .  oh  and i   ll be down tomorrow with some physic for your little boy  mrs .  carter .      they stared at the green face  the rotted teeth  the stinking hair  and the huge booger  made in fact of glass  and fled .   still drunk with terror and relief  tiffany rocked gently  muttering    iron enough to make a nail .     until annagramma shook her .  the thick flakes were dropping so fast that it was hard to see her face .      tiffany  broomstick .  broomstick fly     said annagramma .     fly a long way .  do you hear me .  somewhere safe .         but he   the poor thing thinks that           yes  yes  i   m sure it   s all very important     said annagramma  dragging her toward the cottage wall  where her broomstick leaned .  she half pushed  half lifted tiffany onto it and looked up .  snow was pouring out of the sky like a waterfall now .      he   s coming back .     she snapped  and said a few words under her breath .  the broomstick shot straight up and disappeared into the fading  snow filled light .       chapter ten      going home      granny weatherwax looked up from the saucer of ink  in which a tiny tiffany was disappearing into the whiteness of the blizzard .  she was smiling  but with granny weatherwax this did not necessarily mean that something nice was happening .      we could ha    taken him doon easy     said rob anybody reproachfully .     ye should ha    let us .         perhaps .  or perhaps he   d have frozen you solid .     said granny .     besides  there   s a bigger task ahead of the nac mac feegles .  your big wee hag needs you to do two things .  one of them is hard  the other one is very hard .      the feegles cheered up when they heard this .  they were everywhere in mrs .  ogg   s kitchen .  some were perched on nanny ogg herself  and miss tick looked very uncomfortable surrounded by them .  unlike miss tick  feegles rarely had an opportunity for a bath .      firstly     said granny     she will need you to go into the   underworld  to fetch the summer lady .      the significant pause did not seem to bother the feegles at all .      oh aye  we can do that     said rob anybody .     we can get into anywhere .  an    that   s the verra hard bit  is it .         and out again .     said granny .      oh  aye     said rob firmly .     mostly we get thrown oot .         the very hard part     said granny     will be finding a hero .         that   s no    hard     said rob .     we   re a    heroes here .     a cheer went up .      really .     said granny .     are you frightened to go into the underworld  rob anybody .         me .  no .     rob anybody looked around at his brothers and grinned hugely .      spell the word    marmalade     then .     granny weatherwax pushed a pencil across nanny ogg   s table and sat back in her chair .     go on .  right now .  and no one is to help you .      rob backed away .  granny weatherwax was the hag o    all hags   he knew that .  there was no telling what she might do to an errant feegle .   he picked up the pencil nervously  and placed the pointy end against the wood of the table .  other feegles clustered around  but under granny   s frown no one dared to even cheer him on .   rob stared upward  his lips moving and sweat beading his forehead .      mmmmaa       he said .      one     said granny .   rob blinked .     hey .  who   s countin    .     he protested .      me     said granny .  the kitten you leaped onto her lap and curled up .      crivens  ye never said there wuz gonna be countin    .         didn   t i .  the rules can change at any time .  two .      rob scribbled a passable m  hesitated  and then drew an r just as granny said    three .         there   s gonna have tae be a    a    in there  rob     said billy bigchin .  he looked up defiantly at granny and added     i heard tell the rules can change at any time  right .         certainly .  five .      rob scratched in an a and added another m in a burst of creativity .      six and a half     said granny  calmly stroking the kitten .      whut .  ach  crivens     muttered rob  and wiped a sweaty hand on his kilt .  then he gripped the pencil again and drew an l .  it had a rather wavy foot because the pencil skidded out of his hands and the point broke .   he growled and drew his sword .      eight     said granny .  wood shavings flew as rob hacked a rather ragged fresh point out of the pencil .      nine .     an a and a d were scribbled by a rob  whose eyes were now bulging and whose cheeks were red .      ten .     rob stood to attention  looking mostly nervous but slightly proud  beside mramlad .  the feegles cheered  and those nearest to him fanned him with their kilts .      eleven .         whut .  crivens .     rob scurried back to the end of the word and plonked down a small e .      twelve .         ye can count all ye want tae  mistress     said rob  flinging down the pencil     but that   s all the marmalade there is .     this got another cheer .      an heroic effort  mr .  anybody     said granny .     the first thing a hero must conquer is his fear  and when it comes to fightin     the nac mac feegles don   t know the meanin    of the word .         aye  true enough     rob grunted .     we dinna ken the meanin    o    thousands o    wurds .         can you fight a dragon .         oh  aye  bring it on .     he was still angry about the marmalade .      run up a high mountain .         nae problemo .         read a book to the very end to save your big wee hag .         oh  aye .     rob stopped .  he looked cornered .  he licked his lips .     how many o    them pagey things would that be .     he said hoarsely .      hundreds     said granny .      wi    wurds on both sides .         yes  indeed .  in quite small writing .      rob crouched .  he always did that when he was cornered  the better to come up fighting .  the mass of feegles held their breath .      i   ll do it .     he announced grimly  clenching his fists .      good     said granny .     of course you would .  that would be heroic   for you .  but someone must go into the underworld to find the real summer lady .  that is a story .  it has happened before .  it works .  and he must do it in fear and terror like a real hero should  because a lot of the monsters he must overcome are the ones in his head  the ones he brings in with him .  it   s time for spring  and winter and its snow is still with us  so you must find him now .  you   ve got to find him and set his feet on the path .  the path that goes down  rob anybody .         aye  we ken that path     said rob .      his name is roland     said granny .     i reckon you should leave as soon as it is light .          the broomstick barreled through the black blizzard .  sticks usually went where the witches wanted them to go  and tiffany lay along the broom  tried not to freeze to death  and hoped it was taking her home .  she couldn   t see anything except darkness and rushing snow that stung her eyes  so she lay with the hat pulled down to streamline the stick .  even so  snowflakes struck her like stones and piled up on the stick .  she had to flail around every few minutes to stop things from icing up .   she did hear the roar of the falls below and felt the sudden depth of air as the stick glided out over the plains and began to sink .  she felt cold to the bone .   she couldn   t fight the wintersmith  not like annagramma could .  oh  she could plan to do it  and go to bed determined  but when she saw him        iron enough to make a nail    .  the words hung around in her head as the stick flew on and she remembered the old rhyme she   d heard years ago  when the wandering teachers came to the village .  everyone seemed to know it       iron enough to make a nail     lime enough to paint a wall     water enough to drown a dog     sulfur enough to stop the fleas     poison enough to kill a cow     potash enough to wash a shirt     gold enough to buy a bean     silver enough to coat a pin     lead enough to ballast a bird     phosphor enough to light the town       and on  and on     it was a kind of nonsense  the sort that you never remember being taught but always seem to have known .  girls skipped to it  kids dib dibbed it to see who was o u t out .   and then one day a traveling teacher  who like all the others would teach for eggs  fresh vegetables  and clean used clothing  found he got more to eat by teaching things that were interesting rather than useful .  he talked about how some wizards had once  using very skillful magic  worked out exactly what a human being was made of .  it was mostly water  but there were iron and brimstone and soot and a pinch of just about everything else  even a tiny amount of gold  but all cooked up together somehow .   it made as much sense to tiffany as anything else did .  but she was certain of this  if you took all that stuff and put it in a big bowl  it wouldn   t turn into a human no matter how much you shouted at it .   you couldn   t make a picture by pouring a lot of paint into a bucket .  if you were human  you knew that .   the wintersmith wasn   t .  the wintersmith didn   t    .   he didn   t know how the song ended  either .   the words went around and around her mind as the borrowed broom plunged onward .  at one point dr .  bustle turned up  with his reedy  self satisfied voice  and gave her a lecture on the lesser elements and how  indeed  humans were made up of nearly all of them but also contained a lot of narrativium  the basic element of stories  which you could detect only by watching the way all the others behaved    .   you run  you flee .  how do you like this  sheep girl .  you stole him from me .  is he all that you hoped for .  the voice came out of the air right beside her .      i don   t care who you are     muttered tiffany  too cold to think straight .     go away    .      hours went by .  the air down here was a bit warmer  and the snow not so fierce  but the cold still got through  no matter how much clothing you wore .  tiffany fought to stay awake .  some witches could sleep on a broomstick  but she didn   t dare try in case she dreamed she was falling and woke up to find that it was true but soon wouldn   t be .   but now there were lights below  fitful and yellow .  it was probably the inn at twoshirts  an important navigation point .   witches never stayed at inns if they could help it  because in some areas that could be dangerous  and in any case most of them inconveniently required you to pay them money .  but mrs .  umbridge  who ran the souvenir shop opposite the inn  had an old barn around the back and was what miss tick called ftw  or friendly to witches .  there was even a witch sign  scratched on the barn wall where no one who wasn   t looking for it would find it  a spoon  a pointy hat  and one big schoolmistressy checkmark .   a pile of straw had never seemed more wonderful  and inside two minutes tiffany was inside the straw .  at the other end of the little barn mrs .  umbridge   s pair of cows kept the air warm and smelling of fermented grass .   it was a dark sleep .  she dreamed of annagramma taking off the de luxe mask and revealing her face  and then taking her face off to show granny weatherwax   s face underneath    .   and then  was it worth a dance  sheep girl .  you have taken my power and i am weak .  the world will become frost .  was it worth a dance .   she sat up in the pitch black barn and thought she saw a writhing glow in the air  like a snake .  then she fell back into the darkness and dreamed of the wintersmith   s eyes .       chapter eleven      even turquoise      clang clonk .   tiffany sat bolt upright  straw tumbling off her .  but it was only the sound of a handle clanging on the side of a metal pail .   mrs .  umbridge was milking her cows .  pale daylight shone through the cracks in the walls .  she looked up when she heard tiffany .      ah  i thought one of my ladies must   ve arrived in the night     she said .     want some breakfast  dear .         please .      tiffany helped the old woman with her buckets  helped make some butter  patted her very old dog  had beans on toast  and then        i think i   ve got something here for you     said mrs .  umbridge  heading for the little counter that was twoshirts   s entire post office .     now where did i   oh yes    .      she handed tiffany a small bundle of letters and a flat parcel  all held together by an elastic band and covered with dog hairs .  she went on talking  but tiffany barely noticed .  there was something about how the carter had broken his leg  poor man  or maybe it was his horse that had broken a leg  poor creature  and one of the blizzards had brought down a lot of trees onto the track  and then the snow had set in so cruelly  dear  that not even a man on foot could get through  and so what with one thing and another the mail to and from the chalk had been delayed and really there was hardly any of it anyway     all this was a kind of background buzzing to tiffany  because the letters were all addressed to her   three from roland and one from her mother   and so was the parcel .  it had a businesslike air  and when opened revealed a sleek black box  which itself opened to reveal     tiffany had never seen a box of watercolor paints before .  she hadn   t known that so many colors existed in one place .      oh  a paint box     said mrs .  umbridge  looking over her shoulder .     that   s nice .  i had one when i was a girl .  ah  and it   s got turquoise in it .  that   s very expensive  turquoise .  that   s from your young man  is it .     she added  because old women like to know everything  or a little bit more .   tiffany cleared her throat .  in her letters she   d kept right off the whole painful subject of painting .  he must have thought she   d like to try it .   the colors in her hands gleamed like a trapped rainbow .      it   s a lovely morning     she said     and i think i   d better go home    .          on the chilly river just above the thundering lancre falls  a tree trunk was moored .  granny weatherwax and nanny ogg stood on a huge  water worn stone in the middle of the torrent and watched it .   the log was covered in feegles .  they all looked cheerful .  admittedly  certain death awaited them  but it did not involve   and this is important   having to spell anything .      you know  no man has ever gone over these falls and lived to tell the tale     said nanny .      mr .  parkinson did     said granny .     don   t you remember .  three years ago .         ah  yes  he lived  certainly  but he was left with a very bad stutter     said nanny ogg .      but he wrote it down     said granny .     he called it    my fall over the falls .     it was quite interestin    .         no one actually told a tale     said nanny .     that is my point .         aye  weel  we   re as light as wee feathers     said big yan .     an    the wind blowin    through the kilt keeps a man well aloft  ye ken .         i   m sure that   s a sight to see     said nanny ogg .      are ye all ready .     said rob anybody .     fine .  would ye be so good as to untie yon rope  mrs .  ogg .      nanny ogg undid the knot and gave the log a shove with her foot .  it drifted a little way and then got caught by the current .         row  row  row yer boat    .     daft wullie suggested .      whut aboot it .     said rob anybody as the log began to speed up .      why don   t we all sing it .     said daft wullie .  the walls of the canyon were closing in fast now .      okay     said rob .     after all  it is a pleasin    naut ickal ditty .  and wullie  ye   re tae keep yon cheese away fra    me .  i dinna like the way it   s lookin    at me .         it hasna got any eyes  rob     said wullie meekly  holding on to horace .      aye  that   s whut i mean     said rob sourly .      horace didna mean tae try an    eat ye  rob     said daft wullie meekly .     an    ye wuz sae nice an    clean when he spat ye oot .         an    hoo come ye ken whut name a cheese has .     rob demanded  as white water began to splash over the log .      he told me  rob .         aye .     said rob  and shrugged .     oh  okay .  i wouldna argue wi    a cheese .      bits of ice were bobbing on the river .  nanny ogg pointed them out to granny weatherwax .      all this snow is making the ice rivers move again     she said .      i know .         i hope you can trust the stories  esme     said nanny .      they are ancient stories .  they have a life of their own .  they long to be repeated .  summer rescued from a cave .  very old     said granny weatherwax .      the wintersmith will chase our girl  though .      granny watched the feegles    log drift around the bend .      yes  he will     she said .     and  you know  i almost feel sorry for him .          and so the feegles sailed home .  apart from billy bigchin they couldn   t carry a tune in a bucket  but that minor problem was dwarfed by the major problem  which was that they didn   t bother with the idea of singing at the same pitch  or speed  or even with the same words .  also  minor fights soon broke out  as always happened even when feegles were having fun  and so the sound that echoed among the rocks as the log sped toward the lip of the waterfall went something like      rowaarghgently boat ouchgentlydoon boat boat boatiddley boat stream boatlymerrily boatarrgh   crivennnnnns .      and with its cargo of feegles  the log tipped and disappeared  along with the accompanying song  into the mists .       tiffany flew over the long whaleback of the chalk .  it was a white whale now  but the snow didn   t look too deep here .  the bitter winds that blew the snow onto the downs also blew it away .  there were no trees and few walls to make it drift .   as she drew nearer to home  she looked down onto the lower  sheltered fields .  the lambing pens were already being set up .  there was a lot of snow for this time of year   and whose fault was that .    but the ewes were on their own timetable  snow or not .  shepherds knew how bitter the weather could be at lambing  winter never gave in without a fight .   she landed in the farmyard and said a few words to the broomstick .  it wasn   t hers  after all .  it rose again and shot off back to the mountains .  a stick can always find its way home  if you know the trick .   there were reunions  lots of laughter  a few tears  a general claiming that she had grown like a beanstalk and was already as tall as her mother and all the other things that get said at a time like this .   apart from the tiny cornucopia in her pocket  she   d left everything behind   her diary  her clothes  everything .  it didn   t matter .  she hadn   t run away  she   d run to  and here she was  waiting for herself .  she could feel her own ground under her boots again .   she hung the pointy hat behind the door and went and helped the men setting up the pens .   it was a good day .  a bit of sun had managed to leak through the murk .  against the whiteness of the snow all colors seemed bright  as if the fact that they were here gave them some special brilliance .  old harnesses on the stable wall gleamed like silver  even the browns and grays that might once have appeared so drab seemed  now  to have a life of their own .   she got out the box of paints and some precious paper and tried to paint what she was seeing  and there was a kind of magic there  too .  it was all about light and dark .  if you could get down on paper the shadow and the shine  the shape that any creature left in the world  then you could get the thing itself .   she   d only ever drawn with colored chalks before .  paint was so much better .   it was a good day .  it was a day just for her .  she could feel bits of herself opening up and coming out of hiding again .  tomorrow there would be the chores  and people very nervously coming up to the farm for the help of a witch .  if the pain was strong enough  no one worried that the witch who was making it go away was someone you last remembered being two years old and running around with only her undershirt on .   tomorrow   might become anything .  but today the winter world was full of color .       chapter twelve      the pike      there was talk of strangeness all across the plains .  there was the rowing boat belonging to the old man who lived in a shack just below the waterfall .  it rowed itself away so fast  people said  that it skipped over the water like a dragonfly   but there was no one inside it .  it was found tied up at twoshirts  where the river ran under the coach road .  but then the overnight mail coach that had been waiting outside the inn ran away by itself  with all the mailbags left behind .  the coachman borrowed a horse to give chase and found the coach in the shadow of the chalk with all the doors open and one horse missing .   the horse was returned a couple of days later by a well dressed young man who said he   d found it wandering .  surprisingly  then  it looked well fed and groomed .       very  very thick would be the best way to describe the walls of the castle .  there were no guards at night  because they locked up at eight o   clock and went home .  instead  there was old robbins  who   d once been a guard and was now officially the night watchman  but everyone knew he fell asleep in front of the fire by nine .  he had an old trumpet that he was supposed to blow if there was an attack  although no one was entirely sure what this would achieve .   roland slept in the heron tower because it was up a long flight of steps that his aunts didn   t much like climbing .  it also had very  very thick walls  and this is just as well  because at eleven o   clock someone stuck a trumpet against his ear and blew on it hard .   he leaped out of bed  got caught in the eiderdown  slipped on a mat that covered the freezing stone floor  banged his head on a cupboard  and managed to light a candle with the third desperately struck match .   on the little table by his bed was a pair of huge bellows with old robbins   s trumpet stuck in the business end .  the room was empty  except for the shadows .      i   ve got a sword  you know     he said .     and i know how to use it .         ach  ye   re deid already     said a voice from the ceiling .     chopped tae tiny wee pieces in yer bed while ye snored like a hog .  only jokin     ye ken .  none of us mean ye any harm .     there was some hurried whispering in the darkness of the rafters  and then the voice continued     wee correction there  most o    us dinna mean ye any harm .  but dinna fash yersel    aboot big yan  he disna like anybody verra much .         who are you .         aye  there ye go again  gettin    it all wrong     said the voice conversationally .     i   m up here an    heavily armed  ye ken  while ye   re doon there in yer wee nightie  makin    a bonny target  an    ye think ye are the one who asks the questions .  so ye know how to fight  do ye .         yes .         so you   ll fight monsters tae save the big wee hag .  will ye .         the big wee hag .         that   s tiffany tae ye .         you mean tiffany aching .  what   s happened to her .         you   ll be ready for when she needs ye .         yes .  of course .  who are you .         and ye know how tae fight .         i   ve read the manual of swordsmanship all the way through .      after a few seconds the voice from the high shadows said     ah  i think i   ve put ma finger on a wee flaw in this plan    .          there was an armory across the castle courtyard .  it wasn   t much of one .  there was a suit of armor made of various nonmatching pieces  a few swords  a battle axe that no one had ever been able to lift  and a chain mail suit that appeared to have been attacked by extremely strong moths .  and there were some wooden dummies on big springs for sword practice .  right now the feegles were watching roland attack one with a great deal of enthusiasm .      ach weel     said big yan despondently as roland leaped about .     if he never meets anythin    other than bits o   wood that dinna fight back  he might be okay .         he   s willin        rob anybody pointed out as roland put his foot against the dummy and tried to tug the sword point out of it .      oh  aye .     big yan looked glum .      he   s got a bonny action  ye must admit     said rob .   roland succeeded in pulling the sword out of the dummy  which sprang back on its ancient spring and hit him on the head .   blinking a little  the boy looked down at the feegles .  he remembered them from the time he was rescued from the queen of the elves .  no one who met the nac mac feegles ever forgot them  even if they tried hard .  but it was all vague .  he   d been near crazy part of the time  and unconscious  and had seen so many strange things that it was hard to know what was real and what wasn   t .   now he knew  they were real .  who   d make up a thing like this .  okay  one of them was a cheese that rolled around of its own accord  but nobody was perfect .      what am i going to have to do  mr .  anybody .     he asked .   rob anybody had been worried about this bit .  words like    underworld    can give people the wrong idea .      ye must rescue a   lady     he said .     not the big wee hag .  another   lady .  we can take ye to the place where she bides .  it   s like   undergroound  ye ken .  she   s like   sleepin    .  an    all ye ha    tae do is bring her up tae the surface  kind o    thing .         oh  you mean like orpheo rescuing euniphon from the underworld .     said roland .   rob anybody just stared .      it   s a myth from ephebe     roland went on .     it   s supposed to be a love story  but it   s really a metaphor for the annual return of summer .  there   s a lot of versions of that story .      they still stared .  feegles have very worrying stares .  they   re even worse than chickens in that respect .       a metaphor is a kind o    lie to help people understand what   s true     said billy bigchin  but this didn   t help much .      and he won her freedom by playing beautiful music     roland added .     i think he played a lute .  or maybe it was a lyre .         ach  weel  that   ll suit us fine     said daft wullie .     we   re experts at lootin    an    then lyin    aboot it .         they   re musical instruments     said billy bigchin .  he looked up at roland .     can ye play one  mister .         my aunts have a piano     said roland doubtfully .     but i   ll get into real trouble if anything happens to it .  they   ll tear the walls down .         swords it is  then     said rob anybody reluctantly .     ha    ye never fought against a real person  mister .         no .  i wanted to practice with the guards  but my aunts won   t let them .         but ye have used a sword before .      roland looked embarrassed .     not lately .  not as such .  er   not at all  in fact .  my aunts say           so how d   ye practice .     asked rob in horror .      well  there   s a big mirror in my room  you see  and i can practice   the   actual       roland began  stopping when he saw their expressions .     sorry     he added .     i don   t think i   m the type you   re looking for    .         oh  i wouldna say that     said rob anybody wearily .     accordin    tae the hag o    hags  ye   re just the laddie .  ye just need someone tae fight with    .      big yan  always suspicious  looked at his brother and followed his gaze to the battered suit of armor .      oh aye .     he growled .     weel  ah   m no    gonna be a knee .          the next day was a good day  right up to the point where it became a tight little bowl of terror .   tiffany got up early and lit the fires .  when her mother came down  she was scrubbing the kitchen floor  very hard .      er   aren   t you supposed to do that sort of thing by magic  dear .     said her mother  who   d never really got the hang of what witchcraft was all about .      no  mum  i   m supposed not to     said tiffany  still scrubbing .      but can   t you just wave your hand and make all the dirt fly away  then .         the trouble is getting the magic to understand what dirt is     said tiffany  scrubbing hard at a stain .     i heard of a witch over in escrow who got it wrong and ended up losing the entire floor and her sandals and nearly a toe .      mrs .  aching backed away .     i thought you just had to wave your hands about     she mumbled nervously .      that works     said tiffany     but only if you wave them about on the floor with a scrubbing brush .      she finished the floor .  she cleaned under the sink .  she opened all the cupboards  cleaned them out  and put everything back .  she cleaned the table  and then turned it over and cleaned it underneath .  she even washed the bottoms of the legs  where they touched the floor .  it was then that mrs .  aching went and found things to do somewhere  because this was clearly not just about good housekeeping .   it wasn   t .  as granny weatherwax once said  if you wanted to walk around with your head in the air  then you needed to have both feet on the ground .  scrubbing floors  cutting wood  washing clothes  making cheese   these things grounded you  taught you what was real .  you could set a small part of your mind to them  giving your thoughts time to line up and settle down .   was she safe here from the wintersmith .  was here safe from the wintersmith .   sooner or later she   d have to face him again   a snowman who thought he was human and had the power of the avalanche .  magic could only slow him down for a while  and make him angry .  no ordinary weapon would work  and she didn   t have many extraordinary ones .   annagramma had gone for him in a rage .  tiffany wished she could be that angry .  she   d have to go back and thank her  too .  annagramma was going to be all right  at least .  people had seen her turn into a screaming  green skinned monster .  they could respect a witch like that .  once you got respect  you   d got everything .   she   d have to try to see roland  too .  she didn   t know what to say .  that was kind of all right  because he wouldn   t know what to say  either .  they could spend whole afternoons together  not knowing what to say .  he was probably in the castle right now .  as she cleaned under the seat of a chair  she wondered what he was doing .       there was a hammering on the door of the armory .  that was the aunts for you .  the door was four thicknesses of oak and iron  but they banged on it anyway .      we will not tolerate this waywardness .     said aunt danuta .  there was a crash from the other side of the door .     are you fighting in there .         no  i   m writing a flute sonata .     shouted roland .  something heavy hit the door .   aunt danuta pulled herself together .  she looked like miss tick in general outline  but with the eyes of the perpetually offended and the mouth of an instant complainer .      if you don   t do as you   re told  i will tell your father       she began  and stopped when the door was yanked open .   roland had a cut on his arm  his face was red  sweat was dripping off his chin  and he was panting .  he raised his sword in a trembling hand .  behind him  on the other side of the gray room  was a suit of very battered armor .  it turned its helmet to look at the aunts .  this made a squeaking noise .      if you dare disturb my father     roland said as they stared at it     i shall tell him about the money that   s being taken out of the big chest in the strong room .  don   t lie .      for a moment   a blink would have missed it   aunt danuta   s face had guilt written on it  but it vanished with speed .     how dare you .  your dear mother           is dead .     shouted roland  and slammed the door .   the helmet   s visor was pushed up and half a dozen feegles peered out .      crivens  what a pair of ol    corbies     said big yan .      my aunts     said roland darkly .     what   s a corbie .         it   s like a big ol    crow that hangs around waitin    for someone tae die     said billy bigchin .      ah  then you   ve met them before     said roland with a glint in his eye .     let   s have another go  shall we .  i think i   m getting the hang of it .      there was a grumble of protests from every part of the armor  but rob anybody shouted it down .      all right .  we   ll gi   e the lad one more chance     he said .     get tae yer posts .      there were clangs and much swearing as the feegles climbed around inside the suit  but after a few seconds the armor seemed to pull itself together .  it picked up a sword and lumbered toward roland  who could hear the muffled orders coming from inside .   the sword swung  but in one quick movement he deflected it  stepped sideways  swung his own sword in a blur  and chopped the suit in half with a clang that echoed around the castle .   the top part hit the wall .  the bottom half just rocked  still standing .   after a few seconds  a lot of small heads slowly rose above the iron trousers .      was that supposed to happen .     roland said .     is everyone  er   whole .      a quick count revealed that there were indeed no half feegles  although there was a lot of bruising and daft wullie had lost his spog .  a lot of feegles were walking in circles and banging at their ears with their hands  though .  it had been a very loud clang .      no    a bad effort  that time     said rob anybody vaguely .     ye seem tae be gettin    the knowin    o    the fightin    .         it definitely seemed better  didn   t it     said roland  looking proud .     shall i have another go .         no .  i mean   no     said rob .     no  i reckon that   s enough for today  eh .      roland glanced up at the little barred window  high in the wall .     yes  i   d better go and see my father     he said  and the glow in his face faded .     it   s well past lunchtime .  if i don   t see him every day  he forgets who i am .      when the boy had gone  the feegles looked at one another .      that lad is no    havin    an easy life right noo     said rob anybody .      you   ve got tae admit he   s gettin    better     said billy bigchin .      oh  aye  i   ll warrant he   s no    such a bunty as i thought  but that sword is far tae heavy for him  an    it   ll take weeks tae get him any guid     said big yan .     ha    we got weeks  rob .      rob anybody shrugged .     who can tell .     he said .     he   s gonna be the hero  come whut may .  the big wee hag   ll meet the wintersmith soon enough .  she canna fight that .  it   s like the hag o    hags sez  ye canna fight a story as old as that .  it   ll find a way .     he cupped his hands .     c   mon lads  away tae the mound .  we   ll come back tonight .  mebbe ye can   t make a hero all in one go .          tiffany   s little brother was old enough to want to be considered older still  which is a dangerous ambition on a busy working farm  where there are big hoofed horses and sheep dips and a hundred and one other places where a small person might not be noticed until it   s too late .  but most of all he liked water .  when you couldn   t find him  he was usually down by the river  fishing .  he loved the river  which was a bit surprising since a huge green monster had once leaped out of it to eat him .  however  tiffany had hit it in the mouth with an iron frying pan .  since he   d been eating sweets at the time  wentworth   s only comment afterward had been     tiffy hit fish go bang .     but he did seem to be growing up as a skilled angler .  he was fishing this afternoon .  he   d found the knack of knowing where the monsters were .  the really big pike lurked in the deep  black holes  thinking slow hungry thoughts until wentworth   s silver lure dropped almost into their mouths .   when tiffany went to call him in  she met him staggering up the path  much disheveled  and carrying a fish that looked as if it weighed at least half as much as he did .      it   s the big one .     he shouted as soon as he saw her .     abe reckoned it was tucked in under the fallen willow  you know .  he said they   ll snap at anything this time of year .  it pulled me over  but i held on .  must weigh at least thirty pounds .      about twenty  thought tiffany  but fish are always much heavier to the man who catches them .      well done .  but come on in  it   s going to freeze     she said .      can i have it for supper .  it took ages to get in the net .  it   s at least thirty five pounds .     wentworth said  struggling under the load .  tiffany knew better than to offer to carry it .  that would be an insult .      no  it has to be cleaned and soaked for a day  and mum   s done stew for tonight .  but i   ll cook it for you tomorrow with ginger sauce .         and there   ll be enough for everyone     said wentworth happily     because it weighs at least forty pounds .         easily     tiffany agreed .   and that night  after the fish had been duly admired by everyone and found to weigh twenty three pounds with tiffany   s hand on the scales helping it along a bit  she went into the scullery and cleaned the fish  which was a nice way of talking about pulling out or cutting off everything that you shouldn   t eat  which if tiffany had her way meant the whole fish .  she didn   t much like pike  but a witch should never turn up her nose at food  especially free food  and at least a good sauce would stop it tasting of pike .   then  as she was tipping the innards into the pig bucket  she saw the glint of silver .  well  you couldn   t exactly blame wentworth for being too excited to extract the lure .   she reached down and pulled out  covered with slime and scales but very recognizably itself  the silver horse .   there should have been a roll of thunder .  there was just wentworth  in the next room  telling for the tenth time about the heroic capture of the monster fish .  there should have been a rush of wind .  barely a draft disturbed the candles .   but he knew she   d touched it .  she felt his shock .   she went to the door .  as she opened it  a few snowflakes fell  but as if suddenly happy to have an audience  more began to pour down until   with no sound but a hiss   the night turned white .  she held out her hand to catch some flakes and looked at them very closely .  little icy tiffanys melted away .   oh  yes .  he had found her .   her mind went cold  but crystal wheels of thought spun fast .   she could take a horse .    no  she   d not get far on a night like this .  she should   ve kept that broomstick .   she shouldn   t have danced .   there was nowhere to run to .  she   d have to face him again  and face him here  and stop him dead .  in the mountains  with their black forests  endless winter was hard to imagine .  it was easier here  and because it was easier it was worse  because he was bringing winter into her heart .  she could feel it growing colder .   but the snow was inches deep already  in this short time .  she was a shepherd   s daughter before she was a witch  and at this time  in this place  there were more immediate things to do .   she went into the golden warmth and light of the kitchen and said     dad  we must see to the flock .          chapter thirteen      the crown of ice      that was then .  this is now .      ach  crivens     moaned wee dangerous spike  on the roof of the cart shed .   the fire went out .  the snow that had filled the sky began to thin .  wee dangerous spike heard a scream high overhead and knew exactly what to do .  he raised his arms in the air and shut his eyes just as the buzzard swooped out of the white sky and snatched him up .   he liked this bit .  when he opened his eyes  the world was swinging beneath him and a voice nearby said     get up here quick  laddie .      he grabbed the thin leather harness above him and pulled  and the talons gently released their grip .  then  hand over hand in the wind of the flight  he dragged himself across the bird   s feathers until he could grab the belt of hamish the aviator .      rob says ye   re old enough tae come doon intae the underworld     said hamish over his shoulder .     rob   s gone tae fetch the hero .  ye are a lucky wee laddie .      the bird banked .   below  the snow   fled .  there was no more melting  it simply drew back from the lambing pen like the tide going out or a deep breath being taken  with no more sound than a sigh .   morag skimmed over the lambing field  where men were looking around in puzzlement .     one deid ship and a dozen deid lambs     said hamish     but no big wee hag .  he   s taken her .         where to .      hamish steered morag up in a big wide circle .  around the farm the snow had stopped falling .  but up on the downs it was still dropping like hammers .   and then it took a shape .      up there     he said .       all right  i   m alive .  i   m pretty sure about that .   yes .   and i can feel the cold all around me  but i don   t feel cold  which would be pretty hard to explain to anyone else .   and i can   t move .  not at all .   white all around me .  and inside my head  all white .   who am i .   i can remember the name tiffany .  i hope that was me .   white all around me .  that happened before .  it was a kind of dream or memory or something else i don   t have a word for .  and all around me  whiteness falling .  and building up around me  and lifting me up .  it was   the chalk lands being built  silently  under ancient seas .   that   s what my name means .   it means land under wave .   and  like a wave  color came flooding back into her mind .  it was mostly the redness of rage .   how dare he .   to kill the lambs .   granny aching wouldn   t have allowed that .  she never lost a lamb .  she could bring them back to life .   i should never have left here in the first place  tiffany thought .  perhaps i should have stayed and tried to learn things by myself .  but if i hadn   t gone  would i still be me .  know what i know .  would i have been as strong as my grandmother  or would i just be a cackler .  well  i   ll be strong now .   when the killing weather was blind nature  you could only cuss  but if it was walking about on two legs   then it was war .  and there would be a reckoning .   she tried to move  and now the whiteness gave way .  it felt like hard snow  but it wasn   t cold to her touch  it fell away  leaving a hole .   a smooth  slightly transparent floor stretched away in front of her .  there were big pillars rising up to a ceiling that was hidden by some sort of fog .   there were walls made of the same stuff as the floor .  they looked like ice   she could even see little bubbles inside them   but were no more than cool when she touched them .   it was a very large room .  there was no furniture of any sort .  it was just the sort of room a king would build to say    look  i can afford to waste all this space .      her footsteps echoed as she explored .  no  not even a chair .  and how comfortable would it be if she found one .   she did  eventually  find a staircase that went up  unless  of course  you started at the top  .  it led to another hall that at least had furniture .  they were the sort of couches that rich ladies were supposed to lounge on  looking tired but beautiful .  oh  and there were urns  quite big urns  and statues  too  all in the same warm ice .  the statues showed athletes and gods  very much like the pictures in chaffinch   s mythology  doing ancient things like hurling javelins or killing huge snakes with their bare hands .  they didn   t have a stitch of clothing between them  but all the men wore fig leaves  which tiffany  in a spirit of enquiry  found would not come off .   and there was a fire .  the first strange thing about it was that the logs were also of the same ice .  the other strange thing was that the flames were blue   and cold .   this level had tall pointed windows  but they began a long way from the floor and showed nothing but the sky  where the pale sun was a ghost among the clouds .   another staircase  very grand this time  led up to yet another floor with more statues and couches and urns .  who could live in a place like this .  someone who didn   t need to eat or sleep  that   s who .  someone who didn   t need to be comfortable .      wintersmith .      her voice bounced from wall to wall  sending back    ith   ith   ith       until it died away .   another staircase  then  and this time there was something new .  on a plinth  where there might have been a statue  was a crown .  it floated in the air a few feet above the base  turning gently  and glittered with frost .  a little bit farther on was another statue  smaller than most  but around this one  blue and green and gold lights danced and shimmered .   they looked just like the hublights that could sometimes be seen in the depths of winter floating over the mountains at the center of the world .  some people thought they were alive .   the statue was the same height as tiffany .      wintersmith .     there was still no reply .  a nice palace with no kitchen  no bed    .  he didn   t need to eat or sleep  so who was it for .   she knew the answer already  me .   she reached out to touch the dancing lights  and they swarmed up her arm and spread across her body  making a dress that glittered like moonlight on snowfields .  she was shocked  then angry .  then she wished she had a mirror  felt guilty about that  and went back to being angry again  and resolved that if by chance she did find a mirror  the only reason she   d look in it would be to check how angry she was .   after searching for a while  she found a mirror  which was nothing more than a wall of ice of such a dark green that it was almost black .   she did look angry .  and immensely  beautifully sparkly .  there were little glints of gold on the blue and green  just like there were in the sky on wintry nights .      wintersmith .      he must be watching her .  he could be anywhere .      all right .  i   m here .  you know that .         yes .  i do     said the wintersmith behind her .   tiffany spun around and slapped him across the face  then slapped him again with her other hand .   it was like hitting rock .  he was learning very quickly now .      that   s for the lambs     she said  trying to shake some life back into her fingers .     how dare you .  you didn   t have to .      he looked much more human .  either he was wearing real clothes or he had worked hard on making them look real .  he   d actually managed to look   well  handsome .  not cold anymore  just   cool .   he   s nothing but a snowman  her second thoughts protested .  remember that .  he   s just too smart to have coal for eyes or a carrot for a nose .      ouch     said the wintersmith  as if he   d just remembered to say it .      i demand that you let me go .     tiffany snapped .     right now .     that   s right  her second thoughts said .  you want him to end up cowering behind the saucepans on top of the kitchen dresser .  as it were        at this moment     said the wintersmith very calmly     i am a gale wrecking ships a thousand miles away .  i am freezing water pipes in a snowbound town .  i am freezing the sweat on a dying man  lost in a terrible blizzard .  i creep silently under doors .  i hang from gutters .  i stroke the fur of the sleeping bear  deep in her cave  and course in the blood of the fishes under the ice .         i don   t care .     said tiffany .     i don   t want to be here .  and you shouldn   t be here either .         child  will you walk with me .     said the wintersmith .     i will not harm you .  you are safe here .         what from .     said tiffany  and then  because too much time around miss tick does something to your conversation  even in times of stress  she changed this to     from what .         death     said the wintersmith .     here you will never die .          at the back of the feegles    chalk pit  more chalk had been carved out of the wall to make a tunnel about five feet high and perhaps as long .   in front of it stood roland de chumsfanleigh  it wasn   t his fault  .  his ancestors had been knights  and they had come to own the chalk by killing the kings who thought they did .  swords  that   s what it had all been about .  swords and cutting off heads .  that was how you got land in the old days  and then the rules were changed so that you didn   t need a sword to own land anymore  you just needed the right piece of paper .  but his ancestors had still hung on to their swords  just in case people thought that the whole thing with the bits of paper was unfair  it being a fact that you can   t please everybody .   he   d always wanted to be good with a sword  and it had come as a shock to find they were so heavy .  he was great at air sword .  in front of a mirror he could fence against his reflection and win nearly all the time .  real swords didn   t allow that .  you tried to swing them and they ended up swinging you .  he   d realized that maybe he was more cut out for bits of paper .  besides  he needed glasses  which could be a bit tricky under a helmet  especially if someone was hitting you with a sword .   he wore a helmet now  and held a sword that was   although he wouldn   t admit it   far too heavy for him .  he was also wearing a suit of chain mail that made it very hard to walk .  the feegles had done their best to make it fit  but the crotch hung down to his knees and flapped amusingly when he moved .   i   m not a hero  he thought .  i   ve got a sword  which i need two hands to lift  and i   ve got a shield that is also really heavy  and i   ve got a horse with curtains around it that i   ve had to leave at home  and my aunts will go mad when they go into the drawing room   but inside i   m a kid who would quite like to know where the privy is    .   but she rescued me from the queen of the elves .  if she hadn   t  i   d still be a stupid kid instead of   um   a young man hoping he isn   t too stupid .   the nac mac feegles had exploded back into his room  fighting their way through the storm that had arrived overnight  and now  they said  it was time for him to be a hero for tiffany    .  well  he would be .  he was sure of that .  fairly sure .  but right now the scenery wasn   t what he   d expected .      you know  this doesn   t look like the entrance to the underworld     he said .      ach  any cave can be the way in     said rob anybody  who was sitting on roland   s helmet .     but ye must ha    the knowin    o    the crawstep .  okay  big yan  ye go first    .      big yan strutted up to the chalk hole .  he stuck out his arms behind him  bent at the elbows .  he leaned backward  sticking out one leg to keep his balance .  then he wiggled the foot in the air a few times  leaned forward  and vanished as soon as the foot touched the ground .   rob anybody banged on roland   s helmet with his fist .      okay  big hero     he shouted .     off ye go .          there was no way out .  tiffany didn   t even know if there was a way in .      if you were the summer lady  then we would dance     said the wintersmith .     but i know now that you are not her  even though you seem to be .  but for the sake of you i am now human  and i must have company .      tiffany   s racing mind showed her pictures  the sprouting acorn  the fertile feet  the cornucopia .  i   m just enough of a goddess to fool a few floorboards and an acorn and a handful of seeds  she thought .  i   m just like him .  iron enough to make a nail doesn   t make a snowman human  and a couple of oak leaves don   t make me a goddess .      come     said the wintersmith     let me show you my world .  our world .          when roland opened his eyes  all he could see were shadows .  not shadows of things   just shadows  drifting like cobwebs .      i was expecting somewhere   hotter     he said  trying to keep the relief out of his voice .  around him  feegles popped out of nowhere .      ah  you   re thinkin    o    hells     said rob anybody .     they tends to be on the toasty side  it   s true .  underworlds are more o    the gloomy sort .  it   s where folks end up when they   s lost  ye ken .         what .  you mean if it   s a dark night and you take the wrong turning           ach  no .  like mebbe deid when they shouldn   t be an    there   s nae place for    em tae go  or they fall doon a gap in the worlds an    dinna ken the way .  some o    them don   t even ken where they are  poor souls .  there   s an awful lot o    that kind o    thing .  there   s no    a lot o    laughs in a underworld .  this one used tae be called limbo  ye ken     cuz the door was verra low .  looks like it   s gone way downhill since we wuz last here .     he raised his voice .     an    a big hand  lads  for young wee dangerous spike  oot wi    us for the first time .     there was a ragged cheer  and wee dangerous spike waved his sword .   roland pushed his way through the shadows  which actually offered some resistance .  the very air was gray down here .  sometimes he heard groans  or someone coughing in the distance   and then there were footsteps  shuffling toward him .   he drew his sword and peered through the gloom .   shadows parted and a very old woman in tattered  threadbare clothes shuffled past  dragging a large cardboard box behind her .  it bounced awkwardly as she tugged at it .  she didn   t even glance at roland .   he lowered the sword .      i thought there   d be monsters     he said as the old woman disappeared into the gloom .      aye     said rob anybody grimly .     there are .  think o    somethin    solid  will ye .         something solid .  .         i   m nae jokin    .  think o    a nice big mountain  or a hammer .  whatever ye do  dinna wish or regret or hope .      roland closed his eyes and then reached up to touch them .      i can still see .  but my eyes are shut .         aye .  and ye   ll see more wi    yer een shut .  look aroond ye  if ye dare .      roland  his eyes shut  took a few steps forward and looked around .  nothing seemed to have changed .  perhaps things were slightly more gloomy .  and then he saw it   a flash of bright orange  a line in the dark that came and went .      what was that .     he asked .      we dinna ken whut they call themselves .  we call    em bogles     said rob .      they are flashes of light .         ach  that one was a long way away     said rob .     if ye want tae see one close up  it   s standin    right beside ye    .      roland spun around .      ah  ye see  ye made a classic mistake right there     said rob  conversationally .     ye opened yer eyes .      roland shut his eyes .  the bogle was standing six inches away from him .   he didn   t flinch .  he didn   t scream .  hundreds of feegles were watching him  he knew .   at first he thought  it   s a skeleton .  when it flashed again  it looked like a bird  a tall bird like a heron .  then it was a stick figure  like a kid would draw .  over and over again it scribbled itself against the darkness in thin  burning lines .   it scribbled itself a mouth and leaned forward for a moment  showing hundreds of needle teeth .  then it vanished .   there was a murmur from the feegles .      aye  ye done weel     said rob anybody .     ye stared it in the mouth and ye didna take so much as a step back .         mr .  anybody  i was too scared to run     roland muttered .   rob anybody leaned down until he was level with the boy   s ear .      aye     he whispered     i ken that well enough .  there be a lot o    men who became heroes    cuz they wuz too scared tae run .  but ye didna yell nor cack yer kecks  an    that   s good .  there   ll be more o    them as we go on .  dinna let them intae yer heid .  keep    em oot .         why  what do they    .  no  don   t tell me .     said roland .   he walked on through the shadows  blinking so he wouldn   t miss anything .  the old woman had gone  but the gloom began to fill up with people .  mostly they stood by themselves  or sat on chairs .  some wandered around quietly .  they passed a man in ancient clothing who was staring at his own hand as though he were seeing it for the first time .   there was a woman swaying gently and singing a nonsense song in a quiet  little girl voice .  she gave roland a strange  mad smile as he walked past .  right behind her stood a bogle .      all right     said roland grimly .     now tell me what they do .         they eat yer memories     said rob anybody .     yer thoughts is real tae them .  wishes an    hope are like food .  they   re vermin  really .  this is whut happens when these places are no    looked after .         and how can i kill them .         oh  that was a verra nasty voice ye just used .  hark at the big wee hero .  dinna bother aboot them  laddie .  they won   t attack ye yet  and we   ve got a job tae do .         i hate this place .         aye  hells is a lot more lively     said rob anybody .     slow doon now   we   re at the river .      a river ran through the underworld .  it was as dark as the soil  and lapped at its banks in a slow  oily way .      ah  i think i   ve heard of this     said roland .     there   s a ferryman  right .      yes .   he was there  suddenly  standing in a long  low boat .  he was all in black  of course in black  with a deep hood that entirely concealed his face and gave a definite feeling that this was just as well .      hi  pal     said rob anybody cheerfully .     how   re ye doin    .      oh no  not you people again  said the dark figure in a voice that was not so much heard as felt .  i thought you were banned .      just a wee misunderstandin     ye ken     said rob  sliding down roland   s armor .     ye have tae let us in     cuz we   s deid already .      the figure extended an arm .  the black robe fell away  and what pointed at roland looked  to him  very much like a bony finger .   but he must pay the ferryman  he said accusingly  in a voice of crypts and graveyards .      not until i   m on the other side     roland said firmly .      oh  c   mon .     said daft wullie to the ferryman .     ye can see he   s a hero .  if ye canna trust a hero  who can ye trust .      the cowl regarded roland for what seemed like a hundred years .   oh  very well then .   the feegles swarmed aboard the rotting boat with their usual enthusiasm and cries of    crivens .        where   s the booze on this cruise .     and    we   re right oot in the styx noo .     and roland climbed in with care  watching the ferryman suspiciously .   the figure pulled on the big oar  and they set off with a creak and then  regrettably  and to the ferryman   s disgust  to the sound of singing .  more or less singing  that is  at every possible speed and tempo and with no regard at all for the tune      row row yer row boat boat boaty boat down boat stream boat merrily stream like a bird on the boa        will you shut up .         bonny boat row stream stream boat boat row yer boat down the merrily stream row merrily merrily boat        this is hardly appropriate .      down the boat boat down the merrily stream stream stream merrily merrily merrily merrily merrily merrily boat .         mr .  anybody .     said roland as they glided jerkily along .      aye .         why am i sitting next to a blue cheese with a bit of tartan wrapped around it .         ah  that   d be horace     said rob anybody .     he   s daft wullie   s pal .  he   s no    bein    a nuisance  is he .         no .  but he   s trying to sing .         aye  all blue cheeses hum a bit .         mnamnam mnam mnamnam     sang horace .   the boat bumped against the far bank  and the ferryman stepped ashore quickly .   rob anybody scrambled up roland   s ragged chain mail sleeve and whispered     when i gi   e ye the word  run for it .         but i can pay the ferryman .  i have the money     said roland  patting his pocket .      you whut .     said the feegle  as if this were some strange and dangerous idea .      i have the money     roland repeated .     two pennies is the rate to cross the river of the dead .  it   s an old tradition .  two pennies to put on the eyes of the dead  to pay the ferryman .         whut a clever man ye are  to be sure     said rob as roland dropped two copper coins into the ferryman   s bony hand .     an    did ye no    think tae bring four pennies .         the book just said the dead take two     said roland .      aye  mebbe they do     rob agreed     but that   s    cuz the deid dinna expect tae be comin    back .      roland looked back across the dark river .  flashes of orange light were thick on the bank they   d left .      mr .  anybody  i was once a prisoner of the queen of fairyland .         aye  i ken that .         it was for a year in this world  but it only seemed like a few days there   except that the weeks passed like centuries .  it was so   dull  i could hardly remember anything after a while .  not my name  not the feel of sunshine  not the taste of real food .         aye  we ken that   we helped tae rescue ye .  ye niver say thanks  but ye wuz oot o    yer skull the whole time  so we didna take offense .         then allow me to thank you now  mr .  anybody .         dinna mention it .  anytime .  happy tae oblige .         she had pets that fed you dreams until you died of hunger .  i hate things that try to take away what you are .  i want to kill those things  mr .  anybody .  i want to kill all of them .  when you take away memories  you take away the person .  everything they are .            tis a fine ambition ye   ve got there     said rob .     but we ha    got a wee job tae do  ye ken .  aw crivens  this is whut happens when things get sloppy an    bogles take over .      there was a big pile of bones on the path .  they were certainly animal bones  and the rotting collars and lengths of rusted chain were another clue .      three big dogs .     said roland .      one verra big dog wi    three heads     said rob anybody .     verra popular in underworlds  that breed .  can bite right through a man   s throat .  three times .     he added with relish .     but put three doggy biscuits in a row on the groond  an    the puir wee thing sits there strainin    an    whinin    all day .  it   s a wee laff  i   m tellin    ye .     he kicked at the bones .     aye  time wuz when places like this had some pers   nality .  look  see what they   ve done here  too .      farther along the path was what was probably a demon .  it had a horrible face  with so many fangs that some of them must have been just for show .  there were wings  too  but they couldn   t possibly have lifted it .  it had found a piece of mirror  and every few seconds it took a peep into it and shuddered .      mr .  anybody     said roland     is there anything down here that this sword i   m carrying could kill .         ah  no .  no    kill     said rob anybody .     no    bogles .  no    as such .  it   s no    a magic sword  see .         then why am i dragging it along .            cuz ye are a hero .  who ever heard o   a hero wi   oot a sword .      roland tugged the sword out of its scabbard .  it was heavy and not at all like the flying  darting silver thing that he   d imagined in front of the mirror .  it was more like a metal club with an edge .   he gripped it in both hands and managed to hurl it out into the middle of the slow  dark river .   just before it hit the water  a white arm rose and caught it .  the hand waved the sword a couple of times and then disappeared with it under the water .      was that supposed to happen .     he asked .      a man throwin    his sword awa    .     yelled rob .     no .  ye   re no    supposed tae bung a guid sword intae the drinkie .         no  i mean the hand     said roland .     it just           ach  they turn up sometimes .     rob anybody waved a hand as if midstream underwater sword jugglers were an everyday occurrence .     but ye   ve got no weapon noo .         you said swords can   t hurt bogles .         aye  but it   s the look o    the thing  okay .     said rob  hurrying on .      but not having a sword should make me more heroic  right .     said roland  as the rest of the feegles trotted after them .      technic   ly  aye     said rob anybody reluctantly .     but mebbe also more deid .         besides  i have a plan     said roland .      ye have a plan .     said rob .      yes .  i mean aye .         writted doon .         i   ve only just thought of       roland stopped .  the ever shifting shadows had parted  and a big cave lay ahead .   in the center of it  surrounding what looked like a rock slab  was a dim yellow glow .  there was a small figure lying on the slab .      here we are     said rob anybody .     that wasna so bad  aye .      roland blinked .  hundreds of bogles were clustered around the slab  but at a distance  as if they were not keen on going any closer .      i can see   someone lying down     he said .      that   s summer herself     said rob .     we have tae be canny aboot this .         canny .         like   careful     said rob helpfully .     goddesses can be a wee bit tricky .  verra image conscious .         don   t we just   you know  grab her and run .     said roland .      oh  aye  we   ll end up doin    somethin    like that     said rob .     but you  mister  will have tae be the one tae kiss her first .  you okay wi    that .      roland looked a bit strained  but he said     yes   er  fine .         the ladies expect it  ye ken     rob went on .      and then we run for it .     said roland hopefully .      aye     cuz probably that   s when the bogles will try an    stop us gettin    awa .     it   s people leavin    that they don   t like .  off ye go  laddie .      i   ve got a plan  thought roland  walking toward the slab .  and i   ll concentrate on it so that i don   t think about the fact that i   m walking through a crowd of scribbly monsters that are only there if i blink and my eyes are watering .  what   s in my head is real to them  right .   i   m going to blink  i   m going to blink  i   m going to        blink .  it was over in a moment  but the shudder went on for a lot longer .  they had been everywhere  and every toothy mouth was looking at him .  it should not be possible to look with teeth .   he ran forward  eyes streaming with the effort of not closing  and looked down at the figure lying in the yellow glow .  it was female  it was breathing  it was asleep  and it looked like tiffany aching .       from the top of the ice palace tiffany could see for miles  and they were miles of snow .  only on the chalk was there any sign of green .  it was an island .      you see how i learn .     said the wintersmith .     the chalk is yours .  so there summer will come  and you will be happy .  and you will be my bride and i will be happy .  and everything will be happy .  happiness is when things are correct .  now i am human  i understand these things .      don   t scream  don   t shout  said her third thoughts .  don   t freeze up  either .      oh   i see     she said .     and the rest of the world will stay in winter .         no  there are some latitudes that never feel my frost     said the wintersmith .     but the mountains  the plains as far as the circle sea   oh  yes .         millions of people will die .         but only once  you see .  that is what makes it wonderful .  and after that  no more death .      and tiffany saw it  like a hogswatch card  birds frozen to their twigs  horses and cows standing still in the fields  frozen grass like daggers  no smoke from any chimney  a world without death because there was nothing left to die  and everything glittering like tinsel .   she nodded carefully .     very   sensible     she said .     but it would be a shame if nothing moved at all .         that would be easy .  snow people     said the wintersmith .     i can make them human .         iron enough to make a nail .     said tiffany .      yes .  it is easy .  i have eaten sausage .  and i can think .  i never thought before .  i was a part .  now i am apart .  only when you are apart do you know who you are .         you made me roses of ice     said tiffany .      yes .  already i was becoming .      but the roses melted at dawn  tiffany added to herself  and glanced at the pale yellow sun .  it had just enough strength to make the wintersmith sparkle .  he does think like a human  she thought  looking into the odd smile .  he thinks like a human who   s never met another human .  he   s cackling .  he   s so mad  he will never understand how mad he is .   he just doesn   t have a clue what    human    means  he doesn   t know what horrors he   s planning  he just doesn   t   understand .  and he   s so happy he   s almost sweet    .       rob anybody banged on roland   s helmet .      get on wi    it  laddie     he demanded .   roland stared at the glowing figure .     this can   t be tiffany .         ach  she   s a goddess  she can look like anythin        said rob anybody .     just a wee peck on the cheek  okay .  dinna get enthusiastic  we havena got all day .  a wee peck an    we   re offski .      something butted roland on the ankle .  it was a blue cheese .      dinna fash yerself aboot horace   he just wants ye tae do the right thing     said the mad feegle whom roland had come to know as daft wullie .   he went closer  with the glow crackling around him  because no man wants to be a coward in front of a cheese .      this is kind of   embarrassing     he said .      crivens  get on wi    it  will ye .      roland leaned forward and pecked the sleeping cheek .   the sleeper opened her eyes  and he took a step back very quickly .      that   s not tiffany aching .     he said  and blinked .  bogles were as thick around him as grass stems .      now take her by the hand an    run     said rob anybody .     the bogles will turn nasty when they see we   re leavin    .     he banged cheerfully on the side of the helmet and added     but that   s okay  right .     cuz ye have a plan .         i hope i   ve got it right  though     said roland .     my aunts say i   m too clever by half .         glad tae hear it     said rob anybody        cuz that   s much better than bein    too stupid by three quarters .  now grab the lady an    run .      roland tried to avoid the stare of the girl as he took her hand and pulled her gently off the slab .  she said something in a language he couldn   t understand  except that it sounded as though there were a question mark on the end of it .      i   m here to rescue you     he said .  she looked at him with the golden eyes of a snake .      the sheep girl is in trouble     she said  in a voice full of unpleasant echoes and hisses .     so sad  so sad .         well  er  we   d better run     he managed     whoever you are    .      the not tiffany gave him a smile .  it was an uncomfortable one  with a bit of a smirk in it .  they ran .      how do you fight the bogles .     he panted when the feegle army jogged through the caves .      ach  they dinna like the taste o    us overmuch     said rob anybody as the shadows parted .     it may be    cuz we think aboot the drinkin    a lot   it makes    em squiffy .  keep movin    .      and it was at this point that the bogles struck  although that was hardly the right word .  it was more like running into a wall of whispers .  nothing grabbed  there were no claws .  if thousands of tiny weak things like shrimps or flies were trying to stop someone  this would be how it felt .   but the ferryman was waiting .  he raised a hand as roland staggered toward the boat .   that will be six pennies  he said .      six .     said roland .      ah  we wasna doon here more   n two hour  an    bang went sixpence .     said daft wullie .   one one day round trip  one one way  said the ferryman .      i don   t have that much .     roland shouted .  he was beginning to feel little tugs in his head now .  thoughts had to push hard to get as far as his mouth .      leave this tae me     said rob anybody .  he turned to look down on his fellow feegles and banged on roland   s helmet for silence .      okay  lads     he announced .     we   re no    leavin    .      what .  said the ferryman .  oh no  you leave .  i   m not having you down here again .  we   re still finding the bottles from last time .  come on  get on the boat this minute .      crivens  we canna do that  pal     said rob anybody .     we   re under a geas to help this lad  ye ken .  where he disna go  we dinna go .      people are not supposed to want to stay here .  snapped the ferryman .      ach  we   ll soon ha    the old place jumpin    again     said rob anybody  grinning .   the ferryman drummed his fingers on the pole .  they made a clicking sound  like dice .   oh  all right then .  but   and i want to be clear on this   there is to be no singing .   roland dragged the girl onto the boat .  the bogles kept clear of that  at least  but as the ferryman pushed away from the shore  big yan kicked roland on the boot and pointed upward .  scribbles of orange light  hundreds of them  were moving across the roof of the cavern .  there were more of them on the opposite shore .      how   s the plan goin     mister hero .     asked rob anybody quietly as he climbed down from the boy   s helmet .      i   m waiting for the opportune moment     said roland haughtily .  he turned to look at the not tiffany .     i   m here to get you out     he said  trying not to look directly at her eyes .      you .     said the not tiffany  as if the idea were amusing .      well  us     roland corrected himself .     everything is        there was a bump as the boat grounded on the farther shore  where the bogles were as thick as standing corn .      off ye go  then     said big yan .   roland pulled the not tiffany along the path for a few steps  and stopped .  when he blinked  the path ahead was a writhing orange mass .  he could feel the little pulls on him  no stronger than a breeze .  but they were in his brain  too .  cold  and nibbling .  this was stupid .  it couldn   t work .  he wouldn   t be able to do it .  he wasn   t any good at this sort of thing .  he was wayward and inconsiderate and disobedient  just like his   aunts   said .   behind him  daft wullie shouted  in his cheerful way     make yer aunties proud of ye .      roland half turned  suddenly angry .     my aunts .  let me tell you about my aunts           no time  laddie .     shouted rob anybody .     get on wi    it .      roland looked around  his mind on fire .   our memories are real  he thought .  and i will not stand for this .   he turned to the not tiffany and said     don   t be afraid .     then he held out his left hand and whispered  under his breath     i remember   a sword    .      when he shut his eyes  there it was   so light he could barely feel it  so thin he could hardly see it  a line in the air that was made up mostly of sharpness .  he   d killed a thousand enemies with it  in the mirror .  it was never too heavy  it moved like part of him  and here it was .  a weapon that chopped away everything that clung and lied and stole .      mebbe ye can make a hero all in one go     said rob anybody thoughtfully  as bogles scribbled themselves into existence and died .  he turned to daft wullie .     daft wullie .     he said .     can ye bring to mind when it was i told ye that sometimes ye say exactly the right thing .      daft wullie looked baffled .     noo that ye mention it  rob  i dinna recall ye ever sayin    that  ever .         aye .     said rob .     weel  if i had done  just now would ha    been one o    those times .      daft wullie looked worried .     that   s all right though  aye .  i said somethin    right .         aye .  ye did  daft wullie .  a first .  i   m proud o    ye     said rob .   daft wullie   s face split in an enormous grin .     crivens .  hey  lads  i said           but dinna get carried awa        rob added .   as roland swung the airy blade  the bogles parted like spiderwebs .  there were more  always more  but the silver line always found them  cutting him free .  they backed away  tried new shapes  recoiled from the heat of the anger in his head .  the sword hummed .  bogles curled around the blade and squealed  and sizzled into nothingness on the floor        and someone was banging on his helmet .  they   d been doing so for quite a while .      huh .     he said  opening his eyes .      ye   ve run oot     said rob anybody .  his chest heaving  roland looked around .  eyes open or shut  the caves were empty of orange streaks .  the not tiffany was watching him with a strange smile on her face .      either we get oot noo     said rob     or ye can hang aroond and wait for some more  mebbe .         an    here they come     said billy bigchin .  he pointed across the river .  a pure mass of orange was pouring into the cave  so many bogles that there was no space between them .   roland hesitated  still fighting for breath .      i   ll tell ye whut     said rob anybody soothingly .     if ye are a guid boy an    rescue the lady  we   ll bring ye doon here another time  wi    some sandwiches so   s we can make a day o    it .      roland blinked .     er  yes     he said .     um   sorry .  i don   t know what happened just then    .         offski time .     yelled big yan .  roland grabbed the hand of the not tiffany .      an    don   t look back until we   re well oot o    here     said rob anybody .     it   s kind of traditional .          on the top of the tower  the ice crown appeared in the wintersmith   s pale hands .  it shone more than diamonds could  even in the pale sunlight .  it was purest ice  without bubbles  lines  or flaw .      i made this for you     he said .     the summer lady will never wear it     he added sadly .   it fit perfectly .  it didn   t feel cold .   he stepped back .      and now it is done     said the wintersmith .      there is something i have to do  too     said tiffany .     but first there   s something i have to know .  you found the things that make a man .         yes .         how did you find out what they were .      the wintersmith proudly told her about the children  while tiffany breathed carefully  forcing herself to relax .  his logic was very   logical .  after all  if a carrot and two pieces of coal can make a heap of snow a snowman  then a big bucket of salts and gases and metal should certainly make him a human .  it made   sense .  at least  sense to the wintersmith .      but  you see  you need to know the whole song     said tiffany .     it is mostly only about what humans are made of .  it isn   t about what humans are .         there were some things that i could not find     said the wintersmith .     they made no sense .  they had no substance .         yes     said tiffany  nodding sadly .     the last three lines  i expect  which are the whole point .  i   m really sorry about that .         but i will find them     said the wintersmith .     i will .         i hope you do  one day     said tiffany .     now  have you ever heard of boffo .         what is this boffo .  it was not in the song .     said the wintersmith  looking uneasy .      oh  boffo is how humans change the world by fooling themselves     said tiffany .     it   s wonderful .  and boffo says that things have no power that humans don   t put there .  you can make things magical  but you can   t magically make a human out of things .  it   s just a nail in your heart .  only a nail .      and the time has come and i know what to do  she thought dreamily .  i know how the story has to end .  i must end it in the right kind of way .   she pulled the wintersmith toward her and saw the look of astonishment on his face .  she felt light headed  as though her feet weren   t touching the floor .  the world became   simpler .  it was a tunnel  leading to the future .  there was nothing to see but the wintersmith   s cold face  nothing to hear but her own breathing  nothing to feel but the warmth of the sun on her hair .   it wasn   t the fiery globe of summer  but it was still much bigger than any bonfire could ever be .   where this takes me  there i choose to go  she told herself  letting the warmth pour into her .  i choose .  this i choose to do .  and i   m going to have to stand on tiptoe  she added .   thunder on my right hand .  lightning in my left hand .   fire above me    .      please     she said     take the winter away .  go back to your mountains .  please .      frost in front of me    .      no .  i am winter .  i cannot be anything else .         then you cannot be human     said tiffany .     the last three lines are     strength enough to build a home  time enough to hold a child  love enough to break a heart .         balance   and it came quickly  out of nowhere  lifting her up inside .   the center of the seesaw does not move .  it feels neither upness nor downness .  it is balanced .   balance   and his lips were like blue ice .  she   d cry  later  for the wintersmith who wanted to be human .   balance   and the old kelda had once told her     there   s a little bitty bit inside ye that willna melt and flow .      time to thaw .   she shut her eyes and kissed the wintersmith        and drew down the sun .   frost to fire .       the entire top of the ice palace melted in a flash of white light that cast shadows on walls a hundred miles away .  a pillar of steam roared up  stitched with lightning  and spread out above the world like an umbrella  covering the sun .  then it began to fall back as a soft  warm rain that punched little wormholes in the snow .   tiffany  her head usually so full of thoughts  hadn   t got a thought to spare .  she lay on a slab of ice in the soft rain and listened to the palace collapse around her .   there are times when everything that you can do has been done and there   s nothing for it now but to curl up and wait for the thunder to die down .   there was something else in the air  too  a golden glint that vanished when she tried to look at it and then turned up again in the corner of her eye .   the palace was melting like a waterfall .  the slab she lay on half slid and half floated down a staircase that was turning into a river .  above her  huge pillars fell but went from ice to a gush of warm water in midair  so that what crashed down was spray .   good bye to the glittering crown  tiffany thought with a touch of regret .  good bye to the dress made of dancing light  and good bye to the ice roses and the snowflakes .  such a shame .  such a shame .   and then there was grass under her  and so much water pouring past her that it was a case of get up or drown .  she managed to get to her knees  at least  and waited until it was possible to stand up without being knocked over .      you have something of mine  child     said a voice behind her .  she turned  and golden light rushed into a shape .  it was her own shape  but her eyes were    odd  like a snake   s .  right here and now  with the roaring of the heat of the sun still filling her ears  this didn   t seem very amazing .   slowly  tiffany took the cornucopia out of her pocket and handed it over .      you are the summer lady  aren   t you .     she asked .      and you are the sheep girl who would be me .     there was a hiss to the words .      i didn   t want to be .     said tiffany hurriedly .     why do you look like me .      the summer lady sat down on the turf .  it is very strange to watch yourself  and tiffany noticed she had a small mole on the back of her neck .      it   s called resonance     she said .     do you know what that is .         it means    vibrating with        said tiffany .      how does a sheep girl know that .         i have a dictionary     said tiffany .     and i   m a witch  thank you .         well  while you were picking up things from me  i   ve been picking up things from you  clever sheep witch     said the summer lady .  she was beginning to remind tiffany a lot of annagramma .  that was actually a relief .  she didn   t sound wise  or nice   she was just another person  who happened to be very powerful but not frighteningly smart and was  frankly  a bit annoying .      what   s your real shape .     tiffany asked .      the shape of heat on a road  the shape of the smell of apples .     nice reply  tiffany thought  but not helpful  as such .   tiffany sat down next to the goddess .     am i in trouble .     she asked .      because of what you did to the wintersmith .  no .  he has to die every year  as do i .  we die  and sleep and wake .  besides   you were entertaining .         oh .  i was entertaining  was i .     said tiffany  her eyes narrowing .      what is it you want .     asked the summer lady .  yes  thought tiffany  just like annagramma .  wouldn   t spot a hint a mile high .      want .     said tiffany .     nothing .  just the summer  thank you .      the summer lady looked puzzled .     but humans always want something from gods .         but witches don   t accept payment .  green grass and blue skies will do .         what .  you   ll get those anyway .     the summer lady sounded both confused and angry  and tiffany was quite happy about this  in a small and spiteful way .      good     she said .      you saved the world from the wintersmith .         actually  i saved it from a silly girl  miss summer .  i put right what i put wrong .         one simple mistake .  you   d be a silly girl not to accept a reward .         i   d be a sensible young woman to refuse one     said tiffany  and it felt good to say that .     winter is over .  i know .  i   ve seen it through .  where it took me  there i chose to go .  i chose when i danced with the wintersmith .      the summer lady stood up .     remarkable     she said .     and strange .  and now we part .  but first  some more things must be taken .  stand up  young woman .      tiffany did so  and when she looked into the face of summer  golden eyes became pits that drew her in .   and then the summer filled her up .  it must have been for only a few seconds  but inside them it went on for much longer .  she felt what it was like to be the breeze through green corn on a spring day  to ripen an apple  to make the salmon leap the rapids   the sensations came all at once and merged into one great big  glistening  golden yellow feeling of summer        that grew hotter .  now the sun turned red in a burning sky .  tiffany drifted through air like warm oil into the searing calm of deep deserts  where even camels die .  there was no living thing .  nothing moved except ash .   she drifted down a dried up riverbed  with pure white animal bones on the banks .  there was no mud  not one drop of moisture in this oven of a land .  this was a river of stones   agates banded like a cat   s eye  garnets lying loose  thunder eggs with their rings of color  stones of brown  orange  creamy white  some with black veins  all polished by the heat .      here is the heart of the summer     hissed the voice of the summer lady .     fear me as much as the wintersmith .  we are not yours  though you give us shapes and names .  fire and ice we are  in balance .  do not come between us again    .      and now  at last  there was movement .  from out of gaps between the stones they came like stones brought alive  bronze and red  umber and yellow  black and white  with harlequin patterns and deadly gleaming scales .   the snakes tested the boiling air with their forked tongues and hissed triumphantly .   the vision vanished .  the world came back .   the water had poured away .  the everlasting wind had teased the fogs and steams into long streamers of cloud  but the unconquered sun was finding its way through .  and  as always happens  and happens far too soon  the strange and wonderful becomes a memory and a memory becomes a dream .  tomorrow it   s gone .   tiffany walked across the grass where the palace had been .  there were a few pieces of ice left  but they would be gone in an hour .  there were the clouds  but clouds drifted away .  the normal world pressed in on her  with its dull little songs .  she was walking on a stage after the play was over  and who now could say it had ever happened .   something sizzled on the grass .  tiffany reached down and picked up a piece of metal .  it was still warm with the last of the heat that had twisted it out of shape  but you could see that it had once been a nail .   no  i won   t take a gift to make the giver feel better  she thought .  why should i .  i   ll find my own gifts .  i was      entertaining    to her  that   s all .   but him   he made me roses and icebergs and frost and never understood    .   she turned suddenly at the sound of voices .  the feegles came bounding over the slope of the downs  at a speed just fast enough for a human to keep up .  and roland was keeping up  panting a little  his overlarge chain mail making him run like a duck .   she laughed .       two weeks later tiffany went back to lancre .  roland took her as far as twoshirts  and the pointy hat took her the rest of the way .  that was a bit of luck .  the driver remembered miss tick  and since there was a spare space on the roof of the coach  he wasn   t prepared to go through all that again .  the roads were flooded  the ditches gurgled  the swollen rivers sucked at the bridges .   first she visited nanny ogg  who had to be told everything .  that saved some time  because once you   ve told nanny ogg  you   ve more or less told everyone else .  when she heard exactly what tiffany had done to the wintersmith  she laughed and laughed .   tiffany borrowed nanny   s broomstick and flew slowly across the forests to miss treason   s cottage .   things were going on .  in the clearing  several men were digging the vegetable area  and lots of people were hanging around the door  so she landed back in the woods  shoved the broom into a rabbit hole and her hat under a bush  and walked back on foot .   stuck in a birch tree where the track entered the clearing was   a doll  maybe  made out of lots of twigs bound together .  it was new  and a bit worrying .  that was probably the idea .   no one saw her raise the catch on the scullery door or slip inside the cottage .  she leaned against the kitchen wall and went quiet .   from the next room came the unmistakable voice of annagramma at her most typically annagrammatical .         only a tree  do you understand .  cut it up and share the wood .  agreed .  and now shake hands .  go on .  i mean it .  properly  or else i   ll get angry .  good .  that feels better  doesn   t it .  let   s have no more of this silliness        after ten minutes of listening to people being scolded  grumbled at  and generally prodded  tiffany crept out again  cut through the woods  and walked into the clearing via the track .  there was a woman hurrying toward her  but she stopped when tiffany said     excuse me  is there a witch near here .         ooooh  yes     said the woman  and gave tiffany a hard stare .     you   re not from around here  are you .         no     said tiffany  and thought  i lived here for months  mrs .  carter  and i saw you most days .  but i always wore the hat .  people always talk to the hat .  without the hat  i   m in disguise .      well  there   s miss hawkin     said mrs .  carter  as if reluctant to give away a secret .     be careful  though .     she leaned forward and lowered her voice .     she turns into a terrible monster when she   s angry .  i   ve seen her .  she   s all right with us  of course     she added .     lots of young witches have been coming to learn things from her .         gosh  she must be good .         she   s amazing     mrs .  carter went on .     she   d only been here five minutes and she seemed to know all about us .         amazing     said tiffany .  you   d think that somebody wrote it all down .  twice .  but that wouldn   t be interesting enough  would it .  and who would believe that a real witch bought her face from boffo .      and she   s got a cauldron that bubbles green     mrs .  carter said with great pride .     all down the sides .  that   s proper witching  that is .         it sounds like it     said tiffany .  no witch she   d met had done anything with a cauldron apart from make stew  but somehow people believed in their hearts that a witch   s cauldron should bubble green .  and that must be why mr .  boffo sold item     bubbling green cauldron kit       extra sachets of green     each .   well  it worked .  it probably shouldn   t  but people were people .  she didn   t think annagramma would be particularly interested in a visit right now  especially from someone who   d read all the way through the boffo catalogue  so she retrieved her broom and headed on to granny weatherwax   s cottage .   there was a chicken run out in the back garden now .  it had been carefully woven out of pliable hazel  and contented werks were coming from the other side .   granny weatherwax was coming out of the back door .  she looked at tiffany as if the girl had just come back from a ten minute stroll .      i   ve got business down in the town right now     she said .     it wouldn   t worry me if you came  too .     that was  from granny  as good as a brass band and an illuminated scroll of welcome .  tiffany fell in alongside her as she strode off along the track .      i hope i find you well  mistress weatherwax .     she said  hurrying to keep up .      i   m still here after another winter  that   s all i know     said granny .     you look well  girl .         oh  yes .         we saw the steam from up here     said granny .   tiffany said nothing .  that was it .  well  yes .  from granny  that would be it .   after a while granny said     come back to see your young friends  eh .      tiffany took a deep breath .  she   d been through this in her head dozens of times  what she would say  what granny would say  what she would shout  what granny would shout        you planned it  didn   t you .     she said .     if you   d suggested one of the others  they   d probably have got the cottage  so you suggested me .  and you knew  you just knew that i   d help her .  and it   s all worked out  hasn   t it .  i bet every witch in the mountains knows what happened by now .  i bet mrs .  earwig is seething .  and the best bit is  no one got hurt .  annagramma   s picked up where miss treason left off  all the villagers are happy  and you   ve won .  oh  i expect you   ll say it was to keep me busy and teach me important things and keep my mind off the wintersmith  but you still won .      granny weatherwax walked on calmly .  then she said     i see you got your little trinket back .      it was like having a bolt of lightning and then not getting any thunder  or throwing a pebble into a pool and not getting a splash .      what .  oh .  the horse .  yes .  look  i           what kind of fish .         er   pike     said tiffany .      ah .  some likes    em  but they are too muddy for my taste .      and that was it .  against granny   s calm she had nowhere to go .  she could nag  she could whine  and it wouldn   t make any difference .  tiffany consoled herself with the fact that at least granny knew that she knew .  it wasn   t much  but it was all she was going to get .      and the horse ain   t the only trinket i see     granny continued .     magick  is it .     she always stuck a k on the end of any magic she disapproved of .   tiffany glanced down at the ring on her finger .  it had a dull shine .  it   d never rust while she wore it  the blacksmith had told her  because of the oils in her skin .  he   d even taken the time to cut little snowflakes in it with a tiny chisel .      it   s just a ring i had made out of a nail     she said .      iron enough to make a ring     said granny  and tiffany stopped dead .  did she really get into people   s minds .  it had to be something like that .      and why did you decide you wanted a ring .     said granny .   for all sorts of reasons that never quite managed to be clear in tiffany   s head  she knew .  all she could think of to say was     it seemed like a good idea at the time .     she waited for the explosion .      then it probably was     said granny mildly .  she stopped  pointed away from the path   in the direction of the town and nanny ogg   s house   and said     i put the fence around it .  it   s got other things protectin    it  you may be sure of that  but some beasts is just too stupid to scare .      it was the oak tree sapling  already five feet high .  a fence of poles and woven branches surrounded it .      growing fast  for oak     said granny .     i   m keeping an eye on it .  but come on  i don   t want to miss it .     she set off again  covering the ground fast .  bewildered  tiffany ran after her .      miss what .     she panted .      the dance  of course .         isn   t it too early for that .         not up here .  they starts up here .      granny hurried along little paths and behind gardens and came out into the town square  which was thronged with people .  small stalls had been set up .  a lot of people were standing around in the slightly hopeless why are we here .  way of crowds who   re doing what their hearts want to do but their heads feel embarrassed about  but at least there were hot things on sticks to eat .  there were lots of white chickens  too .  very good eggs  nanny had said  so it would have been a shame to kill them .   granny walked to the front of the crowd .  there was no need to push people out of the way .  they just moved sideways  without noticing .   they   d arrived just in time .  children came running along the road to the bridge  only just ahead of the dancers who  as they trudged along  seemed like quite homely and ordinary men   men tiffany   d seen often  working in forges or driving carts .  they all wore white clothes  or at least clothes that had been white once  and like the audience they looked a bit sheepish  their expressions suggesting that this was all just a bit of fun  really  not to be taken seriously .  they were even waving to people in the crowd .  tiffany looked around and saw miss tick  and nanny  and even mrs .  earwig   nearly every witch she knew .  oh  and there was annagramma  minus mr .  boffo   s little devices  and looking very proud .   it wasn   t like this last autumn  she thought .  it was dark and quiet and solemn and hidden  everything that this isn   t .  who watched it from the shadows .   who is watching now from the light .  who is here in secret .   a drummer and a man with an accordion pushed their way through the crowd  along with the local pub owner carrying eight pints of beer on a tray  because no grown man is going to dance in front of his friends with ribbons around his hat and bells on his trousers without the clear prospect of a large drink  .   when the noise had died down a bit  the drummer beat the drum a few times and the accordionist played a long drawn out chord  the legal signal that a morris dance is about to begin  and people who hang around after this have only got themselves to blame .   the two man band struck up .  the men  in two lines of three facing each other  counted the beat and then leaped    .  tiffany turned to granny as twelve hobnailed boots crashed to the ground  throwing up sparks .      tell me how to take away pain     she said  above the noise of the dance .   crash .      it   s hard     said granny  not taking her eyes off the dancers .  crash went the boots again .      you can move it out of the body .      crash .      sometimes .  or hide it .  or make a cage for it and carry it away .  and all of it   s dangerous  and it will kill you if you don   t respect it  young woman .  it is all price and no profit .  you are asking me to tell you how to put your hand in the lion   s mouth .      crash .      i must know  to help the baron .  it   s bad .  there is a lot i have to do .         this you choose to do .     said granny  still watching .      yes .      crash .      this is your baron who doesn   t like witches .     said granny  her gaze going from face to face in the crowd .      but who does like witches until they need one  mistress weatherwax .     said tiffany sweetly .   crash .      this is a reckoning  mistress weatherwax     tiffany added .  after all  once you   ve kissed the wintersmith  you   re in the mood to dare .  and granny weatherwax smiled  as if she   d done all that was expected of her .      ha .  is it now .     she said .     very well .  come and see me again before you go  and we   ll see what you may take back with you .  and i hopes you can close the doors you are opening .  now watch the people .  sometimes you see her .      tiffany paid attention to the dance .  the fool had turned up without her noticing  wandering around collecting money in his greasy top hat .  if a girl looked as though she   d squeal if he kissed her  he gave her a kiss .  and sometimes  without any warning  he   d spring off into the dance  spinning through the men with never a foot in the wrong place .   then tiffany saw it .  the eyes of a woman on the other side of the dance flashed gold  just for a moment .  once she   d seen it  she saw it again   in the eyes of a boy  a girl  the man holding the beer  moving around to watch the fool        summer   s here .     said tiffany  and realized that she was tapping her foot to the beat  she realized it because a heavier boot had just trodden on it and pinned it gently but firmly to the ground .  beside it  you looked up at her in blue eyed innocence that became  for the briefest fragment of a second  the lazy golden eyes of a snake .      she   s meant to be     said granny weatherwax  removing her boot .      a few coppers for luck  miss .     said a voice close by  and there was the sound of money being shaken in an ancient hat .   tiffany turned and looked into purple gray eyes .  the face around them was lined and tanned and grinning .  he had a gold earring .     a copper or two from the lovely lady .     he wheedled .     silver or gold  maybe .      sometimes  tiffany thought  you just know how it all should go    .      iron .     she said  taking the ring off her finger and dropping it into the hat .   the fool picked it out  delicately  and flipped it into the air .  tiffany   s eye followed it  but somehow it wasn   t in the air anymore but was glistening on the man   s finger .      iron   s enough     he said  and gave her a sudden kiss on the cheek .   it was only slightly chilly .       the galleries inside the feegle mound were crowded but hushed .  this was important .  the honor of the clan was at stake here .   in the middle was a large book  taller than rob and filled with colorful pictures .  it was quite muddy from its journey down into the mound .  rob had been challenged .  for years he   d thought himself to be a hero  and then the hag o    hags had said he wasna  no    really .  weel  you couldn   t argue wi    the hag o    hags  but he wuz goin    to rise tae the challenge  oh aye  so he wuz  or his name wasna rob anybody .      where   s mah coo .     he read .     is that mah coo .  it gaes cluck .  it is a   a   chicken .  it is no    mah coo .  an    then there   s this wee paintin    o    a couple o    chickens .  that   s another page  right .         it is indeed  rob     said billy bigchin .   there was a cheer from the assembled feegles as rob ran around the book  waving his hands in the air .      an    this one is a lot harder than abker  right .     he said  when he   d done the circuit .     that one was easy .  an    a very predictable plot .  whoever writted that book didna stretch himself  in ma opinion .         you mean the abc .     said billy bigchin .      aye .     rob anybody jumped up and down and punched the air a few times .     got somethin    a wee bit tougher .      the gonnagle looked at the stack of battered books the feegles had  in various ways  collected .      somethin    i can get ma teeth intae     rob added .     a big book .         well  this one   s called principles of modern accountancy     said billy doubtfully .      an    is that a big heroic book to read .     said rob  running on the spot .      aye .  probably  but        rob anybody held up a hand for silence and looked across at jeannie  who had a crowd of little feegles surrounding her .  she was smiling at him  and his sons were staring at their father in silent astonishment .  one day  rob thought  they   ll be able to walk up to even the longest words and give them a good kicking .  not even commas and those tricksie semicolonses will stop them .   he had to be a hero .      ah   m feelin    guid about this readin        said rob anybody .     bring it on .      and he read principles of modern accountancy all morning  but just to make it interesting  he put lots of dragons in it .       author   s note      the morris dance        is traditionally danced on may    to welcome in the summer .  its history is a bit confused  possibly because it   s often danced near pubs  but it is now the english folk dance .  the dancers usually wear white  and have bells sewn on their clothes .  it is danced by both men and women  and is certainly now danced in the united states too .   i know this because i saw the dark morris danced in a bookshop in chicago some years ago .   i   d invented the dark morris for another book called reaper man  at least i think i invented it   and a morris team  officially known as a side  turned up in all black  just for me .  they danced it in silence and perfect time  without the music and bells of the    summer    dance .   it was beautifully done .  but it was also a bit creepy .  so it might not be a good idea to try it at home    .       about the author      terry pratchett is one of the world   s most popular writers .  his first short story was published when he was     and his first book was
