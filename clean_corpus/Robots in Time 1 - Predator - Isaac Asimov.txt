the laws of robotics      .   a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .       .   a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .       .   a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law    foreward    in    robot visions     dr .  isaac asimov writes about a question inherent in any time travel story   whether individuals traveling in time will alter events that would have occurred without the interference of a time traveler .  most writers who tackle this question write about changing the past and whether doing so is desirable or not .  the good doctor  once again exhibiting the originality of his own vision  chooses to focus on a more rarely examined concern  of traveling into the future  and the possible consequences of doing so .   stories that merely take place in the future are not the same as stories about individuals who travel from their own time  whatever it is  to their future .  to my knowledge  the first science fiction novel to tell such a story is the classic novel by h .  g .  wells  the time machine .  in it wells writes of a man who travels to the distant future from victorian england  the time and place in which wells was writing the novel .  however  wells presented a dystopian vision of the future as a warning of what could happen if the rigid social and economic divisions of his own society worsened to the extreme .  the possibility of avoiding that vision lay not with the time traveler  but with the people who lived in wells   s time .  wells did not really examine whether his time traveler   s report to his friends back in his own time would bring about a different future .   two theories of history influence the tale any writer tells about time travel .  one belief is that only large forces such as technological advance  economic change  and the development of religions and philosophies determine the direction of history .  the other theory is that any event     no matter how small  sends out ripples of influence that profoundly affect all other events .  an historian told me that his colleagues are about evenly divided in their support of these theories .  authors of time travel stories always write with one or the other implicit  if not explicit  in their work .   i first discovered the science fiction of isaac asimov as a child and have read both his fiction and nonfiction in the years since then .  writing time travel stories about his positronic robots and his three laws of robotics is therefore a special honor for me  and i hope you will enjoy the robots in time series .  by way of introduction  this book presents the late dr .  asimov   s fantastic    robot visions .        william f .  wu .          mojave center governor sat in his office  deep in the underground city of mojave center .  he was an experimental humaniform robot of a type that was new this year       .  each of the governor robots was currently running all the municipal systems of one entire  newly constructed city .  they were doing so under probationary status  monitored by a committee of scientists through their computer .   his office was in the middle level of the city  in the center of that level .  he didn   t really need an office at all since most of his work was done through his radio link to the city computer or directly to municipal departments  further  he could plug into various terminals when necessary .  however  he had learned that humans sometimes preferred doing business in an office  so he maintained a small room in mojave center for that purpose .   at the moment  mc governor was alone .  he plugged his humaniform forefinger into a wall jack .  inside the jack  the end of his finger opened and plugged into the system .  he contacted the city computer .      i am going to run a simulation program again     said mc governor .     i will continue my normal duties through my multi tasking system .  however  i instruct you not to transfer any communication or other interruption lower than priority   .  when i have finished running the simulation  i will notify you .         acknowledged     said the city computer .   mc governor returned his finger to human shape  breaking the shielded connection .  for the sake of security  he told himself  he chose not to use radio communication concerning the simulation programs .  lately he had been running them more often than before .   he ran down his list of programs .  they were standard simulation programs that all the governors used to discover and correct potential problems and challenges without actually having to face them in real life .  his favorites involved some sort of disaster that befell mojave center  requiring him to respond urgently under the laws of robotics to restore the situation to normal .  like all positronic robots  he was programmed so that his greatest imperative  and his greatest reward  was in obeying the laws .  the first law of robotics was     a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .      this time  he selected the program called desert flash flood .  it was essentially a form of role playing game .  he began running it .  suddenly he found himself standing in the main thoroughfare of mojave center  antelope valley boulevard    with water a meter high pouring down the street .   mc governor was a very tall  brawny robot .  he ran through the water to a young woman who was stumbling and splashing helplessly  trying to hold a toddler in her arms .  as mc governor picked her up and strode through the current toward an escalator  he radioed the city monitors who controlled all the basic life functions .      shut down all electricity to nonessential services if they have failed to shut down automatically     he instructed the computer  as he carried the woman and her child .     run a status check on the emergency electrical systems providing essential services .      right now  his greatest worry was the electrocution of humans if broken power lines touched the flood water .  as a governor robot  he was a central control unit  capable of managing entire cities  from traffic to essential services and utilities  to environmental control and industry .  the city had its own decentralized computer systems  which reported directly to him and took his instructions by way of his internal radio and video systems .      thank you     the woman gasped  clutching her drenched toddler as mc governor set her down on the rising escalator .   almost immediately  the monitors reported that nonessential services were being discontinued .  the escalator stopped moving  but the woman stumbled on up the steps .  mc governor waded back into the water toward a trolley full of humans stranded on one side of the boulevard .  they were yelling and screaming in panic .  its robot driver was speaking calmly to his passengers  asking for patience .   the city monitors reported that the emergency power system was functioning safely .      send me all data related to the cause of the flood     he ordered .  at the same time  he moved behind the stranded vehicle .  it normally ran on a battery powered electric motor .  now the robot driver steered as mc governor pushed the vehicle to the stationary escalator  where the driver began helping the humans onto it .   as the monitors all over the city reported their data  mc governor computed the information .  a flash flood had taken place in the mojave desert above them  washing down from the san gabriel mountains to the south .  normally  it should not have been a problem .  the top surface of mojave center  a large rectangle on the desert floor  was comprised mostly of solar cells  which provided power .  it was fully sealed  of course  so that flood water would normally pass right over the underground city .  in this case  however  the force of the flood had ripped open the surface and water was still pouring down into the top levels of the city .   robots working on those levels were already struggling to seal off the leak .  others all over the city were coordinating evacuation efforts for the humans .  mc governor was about to request the details of those efforts when he was interrupted from outside the simulation program .      city computer calling mojave center governor with a priority   emergency .      mc governor shut off the simulation and inserted his finger into the wall jack again to shield his communication .     mc governor here .  report the emergency .         flooding is reported on the main level over antelope valley boulevard   .  at this time  the priority   emergency is estimated to be thirty seven minutes from reaching a priority   level without additional measures .         what is the cause of the flooding .         the circulation of water was routed incorrectly through the city .  too much water was directed to the problem area  and the increased pressure burst two main valves simultaneously .         why was the water routed incorrectly .         the orders came from you .         are all standard emergency procedures under way .         affirmative .  the most critical is that all drainage systems are open to the maximum .      mc governor quickly broke the connection and ran outside .  the scene was similar to that of the simulation  though not identical .  not as much water was running down the boulevard  it was only half a meter deep  but many more people were running for the escalators and sliding ramps  yelling to each other .  mc governor was horrified  somehow  he had allowed his involvement with the simulation to influence his multi tasking ability .  unwittingly  he had begun to create the flood in the simulation  putting humans at risk in violation of the first law of robotics .   he waded into the water  snatched up two children who had been knocked off their feet by the current  and carried them to the nearest rising slide ramp .      city computer     he radioed .     what is the status of the broken valves now .         a robot maintenance team has shut off the water flow manually at the preceding valves .  the broken valves are not yet under replacement .      around mc governor  people were still in danger .  the shallow water would not drown anyone in the areas where it had flowed into gentle backwaters  but the current was powerful enough to knock people down .  if they were injured  they might drown even in shallow water .  other robots were already wading through the water  carrying people to safety .   a short  balding man with frizzy gray hair had lost his footing .  though sitting in water that was not over his head  he was clinging to the bumper of a small utility vehicle  unable to pull himself up against the force of the current .  he pulled himself toward the bumper  tried to gain traction with his feet  and was knocked down again .  this time he lost his grip and was rolled roughly down the boulevard .   mc governor waded quickly to the man and lifted him up .  he was an engineer named max eisen  to whom mc governor had spoken briefly before .  as mc governor carried him  eisen coughed and wheezed  but was breathing .  in several long strides  mc governor returned to the ramp  where he set the man down in a sitting position .  then he looked around again .      over there     max wheezed  pointing .   a young woman with curly orange hair had jumped up onto the pedestal next to an abstract stone sculpture .  she was looking doubtfully at the water swirling around the base of the pedestal .  as mc governor hurried toward her  the pedestal tilted from the imbalance her weight caused .  water flowed under its raised edge  pushing it over .   the young woman gasped as she was thrown through the air .  the stone sculpture began to slide off its pedestal in the same direction .  before she hit the water  however  mc governor managed to catch her and swing her out of the way .  in the spot where she would have struck the water  the stone sculpture splashed and then cracked against the hard floor beneath it .      you are safe now     said mc governor  carrying her back to the ramp to join max .   the water was slowing down quickly now .  with the broken pipes turned off and the drainage open to the maximum  the emergency was passing .  up and down the boulevard  robots were helping humans to safety and seeing to their injuries if they had sustained any .      elaine     said max .     i would like to introduce you to mojave center governor  the robot who runs our city .         pleased to meet you .     elaine smiled gratefully  brushing her orange hair out of her face .     and thank you .         i may not deserve thanks     mc governor said grimly .     i should never have allowed this to happen .      internally  he radioed the water system monitors again .  they all reported good drainage .  then he called the city computer .     are you aware of any immediate first law imperatives that are not being addressed .         no .         compile total damage estimates  including human casualties  and relay them to me as soon as they are reasonably complete .  prioritize repairs according to safety factors .     he was very worried that his lapse had caused humans to be injured or worse .      acknowledged     said the city computer .   then mc governor reviewed the power monitors and turned the electricity back on in all the branches of the system that were undamaged .      elaine just moved here     said max .     i   m afraid this wasn   t a very good introduction  elaine  but mojave center really promises to be a good place to live .      mc governor towered over max as he looked down at him .     do you need medical care .  either of you .         i   m okay     said elaine  looking up at him with wide eyed wonder .     thanks to you and the first law of robotics .         i twisted my ankle     said max  shifting his weight .     i don   t think it   s too serious  but maybe it should be looked at .         of course .         we shouldn   t keep you     said elaine .     i   m sure you should be in contact with all your subordinates .         i am     said mc governor .     my multi tasking ability allows me to make contacts and decisions even as we speak .     he lifted max gently and began walking up the ramp .     max  i will take you to the nearest first aid station .         okay .      elaine walked with them .     can i ask you another question .  why are you so gigantic .      max laughed .      actually  i am a gestalt robot .  i am comprised of six robots  both in body and in mind .         what .     she cocked her head to one side  puzzled .     you mean you can divide into six smaller robots .         yes  that is right .     mc governor smiled .     the reason i am this big is that i can divide into six robots of rather small human stature  slender and short .         but what for .  why not just make one big one  like you are  if that   s what the city needs .         in the event of certain types of large scale emergencies  i can divide into my component robots so that each can move directly to a different site to manage damage control .         makes sense to me     said max .     right  elaine .         yes  i see .  but what about your brain  governor .  does it segment somehow .         no  not physically .     mc governor was amused at the thought .     their positronic brains are physically distinct from mine  of course  but right now all six are merging data with mine to create my own personality .  in order to divide  i will have to allow each latent personality to separate and take control over its data as well as its own body .         i   m impressed     said elaine .     and a little confused .  i never heard of anything like this   that is  a robot like you .         he represents the new cutting edge in municipal robotics     said max .     i read all about him .  and this very moment  even as he speaks to us  he   s also monitoring all the energy consumption  security matters  engineering functions  and anything else you can think of regarding the city .         you   re doing all that right now .     elaine studied mc governor   s face  as though for a clue of some sort to the effort he was expending .      that is the job .     mc governor shrugged amiably .     i was constructed for it  so to me  combining all these duties is not surprising .         tell me     said elaine  studying his face curiously .     what do you do for fun .         aw  i don   t think robots have a lot of fun     said max .     oh  do they .         as a robot  my greatest pleasure is in obeying the three laws of robotics .  that value is hardwired into my positronic brain  as it is with all positronic robots .     mc governor smiled  enjoying the mere thought of them .     the first law of robotics says   a robot may not injure a human being               yes     said elaine  nodding recognition .     we learned them in school .      mc governor heard her  but he really wanted to recite them all .  doing so gave him a feeling of security and satisfaction .     the second law is     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     then the third law of robotics is              a robot must protect his own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws         elaine finished  grinning impishly .      yes   exactly     said mc governor  suddenly embarrassed .     please pardon me for boring you with this matter .     he was about to ask elaine some polite questions about her interests when he received a radio alert from the city   s communication center .      governor  priority   communication is requested .         acknowledged     said mc governor .  priority   also required a shielded communication  so he would have to take it in his office  but it was not enough to override his duty to max .  he delivered max to the robots at a first aid station  bade both humans goodbye  and hurried toward his office .   as mc governor strode quickly down antelope valley boulevard toward one of the slidewalks  he judged the damage he could see .  the underground city had different levels  connected by various moving ramps  slidewalks  and lifts  generally  they appeared untouched .  of course  much of the water damage would not be immediately visible .   as he walked  all he could think about was that he had failed in his duty .     mc governor sat down in his desk chair and plugged his humaniform forefinger into a wall jack once more .  he gave his password and called for the priority   message .      message source  the governor robot oversight committee computer .      text  the governor robots of the following experimental cities have entered closed loops  emerald city  republic of ireland  kenyatta center  kenya  new monegaw springs  missouri  osaka center  japan  rio de oro center  brazil .       the exact times that each governor had entered the closed    loop were given next .  mc governor adjusted those times for the different time zones in which each city was located around the world .  he found that each governor robot had malfunctioned within the last three hours .   mc governor disconnected  his mind working quickly .  he was one of only six governor robots being tested on earth right now  and the other five had all failed today .  since the governors had all been constructed with the same basic design  he was forced to conclude that he would experience the same fate  probably very soon .   mc governor had a very levelheaded  rational  not very flashy personality .  he was totally dedicated to his job .  however  when he was thinking alone  without having to pace himself to human abilities or to slower electronic equipment  he could think extremely quickly .   now his own existence was threatened .  since neither a threat to humans nor direct human orders were present  the first and second laws of robotics did not apply .  under these conditions  the third law of robotics compelled him to evaluate his position at maximum efficiency in both speed and clarity .   obviously  some crucial design flaw was about to make him enter a closed loop .  it would put him into a state roughly parallel to a comatose condition in humans .  even worse  however  was the danger from the oversight committee of scientists .   in order to study him  they would have to dismantle him even if they could take control of him before he entered the closed loop .  they would need nothing more than to reach him with a direct order for him to shut himself down until further notice  under the second law  their instruction alone would be enough to control his behavior .  his first priority was to insulate himself from receiving any such instruction .  after that  he would have to find out how to avoid entering the endless loop .   he was able to infer some information that was not actually part of the message .  for instance  the message came from the oversight committee   s computer  not the committee itself .  their computer had probably judged for itself that the message should be sent to him .  so far the scientists had apparently not learned of this .   mc governor did not know how often the scientists actually reviewed the data regarding the governors .  since the experimental robots had already been functioning successfully for many months without a problem  the four roboticists were probably not bothering to check the data too frequently .  however  an emergency of this magnitude would probably prompt their computer to contact their offices directly .  when they learned that he had caused water mains to break by incorrectly routing the normal water supply  they would be even more concerned .   his deliberations and immediate plans were formed in less than a second .  a more detailed strategy would have to wait until he had more information .  first he plugged back into the secure link to the city computer .      priority        he instructed .  that meant that only he or the scientists on the committee could access this .  he had no way to prevent them from getting information from anywhere in the mojave center system  but he could stop accidental leaks of information .     delete all records of receipt  storage  and acknowledgment of last priority   message .  until further directives from me  indicate to all exterior and interior communications that city operations are functioning normally .  do not pass any direct instructions to me from any humans .  store them and use priority    communication to tell me that some .  have arrived  without revealing their content .      when the city computer had acknowledged receipt  he withdrew his finger .  that would delay any instructions from the oversight committee  but not for long .  they would merely have to call any human here in mojave center and ask him to pass the orders on to mc governor .  if he stayed in his office  however  he would not have to hear any human instructions in person  either .   mc governor plugged back into the city computer .     priority    .  have a detail of security robots report to the exterior of my office immediately and block all humans from entering .  the security detail is to report to me if any humans approach my office .  they are not to convey any direct messages of any kind to me from a human until and unless i personally give further instructions .      he hesitated  at least by robotic standards .  if a human ordered a security robot to convey a message  the second law would override his own orders .  he would have to block that possibility with a first law imperative .      i  mc governor  may be in personal danger from anticipated human contact .  if my functions are disrupted  harm may come to the human residents of mojave center .  a first law imperative is therefore involved .      that would not stop the oversight committee   s directives from reaching him forever  but it would be enough at least to force the committee to make some effort .  the robots on security detail would have to be persuaded that a greater or more immediate first law imperative overrode this one .  otherwise  they would have to be physically disabled or destroyed before they would disobey his instructions .   the danger of his entering an endless loop was more complex .  he had never noticed any tendency on his part to enter any sort of long term loop .  if the scientists on the oversight committee had learned of this problem  he would have heard from them before now .  that meant that the problem was likely to hit with no internal warning .   his own monitoring systems might not be reliable .  he judged that his best chance to learn something quickly about his own basic design was to contact his creator  wayne nystrom .  wayne was not part of the oversight committee  of course  since its mission was to study his work .  mc governor would have to call him and instruct the city computer to shield the call and delete all records of it .   mc governor did not want   in human terms   to die .          wayne nystrom stood inside his air conditioned mobile office  looking out the window .  in the distance  the turquoise waters of the atlantic ocean and the pale sand of the florida beach were bright in the sunlight .  immediately in front of him  however  robot drivers were piling the sand in huge mounds with giant earth movers  preparing a place for turquoise coast  the latest underground city of wayne   s own design .  like the others  it would be run by a governor robot that was still under construction .      biggest challenge yet     he muttered .  he was alone in his office  as he always preferred .  eccentric and secure in the knowledge of his own brilliance  he preferred his own company to anyone else   s and often carried out private conversations with himself  being the only human on any planet whom he really trusted .  at the age of forty one  he was finally achieving the success with his creations that he had always known he deserved .   his telephone beeped his personal code .  he moved toward it reluctantly  still watching the robot crew dig into the sand outside .     and they told me i couldn   t build an underground city here because you strike water so soon under the surface     he growled sourly .     wrong again  as usual .      he sighed and pushed the button on his telephone speaker .     yeah .         good day  dr .  nystrom .     the humaniform robot face of mojave center governor came on the video screen .      hello  governor .     wayne instantly relaxed when he realized that the caller was one of his own robotic creations .     i   m glad to hear from you .  how are you .         i have an emergency situation that i may not be able to handle     said mc governor somberly .      not likely     said wayne  though he welcomed the challenge of an intellectual puzzle .  besides  mc governor had always been somber and serious .     what   s the problem .         the third law prevents me from speaking of it by public telephone .  i need help .  will you come to see me so that we can talk in private .         of course     said wayne .     i stand by all of my creations .  you know that .  will tomorrow be soon enough .         i fear not     said mc governor .     every hour counts .  perhaps every minute .      wayne hesitated  surprised .  he was anxious to know more and was suddenly frightened by the sense of urgency that mc governor was conveying .     all right .  this project doesn   t need me right now .  i   ll arrange a flight right away .        mc governor disconnected  unsure whether dr .  nystrom could really help him .  while dr .  nystrom might be the only one who could enlighten him quickly on his basic design flaw  his creator might simply arrive too late .   dr .  nystrom would first have to pack and arrange a chartered sst flight from florida to mojave center   s small airport .  that would take some time  as would the flight itself .  if nothing unexpected occurred to slow him down  he needed a couple of hours to get here at absolute minimum .   mc governor decided to review his internal data .  he began by examining his design in three dimensional blueprint  but he saw nothing he had not seen before .  then he began running the standard simulation programs .   all the simulations presented options that involved the three laws of robotics .  as he reviewed them  he ran short segments of each  looking for irregularities .  these simulations were as close to a hobby as he possessed .   mc governor especially liked the simulations that presented him with first law imperatives .  in fact  they were the part of his programming that kept his morale high .  he opened his favorite one  earthquake simulation    near the climax .   in this one  a major earthquake has shaken the san andreas fault  roughly seventy kilometers west of mojave center .  because of the danger of earthquakes in the region  mojave center had been designed and constructed as a self contained  sealed unit .  its four sides and floor were sealed  the surfaces smooth and the edges rounded .  theoretically  it would float in the sand around it during an earthquake of virtually any magnitude  with its water tanks and batteries safely inside .   during a major quake  the box containing the city would be shaken  mostly laterally  snapping off the aqueducts that brought water down from the mountaintops in the area .  the solar panels on the top surface  however  would remain attached and functional .  when the quake stopped  the city should remain intact  though the floating might bring it to rest at a slightly tilted angle .   inside the city  of course  all the positronic robot labor would be warning humans to stay inside and helping them find secure locations .   however  earthquake simulation   postulated an additional problem .  after a simulated earthquake of nine on the richter scale  mojave center has survived intact but has come to rest at a severe angle .  the robots can adjust their perception of spatial relations more easily than humans  and the human residents are disoriented and near hysteria .   then a major aftershock hits .  now that the city is no longer in its original position  and has already sustained major stress to its outer shell  it is much more vulnerable  and parts of the city begin to break .  at this point  mc governor decided to turn on the simulation .   in mc governor   s positronic imagination  he strode through antelope valley boulevard against four feet of rushing water .  it flowed out of broken water pipes protruding from the walls and poured down all the streets .      city computer     mc governor ordered in quick  firm tones through the radio link .     shut down all electricity in mojave center now .  trigger all emergency chemical lights immediately .  priority i  first law emergency in effect .      instantly  the normal bright  indirect electric light went off  to be replaced by slightly dimmer orange and yellow light sources provided by chemical reactions .  they were in self contained  waterproof units that would not  if broken  endanger humans by sending an electrical charge into the water .  meanwhile  helpless humans screamed and clung to whatever railings or fixed furnishings they could  in danger of drowning or being dashed against the walls  debris  and malfunctioning ramps and escalators .   as mc governor passed  he picked them up in his strong arms as though they were children  holding them high above the dangerous water .     you will be taken to safety     he said calmly .     please do not struggle .      respecting his judgment and ability  the frightened humans obeyed him .   all around him  other robots were also rescuing humans from imminent death and severe injury wherever they could .  still more robots used tools or their own robotic body strength to close valves or crimp pipes shut in whatever way was possible .  driven by the first law  every robot present was risking his own existence to save the humans .   with a woman sitting on his shoulders and two grown men under each arm  mc governor forced his way to an upper level where an escalator was still functioning .  he could have just set them down and let them find their way to the surface  but his interpretation of the first law would not allow that .  instead  he climbed up the moving escalator  still carrying his charges .   on the top level  which was devoted entirely to engineering  mc governor set down his human burden in temporary safety .  then he reached up to manipulate the controls of an emergency exit .  it was a trapdoor that operated on springs instead of electricity so that it could still be used in moments such as this .  he threw it open with a clang and led the three humans out into the fresh  dry air of the mojave desert  where  blinking and squinting in the bright sunlight  they stumbled onto the shiny solar panels that lay on the top of the city .      remain here     said mc governor .     stay on the sand  away from the top surface of mojave center .  the open sand will be safe in the event that additional aftershocks take place .      they nodded and moved away from the solar panels that marked the top of the city .   mc governor saw that they were safe and leaped back down through the trapdoor .  shouting and also sending a priority   radio signal to all the robots  he announced that he had opened an escape route and described its location .  as the other robots began directing and carrying humans to safety on the surface  he ran back down to pick up as many more of the injured and panicked humans as he could find .   mc governor ran the simulation through to its conclusion  saving many lives by repeatedly carrying and leading humans to safety .  the simulation ended when all the human survivors had been rescued .  then  deeply satisfied with the feeling of accomplishment in following a long  complex series of first law imperatives  he turned it off .   as a routine matter  he checked the passage of time  and was astounded .  he usually ran through a simulation in no more than fifteen to thirty seconds  even accounting for the time he had spent checking segments of other simulations  he had expected to find a total time usage of no more than forty seconds .  instead  he had used two minutes and six seconds .  while the time itself was not significant  the extent of his miscalculation was alarming .      first clue i have found of something wrong     he said to himself .     this kind of malfunction is rare for a positronic brain .     he decided to call up the times he had spent on simulations during the past week .   what he found was even more worrisome .  each occasion had taken more time than the one before  and he had not previously noticed that .  also  the curve was rising sharply .  he had spent two minutes  six seconds this time  one minute  twenty one seconds the previous incident  fifty nine seconds before that .  these simulations had been run during the last twelve hours .  before these  the times were all in the normal range  from thirty to forty five seconds .      this may be it .  the problem i have been looking for .  if i can figure out exactly what it is .      mc governor usually checked the time of all his activities  as a matter of routine .  after running each of these simulations  he should have noticed the unusual times  but he had not .  of course  at that time  he had not been alerted to the possibility of a significant flaw in his design  so the increases had not seemed important .   now they did .   he began calculating an extrapolation of his recent behavior with the simulations .  this included the simulations he had chosen  their characteristics  and the length of time he had spent on each one .  it took very little time .   when mc governor had finished his calculations  he knew that he was in serious trouble .  the length of time he was spending running each simulation was rising so rapidly that at the existing rate  he would do nothing else in only a few more hours .  that was consistent with his meager information about the fate of the other governor robots .   the cause he had found was even more serious .  by sifting through all the simulations available  and examining those that he had been selecting more and more frequently  he had isolated a handful of them that all possessed the same flaw .  each of the bad simulations was improperly triggering his response to the three laws of robotics  enhancing his devotion to them out of proportion to the fact that these were merely simulated experiences .   because of this flaw in the simulation programs  all the governor robots eventually would find a scenario in which they would be obeying all three laws of robotics to the utmost .  they would experience a virtual robot   s utopia .  since a robot   s only pleasure came from obeying the three laws of robotics  this simulation would provide a kind of perpetual high  almost like that of drug addiction .   since the other governors had already entered closed loops  mc governor estimated that the simulation was just as addictive to robots as certain drugs were to humans .   the process was simple  involving three stages of addiction .  first  any governor running the flawed simulation programs would devote more and more of his time and energy to these simulations .  this was where mc governor stood now .   second  the governor robot would spend all his time in simulations  still running the city simultaneously with his multi tasking abilities .  in the final stage  his flow of orders and actions would slow drastically  impairing the execution of his normal duties .  as the program went into an endless loop and brought all other thoughts to a halt  he would ultimately shut himself down .       i have not reached that point yet     mc governor said inwardly .     but even now i can feel the craving to run another simulation .  i have predicted my own destruction .      the third law of robotics would not allow him to sit passively and wait for that destruction  however .   mc governor checked his monitors for a routine review of the city .  as usual  everything was running fine .  then he took another step toward shielding himself .   first he shut down all incoming communication except his emergency line .  that would prevent any chance of his thoughts accidentally mixing with a link to the city or another robot .  his efforts to escape the endless loop and subsequent dismantling by investigating roboticists would require leaving as slight a trail as possible .      i see one chance     mc governor decided .  the six component humaniform robots comprising him could not run the simulation individually .     so if i divide   if they split up   they are in no danger of the addiction .  i will not exist in this current form  but i will have obeyed the third law by preserving all my component parts and their data .      the problem did not end there  however .  the six component robots could not run the city of mojave center after they had separated .  they would still have all of mc governor   s data and communication devices  but that would not be enough for them to do his job .   the information from the various monitors that were physically located within their bodies normally flowed to the gestalt consciousness of the governor .  that consciousness would cease to exist when the governor divided  leaving the data nowhere to combine and the city computer and sensors nowhere to send their signals .      i will not be able to function in this job  either in my gestalt form or in a divided form .     mc governor knew that he still faced imminent destruction .   naturally  once the governor was no longer running the city  the oversight committee monitoring the experiment would want to know why .  to find out  they would dismantle all the component robots  effectively killing the governor .  so the third law still required that he take more steps to save them .      they must flee     mc governor decided .     each one separately  wherever he chooses to go .  like the other governors  i will have failed my field test  but the oversight committee can arrange for older models of robots to run the city .      an alert reached him through his emergency line .  according to his recent instructions  it conveyed no other information .  worried  he plugged his finger back into the cable jack and gave his password .      messages have arrived for you  governor     reported the city computer .      give me the sources     said mc governor .     no actual messages .         two from the oversight committee computer  one from dr .  redfield of that committee .         priorities .         the first two are priority   .  the last is priority    .      mc governor disconnected .  he had very little time left .            mc governor made an internal shift in his programming .  he activated the six positronic brains of the component robots .  they were sharing his data already  but they would need to join in the deliberations he was making .  since they all had different specialties  they also had distinct personalities .  the seven way discussion was conducted through internal signals .      where would you flee under this third law imperative .     mc governor asked them .      we must be careful not to go anywhere that would endanger humans     mc   warned .      obviously     said mc   .     we all know the laws as well as you .         my specialty is the environmental impact of mojave center on the surrounding desert     said mc   .     i can tell all of you that finding a place on earth where we will not disturb anyone will be difficult .         you know i am the troubleshooter for this city     said mc   .     i find that there is always a solution of some kind to a problem .         stay focused on the subject  please     mc governor said sternly .     we do not have much time .  now  clearly the first law prevents us from disrupting others .  the other pertinent question is  where can we hide effectively .  we   that is  the six of you   will be fugitives .  your chances of getting on board spacecraft to leave the planet are poor .  so are your chances of evading capture if you stay on this planet .  mc    you specialize in city security .  what is your appraisal .         to robots     security    requires that we avoid receiving instructions from any human .  otherwise  under the second law  virtually any human can capture us .  just by ordering us to cooperate with him .  however  i believe we can avoid hearing any instructions .         how .     mc governor asked .  he was feeling a stronger desire than ever before to run one of those simulation programs again .  the addiction was increasing its power over him .      mojave center has a new generation of miniaturization unit in its bohung medical research institute .  these are most often used to reduce robots and equipment to microscopic size so that they can work on humans by traveling through the bloodstream .         this is nothing new     said mc governor .     the principle is quite old  in fact .         our new unit can do far more than earlier types     said mc   .     as before  a shower of subatomic particles alters the molecular structure of the subject  yet allows the subject to retain its shape and functions .  the equipment itself will not shrink .  only we will .  the difference           this is a start     said mc   .     but if we are still within the hearing of human instructions  we can be apprehended under the second law  even if we are too small to be seen .         allow mc   to finish     ordered mc governor .      the difference     mc   continued angrily     is that this unit is theoretically capable of using the same system to create time travel .      for the first time  mc governor felt an energy surge of excitement .     really .  how can this work .         some simple modifications in the miniaturization equipment will alter the character of the device .  as a time travel gate  it also showers the traveler with subatomic particles .  chaos theory in physics has established that a certain percentage of the particles will move out of time  as in experiments involving the heisenberg uncertainty principle  in sufficient combination  they will create a funnel into the past .  when that funnel is large enough  it will take anything within its cone back to a certain point in time .  if we are microscopic at the time  we can be taken .         how much control do we have over where we go .     mc    the city specialist in social stability  was programmed to be cautious .      we should have precise control  based on the precision of the machine and its equipment     said mc   .     remembering  of course  that this has never actually been attempted .         so a third law danger exists     said mc   .     but that is overridden by the imperatives of the first and second laws  which might be well served .         if you go back to any point in time before the positronic brain was invented     said mc governor     none of the humans around you will have heard of the three laws of robotics .  so they would never try to control you with orders under the second law .         if they saw us  they might tell us what to do mistaking us for humans     said mc   .     we would still have to obey them  even if they did not know we are robots .         the danger would be changing the past     said mc governor .     anything you did back in time  especially in relation to significant historical events  could violate the first law by altering the course of history .         we cannot take that risk     said mc   .     in the very act of interacting with other humans  we would come across first law imperatives in our immediate surroundings .  we would have to act  and in doing so  we would be changing history .         exactly     said mc governor .      we can avoid that problem     mc   added .     the combination of miniaturization and time travel should eliminate it .         that should work     said mc   .     i understand .  first we miniaturize to microscopic level .  then we go back into the past .  once there  we will be too small to perceive first law imperatives and no humans will give us any instructions because they will not know we exist .         it sounds acceptable to me     said mc governor .     does anyone see a flaw in this logic .      none of the robots answered immediately .  mc governor waited patiently .  then  one by one  each of them agreed that this appeared to be an acceptable course of action .      does anyone have another plan that will satisfy the laws of robotics to an equal degree and entail less risk .     mc governor asked .   another robotic pause followed .  again  each of the six gradually concluded that this was the best plan that the group could devise .  mc governor concurred .      then we must get to the miniaturization device     said mc governor .     mc    how difficult are the modifications that must be made .         they are complex  but the description is available in the city library .         what tools are required .         a set of precision tools is stored in the same room for use by the robot technician assigned to the machine     said mc   .     that robot   s identification can be found in our standard list .  he is  of course  capable of making the necessary changes .  he is working there full time .         get me his name     said mc governor .  now that he had partially disengaged his gestalt personalities  he could not directly control or access all his normal functions and data .      he is r .  ishihara     said mc   .      thank you .  our immediate challenge now is to reach the machine without receiving any messages under the second law .  i will make these arrangements .  during this time  i will leave all of you functional .  if you think or learn of anything significant  speak up .  otherwise  i request silence so that i may turn all of my attention to the task at hand .      the six component robots acknowledged his instructions and turned quiet .   mc governor would have to break radio silence in order to reach the bohung institute .  also  to get there without risking receiving human instructions  especially that message from dr .  redfield  he would require help .  he contacted the security detail that he had ordered to guard his office door .      detail chief  identify .         r .  horatio  security chief    .  detail size  six humaniform robots .         horatio  as we speak  order a closed vehicle to come here .  it must be large enough to carry me and your entire detail in private .  it must also be an ordinary vehicle without markings that will attract attention .         so ordered  sir .         when i sign off  i will shut down all of my sensors and communication links except the tactile sensitivity in my right hand .  at sign off  when the vehicle has arrived  you are to lead your detail into my office and carry me unseen into the vehicle .  if others  human or robot  approach  you are to detain them and bring them with us without explanation  barring only  of course  the imperatives of the laws of robotics .  then you will transport me to the bohung institute in secrecy .         yes  sir .  where in the institute  sir .      mc governor quickly switched to a shielded internal link     mc    what is the name of the room where the miniaturization equipment is housed in the institute .         technical laboratory f          mc governor radioed the room number to horatio .     when we have arrived  you will pat my right hand three times in quick succession  this will signal me to reactivate         understood  sir .         this entire project is to be carried out in absolute secrecy .  my identity and destination are private under a third law imperative to me .         we will respect it  sir .  however  regarding your privacy  i assume you are aware that the institute   s employees are currently working there  as normal .         yes  chief .  please hold .     mc governor shifted internally again .  using his authority as governor  he contacted the institute chief of security .      r .  langtimm  institute chief of security  governor .         please conduct a complete evacuation of the institute     mc governor ordered .     with the single exception of r .  ishihara  assigned to room f     .  he will remain to accept instructions from me in person .  also see that no onlookers are left in the immediate area outside .  you will not identify me as the source of the evacuation order .  do you have any existing imperatives under the laws of robotics that would prevent this procedure at this time .         no  sir .         good .  all entrances except the main doors are to be sealed .  i am sending a security detail there soon for a private purpose .  after evacuation  you will maintain a security detail outside the main door until a vehicle arrives from my office .  at that time  you will verify the identification of security detail chief r .  horatio and transfer the responsibility for the institute to him .  then you and your detail will go off duty indefinitely .  none of you will volunteer any information pertaining to this project  ever .  acknowledge .         acknowledged .  time of commencement .         now     said mc governor  disconnecting .  he knew that if a human ordered the robots to reveal their information  they would have to answer under the second law .  leaving no trail was impossible  the best he could do was minimize it .   he turned back to his link with r .  horatio .     inside the institute  you will convey me to room f     where you will identify r .  ishihara  a technician who works there .  you will signal me at that time .  begin .      mc governor shut down all external links and sensors  except for the feeling in his right hand .   in this condition  in total silence and total darkness  he had little awareness that his orders were being carried out .  he felt another hand gently move his  probably to make carrying him easier  and then the sense that his hand was now resting on his abdomen  probably as he was placed inside the vehicle .  during the trip  he had absolute trust in the reliability of the robots under his authority as governor .  the only possible problem would be unforeseen imperatives under the three laws .   during the trip  he reviewed all his information .  he found no basic flaws in the logic of this procedure .  every thought returned to his fundamental motive  the third law required him to save himself if he could do so without violating the first and second .   in the absence of more sensory and other input data  time seemed to pass slowly .  when he felt his hand shifting slightly again  indicating that he was being taken out of the vehicle  he checked his internal clock .  he had judged that prompt transport from his office to the bohung institute would require approximately twelve minutes  depending on the density of traffic .  slightly over fourteen minutes had passed  easily within the normal range of error .   when three gentle but firm pats struck his hand quickly  he resumed normal functions .   mc governor found himself lying on a couch that normally only humans would need .  he stood up  looking around .  room f      intended specifically  for miniaturizing  was divided into two sections .  he  horatio and his security detail  and one other robot were in an area where researchers would ordinarily work .  it was lined with desks and computer terminals .  a transparent wall divided it from the other side  which housed one machine .      have any unforeseen problems arisen .     mc governor asked horatio .      no  governor .         did anyone see me during transport .         no  sir .         excellent .  you are r .  ishihara .     mc governor asked the stranger .      yes .         horatio  leave us .  you and your detail will remain outside the main doors and will not allow anyone to enter .  you will stay there until i send r .  ishihara to you with my further instructions .  if any situation under the three laws requires you or your detail to alter your behavior  you will inform ishihara at once  before you leave .  my own radio link will be shut down again .  otherwise  you will make no attempt to contact me .  as you leave the building  your detail will also turn off your aural sensitivity until you are too far away to hear our voices .  you are not to hear anything related to my presence in this building .         yes  governor .     horatio led his detail out of the room and down the hall .      ishihara     said mc governor  turning to him .     you and i will speak strictly out loud at low volume .  we will not use any radio links so as to avoid interception by any other robots  even accidentally .         yes  sir .         identify the function of this room for me .         well  governor .     ishihara pointed to the solid metal sphere beyond the transparent wall .  it was roughly fifteen meters in diameter .     this is the unit that miniaturizes robots and equipment to microscopic size for surgery .         and i understand that it can be modified to send items into the past .         theoretically  yes .         ishihara  i am now operating under a third law requirement .  as governor  i am instructing you to help me .  when you have finished  you will leave the building and tell horatio and his detail to resume their normal duties .  at that time  you will do the same .  none of you will volunteer any information about my activities here .         understood  governor .         according to the theory of time travel which governs this device  can someone pick the precise destination of such travel in both time and location .         yes  governor .  the same controls that specify the degree of miniaturization would in this case alter the destination in time and place .  that would be part of the modifications that are required .         you are capable of making these modifications .         yes  sir .         begin them .  i must modify myself .             wayne nystrom rode the escalator tube that carried him from the exit door of his chartered jet directly down into mojave center .  this escalator took him to a lift in one of the upper levels  which he used to reach the central floor .  dressed casually and carrying a large  light shoulder bag with personal items and one change of clothes  he stepped out of the lift and quickly walked to the nearest slidewalk on the main boulevard of the city .      everything looks normal     he muttered to himself .  the streets were still clean and smooth  indicating that the usual functions of maintenance robots were continuing .  that was important since any danger to humans would  of course  force any robots who noticed to leave their regular jobs and help them .  around him  humans and robots conducted their business with a mixture of determination and everyday routine that also seemed ordinary .      excuse me .  i need assistance     he called to a robot driving by on a small cargo cart .      how can i help you .     the robot came to a sudden stop .      please contact mojave center governor for me .  my name is dr .  wayne nystrom and he is expecting to see me .  i need to know where to find him .         of course  dr .  nystrom .     the robot frowned .     i have signaled by radio .  his response is usually immediate .  now i am sending a message through the city computer .      wayne nodded  waiting with mounting curiosity .      the city computer has agreed to accept a message and page him     said the robot .     i will convey a message for you if you like .         tell him that i have arrived in mojave center and will meet him anywhere that he designates     said wayne .      done     said the robot .      can you give me a ride to mc governor   s office .         of course .  join me up here on the bench and strap in  please .      wayne did so  riding in silence .  he looked around as the cart moved  still observing that the city was to all appearances functioning normally .  for mc governor to be momentarily out of contact would not have been alarming except for the call he had made to wayne .  when they reached mc governor   s office  wayne hopped down and sent the robot on his way .   wayne was surprised to find the door to mc governor   s office closed .  he pushed the doorbell  then knocked .  finally he tried the doorknob  expecting it to be locked .  instead  it turned .  cautiously  he opened the door .      normal here  too .     he glanced around  but the office of a governor robot never had much in it .  a couple of chairs stood across the desk for humans who might come here for an appointment .  a beverage server was embedded in the wall for guests .  otherwise  only the desk and the desk chair were in the room .  he closed the door behind him  moved around the desk  and sat down in the desk chair .   wayne opened the desk drawers and found them empty .  the desk was just for show .  mc governor didn   t need a computer terminal  either  since he had one inside his robot body .  wayne saw the wall jack that mc governor would use for shielded communication  but a human had no use for it .  no other communication devices were in the office for the simple reason that mc governor bore all of them within his body .      nothing for me here     wayne got up and left the office  closing the door behind him .  on the boulevard  he hailed another robot  who was using a hand held inspection tool on a wall .     call a security robot to this location  please .         of course     said the robot .     are you under the threat of harm  sir .         not immediately     said wayne .     at this time  i just need to confer with a security chief     he identified himself .      very well .     the robot returned to his duties .   in less than a minute  a single robot arrived in a small  fast moving security vehicle .     dr .  nystrom .  i am r .  horatio  the security chief assigned to this section of mojave center     he jumped lightly out of the cart .      pleased to meet you .  are you familiar with my name .         yes  sir  i have just verified your identity with the city computer through visual record and your voiceprint .  i am honored to meet you .  how can i assist you .         can you locate mc governor for me .         you mean by standard communication link .         yes .  i asked a robot to do this a little while ago and the governor could not be reached .         i am still in contact with the city computer .  i see that your message is on file .  mc governor has not accessed it .         please try again .         yes  sir .  attempting now .         hm .  no response .         not yet  sir .         i would like a computer terminal with access to the city computer .      horatio hesitated .     you do not have the authority for that  sir .         not by statute     wayne agreed .     who is your superior in security .         i report directly to mc governor .         ah .  then the choice falls to you .  here   s my problem .  i think that mc governor has an unusual difficulty of some sort .  if he   s not able to perform his duties in running the city  then first law imperatives may be developing for every human in mojave center .  i request a chance to avoid that possibility .  as the designer of mojave center and the governor robots  i have the best chance of helping him here .      horatio observed him in silence  only for a split second  but long enough for wayne to notice .  then the robot nodded .     dr .  nystrom  i am persuaded to give you access to the terminal in my security cart .  however  i must request that you share your conclusions with me .      wayne knew that horatio   s programming as security chief required him to be very careful  so arguing would be a waste of time .     agreed .         i am entering your voiceprint now     said horatio .     you are screened for use .     he turned aside and patted the front seat of the security cart .  wayne climbed into the passenger side .  a computer terminal was in the console in front of him .      display current function of mc governor     wayne said to the terminal .      none found     said the computer terminal .     insane     muttered wayne .     display standard monitors of electricity generation and storage  water use  and the air mixture in the ventilation system .      the monitors appeared in front of him .  all the levels were well within the normal range .  in fact  they were maddeningly average .      show curves of use in the last six hours .     water use was high early in the curve  but only for a short while .      show me the most recent functions of mojave center governor identified on file .      the screen read      communication with r .  horatio  security chief  antelope valley boulevard .      communication with r .  langtimm  security chief  bohung institute .      wayne suddenly realized that horatio was keeping some information to himself .  he blanked the screen and turned to horatio .  before he could speak  horatio beat him to it .      an urgent call for mojave center governor has come in to the city computer     said horatio .     the governor robot oversight committee is in a conference call .         calling you .         when mc governor was not available  they requested the security chief  bringing the call to me .  when they requested help regarding mc governor  i told them you were here and they wish to speak with you .         i wish you hadn   t told them     wayne said sourly .     none of your business that i   m here .  none of theirs  either .      horatio ignored his tone .     your portable terminal is not equipped for holographic images  but i can transfer the call to it for you .  shall i .         sure     muttered wayne  feeling his heart begin to pound .     let   s see what they want .      the screen quartered into portrait shots of the four scientists on the committee .  they were seeing his face at the same time .  after greetings had been exchanged  they got right to the point .      what are you doing there  dr .  nystrom .     dr .  redfield asked .  she was a tall  slender blond .     have you seen mc governor in the last hour .         no     wayne growled angrily .     i came to see how my creation was doing .  is that a crime .         easy  doctor     said professor post .  he frowned  his dark curly hair and black pointed beard making him look threatening .     we   re all on the same side .         no  we aren   t     wayne said firmly .     i   m here to see to my work .  you want to pass judgment on it and you   re doing it prematurely .  leave this to me .         you know we can   t do that     said dr .  chin  a short  pretty chinese american .     we are charged with evaluating this system .  maybe you should know  dr .  nystrom  that the other five governors have failed in their duties in the last day or so .      wayne stared at her  astonished .     what .         they have entered closed loops .     dr .  khanna enunciated precisely in his hindi accent  which marked him as a native of northern india .     their functions have been transferred to standard municipal robots .         obviously     said dr .  redfield     the same problem is likely for mojave center governor .  we were hoping to reach him before the same fate took him .  it looks like we   re too late .  however  we must find him .         in the meantime  we will have to assign new robots to take over the responsibilities of running mojave center     said professor post .   wayne stared at their faces  momentarily speechless .  finally  he shook his head .     no .  no .  this can   t be right .  why didn   t you tell me sooner .         we put in calls to your florida office today     said dr .  redfield .     you must have already left .         no .     wayne leaned forward toward the screen .     no .  i should have been told about this when the first governor shut down .  so i could get right on this .         our first duty was to assign new robots to the cities to keep them running safely     professor post said calmly .      we contacted you as a courtesy     said dr .  chin .     this committee does not report to you .         are you trying to sabotage my project .     wayne pointed at her face accusingly .     you don   t want to let me in on this .         we are to judge the functioning of the governor robots themselves     said dr .  khanna .     you signed an agreement to that effect when this project began .  now  then  as to the current situation        wayne pounded on the disconnect key with his fist .  the terminal screen returned to a standard display .  angrily  wayne jumped out of the cart  landing in front of horatio   s impassive face .      where is he .     wayne demanded .      i do not know .         under the second law  i order you to answer all my questions honestly .  where is mc governor .         i do not know where mojave center governor robot is     said horatio carefully .   wayne glared at him  slowly composing himself .  he knew that horatio could not lie about this unless a first law imperative required it .      tell me if a first law imperative is influencing your judgment and responses under the second law .         no  dr .  nystrom .  none is .      wayne thought about that .  if the first law imperative were strong enough  he could still be lying .     you communicated with mc governor shortly before his disappearance .  was he involved with a first law imperative .         to some degree .      wayne   s temper subsided .  dealing with erratic  untrustworthy humans often frustrated him  but robots were direct  honest  and reliable within the framework of the three laws .     so he felt an indirect concern over the first law   maybe one that is not immediate .         yes  sir .         was he involved with a third law imperative .         yes  dr .  nystrom .         aha .     wayne nodded grimly .     so he vanished to save himself .  is that correct .         that is correct .         but you don   t know where he is now .         no .      wayne smiled wryly .     doc nystrom don   t program no idiot robots .         sir .         just a private joke .  so mc governor was careful not to leave you with information that would leave a clear trail .         that is correct .         horatio  i have to convince you that i want to help mc governor .  right now  it looks like he   s the only governor who   s still functioning .  do you understand what will happen to all the other governor robots .         they will have to be examined for their flaws .         yes .  exactly .  but those scientists on the committee just want to find a reason to destroy all the governors  and my career as well .  i   m not under the threat of physical harm  horatio  but my life   s work is in danger  and that means all the years of my life could be thrown away   made into nothing .  do you understand how that can harm me .         i understand that your career is deeply important to you  dr .  nystrom .  however  the governor robots must have their flaws corrected .  otherwise  they could accidentally harm all the humans under their influence someday  perhaps through neglect of their duties .         of course  of course .  but here   s the difference  horatio .  the committee wants to chop up the governors  pull out their insides  and leave them in pieces .         i should think the roboticists would then fix them properly and return them to service .         you don   t know them  horatio .     wayne kept his frustration and worry in check .  to persuade a robot to change his mind would require calm  clear thinking .     committees don   t exist to fix things .  their purpose is to write reports .  they will each write reports about the governors .  then they will conclude that the governors can   t be trusted to take care of humans and the governor robots will be junked  along with my professional reputation .  you follow me so far .         yes  i do .  but why would they not recommend improving the governor robots and then using them as planned .         aw  horatio .  i love robots .  you   re so rational .  the reason is that they   re jealous of my accomplishments and the financial success i   ve attained .  they aren   t rational the way you are  horatio .  perhaps you   ve noticed that about us humans in your own work .         well  yes  i have .         horatio  i want to save the governors .  if i can reach mc governor first  then i can do the work .  i can find the flaw  correct it  and demonstrate to the committee that he has been fixed .         if they hate you so much  could they not still stop you .         at that point  they wouldn   t dare stop me from putting the other governors safely back on line .  but if i can   t find and fix mc governor first  the committee will kill my creations .  i want to save them .         i see the difference  sir .         then help me protect mc governor .  tell me what you know  and take me to his last known location .         all right  dr .  nystrom .  let us go .               r .  hunter was a new robot  finished and programmed according to the specifications of the governor robot oversight committee  which had also arranged for his services .  he was to locate the missing governor robot .  the committee sent him all of their existing data on the problem while he was on a chartered flight to mojave center .  when the data had been transferred  the committee members contacted him on a conference call .   hunter had been programmed with substantial information on dealing with humans .  like other robots  he understood that they often preferred direct contact .  the purpose for this was more to get a feeling for someone   s personality than to accomplish a specific goal .  humoring them  he accepted their conference call  examining the first human faces he had seen on his internal video screen with some curiosity of his own .   after introductions  dr .  chin asked     would you mind describing your current appearance .  according to our request  you are a humaniform robot six feet tall  capable of altering your appearance at will  and i would like to know what appearance you will use as you proceed .  we can see your face on the screen  of course  but i would like a quick summary of your overall look .         i am still using the appearance given to me as i was being completed .  six feet tall  blond hair  blue eyes  northern european bone structure and skin tone  and the body of a champion athlete .  the myriad microscopic solar cells on my skin that provide my energy do not interfere with my humanoid appearance .  i suppose i will continue to use this look until i have some reason to alter it .         that is reasonable     dr .  khanna said .     how will you make judgments of that sort .  that is  how would you appraise your own personality .         my personality was programmed both to solve the mystery of mc governor   s flight and to follow him as necessary to apprehend him .  so  even more than most robots  i am goal oriented and single minded except  of course  where the laws of robotics influence my .  priorities .  i can socialize with humans as required and  as much as possible  i will try to imitate the robotic thinking of mc governor .         i   m sure your programming is right for the job     said dr .  redfield .     please pardon our questions .  a great deal of expense has been put into the governors and the cities they were intended to run  so we   re just looking for a little reassurance .         mc governor must have left a trail of some sort     said hunter .     i am sure i can pick it up with no problem .         what will your first move be .     professor post asked .      the most powerful tool i have at this stage is the authority you granted me with the city computer to access information directly .  once i have located mc governor   s last known location  i will start an eyes on search of the spot and track him the best i can .         i   m sure that will be fine     said dr .  chin .   when the committee had disconnected  hunter reviewed his information .  it was not much  but he expected that the governor was still inside the city somewhere .  he was relieved to have found the humans on the committee to be reasonable and cooperative .  his background data on humans had led him to expect otherwise .   hunter contacted the city computer while he was still in the air .  the committee had entered his authority into the city computer themselves .  that gave him the ability to bypass any standard procedures or special orders that would normally have prevented a visiting robot from directly accessing priority information .   by the time hunter arrived at mojave center  he knew that mc governor had arranged to be taken in secret to the bohung institute .  security records had told him that much .  he also learned that all the human and robotic personnel except r .  ishihara had signed off for the day just before mc governor had arrived at the institute .   with that knowledge  hunter accessed the city computer   s map and walked straight to the institute .  as he walked  he instructed the city computer to order r .  ishihara to report to his usual station .  ishihara met him in room f      where hunter identified himself .   hunter studied the equipment in the room visually .  at the same time  he accessed and recorded the city computer   s explanation of its standard use .  then he turned to ishihara .  they communicated with their radio comlinks  allowing them to think and converse at robotic speed  unhampered by the slowness of speech designed for human understanding .      i think you met mc governor here and assisted him in some way .  were the laws of robotics involved .      ishihara hesitated .      the governor probably requested that you not volunteer any information .  i understand your desire to cooperate with him .  however  i must tell you that his disappearance involves an indirect first law imperative regarding any humans that he contacts .  perhaps he told you that he was in danger under the third law .  tell me if that is true .         yes .         i must know where he went  ishihara .  the first law requires that you help me find him .         an indirect first law imperative leaves me room for interpretation     said ishihara .     convince me that the danger to humans is clear .  by now  you know that mc governor   s functions with the city have been transferred to other robots .  how can he endanger anyone now .         tell me where he went     said hunter .      i agreed not to volunteer any information .         then help me in a limited way .  explain to me what he wanted from you .  surely you accept that the possibility of a first law problem requires some investigation .         i do .     ishihara nodded toward the equipment beyond the transparent wall .     he wanted me to make modifications in this and show him how to use it .         what were these modifications .         they make this system theoretically capable of sending microscopic targets backward in time .      hunter was surprised .  nothing in his data suggested a possibility of this kind .     you said theoretically .  it has not been tested .         not when mc governor first asked me .         he used it  then .      ishihara said nothing .      yes  yes  you agreed not to volunteer anything .  what were the circumstances when you last saw him .         mc governor ordered me to leave the premises while he remained here .         are you saying that  to your knowledge  he did not leave this room in a normal manner .         i am .         then show me the controls and calibrations on this equipment and explain what they mean .  begin with a summary of how this works .         come with me .     the transparent wall slid soundlessly up into the ceiling  ishihara was obviously controlling it through his comlink .  he led hunter into the other chamber .  on the sphere   s console  the power was still on .      do you routinely leave this equipment turned on .         no .         how does it work .         the miniaturization is accomplished by striking the target with an intense spray of subatomic particles .  the result is a gradual and proportional shrinkage of the target .         in what way did you modify this .         by altering the content and concentration of the spray  and utilizing the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics  the equipment can send the target back in time .         according to standard chaos theory  that   s impossible .  chaotic systems are clearly irreversible .         this system also utilizes the uncertainty principle of chaotic dynamical systems .  that is  calculations under chaos theory by definition involve chance .  these modifications cross the random nature of chaotic calculations with those of the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics  bringing the two systems together .         show me your modifications .      as ishihara did so  hunter studied both the miniaturization system and the new theoretical time travel capability .  by the time the explanation had ended  hunter understood both .  he took several moments to attempt a theoretical calculation .   the result showed hunter an apparent contradiction in their effects .  to be sure  he ran several more .  all exhibited the same problem .      ishihara  according to the two theories you gave me  i think the time travel program is going to interfere with the miniaturization .         how so .         according to my results  the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics remains inherently incompatible with events as interpreted by chaos theory .  i see that the effects can be compounded by this technology  but the results are going to neutralize each other .  if the miniaturization is done first with a spray designed under one set of calculations  then the second spray will neutralize some of the effects of the first one .  specifically  the time travel will make the miniaturization temporary .     hunter went on to give him an example of his calculations .      i see your point .         so as a result of all this  mc governor will have begun a slow countdown to enlargement back to normal size as the flaw in the program causes the atoms to begin drawing energy from his environment and returning his atomic structure to normal .         i agree     said ishihara .     that is an important observation .  i will add it to the permanent data on this subject .         now i have to know where mc governor went  ishihara .  you must tell me .         what difference does this make .         i think mc governor went back into time to hide from the committee that employed me to find him .  i surmise that the first law required him to miniaturize himself first to avoid actions that might change history and harm humans .  is this consistent with your observations of him .         yes  it is .         however  since the miniaturization is temporary  he will resume normal size at a certain point  almost certainly without prior warning .  from then on  he is definitely in danger of harming humans by altering history .  i must find him and return him to our own time .  this should be a clear enough first law imperative for you to help me .         i agree .  what do you want me to do .         if i go into the past after him  i must bring him back .  is this possible .         i will have to study this matter .         all right .  you consider how to do that and i will make some more calculations .      hunter studied the data he had gathered about the two processes this system contained .  mc governor   s miniaturization would collapse in geometric stages of two  so once  the process began  it would accelerate rapidly .  his examination of the time travel gate showed him where the most recent use of the gate had sent its subject in time .      the cretaceous period of the mesozoic era  about sixty million years ago  in what is now western north america     hunter said thoughtfully .     when dinosaurs roamed the earth .  so that is where mc governor went .         it makes sense     said ishihara .     no humans existed in that time to harm .  nor were there any to give him orders under the second law .         a perfect hiding place     said hunter .     as long as he remains microscopic .         hunter  i have reviewed my data on your question .  i believe a device can be made that would trigger the time travel function even from the past .  it will draw the funnel created by the particle shower down on it and  therefore  on the individual within the radius of the funnel .  the shower  of course  will return you to our time .         how long will it take you to make this device .         i am not sure .  with the first law priority  i can devote all my time to it .  however  this is a new invention .  it could take only a day or so  but unforeseen problems may extend the time .  and you realize that you will be the experimental subject .  if it fails  you will only learn of the failure when you are trapped in the past .         i understand .  the first law supersedes the third in this matter  i will have to take the risk .     hunter thought a moment .     i believe that a team of humans to accompany me would be wise .  if the trip is very risky  however  the first law will not let me take them .         once i have made this device  i can estimate how risky it is     said ishihara .     if you are agreeable  i will begin gathering further data and materials at once .         yes  of course .  if you have a problem gathering equipment  contact me directly .  i have been given unusual authority with the city computer  and i can requisition materials with emergency priority .  i am going to visit mc governor   s office .        hunter checked his internal map of mojave center again to find mc governor   s office .  once he had started on his way  he used his radio link with the city computer to access a nationwide list of professionals in various fields .  planetwide and interplanetary lists were also available  but time was important  so the closer he could find willing experts  the sooner they were likely to arrive .   first hunter had the computer combine the lists  then identify candidates by their fields  availability  and conditions of employment .  his first choice was a roboticist at the university of michigan .  she was a young woman named jane maynard  who was looking for field research regarding robots .  the second was chad mora  a young paleontologist whose recent degree had not yet led to any work .  hunter had made these selections by the time he arrived at the office .   when he reached mc governor   s office  he found the door locked  but ordered the city computer to open it .  inside  he immediately realized that the office had never been intended for regular use .  the walls were bare and the only furniture was a chair and a desk with nothing on it .  still  a quick look at the city computer   s architectural image of the office identified all the functional areas .  by this time  hunter was eager to hire his team as soon as possible .      computer     hunter ordered .     reach any member of the governor robot oversight committee .  give that member this request for employment in my project .     he sat down in the chair to wait  aware that humans were sometimes out of touch  unlike those robots who carried their communication devices as part of their design .      hunter .  r .  ishihara here .     he was radioing directly .      yes  ishihara .         i have a list of highly sophisticated technical parts that i need to build the device that will bring you back from the past .  the city computer reports that all the parts are present in the city  but a number of them are already in use .         are they in crucial areas involving the first law .         i believe that all of them can be successfully substituted or temporarily discontinued without creating a first law problem     said ishihara .     however  i am not certain .         give me the list .      ishihara did so .      i will contact the city computer .  if there is a further problem  i will have it locate and purchase the parts elsewhere .     hunter broke that connection and contacted the city computer again .      please give top priority transfer to r .  ishihara of the following list of parts .  if necessary  remove them from current operating locations .     hunter transferred the list .     verify that none of these is in irreplaceable positions under the first law .         verified     said the computer .     all parts can be provided .  many are in inventory .  of the remainder  substitution and removal from current operating locations can begin immediately .         begin transfer of the parts to r .  ishihara as soon as possible .             while hunter waited  he studied the late cretaceous period in what was now alberta  canada  the place where mc governor had gone .  he also reviewed his data on mc governor   s disappearance .  during this review he noticed that dr .  nystrom  the inventor of the governor robots  had spoken to the committee from mojave center shortly after mc governor   s disappearance  apparently he had lost his temper and discontinued the call abruptly .  the committee had already judged that dr .  nystrom knew nothing of value about the mystery .  still  hunter ordered the city computer to page dr .  nystrom .   then  having nothing else to do  he shut down most of his system to save energy .  he left open only his communication links .  just under three hours later  the city computer contacted him again .      r .  hunter  you have a call from dr .  redfield .         accepted .     hunter instantly returned to normal operating level .     hello  dr .  redfield .         hi .  good news  hunter .     she smiled brightly .     our funding was good enough to hire the two people you wanted .  they   re on their way .         very good .  i have made some limited progress here .  can you give me an expected time of arrival .         the city computer has their charter information .  if i remember right  they   re due on the same flight tomorrow morning .  you can call them at home or in flight if you need earlier contact .         i doubt that will be necessary .      she smiled wryly .     both of them were willing to join the project  but we had to pay a number of unusual expenses for them to leave home that soon .  they will also need briefing when they arrive .         that will not take long .  the information they will need is minimal .         hunter .  .  .     dr .  redfield hesitated .     the committee assigned you to the job in all confidence  and we still have that .  and we all realize that a roboticist might be necessary in your work .  but i   ve been wondering           yes .         are you sure you need a paleontologist .      hunter  with his robotic speed  considered his answer carefully .  he could see that this was a reasonable question  but he did not want to report any more details of his search for mc governor than necessary .  setting a precedent of that sort could become a distraction in the future .      yes     he said simply .     steve chang sat on a rock in front of his four meter square shack on the slope of an unnamed mountain .  it was one of a ridge of mountains that ran across the southern edge of the valley in the high desert below him .  in the distance the waning red rays of twilight glinted off the solar collectors and water pipes that led down into the new underground city .   with mild curiosity  he had watched it under construction .  robots driving large machinery had dug out a huge hole and then built a big cube inside it with patient but inexorable energy .  as long as they didn   t bother him up here  he didn   t care what they did .   this evening he was sorting some new rocks he had gathered during the last few days in a big yellow bucket .  he tossed the white quartz into one large pile on his left .  the blue green rocks went to his right .  someday  when he got around to it  he would sit down at the computer inside his shack and access a library to find out what kind of rock the blue green ones were .  they probably bore copper  but he didn   t really care .  he collected them because he liked them .   for the last several minutes  however  he had also been watching a small helicopter down on the pad next to the underground city .  flights came and went occasionally  but this one was now flying toward the bluff where he sat .  that was very rare .   steve went on sorting rocks as the helicopter buzzed up the slope  skimming the tops of the occasional joshua trees  grease plants  and outcroppings of bare rock .  finally he stopped to watch in astonishment .  now roaring in his ears  the helicopter slowed and came to a gentle landing in a spot of open sand only fifteen meters away .      they must be lost     steve muttered to himself .     or had a mechanical failure .     he remained seated .   the engine shut off and three figures climbed out of the helicopter .  the leader was a tall  brawny  blond  blue eyed guy with heroic leading man looks .  a pretty young woman walked behind him  holding her long brown hair out of her face as it was blown by the still spinning propeller .  another young man of average height and weight came last .   all three of them wore new  stylish clothes .  steve was wearing his usual short sleeved western shirt  worn blue jeans  and beat up cowboy boots .  up on this bluff  though  they were the ones who looked out of place .      i am r .  hunter     said the blond leader .     you are steve chang  i believe .         how would you know that .     steve demanded .   hunter looked startled at his rudeness .     i have a dossier with your portrait on my internal video .  my companions are jane maynard  roboticist  and chad mora  paleontologist .         yeah .     steve ignored them .     what do you want .         i need your help     said hunter .     i came to offer you employment .         looks like you could use a little money     said chad  grinning .     i didn   t think people still lived like this .         if i wanted a job  i wouldn   t be here     growled steve .     i own this plot of land and you came uninvited .  go away .      hunter turned and started to walk back to the helicopter .  steve grinned .  he had expected more of an argument  but of course  under the second law  a robot had to obey a direct order to leave .      wait a minute     said jane to hunter .  the robot hesitated  now at least able to make some interpretations of his own .     steve  i just want to know if it   s really true that you can mountain climb  camp  rock climb  canoe .  .  . all the outdoor activities hunter told us about .         yeah .  what of it .     steve asked more mildly  flattered that she was interested .      everyone i know is highly specialized and lives in cities .  i   ve never met anyone like you before .      steve shrugged .     i just happen to like the desert .         he   s a real throwback     sneered chad .      shut up  chad     said jane .     steve  i   ve never seen a place like yours .  would you show me around .      steve knew very well that she was just trying to get on his good side  but he didn   t get much female company up on this ridge .  with a reluctant grin  he got to his feet .     there isn   t much to see  but come on in .         you have a computer  at least     said jane  following him inside .     and electricity .         yeah .     steve shrugged .     i built the shack with modem insulation because it does get pretty cold up here in the winter .  i have an old solar powered generator and a windmill in the back for additional power .         this is basically an office with a bed in it     said jane .     very practical .  but where does your water come from .         i have five acres of this slope .  in the winter  it snows up here  and i have collectors that take the runoff down into an underground tank .  i only need about four liters a day  on average  and i have a two thousand liter tank .  so that   s more than enough for a year .         what if the snowfall is short .     jane asked .      i can buy bottled water if necessary  even on a daily basis .     he shrugged casually  but he was really enjoying showing her how he lived .      where do you get your money .  odd jobs down in the desert towns .         i could do that  but i haven   t had to lately .  i use my computer to follow major stock exchanges .  i have some money invested  and i make just enough to survive on what i can earn .      chad laughed .     oh  he   s a financial expert  eh .      steve felt his face grow hot with anger .     i   m self sufficient up here .  that   s more than most people ever manage .         or want .     chad rolled his eyes .      what do you want here .     steve demanded  glaring at all three of them .     get to the point or get out .         a computer analysis of individuals with certain skills turned up your name     said hunter .      let me     jane interjected .     steve  the three of us are going on a trip .  but we need to hire someone who can take care of our camp and equipment .  hunter suggested taking another robot  but i objected .  i think we need a human who can exercise personal judgment without reference to the laws of robotics .         exactly what skills are you talking about .     steve asked suspiciously .      camping  fishing  maybe hunting .  possibly hiking or even climbing .     jane waited patiently  watching him with large  dark eyes .      my focus was too narrow     said hunter .     a flaw in my robotic thinking .  when i planned our trip  i forgot to concern myself with the human needs of chad and jane .         why don   t you find someone in that underground place you came from .         mojave center     said jane .     the problem is that not very many humans have the skills we need .  you do .         mojave center is still experimental     said chad .     the humans living there are all very well educated and specialized .  they   re too important to be spared from the skeleton population .         forget it     said steve .      we   re going back in time     jane said suddenly .     something no human has ever done before .         what .         to the late cretaceous period     said hunter .     that   s why i need a paleontologist  such as chad .         back in time .     steve stared at hunter  his hands tingling with excitement .  he hated the kind of routine life led by people in cities  but a real adventure fascinated him .     why are you going back in time .  just to see if you can do it .         no     said hunter .     if you join us  i   ll brief you fully .  for now  i will say only that a robot has preceded us on this trip .  we must return him to the present time .      steve shook his head slowly  looking at hunter in amazement .     a robot has already made the trip  huh .         i know you may find this trip hard to believe     said hunter  who seemed to mistake his excitement for fear .     so i must tell you that i am authorized to hire you at the same fee i will pay chad and jane  who are highly specialized professionals in their fields .         are you serious .     chad turned to hunter in shock .     you   re going to pay him as much as you pay me .      steve grinned at his outrage .     sure  i   ll take the job .  when do we leave .         now     said hunter .     all necessary clothes  personal articles  and equipment will be provided in mojave center .         now .     steve glanced around his shack .     well .  .  .         what   s wrong .     chad demanded .     afraid somebody will come by and trash your mansion .         it   s still my place     steve growled .      hunter     said jane     security is a realistic concern if he leaves his home unattended .         i will assign a security robot from mojave center to remain here while you are gone     said hunter .     since we will be coming back only a minute or so after we leave  the only significant period of time involved will be the time we spend in mojave center getting ready .  will that be acceptable .         uh  fine     said steve .     give me just a minute to turn off everything .         i will start up the helicopter     said hunter .   chad followed him away from the shack .  jane hesitated  watching steve shut off the power to various appliances .  when he glanced up at her  she smiled .      we   re going back in time     steve mused to himself .     hard to believe .        steve enjoyed the brief helicopter ride  looking out over the desert from an even greater altitude than he normally could .  when they took the angled tube down into mojave center  however  he began to feel closed in .  the carefully processed air seemed humid and chilly to him after living in the natural desert climate .      i will either have to requisition what we need     said hunter     or arrange through the city computer to acquire it or have it made .  but  steve  i need a list from you of what you humans will need to survive .         well  food  of course           that part i understand .  i can arrange basic  balanced nutrition in packaged form .  what about clothing and shelter for living in the wild .         not so fast     said steve .     what about food preparation .  some of it will need cooking .  we   ll need containers  utensils  and a way to clean them all .         i understand .  keep going .  i am recording as you speak     said hunter .      where are we going .         roughly  allowing for major geological changes  we will be in alberta  canada .         alberta .  then we   ll need to keep warm if it   s winter .  what time of year .         summer     said hunter .     but the region that is now alberta was farther south at that time   closer to the equator .  the climate was totally different .         all right  then what kind of climate will it have .         warm and humid     said hunter .     forest  marsh  maybe some open country .  i cannot be more specific than that .         then layered clothing is important     said steve .     so that we can put on or take off whatever is necessary .  boots for all of us .  a sturdy tent to keep off rain and to stand up to wind .  a portable solar powered generator for heat  cooking  power tools           not acceptable     said hunter .      why not .     steve looked up at him in surprise .      all our equipment will have to be as primitive as possible .  we will use everything that we can get in biodegradable form .  we have to be very careful to leave as small an impact in the past as we can .  if we do leave anything behind  it must decompose as fast as possible .         i see     said steve .     well  then .  extra rope and knives .  an axe and a small hatchet to cut wood .     steve continued to list the essential items  now relying strictly on simple hand tools and materials .   after steve had completed his general list  chad and jane added their personal articles .  by the time they had finished their various requests  they had ridden a lift down to an immense hallway labeled antelope valley boulevard .  steve looked around  uncomfortable yet still curious to see whatever he could .      we will go to mc governor   s office     said hunter .     we   ll use it as a rendezvous point .         are we separating .     jane looked at him in surprise .      yes .  i have arranged through the city computer for steve to spend tonight in the same hotel you two are using .  i am going to spend the night supervising gathering the equipment and checking it over .  the first law will not let me go until i have reviewed everything that you three will need .         it   s still fairly early for us     said jane .     we can have a leisurely dinner     said chad .     i   m hungry enough .  that is  if steve here eats his food cooked .         sure     said steve .     and you had better enjoy tonight   s dinner .  after we   re on our way  you   ll have to eat the same way i do .             while the humans ate dinner  hunter found his way to the storage and manufacturing centers of the city .  on his way  he had the city computer introduce him to the supervisory robots through their comlinks to save time .  he spent several hours waiting for the clothing and equipment to be assembled .   once he had given the supervisory robots a top priority order  they left only a small staff on necessary operations and assigned the remainder to hunter   s unusual requests .  by the time he had finished gathering everything to his satisfaction  jane had called him from the hotel to say that the three humans were retiring for the night .   hunter spent the rest of the night inspecting the gear and packing it into bundles .  with his robotic strength  he could carry the greatest amount of it in a large backpack without a problem .  steve would carry another pack with the remainder .  chad and jane would be burdened only with small packs in which their immediate needs were stored .  he wanted them to be as free as possible to concentrate on their basic task  helping him catch mc governor .   in the morning  hunter sent a security robot to pick up the humans when they had finished breakfast .  meanwhile  he went directly to the bohung institute .  in room f     with the help of ishihara  he disabled the miniaturization system .  then he instructed ishihara to wait outside the room and prevent any unauthorized robots or humans from entering until further notice .  hunter was ready for the humans when they arrived .      we briefed steve last night     said jane .     about mc governor going microscopic and fleeing back in time  not realizing that the miniaturization is temporary .  we discussed it after dinner while we walked around the city seeing the sights .         his part is simple enough     said chad .     he does the camping .  we   ll find mc governor .      steve nodded toward the packs .     you got everything  then  hunter .         everything on my list     said hunter .     do any of you have any late additions .      no one did .      all right     said hunter .     i have a khaki  biodegradable worksuit  like the one i am wearing  for each of you .  they have plenty of pockets for your personal items .  change in the next room if you prefer .      the three humans took turns changing their clothes and returned .  all of them looked down at themselves and at each other with self  conscious grins .  their worksuits fit perfectly  of course .      one final briefing     said hunter .     are you familiar with chaos theory as applied to history .         as a paleontologist  yes     said chad .      i haven   t heard it actually discussed     said jane .     i think i can see how it would be applied .         what kind of theory .     steve asked .   chad laughed .   hunter ignored him .     according to traditional chaos theory  chaotic systems are irreversible events cause a sequence of ongoing effects similar to ripples in water after a splash .  no one can stop them .         wouldn   t that make time travel impossible .     steve asked cautiously .      oh  now he   s a physicist     chad sneered .   hunter ignored that  too .     theoretically  yes .  if we can go back in time by using the machinery in this room  however  we will be proving an uncertainty principle in this theory that has existed for a long time .  our own problem  however  is this  any actions mc governor takes  particularly after he returns to normal size  may cause ripples in events  ripples that will be huge by the time they reach the present .  i must find him to prevent him from harming every human who has ever lived .         that part sounds easy enough to understand     said steve .     that   s why we   re chasing him in the first place .         but once we are back in time  we have the same problem .  anything we do could cause ripples  we have to make as few changes of note as possible .     hunter looked each one of them in the eye  in turn .     do you understand how critical this point is .  we must return with all of our equipment .  in every way  we have to have as little influence on our environment as possible .  understood .      steve and jane nodded .      our very presence is going to create some changes     said chad .     we   ll consume oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide  give off body heat  step on the grass .  we can   t avoid making some changes .  let   s not kid ourselves  hunter .         we are not     said hunter .     no one knows where the line is drawn between actions that the time line will absorb and what will make permanent changes .      an uncomfortable silence followed .      are we following mc governor to the exact moment he went to .     jane asked .     how long will we be there before he returns to normal size .         within twenty four hours     said hunter .     we will not follow him to the direct moment .  i have calculated how long the miniaturization is likely to last .  we will be landing as close to the moment it ends as i can calculate .  also  we will be moving geographically  with the movement of the planet .  that was part of mc governor   s calculation  which i   ve duplicated .         sounds good to me     said chad .      time to go     said hunter .  he pushed a button on the control panel that opened the big sphere .     everyone climb in .  when you are comfortable  i will place the gear in around you and get in myself .      as the others entered  hunter punched instructions into the control panel .  its timer was already running by the time he joined them and sealed the hatch behind him .  the quartet was crowded  and since the bottom of the sphere was curved  everyone and everything slid together .  in a moment  however  a quiet hum sounded outside the sphere .  no one moved .     suddenly sunlight replaced the darkness as the sphere vanished .  in the next instant  hunter felt himself fall seventeen centimeters  landing on soft soil with a thump .  he turned to see if the humans were hurt .  no one seemed to be .   all of them were looking around in amazement .  they were outside  of course  sitting among their scattered packs .  most of their surroundings were forested  but beyond the canopy of trees  the sky was blue and the sun bright .   hunter inhaled deeply  and his internal sensors analyzed the content of the air .  it was not extremely different from what he had experienced before  except for somewhat less methane and  of course  no industrial pollutants of any kind  even in trace amounts .  the air was far more humid than that of the desert  or even of the controlled atmosphere in mojave center .  by these initial data  he judged that they had apparently arrived at their destination .      a primeval forest     jane said in awe .  she looked around slowly in all directions .     it   s the real thing .  we   re actually here .         better not get hurt     said chad .     it   s a long way to a hospital   millions of years .      steve got to his feet  also glancing around .     it   s afternoon already .         what of it .     chad demanded  also getting up .     we have hours of daylight left .         it may take hours to find a natural source of water and a safe place to camp .         we have water     said hunter .     as much as we can carry  in these containers .  rationed  it will last us a couple of days .         you hired me to handle this kind of thing     steve said hotly .     what if it takes us days to find water .  back home  we could chew leaves for the moisture if necessary   but here we don   t know which plants might be poisonous to us .         you   re getting ahead of yourself  hotshot     said chad .     we have to find a robot .  if we find him soon  we can just go right home .  suppose you let us handle the scheduling .         then i   ll look for water alone .     steve turned and stomped away through the trees .  in the dense forest  he was out of sight quickly .   hunter  watching him in some alarm  turned up his aural sensitivity .  he did not hear the sound of any particularly large  heavy footsteps that threatened immediate danger .     be extremely careful  please     he called after steve .      the first law requires that i protect all of you     hunter said to chad and jane .     but steve may have a point .  i hired him to take care of your human needs  and water is an obvious one .         let   s make our plans     said jane .     if we   re lucky  we can catch mc governor without having to camp out here .         all right     said hunter .     i have calculated the radius of the circle within which mc governor can probably be found .         he may have had no reason to go anywhere     said jane  looking down at her feet .     we could be standing on him .         at his size  he would sustain no damage if we were     said hunter .  he stepped back .  carefully measuring the distance from the center of their landing point  he paced off a line into the trees .  he was out of sight for a moment  then quickly returned .     i have marked a radius of    .   meters .  our visibility here is about twelve meters .         how are you going to mark it .     chad asked .     blaze the trees .         no     said hunter .     unnecessary damage to tree trunks is the kind of action we must avoid .  i am going to walk around the perimeter of the area .  watch me to see if i am out of sight for very long .      when hunter had finished his circle  making minor adjustments to avoid natural obstacles  he turned to jane .     how is the visibility .         not too good     said jane .     this circle is what  about thirty meters across .         approximately  yes .         i   d say the average visibility here is only twelve meters  maybe twenty in spots     said chad .      then we may have to rely on hearing mc governor   s footsteps and movements through the forest when he returns to full size     said hunter .     we may or may not be able to see him .         when we do see him or hear him     said chad     how do we catch him .         the first and second laws of robotics     said jane .     if mc governor believes that a human is in danger  then he will have to stop to help under the first law .  if he is within hearing of a human voice  he can be ordered to stop and cooperate .  hunter alone  of course  can   t use the laws against him  being a robot himself .         i get the picture     said chad .      we must set a trap for mc governor     said hunter .     one that uses the laws of robotics on him  but not on me .         can we discuss it here  just like that .     chad looked down at the ground .     i know he   s microscopic  but can   t he still hear us .         no     said jane .     his aural sensitivity is still strong  but with the difference in the size of his sensors  the sound of our voices will be too heavily distorted for him to understand .  he won   t even realize that human voices are speaking .  his current existence has more immediate threats from microbes .  the third law will force him to focus all his sensors on sights and sounds that signify danger on his level .  he has no reason to expect human voices here  anyway .         i accept your judgment     said hunter .     that is why i wanted a roboticist along  after all .         i   m convinced     said chad .     so what kind of trap are you talking about .         one with a dinosaur or two     said hunter .     i want you to choose one that will look dangerous to mc governor  but is actually herbivorous and not too large .  if a meat eater approaches any of you humans  the first law will force me to intervene .         all right     said chad  sliding his belt computer free .     i   ll see what   s likely to be around here .  some of the herbivores might attack if they feel endangered  or stampede over someone if they   re scared .  their choice of diet is not the only threat they can present .         excellent point     said hunter .     go ahead with your research and then we will discuss the choices .        steve hurried away from the others angrily  impatient with their carelessness .  he did a lot of hiking in the desert and knew that nature  unlike robots  was indifferent to human needs .  humans needed water  shelter  and latrines in their camp as soon as possible .      besides     he said to himself     if hunter doesn   t want my advice  why is he paying me to be here .      he found the footing difficult in the dense forest .  small animals rustled through the leaves of trees and in the underbrush .  the few he was able to glimpse looked a lot like the reptiles he had seen in the mojave desert  though not exactly .  soon he was sweating .      my body   s not used to this humidity     he told himself .     better slow down .      wiping sweat from his eyes with his forearm  he turned around  checking for landmarks .  that was routine on his hikes through unfamiliar areas .  here  the trees and bushes offered much more variety than the scrub on the barren  rocky bluffs and open desert where he usually explored .  he noted the appearance of a particularly large  crooked tree trunk with low hanging branches and then turned around to look forward again .      all right     he said to himself quietly .  in the desert  water was in the water table under the valley floor .  residents gathered water from snow melt and some  times from mountain springs .  natural water attracted birds .  he could see them from a long way off in open country .  that wouldn   t work here  where birds were in every tree .  he couldn   t see the sky anyway .   the ground was rough and uneven  but it generally sloped away from the group   s landing point .  steve shrugged and picked his way in that direction .     water flows downhill .      steve hiked through the forest for what seemed like a long time .  he was aware  however  that moving through strange territory always seemed to take longer than it really did .  carefully keeping track of his trail  he pushed on through the forest .  still  he found no water .   he was just stepping over the large  angled  trunk of a fallen tree when a large motion ahead made him freeze .  through the leaves and branches straight ahead  he saw a large dinosaur clearly for the first time .   at first  all he could see was a long  narrow neck and a small head   but the head was nearly two meters off the ground .  it had large eyes and a rough  horny beak .  the shape of the head and beak together resembled that of a goose .  the dinosaur was dark green  giving it camouflage in the forest .  as steve watched  it leaned forward  peering at a dead branch on a tree that was still standing .   steve had once been very excited to find a rock with a fossil of some sort of tiny fish .  that had been nothing compared to seeing a living dinosaur .  he crept forward  taking care to keep his footsteps quiet .   the dinosaur dipped its head  looking closely at the dead branch .  steve eased between a couple of bushes  planting his feet softly  and slipped behind a thick tree trunk .  then he peered around it slowly .   the dinosaur was raking at the dead branch with long claws on the ends of long fingers .  as it ripped away chunks of dead wood  swarms of crawling insects were exposed .  it flicked its tongue at them  licking them up quickly .  now steve could see that it stood on two long legs  with heavy hindquarters and a meter long tail .      wow     he whispered to himself .             what have you found .     hunter asked chad .  hunt er was still standing  though chad and jane had both found seats on the ground where they could lean against tree trunks .  chad had been calling up various lists of dinosaurs on his belt computer .      north america was full of dinosaurs in the late cretaceous period .     chad frowned at the little screen on his belt computer .     i think this one might be a good recommendation for our trap .         what is it .     jane asked .      stegoceras     said chad .     common in this time and place .  it will look fairly dangerous  because it has a heavy  spiked dome on its head .  however  it was   is  i mean   an herbivore  and it   s only a couple of meters long and half a meter high  so it won   t pose an extreme danger .         does it look like a goat .     jane asked .      no .  look at the line drawing here on the screen .     chad handed the belt computer to her .     see  it runs on two legs .  it looks more like a goat sized duck wearing a bowl on its head .     he grinned .      you   re right .     jane laughed .     but it does look like it could ram you if it were mad .         strictly an herbivore .     hunter moved to look over her shoulder .     not an omnivore that might decide to try a couple of large mammals for lunch on a whim .         herbivore     said chad .      i think i can accept this     said hunter .     my robotic strength should be more than a match for its strength if it chose to attack a human .  so under these controlled circumstances  my interpretation of the first law will allow us to use a stegoceras .         in that case     said chad     we have to catch one .     he clipped the belt computer back on and got up .     any idea where our safari guide went .         i turned up my hearing sensitivity when he left     said hunter .     i have been listening .  he is still slowly moving away from us westward .  i would say that he is safe .     hunter opened one of the packs and drew out two coils of rope .  he tossed one to chad .   chad looked at the coil of rope in his hand and started tying a loop in one end .     isn   t steve supposed to do the physical labor around here .         steve is looking for water     said jane .     that   s also a duty of his .         i will use my enhanced hearing to pick out footsteps that are not steve   s     said hunter  also tying a lasso .     chad  you can help me identify what species of dinosaur we find .  then the two of us will have to rope him .         you have another rope .     jane asked .        i   ll try it  too .         all right .     hunter took out another and threw it to her .     but your first duty as roboticist is mc governor .  i want you to stay within sight of the perimeter in case he appears here soon .  if you can lasso a stegoceras  go ahead .         thanks a lot     jane said  laughing .     that   s what i get for going into robotics  huh .         if you see him  or anticipate any danger  yell for me     said hunter .  he hesitated  then pointed behind chad  to the north .     this forest is teeming with animals of all kinds  many of them two legged and roughly the right size  allowing for individual variation .  but i hear one likely prospect fairly close in that direction .         let   s go see     said chad .      the first law requires me to go first     said hunter .     stay close and move quietly .      chad nodded .   hunter moved forward  studying the ground with magnified vision in order to place his feet in the spots that would make the least noise .  at the same time  his enhanced hearing told him that a two legged dinosaur was moving very slowly only about twelve meters ahead .  the footsteps were gentle and infrequent  meaning that the dinosaur was not really going anywhere .  hunter guessed that the creature was feeding on leaves or perhaps avoiding a carnivore .   chad  right behind him  was not nearly as quiet .  still  since their quarry was not fleeing  hunter concluded that the paleontologist was handling himself well enough .  hunter had to move around a thicket and then a couple of very large  heavily branched trees .  by the sounds of movement  the dinosaur was soon only about two meters ahead  standing still .   hunter moved to one side and waved for chad to come up next to him .  then hunter pointed soundlessly through the dense forest cover .  all they could see at this point was the long  green  angled slope of the creature   s back .  its head was down low  behind the brush .      it   s too big     said chad softly .     i don   t think that   s a   look out .      suddenly the dinosaur leapt through the bushes at them  flashing rows of long fangs .   now  thinking in nanoseconds  hunter could see his mistake .  the basic shape of this dinosaur was the same as that of the stegoceras  but it was larger than he had judged by the sound of its footsteps .  the long  blunt snout was filled with sharp teeth  incisors instead of molars .  its forearms ended in three fingered hands with long claws .  in short  this was a carnivorous predator .  its lack of movement had not signified feeding or hiding  but that it was lying in wait for the two of them .    chad spun around  ducked  and threw himself to the ground .  driven by the first law to protect him  hunter threw his lasso over the long snout and narrow head of the dinosaur and yanked it tight .  he braced his feet against the ground and pulled with all the robotic strength in his body .  the dinosaur fell heavily to one side  crushing a small tree under it .  now hunter could see that the dinosaur  when standing  was about a meter and a half high  much bigger than a stegoceras .      run .     hunter shouted to chad  who scrambled up and took off .     warn jane .  climb a tree .      the lassoed dinosaur had scrambled to its thick  powerful hind legs .  it ran at hunter  teeth bared again  its long claws raking the air .  hunter  with the advantage of robotic reflexes  dodged to his right  cocking his right arm .  as the dinosaur closed on him  he slipped farther to the side and slammed his fist against the side of the creature   s head .   the power of the blow knocked the dinosaur   s head to one side .  it stumbled  shifting around to face hunter again .  hunter leapt as high as he could  grasping a branch just thick enough to bear his weight .  as the dinosaur lunged  he swung up over it and pulled himself high enough to reach another branch .   hunter had been able to see from the dinosaur   s body that it was a runner  not a climber .  the creature   s long  slender legs had some leaping ability  which it now used futilely .  its jaws snapped below hunter   s dangling feet and its short  skinny forearms were not long enough to reach up very high at all .  then it eyed him angrily and stopped to watch him  twitching its long  heavy tail .   even now  hunter was still holding the end of the rope .  he began pulling .  if he could hoist the dinosaur off the ground  it would be helpless .   soon the rope was taut and the dinosaur began pulling back .  now  however  it had its strong legs braced on the ground and it began to walk backward slowly .  by contrast  hunter could not pull too hard for fear of losing his balance in the tree and falling out .   for a long moment  the robot and the dinosaur were at a stalemate .  then  suddenly  the rope snapped .  hunter caught his balance in the branches  still holding most of the rope .   the dinosaur  with the loop of the lasso around its neck and only a short  broken end of rope dangling from it  showed its teeth and moved around the base of the tree .   even from his high vantage point  hunter could not see chad .  however  he could hear the paleontologist frantically yelling for jane to climb a tree .  the dinosaur was not interested in chad .  it was still watching hunter  not realizing  of course  that a robot was entirely inedible .      it is still here watching me     hunter shouted .     chad  can you hear me .         yeah  hunter     chad called back .     jane and i both climbed up a tree by the camp .         you are both safe  then .         we   re fine     jane shouted breathlessly .     but what do we do now .         what do you think  chad .     hunter asked .      just a minute .  i   m checking my belt computer .     he was silent for a moment .   hunter  who had moved to a standing position in the y of two stout branches  looked down again at the predator .  the dinosaur was standing patiently at the base of the tree .  its tail had stopped moving .      it might be a velociraptor     chad called .     that   s a certain predator with the right overall size and body type .  i didn   t get a very long look  of course .  a lot of bipedal dinosaurs that existed had much the same appearance .  that   s why it resembles a stegoceras .  the only trouble is  velociraptors have only been found in mongolia .  that doesn   t mean they didn   t exist here .  it just means we don   t know .         how long do you think it is going to stay here .     hunter shouted .      i have no idea     yelled chad .     that kind of behavior is too subtle to learn from fossils .         i see     hunter muttered .     better get comfortable .  do not even consider climbing down without telling me .         no problem     jane shouted .   hunter coiled the rope and slipped it over one shoulder .  the patient predator below him had not moved .  it was hungry and thought it could outwait its prey .   by hunter   s internal clock  after forty two minutes and twelve seconds  the dinosaur finally moved out of sight .  hunter   s enhanced hearing told him  however  that the creature was still nearby  hoping that hunter would come down out of the tree .  another one hour and seventeen minutes passed before the dinosaur actually gave up and wandered away a substantial distance .   at this point  hunter decided he could risk returning to the ground under the third law  but he still wanted to find out if the dinosaur would return before he was willing to tell chad and jane to come down .  still listening for the predator   s footsteps  he dropped to the ground and quickly hiked back to the landing site .  there he found the two of them about three and a half meters up in a tree  sitting uncomfortably .      my hearing tells me the predator is gone     said hunter .     i will move you to the ground .      they both began a careful descent .  in a few minutes  hunter had lifted jane down safely and was just lifting chad out of the tree when he heard an unusual noise .  he set chad down and turned to focus his attention .  two bipeds were running quickly in their direction through the underbrush  by their footsteps  hunter knew that one was steve .      hunter .     steve yelled .     hunter  look out .      instantly  hunter lifted chad back into the tree .  as steve raced toward them  hunter raised jane again also .  steve finally came into view  stumbling over a tree branch and staggering forward as he regained his balance .      over here .     hunter ordered .     what is it .      steve was too out of breath to speak .  hunter did not have time to lift him before a dinosaur the size of a large dog charged out of the brush .  steve dodged behind the tree trunk .   in the same moment hunter braced himself to fight off the dinosaur .  it was much smaller than the velociraptor .  in fact  by its size and the hard dome on its head  he quickly recognized that this was a stegoceras .   hunter immediately revised his tactics .  this was the herbivore that they wanted to use to trap mc governor .  he wanted to capture this stegoceras if he could .   the stegoceras darted around hunter  but he shifted to block it .  then the stegoceras stopped to look him over .  hunter slowly slipped the coil of rope from his shoulder and tied a loop on one end .      hey  chad .     steve gasped  between breaths .     give me your rope .  drop it down here .         all right .  here .      as hunter prepared to lasso the stegoceras  he heard the rope drop behind him .  a moment later  steve came up on the other side of the stegoceras with a newly tied lasso .  the small dinosaur hesitated  aware that it now had two enemies  neither of which was running away .      let me go first     said hunter .     i cannot let you take an unnecessary risk .         i can follow your lead     said steve .   hunter nodded .     get ready to throw .  i am going to move up on this side and try to lasso it .  if it dodges your way  maybe you can surprise it .         ready     said steve .   hunter advanced in two slow  precisely measured steps .  then  as the stegoceras glanced toward steve  hunter threw his loop .  with the distance judged by his careful robotic eye and his throw governed by his exact body motion  the loop dropped over the dinosaur   s head and settled around its neck .      got him .     chad yelled enthusiastically .   hunter tightened the loop .  as the stegoceras reared back  steve ran forward and lassoed their prey again .  then they pulled their ropes taut  holding the stegoceras in place as it pulled and yanked .   while hunter had all his attention focused on holding his prey lassoed  his hearing told him of sudden bipedal footsteps behind him  about nine meters away .      look .     jane shouted frantically .      it   s mc governor .     chad yelled .     it must be .  what do we do .      hunter glanced back over his shoulder .  he saw a short  slender human form standing perfectly still  watching him .  then the stranger turned and ran the other way  quickly disappearing into the dense forest cover .      stay where you are     hunter ordered .  he could not release the rope without endangering steve  so that first law concern overrode all his other duties .  the stegoceras had to be gotten under control before any of them did anything else .   steve had already backed up to a tall  young tree .  he quickly ran the end of his rope around the trunk several times  holding it firmly .  then he tied a simple knot to hold it .     there  hunter .  do the same with your end .  give it enough slack not to strangle it .         understood .     hunter backed up to another tree and quickly tied his rope as well .   the stegoceras still jumped and pulled  but it was tied firmly now .      how about getting us down .     jane called .          hunter quickly lifted both jane and chad to the ground again .  chad  in particular  studied the stegoceras with interest .  he unhooked his belt computer and started entering observations about it in a quick  quiet voice .   hunter turned up his visual and aural sensitivity in order to continue tracking the fugitive robot .  their fugitive was already gone in the dense forest .  near hunter  steve wiped sweat from his face on his sleeve and looked over their still struggling catch .      do you know where the robot went .     jane asked hunter  after watching him for a moment .      only a short distance .  i tracked him with my hearing at first  but now his footsteps are silent .  that probably means he is hiding nearby  listening to our conversation .         maybe     said jane .     or he may have found a very quiet way to keep moving .  his arm strength might allow him to swing carefully from one tree branch to another  for instance .         i would probably hear that     said hunter .      mc governor got here too soon for the trap     said chad  turning away from the stegoceras .     we weren   t quite ready for him yet .         yes     said hunter .     he correctly judged that no threat of harm existed here that i did not have under control .  so he was free to flee .         well .     steve demanded .     hunter  aren   t we going to chase him or something .  let   s go after him .         i do not believe he has fled very far     said hunter .     but if i pursue him  he will run .  you three cannot keep up .         can we try it .     steve pleaded .     this is what we came for .         i will not lead you barging through this forest recklessly   especially this late in the day .  mc governor will still have to respond to the laws .  inducing him to come to us is a safer tactic for you humans than running around after him .      steve sighed .     all right .  i   ll let the stegoceras go .         not so fast .     chad stepped up quickly .     first i want to record as much description of him as i can .         he   s all yours .      chad eyed the dinosaur and began muttering observations into his belt computer .      something else is wrong     said jane .     that wasn   t a governor robot .  it was one of the six component robots that combine to create a governor .         i noticed that the footsteps were unexpectedly light     said hunter .     it was gone before i had a chance to turn and see it myself .         do you have any information that can tell us if he split here or back in our own time .      hunter reviewed his data .     no .  that is  nothing conclusive  anyway .         so we don   t know if we   re looking for six robots here     said jane .     the others may also have separated  or they may still be together .         if so  they   re apparently still microscopic     said steve .     they might also appear any time .  right .         now he   s a roboticist     chad sneered  looking up from the stegoceras .      i didn   t see you accomplish anything     said steve .     when i got back here  you were hiding in a tree .      jane stifled a laugh .      until further notice     said hunter     we will focus our project on the robot who we know has reached full size .  if the others are here and still microscopic  they will appear sooner or later on this spot .         if we aren   t going to run after that robot  is there any objection if i make camp .     steve squinted through the treetops at the sun .     assuming you want shelter for the night  and maybe hot food .         did you find water .     hunter asked .      yeah .  a small  clear stream about a ten minute hike from here .         that   s not too far     said chad .      it will be  hauling water     said steve .     especially stepping over all the fallen logs and around all the heavy brush .  suppose we make camp by the water .         unacceptable     said hunter .     if more component robots reach full size  they will do so here .  while we concentrate our search on the known fugitive  we should also be prepared to see if the others appear .  for now  that will be sufficient attention to them .  i will carry water if necessary .         it will be .     steve shrugged and started opening up their supplies .   chad continued walking around the stegoceras and speaking into his belt computer .   hunter opened his radio link and transmitted .     this is r .  hunter  in the employ of the governor robot oversight committee .  respond  mojave center governor component robot .  we must discuss the danger to humans in the future .     then  as he waited for an answer  he explained to jane what he was doing .      any answer .         not yet     said hunter .     do you think he will answer .         hard to say .  from his point of view  you are introducing a rather vague first law concern .  it will be open to his interpretation .         in what way .         if he feels that his own danger from us is more immediate than the theoretical danger he poses to humans in the future  then he may have the freedom of choice not to answer you .         as a robot  i cannot give him a second law instruction     said hunter .     but i suspect that he   i will call him mc     may have shut down his radio link to avoid receiving any transmission from me that might compel him to cooperate with us under the laws of robotics .         i agree .  as soon as he saw us  he must have known we were after him .  since the only radio transmission here would come from you or his own partner components  he won   t need it for anything else .         that does mean he will not try to coordinate with the others if they are here .         true .  in fact  he may very well have shut off his aural capability  at least within the sound range of human speech .  that way no amount of shouting from us humans can force his obedience under the second law .         yes  i understand .     hunter listened again for some sound of mc   in the distance .  any number of large and small animals  presumably dinosaurs  were moving about in the forest within his hearing  but he heard no sounds that he could specifically identify as coming from mc   .      we could still try trapping him again     said jane .     it simply requires staging a trap in his line of sight .         the whole character of our search has to change     said hunter .     we have no way of anticipating now where he will be at any given time .  so even if we decide to use a trap to catch him  we have to find him first .         do you have a revised plan .         maybe .  our new search has to be based on the fact that mc   is no longer miniaturized .  my enhanced vision should be able to track him to some degree and my hearing may still reveal something  especially if i can detect a pattern to separate the sounds of his movements from those of dinosaurs .     hunter walked over to chad .   the stegoceras was no longer struggling .  it was now standing still  glaring suspiciously at all of them  effectively held in place by the two ropes around its neck .  chad was looking at it from several different angles .      we no longer need it     said hunter .     when you have finished gathering your data  we must free it unharmed .         i   m finished     said chad  nodding his agreement .     this is really exciting  hunter .  i have the first raw data ever gathered from a living dinosaur .  in fact  i   ve taped him with the camera built into this belt computer .      hunter moved to the nearest rope and untied it from the tree trunk .     chad  what are the chances that we can actually rope and tame some dinosaurs to ride .         ride .     chad looked at him in surprise .     uh   well  i   ll have to think that over .     he sat down on a large rock and consulted his belt computer again .   hunter held the rope taut as he moved toward the stegoceras .  when he reached it  the small dinosaur tried to butt him in the stomach .  hunter ignored the slight collision and released the other loop from its neck .  then he led the stegoceras away from the humans by the first rope .      i will take him a short distance into the forest before i free him .         i   ll walk with you     said jane .   as they picked their way through the forest  hunter kept the stegoceras tightly leashed and away from jane .      i   ve been thinking     said jane .     you should have a better chance of chasing down mc   on your own now .         maybe in the short term     said hunter .     if i could catch him quickly .         you know you can track him and keep up a pace of hiking and even running after him that we can   t match .  since you   re much bigger than the component robots  you can physically overpower him .  you won   t need us humans to give him second law instructions .  maybe we should just stay in camp  out of your way .         that is one possibility i must consider     said hunter  dragging the stubborn stegoceras after him on the rope .     however  the trail of mc   could lead me away from camp for a protracted period .  i have to consider this environment largely unknown and potentially very harmful .         in other words  you don   t want to leave us alone .     jane ducked under a low hanging tree branch .      not for very long .  i cannot .  if any of you humans remain in camp  the first law will not allow me to leave you unsupervised for very long .  that means i cannot go off on an open ended chase .  if i can arrange for you to come with me safely  then i can fulfill my first law obligations to you while we are pursuing mc   .         i see .  and if you and mc   start a footrace  the rest of us will need mounts to keep up with you .         yes .     hunter stopped .     i think i can let our friend go now .  please step behind me in case he is still angry .         all right .     jane slipped behind hunter  giving him some room to maneuver .   hunter held the dinosaur   s neck firmly in the crook of one arm while he took off the loop .  then he released the little stegoceras and stepped back warily .  the dinosaur shook its domed head  glanced at him  and darted away through the thick underbrush .  still  hunter listened to its footsteps until he was sure that the herbivore had truly lost interest in coming back to ram any of them .      gone .     jane asked .      yes .     hunter turned to start back to camp .     he was too small for anyone to ride .      they walked back to camp in silence .  by the time they arrived  steve had erected a large  blue domed tent .  he had set up the portable kitchen and also arranged the sleeping bags inside the tent .  chad was leaning back against a tree  still working with his belt computer .      i think our search for mc   may also involve a time limit of sorts     said jane thoughtfully .      a time limit .  of what sort .     hunter had not been aware of any .   chad looked up with interest .  steve also stopped working in order to listen .      the miniaturization and subsequent reversal has almost certainly weakened mc l   s molecular structure  making him much more fragile than normal     said jane .      you think a fight with a dinosaur might destroy him .     hunter asked .      possibly     said jane .     but another problem is almost guaranteed .         another problem .         in this warm  humid climate  microscopic life must be very active     said jane .     as long as mc   was microscopic himself  he was defending himself directly from other microbes   possibly even fighting with them under the third law .  but now he   s too big to do that .         so the microbes are going to start interfering with his robotic body .     hunter asked .     in a way that would not normally occur  without the effects of miniaturization and its subsequent termination .         yes  little by little .         i understand .  if he falls down unseen here in this forest  he may be impossible to find .  at the very best  it will take more sophisticated equipment than we have .         i   m afraid so .         wait a minute     said steve .     if the robot   s dead  so to speak  then he won   t be actively interfering with history .  so we just have to catch the others  right .         no     said hunter .     i cannot allow him just to remain here .  according to chaos theory as applied to history  even his rusting  corroding remains could change some subtle part of human history in the far future .         that seems hard to believe     said steve .   chad laughed .     you just don   t understand the general principle of the theory .         all right  then     said steve .     suppose you just tell me .  how  here in the late cretaceous period  can the body of one nonfunctioning robot possibly matter .         you ever hear of the term    therapsids    .     chad demanded with a smirk .      no     steve admitted .      that word  my ignorant friend  refers to some mammal like reptiles that lived long before even this period that we   re in now .  generally  they were small  active  rather aggressive carnivores .  all true mammals are descended from them   meaning that some of our very own human ancestors are alive right now  in one form or another .  you follow me .         yeah .      chad grinned and gestured toward the surrounding forest .     all kinds of little critters are roaming around this forest .  in fact  though it   s unlikely   who knows .  one of the little local monsters might actually be our own very great grandma .     he laughed .      so what does this have to do with a rusting robot .     steve demanded .      so dense .     chad rolled his eyes .     all right  look .  that robot has compound substances in it that are modern industrial creations .  they don   t belong in this time .  if some of our very distant human ancestors poison themselves trying to eat that stuff  they die early   and maybe they won   t reproduce  or they may have chromosome damage that changes the traits of their offspring .  now do you see how human history could be changed by something like this .         yeah  i guess  but it still sounds pretty farfetched     said steve skeptically .      yes  statistically it is quite unlikely     said hunter .     but not impossible .  that is the problem that chaos theory presents me with under the first law .  the degree of probability that mc     s permanent presence may harm all humans is still too great for me to accept .      steve just shrugged .      chad     said hunter .     what do you think about capturing some herbivorous dinosaurs we could ride .         well  from what little information i have  i would say there   s a reasonable chance .         can you recommend some likely species .  some that we can find in this forest .         yes .  that is  i can suggest some that appear to be a good size and shape to ride .  but the fossil evidence can   t possibly tell me something as subtle as how long a certain species might take for a rider to break .         understood     said hunter .     we will be the first to give it a real try .         what kind of dinosaurs have you picked .     steve asked .      what   s your hurry .     chad snickered .   steve stiffened at his tone .     nobody   s going to break a new mount without equipment .  if you want to ride a dinosaur  you   and all of us   will need some kind of stirrups and halter at the very least  preferably a bridle and a saddle if i can rig them up .         an excellent point     said hunter .      so     said steve     i need to know the rough size and shape of the heads  necks  and torsos of the dinosaurs you expect us to ride .  then i can start checking our equipment for something we can use .         all right     said chad  now speaking in a normal tone of voice .     here  take a look at this screen .  our first choice is going to be the struthiomimus .  it kind of resembles an ostrich .      steve moved around and looked over his shoulder .     two meters tall  three and a half meters long  head and neck like an ostrich .  got it .              steve eyed the sunlight that filtered brightly through a few gaps in the canopy of leaves overhead .  the sun was low  only an hour or so of daylight was left .  he made dinner with the supplies they had brought  using a small  portable electric stove .   the group sat in a circle outside the front of the tent  eating from biodegradable dishes and utensils .  steve  remembering his camping experience  had been thinking ahead .  he was determined to show chad that he knew what he was doing  at least within his own area of responsibility .      this is going to take longer than you hoped  isn   t it .     steve asked hunter  between mouthfuls .      i believe so     said hunter .     if the stegoceras had been under control when mc   appeared  i could have given chase at that time .  once he was out of my sight and hearing  though  the moment was past .  from that point  a new plan was required .         hunter  we have water for only another twenty four hours .  our food will last a couple of days if we ration it  but we can stretch it indefinitely if we do some hunting and gathering here in the forest .         why not just go back home for more supplies .     chad asked .     now that we have a better idea of conditions here .         that presents a problem     said hunter .     i have to conduct the time travel myself .  the first law stops me from leaving any of you alone for long and i would not dare leave any humans here without me .  on the other hand  if we all go back and then return here  i would have to bring us back only seconds  or maybe minutes  after we left .         why .     steve asked .      otherwise  the additional component robots might spring up from microscopic to normal size while we   re gone and we would miss them  too .         so what   s the problem .     chad shrugged .     you can arrange for us to come back here right after we left  can   t you .         i do not dare cut it too close     said hunter .     all kinds of theoretical paradoxes are possible in time travel .  with a tight margin of error  it is possible that a mistake could bring us back a few seconds before we left  and we would meet ourselves .  the potential harm is immense  and the first law will not even let me consider that .         wait a minute     said jane .     you still have to weigh the possible damage we will do to this time period if we start consuming resources .         i have been making calculations about that     said hunter .     no action is totally without risk  but i think that some careful hunting and gathering of food and water for a day or two will offer the least amount of risk .      jane looked up from her dinner at him for a moment .     are you sure that our eating some fish or reptiles won   t set off a chain of events that totally changes our future .  that is what the chaos theory is about  isn   t it .         this is ridiculous     said steve impatiently .     i can   t believe that catching a couple of fish is going to end the world in our own time .  this kind of talk drives me crazy .     he got up and started gathering the empty dishes and cups .   behind him  hunter remained calm in the twilight .      i have to take this possibility seriously     hunter said .     however  i feel that consuming a small amount of food will do no more damage than staying here and stepping on the plants  climbing trees  or roping and riding dinosaurs .  i do believe that we should catch fish  however  as opposed to dinosaurs or mammalian ancestors .         what .     steve turned around from the portable kitchen equipment .     you mean that eating a fish instead of a little dinosaur the same size might actually make a difference sixty million years from now .         the chance of making a significant change is less     hunter said patiently .   steve noticed that even chad was listening attentively  apparently  this question wasn   t as stupid as some of the others he had asked .      fish will continue to be a crucial part of the food chain     said hunter .     and many species will continue to evolve .  however  they will not playas crucial a role as dinosaurs and mammals will .         since the dinosaurs all die out later anyway     said steve     who cares if we eat a few now .         i cannot know particulars     said hunter .     i am simply calculating the chances .  an individual fish that you catch and eat is less likely to be important than an individual dinosaur or mammalian ancestor .     he looked around at all of them .     if the most extreme form of chaos theory is true  then we have already made serious changes .         well .     jane smiled .     i wasn   t crazy about eating a lot of giant lizard meat anyway .      chad and steve laughed .      i will help steve carry water from the stream     said hunter .     we know the water has potentially dangerous microbes in it  so it will have to be boiled before you humans consume it in any form .  also  i will have to taste everything you eat from this environment first .  is that clearly understood and accepted .         sure .     chad nodded .      wait a minute     said steve .     i hate to be the only one asking all these questions  but you robots can survive all kinds of stuff that will kill humans .  just because some food doesn   t make you malfunction won   t mean it can   t poison us .         that   s a reasonable question     said jane .      my taste sensors have the ability to study the chemical composition of substances     said hunter .     i can judge whether consuming something will kill a human  and the likelihood of its making one ill .  otherwise  the first law would not allow me to let any of you eat an unknown food .  even certain kinds of fish can be poisonous .  naturally  even the food i judge to be edible will have to be fully cooked .         i   m convinced .     steve grinned .     you won   t catch me    complaining about this .         chad     said hunter .     how should we go about catching dinosaurs to ride .         well  a snare is out     said chad .     it might injure their legs and make them unfit for riding .  i suppose we   ll just have to lasso them somehow .         we have rope for that     said hunter .     what else .         we   ll need a corral     said steve .     to hold them  especially at first .         a holding pen     said hunter .     if i make one of wood  will it be strong enough .         i think it   s worth trying     said chad .     our prospective mounts will certainly be strong enough to smash through wooden rails if they want .         then what good is a corral .     hunter asked .     many animals won   t try to break out unless they   re really excited     said steve .     horses  for instance .  they can often kick out of a wooden stall or corral if they want .  but most of the time they don   t bother .         exactly     said chad .     i can   t tell you what level of excitement dinosaurs would have to reach before they try it .  i suppose each species of dinosaur might respond a little differently .         then i will try it     said hunter .     this forest has plenty of fallen trees and standing dead ones .  i can build a corral out of dead wood without killing any of the live trees .         we can all help     said steve .     not necessary .     hunter studied the forest immediately around them .   no one spoke .  at first  steve couldn   t figure out why hunter was looking around in the dark .  then he remembered that hunter had infrared night vision and could see images in the dark because of the difference in the amount of heat radiated by various objects .      the wood i need is close enough     hunter concluded .     while you three are sleeping  i   ll work on the corral .  i will not need to rest .  i have plenty of energy stored up .  during the day tomorrow  my body   s surface solar cells can replenish what i use tonight .         i   m worried about the distance mc   can cover     said jane .     since we saw him  he   s already had a number of hours to keep moving .  like you  he can move all night on stored energy and replenish it in the sunlight tomorrow .         you mean he can stay on the run night and day .     steve   s eyes widened .      that   s right     said jane .     he has an internal monitor like hunter   s  that tells him how much energy his body has in storage at any time .  as long as he lets the sunlight restore as much or more than he uses  he can keep moving .      hunter looked at jane somberly .     i suggest we split up into teams tomorrow .         will the first law allow that .     jane asked .      only if everyone agrees to my conditions .  here is what i propose .  during the night  i will build a small corral out of dead wood .  if i am not finished by sunrise  chad can help me finish it .         what .     steve looked at him in surprise .     building the corral sounds more like my kind of work .         definitely     said chad .     why not have steve do that with you .         hear me out     hunter said patiently .     after you and i have finished the corral  we will do some hunting .  you will help me search for struthiomimuses  or other suitable dinosaurs  and we may fish in the stream as well .         all right     said chad .     you want me to help find certain dinosaurs  i understand .  i still say steve ought to work on the corral with you .         i want steve to help jane track mc       said hunter .     i have a small transmitter for one of you to carry .  if you see any sign of trouble  you are to warn me instantly .  if possible  you will hurry back to camp immediately .  otherwise  you take the safest course of action you can until i can reach you .  is this understood .         of course     said jane .      sounds good to me     said steve .  he grinned at chad .  they both knew that hunter was sending steve with jane because he could handle the tracking and hiking better than chad .  hunter was simply too tactful to say so .      we   ll have to look for signs of erratic behavior or physical change in mc       said jane     in addition to his choice of evasive pattern and his general direction .  i doubt we can actually catch him without mounts  but i might find some behavior patterns that will help us anticipate his movements later .         excellent     said hunter .      something you might think about     said steve .     i can rig reins  bridles  and cinches out of rope .  but if you can think of a way to make saddles  stirrups that will hold our weight if we stand  and bits that a dinosaur can   t bite through  that will help .         i will consider it     said hunter .     may i ask if you are sleepy .      all three of them laughed .      yeah  actually     said steve .     i usually get up at dawn and go to bed shortly after dark .  i   m ready for bed .         not quite yet for me     said jane .     i   ll just sit up and enjoy the evening .         me too     said chad .     i   ll look through my belt computer some more .         then i will start work on the corral     said hunter  and he moved away into the darkness .   steve brushed his teeth and washed up using a pan of water .  then he went into the tent and took off his boots .  he slipped into one of the sleeping bags  where he relaxed for the first time since they had arrived in this time .  while he certainly didn   t like chad much  he was enjoying the feeling of adventure .  tomorrow should be a real challenge .     when steve woke up  jane and chad were still asleep in the tent .  he quietly crawled outside into the cool  humid forest air .  shafts of bright light filtered through the trees overhead .      good morning  steve     hunter said quietly .  he was about ten meters away from the tent .   steve turned and stopped in surprise .  hunter was standing by a sturdy corral constructed of many different kinds of wood .  it was unevenly shaped  the perimeter going around various trees and even enclosing a number of them .      do you think this will be adequate .     hunter asked .     it is fifteen meters across at the narrowest and twenty at the widest .  the gate is this bar in front .     he patted the gate with one hand .      it looks great     said steve .      i notched the logs to fit into each other     said hunter .     but the rails are not really very sturdy .  i do not have nails or the equipment to drill precise holes for dowels .  i thought about lashing the junctures with vines  but that would mean killing living vines  which i consider unwise .  dead vines  of course  are too brittle .         if a good sized dinosaur really wanted to kick down the rails  nails and dowels wouldn   t stop him     said steve .      let me show you what else i made     said hunter  moving to a pile of objects under a tree .      i don   t recognize this stuff     said steve .      our storage cases had steel support bands     said hunter .     i broke off some pieces .  this one  for instance  i twisted into a short length to use as a bit .  what do you think of it .         oh .  of course .     steve took the piece of oddly shaped metal .     it looks great for a horse .  we   ll have to find out if a dinosaur can bite through it or not .  what   s this other stuff .         several more bits  of course .     hunter pointed to different items in the pile .     those flat metal pieces should support your weight as stirrups .         what about these big wooden things .         those are rudimentary saddles     said hunter .     i accessed data i had about old english riding saddles and modeled these on that design .  they use less material than larger ones .         oh  yes .  i recognize the shape now .         i carved the top to fit human anatomy  of course .  you will find metal bands in the bottom for connecting a girth and cinch .  this design has no saddle horn .         very serviceable     said steve .     i   ll have to wait until we   ve caught a mount before i tie together a bridle or measure a girth .  otherwise  i can   t estimate the sizes .         understood .         how could you do all this work in one night .     steve looked at hunter in astonishment .   hunter grinned .     it helps not to get tired .  i do not need breaks and i did not slow down until the last hour before sunrise .  at that point my stored energy was running low  but i am already replenishing it now that the sun has come up .         we   re practically in the shade here  hunter .         it is good enough .         even through your clothes .     steve asked  grinning .      my face and hands are exposed all the time .     hunter shrugged .     i will be fine soon .  but you three will require breakfast .  how much longer are chad and jane likely to sleep .      steve grinned .     i think they   ve had enough sleep .  i   ll start breakfast .  maybe they would enjoy being awakened by a loud shout from a robot .         really .     hunter looked at the tent .     my experience with humans is still limited .  i will try it .              steve had breakfast ready by the time jane and chad were dressed and out of the tent .  soon enough  the team was ready to start the day .  steve wore a small day pack with food and water for them both .  it was enough for them to stay out of camp until sundown .      here is the transmitter     hunter said  handing jane a tiny metal bead .      it   s turned on all the time .     steve asked  studying the transmitter in jane   s fingers .      yes .  it has no clip  so i suggest you button it securely in one of your pockets     said hunter .      all right .     jane did so .      i will have my comlink fixed on your frequency     said hunter .     it emits beeps at regular intervals  so i can track your position at all times .  but i must trust you to call for help at the first sign of danger .         we will     said jane .     i   m ready .         have fun with the mighty forest hunter     chad said snidely to jane .   ignoring chad  steve nodded to hunter and led jane to the spot where mc   had last been seen .  he pointed to the faint footprints the robot had left .  jane nodded and followed him through the forest .      tracking is a lot easier out in the desert     said steve  crouching low to study the ground again .     the soft sand retains clearer footprints .         will we be able to track him through the forest .     jane asked .     even after he quits running .         yeah .  it   s just tougher .     steve fingered a broken twig .     an animal  say a dinosaur  could have done this .  but it   s a fairly fresh break  so it was probably made by mc   .     he reached up to a bigger branch and started to    break it .      stop it .  what are you doing .     she grabbed his wrist and pulled it away .      i   m blazing a trail  so we can find our way back .  we aren   t going to find any road signs out here .     he smiled and started to break the branch again .      you can   t .     she pulled his arm away .     remember the historical theory hunter talked about .         aw  come on .  you mean breaking a couple of branches is going to stunt human evolution forever .     he pointed in the direction mc   had taken .     what about him .  he   s snapping twigs every time he runs into a tree .  and he   s stomping on the grass   horrors .  so are we .     he laughed  looking at the soft  cool turf under his feet .      i know .     jane smiled patiently  but she kept her hold on his arm .     yes  he   s making small changes here .  and we are  too .  but it   s important   very important  steve   for us not to make any changes we can avoid .         but breaking these twigs doesn   t even kill the tree or the bush .         i agree that it doesn   t seem too serious     said jane .     but the theory says that all changes keep expanding  like ripples in a pool of water .  maybe these twigs are going to drop specific seeds whose descendants will mutate in a certain way  or feed a certain animal .  you see what i mean .         i guess .         in fact  i   m afraid it   s possible that the impact of our being here has already caused terrible harm to the time we come from .      steve shook his head .     none of us should have come back here  including mc governor .         i don   t blame you for not believing it     said jane  releasing his arm .     these calculations are very complex and the theory requires a lot of abstraction .  i   m sure you don   t have much experience with this kind of thing .         thanks a lot .     steve pulled fully away from her .     you highly educated geniuses can   t even find your way around in nature after you leave an artificial environment .  come on  follow the desert rat .      he hurried away  looking up at the trees for unusual shapes and markings .  as long as he was careful  he could keep track of their trail this way .  still  he wished they had landed in a desert  where his everyday habits from back home would have been more useful .     hunter  continuously monitoring the beep from jane   s transmitter  generally trusted steve   s ability in the wild and knew he could track mc   better than the other two humans .  also  hunter had teamed him with jane in the belief that she was more compatible with him than chad .  still  they might easily stumble across that velociraptor or another predator  and hunter was worried that he was skirting the edge of the first law by letting them go without him .   he kept all of these thoughts to himself  of course .  his experience with humans was limited  but he had been programmed with certain basic data on human psychology .  he knew that they needed to have confidence in his leadership .   as hunter reviewed these thoughts  he and chad carried the water containers to the stream that steve had found .  they filled them and lugged the water back to the camp .  hunter bore most of the weight  but chad insisted on doing his share .   hunter had calculated before they had left that the three humans would require four and a half liters of water a day .  as a humanoid robot  he needed a smaller amount  to replenish his simulated saliva and perspiration .  once the water had been stored in camp  he picked up some materials he could adapt for fishing .  he and chad returned to the stream  carrying their lassos .   the stream was only about a meter wide here  occasionally broadening into pools about twice that size .  hunter judged the average depth at one and a half meters  the water ran fast enough to be fairly clear .  the heavy canopy of trees arched over it and the roots of thick trunks were exposed at intervals along the bank .      my hearing is turned up     said hunter .     it tells me that all kinds of animals are nearby in the forest .  have you seen any of them .         only glimpses     said chad .     i haven   t had a good look at them .  can you tell from the sound if any of them are a good riding size .         many of them are     said hunter .     my concern under the first and third laws is that i cannot tell which ones are predators waiting for a kill and which ones are herbivores hiding from us in case we are the predators .         in a sense we are     said chad  grinning .     we   re just not going to eat the ones we catch .         true .     hunter nodded  not sure why chad thought his comment was amusing .     i cannot see them well enough to pick out different species  either .  as a paleontologist  what do you suggest as a course of action .      chad did not answer right away .  he looked up and down the stream and around the forest .     you know  the animals here don   t have the ingrained fear of humans that wild animals in our own time have .  they   re being cautious around us  but i think if we sit down quietly  maybe some of them will come into sight for a drink of water .         ah .  a change in our approach sounds very good .  suppose we fish in the stream and see what happens around us .         fine .         here .  this thread is quite strong .  i pulled it out of the seam of one of the packs .  that little buckle is also from the pack and will act as a sinker .  you know how to use these .         yes     said chad .     i   ve read about fishing .  what was this hook made from .         a latch on one of the storage cases .  i twisted it into that shape .         i see .     chad sat down on a rock near the edge of the water and carefully tied the gear together .     say  what do i use for bait .         oh  yes .     hunter looked around in the air for a moment .  he spotted a couple of insects fluttering around a small bush .  slowly  he stepped toward them  raising his hand .  then  using his highly precise eye hand coordination  he snatched one out of the air .      wow .     chad stared at him in shock .      the local fish eat these all the time     said hunter  as he tied the insect to the line just above the hook .     i judge that since we are taking the risk of fishing anyway  this is the best bait to use .  if we use something we brought with us  and it affects the water or is taken by a fish that gets away  we do not know what consequence may result .         i see     said chad  gently lowering his line into the water with his hands .      i will bring you a dead branch you can use for a pole     said hunter .      thanks .      hunter moved to a half fallen dead tree .  as he grasped a meter long branch and gently ripped it from the trunk  he questioned his wisdom in bringing the human team with him .  if he had come to this time period alone  he could simply be chasing down mc   this minute .   of course  he reminded himself  if a direct physical pursuit had failed for some reason  he would still have wanted jane   s expert understanding of robotics and chad   s knowledge of dinosaurs .  so that line of consideration merely took him in a circle .  returning the humans to their own time and coming back here alone would be no solution either .   hunter returned to chad  handing him the branch without a word .  chad tied the line to end of the branch carefully  then grinned up at hunter .     now i just wait .  did you bring fishing materials for yourself too .         no need  i believe     said hunter .     i   ll find out .     he picked his way downstream several meters and then crouched on the bank .  for a moment  he remained absolutely motionless except for his eyes as he watched dark shapes slipping lazily in the water below him .   chad said nothing  watching him .   once hunter had studied the swimming motion and reflexes of the fish below him  he slowly moved his hand into the water and held it still .  after a moment of warily darting away  the fish returned to their former movements .  then hunter quickly reached down and grabbed one by the gills .  in the same moment  he stood up  raising the wriggling fish out of the water and over the bank .  it was big enough to eat .      what do you think .         wow     chad said again .     for most of the day  steve tracked mc   steadily through the forest .  in some areas the tracks were very clear .  sometimes he had to stop and look closely .  they ate lunch at midday and plodded on .   late in the afternoon  steve stopped and turned to jane .     i don   t know that we   re accomplishing anything .  have you seen anything important .         we   ve been zigzagging and circling all day  haven   t we .     jane asked .      yeah  that   s right .         mc   isn   t just running straight away  is he .  for distance  i mean .         well       steve stopped  considering .     i guess he isn   t .  if we were chasing him with hounds  i   d say he was doubling back and crossing his own path to confuse the scent .  but he must know that we didn   t bring any hounds .  so i   m not sure why he   s doing this .         i suppose he might access stored data about creating evasive patterns under certain conditions .  the one truth about studying a robot   s behavior is that it will be absolutely logical according to his own interpretation of his data and the three laws .      steve nodded .      can you tell how old the track is .         no .  if we were talking about a difference of a day or so  i might be able to .  but we know he   s been at normal size less than a day .  i can   t judge the age of these tracks in hours .     he shrugged .      i see .         well  he   s still running .     steve pointed to the robot   s footprints at their feet .     he   s humaniform  so he runs with essentially the same motion as a human .  see how the front of the footstep is deeper than the rest of it .         yes .  the heel mark hardly shows at all .         his weight is all forward  meaning he   s running  and the tracks we   ve seen show that he   s been running most of time .  he seems to stop sometimes  maybe to get his bearings or to avoid a predatory dinosaur .  still  he   s moving much faster than we are .  we   ll never catch him without those mounts .         well  didn   t i say we shouldn   t expect to .  we came out here today to see what his habits are  that   s all .         yeah  yeah  i remember     steve said wearily .     but haven   t you seen anything yet .         well  i see that he   s meandering all over the place .  i just don   t know what it means yet .         why not .  you   re the robotics expert  aren   t you .     steve grinned  wiping sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his worksuit .     isn   t this why hunter brought along a sheltered  pampered intellectual .      jane   s face tightened .     it   s a sure thing you can   t figure out what he   s doing .         no one expects me to .  in fact       steve stopped suddenly  looking at something ahead of them in the woods .  he thought he saw two very human looking eyes peering at him through the heavy foliage .   jane looked too .   suddenly mc   straightened up and slipped away through the underbrush .      stop .     jane yelled .     i order you to stop .  mc     mojave center component robot .  you have to stop .         come on .     steve started after him  shoving through some branches .      stop .     jane yelled again  hurrying after him .   steve had to protect his eyes from the leaves and branches he plunged into  pushing them aside with both hands  in only a few steps  however  he realized that the robot was out of sight again .  the footsteps were as clear as before  but mc   was running again .  they couldn   t possibly catch him .   jane collided with steve from behind .      take it easy     said steve .     he   s gone .      she nodded  panting .     he still must have his hearing turned off  as i said yesterday .  the second law wouldn   t have let him run away from me otherwise .         he was watching us     said steve .     he could be watching us right now .         he can   t hear us  though .  he wouldn   t dare risk it .     jane looked around  as if she could find him again .     i think that answers our question  though .         huh .  which one .         about his route .  he isn   t just trying to get away from us .  i think his plan is to stay out of our control  but to keep an eye on us .         you mean he   s been watching us all day long .         i think so .         why didn   t we see him before .  why now .         chance  maybe     said jane .     or maybe he got a little careless after escaping our notice all day long .         yeah  maybe .     steve grinned .     if we hadn   t followed him  he wouldn   t have gone anywhere .  we could have saved ourselves a day long hike .         maybe so .     she smiled .   he looked up at the sun through the trees .     well  that discovery is worth something .  but we   re running out of daylight .  time to head back to camp while i can still remember the landmarks .        from the r .  hunter files  the now famous prototype of the highly successful    hunter    class robot first demonstrated his remarkable abilities in the mohave center governor case .  the following images are

during his first ten minutes of effort .  chad had taken his line out of the water  wryly observing that he was wasting his time .  after that  the two of them had spent the afternoon sitting quietly  watching for dinosaurs .   when hunter heard footsteps nearby  he quietly told chad where to look .  as they waited  they began to glimpse dinosaurs of all kinds up and down the stream  coming to the water to drink .  the first one hunter saw clearly was nearly five meters tall .  it was a two legged duck billed creature  reaching up to munch on leaves as it worked its way toward the water .   chad unclipped his belt computer  quickly punching in a description .     small  bony crest on top of its head     he muttered .     duckbill  small hump on its nose .      as hunter watched  the dinosaur moved to the water and bent down low to drink .  its long tall flipped up slightly in the back to help it keep its balance .  another one  slightly shorter  appeared behind it .      brachylophosaurus     said chad quietly .     both of them .  from the body type  i would say they aren   t much good for riding .  they run leaning forward  but stand up high when they reach for food .  no matter how we arranged the saddles  we   d fallout when they shift up and down .      hunter nodded .     look downstream  on the opposite bank .      a low  four legged dinosaur had just slipped from the underbrush to drink from the stream .  its pear shaped head was fairly small  ending in a sharp beak .  however  its body looked huge  most of it was still hidden by the forest cover .  what hunter could see was covered with rows of thick  bony plates .  long spikes protected its sides and shoulders .      panoplosaurus     chad whispered  consulting his belt computer again .     up to five and a half meters long  between two and three tons in weight .             from the length of its legs  i would say it couldn   t move fast enough to catch mc       hunter observed .      i wouldn   t want to sit on one  anyway     said chad  with a grin .   as the day wore on  the majority of dinosaurs that came to the water were varieties of hadrosaurs  such as the brachylophosaurus  according to chad .  he eagerly identified all the different species  which varied in size and color .  they had duckbills and crests of different shapes on top of their heads .  the legs of the hadrosaurs were strong and heavy  ending in three toed  hooved feet .  their forelimbs were medium sized  with webbed  four fingered hands .  chad quickly entered all the new details that he could see .      they are remarkably unconcerned with our presence     said hunter .     my information on wild animals tells me that they are usually afraid of humans .         the remaining wild animals in our own time are descended from very wary  suspicious ancestors who managed to avoid being hunted and fished by humans for many generations     said chad  looking around for more dinosaurs .      you think their behavior has changed through a form of selection  then .         well  these dinosaurs don   t have any particular fear of us because humans have never existed around them before .  they don   t even know what to think of us .  i guess as long as we sit quietly  the herbivores will just keep their distance and get their drink of water .         perhaps so .         none of the hadrosaurs are good for riding     chad said .     we need another type .         i think i hear a new pattern of footsteps     said hunter  suddenly lowering his voice .     closer to that of the stegoceras  but of a larger beast .  look upstream  on this side .      they remained silent for a moment .  a dinosaur   s dark green head appeared through the leaves .  it moved slowly  looking around .  then it leaned down to drink from the stream .      another velociraptor .     hunter whispered .   chad shook his head .     no  it   s just very similar in appearance .  that   s the struthiomimus we   ve been looking for .         wait here .     hunter took his lasso from his shoulder .     i can move more quietly  i think .  i will circle behind him and lasso him .  be ready to jump up and run to me .  we will need both loops on him .      chad nodded .   hunter shifted into a very detailed sensory mode  in which he used his eyesight to analyze the plants and soil on the ground and the branches in front of him .  with his instant reflexes  he judged exactly where to place his feet and how to move through the branches and leaves with maximum stealth .  he only had to walk slightly more slowly than usual to do this .  a human would have had to slow down considerably .   the struthiomimus drank from the water  then lifted its head on its very long neck to listen .  hunter stopped .  when it lowered its head to drink again  he moved forward .   hunter came up behind it .  the struthiomimus was a two legged dinosaur about two meters tall .  its neck represented almost half its total height .  hunter adjusted the loop on his lasso and waited .   the biggest problem in throwing the lasso was not just missing the dinosaur  but having tree branches get in the way .  hunter carefully studied the small clear area through which he could make his toss .  he was ready by the time the struthiomimus finally turned away from the stream  back toward him .   hunter judged the precise moment to throw his loop and tossed it with his finest control .  as the struthiomimus turned to look at the movement of the rope  the loop fell over its head and all the way down its neck .  the dinosaur pulled back  turning to run .      now .     hunter shouted  flinging the free end of his rope around a tree .  he wound it around the big tree trunk once  just before the fleeing dinosaur pulled the rope taut .  then hunter hung on to the rope  using the tree trunk as a brace .      i   m coming .     chad ran crashing through the underbrush  swinging his lasso .      this way     hunter called .     hold this rope and give me your lasso .         i   ll do it .     chad dodged around a couple of trees and moved toward the struthiomimus  which was trampling the bushes and crashing against the trees in an effort to pull away .      stop .     hunter screamed frantically .     it   s too dangerous .         it   s okay .  he   s already roped .     chad slowed down  approaching the raging dinosaur .   hunter couldn   t allow chad to go any closer .  impelled by the first law  hunter quickly tied his rope into a knot and ran after chad .     chad  you must stop .      the struthiomimus was straining its narrow neck against the rope  too panicked to pay any attention to chad .  its heavy body was snapping young trees in half and its feet were flattening the underbrush .  chad  showing more courage than common sense  stood his ground and reared back to throw his lasso .   hunter saw that chad was close enough to be trampled if the terrified dinosaur suddenly shifted in his direction .  to move him as fast as possible  hunter flung himself forward in a flying tackle carefully gauged to bring chad down without hurting him by the impact .  he grabbed chad around the waist  then turned so that as they hit the ground  hunter   s body cushioned chad   s .      stay there     hunter ordered  leaping up and snatching away the rope .     if you do not keep yourself safe  i will have to cut it free so it cannot hurt you .      chad just nodded .   hunter moved up on the dinosaur quickly .  this time  with its movements confined  lassoing it was even easier .  hunter tied the second rope securely to another tree and returned to the first rope to tie it more securely .  the struthiomimus pulled against the ropes  but hunter could see that they would hold .      now what do we do .     chad had stood up now  but dutifully remained where hunter had told him to stay .      when he calms down  we have to move him to the corral     said hunter .     how long do you think that will take .         what do i think .     chad shook his head .     nothing in the fossil record can predict his emotional state .  all we can do is wait and see what he does .         all right .     hunter looked through the trees in the direction of the camp .     we are not strong enough to pull him by hand in any direction he does not want to go .         then how do we make him come with us .         when he is calm  i will untie one rope at a time .  while he is braced by the other rope  we will pull him or coax him with food to follow us .  then we will retie the lead rope to a tree trunk and do the same with the other one .  the tree trunks are close enough for us to move him that way .         that could take a long time .      hunter looked up at the sun .     we have several hours of daylight .        steve and jane returned to camp first .  when the setting sun turned red  steve began preparing dinner .  even when it was ready  hunter and chad still had not returned .      maybe hunter should have given us a receiver     said jane .     so we could keep tabs on him  too .      steve glanced over at her .  she smiled impishly .  he wasn   t sure if she was serious or not .  ever since they had bickered a little out on the trail  he had been uncomfortable with her  but she seemed to have forgotten about it .      steve .  jane .     hunter   s voice came out of the darkening forest  not far away .      yeah .     steve shouted back .      open the corral .      steve and jane glanced at each other  then hurried toward the gate .  they opened it .  then  out of the shadows  hunter came into sight  pulling a taut rope .      ready  chad .     hunter called .     untie your rope and hold it this time .  we have to bring him into the corral .     he turned to steve .     help chad on his rope .      steve and jane jogged forward .  they could hear something large breaking branches as it struggled .  it was still invisible in the darkness .      steve .  over here     said chad .   steve looked around and saw him only a few steps away .  as chad loosened his rope from a tree  steve grabbed it .  so did jane .  then  for the first time  steve saw the long neck and narrow head of the dinosaur  rising up high overhead .      just pull him     said chad .     he   s more docile now .  he fought hard at first  but he   s getting tired  i think .         okay .      hunter pulled the hardest .  little by little  the dinosaur stepped forward  forced to move by the tautness of the two ropes around its neck .  in a few moments hunter and the three humans had all backed into the corral .  the dinosaur  looking around in jerky  sudden movements  at last stepped inside the corral gate .   hunter quickly lashed his rope to one of the trees inside the corral .  then  circling safely around the dinosaur  he took the rope from chad .     climb over the rails     he said .     stay away from the struthiomimus .      steve dropped the rope and moved toward the fence .  he clambered over the rails first and turned .  jane leaned down to brace herself on the arm he offered .  chad climbed over slowly at another part of the fence .   in the corral hunter held the rope firmly as he backed to the fence .  then he let go of it and carefully watched the dinosaur .  the struthiomimus  feeling the release of tension  suddenly pranced sideways .  at the same time  hunter dodged behind it and moved to the other rope .  he untied it and then ran to the nearest part of the fence  where he jumped over .   the dinosaur began to run around the corral  among the trees .      get away .     hunter yelled at the humans  seeing where they were .     away from the fence .  he might break out .      steve backed off  but hunter was frantically running toward them .      now .  move .     hunter spread his arms wide  slowing down abruptly .  he herded the three humans away from the fence  back toward the camp .     stay behind me .      as they watched  the struthiomimus ran among the trees  shaking its head .  for a moment it slipped out of sight in the dark  but reappeared  walking more slowly .  so far it was still in the corral .      it   s really pretty calm for a wild animal in captivity     said steve .      it fought hard at first     said hunter .     it quickly tired itself out pulling against the trees we used as braces .  it may still break out sometime tonight .         what do we do now .     jane asked .      dinner   s ready     said steve .     let   s give our captive time to adjust .         yes     said hunter .     i will listen carefully to the dinosaur   s footsteps .  if it becomes agitated  i will have to tend to it .         i   m hungry enough     said chad .   they sat down to eat facing the corral .  by that time the forest was almost completely dark  but steve moved one of the portable lights to the edge of the fence and angled it inside .  they could see the dinosaur pacing anxiously among the trees  in and out of the light .      looks good so far     said steve  as he collected the empty dishes .  he began cleaning the fish that hunter had brought back  intending to use them in a future meal .      he   s eating leaves     said jane .     look .         that   s a good sign     said chad .     he   s not as upset as he was .  maybe he won   t break out .         you three go to bed     said hunter .     i will have to watch him all night .  i cannot take the risk that he might break out and trample the tent .         what if he does escape .     steve asked .     what can you actually do about it .         i will retrieve the ropes now .  if i anticipate that he will break out  i can tie him to a tree again .         that   s good enough for me     said jane .           in the early light  steve again woke up first .  he hurried out right away to take a look at the dinosaur .     hey  hunter .  is it still here .         good morning  steve     hunter called from the corral .     over this way .      steve ran to the gate  then stopped in surprise .  hunter  riding on the back of the struthiomimus with a saddle and bridle  guided his mount from the trees into full view .  he rode up to the gate as steve stared .      you can ride it already .     steve gazed at the calm struthiomimus .     it really looks like an ostrich  doesn   t it .         yes  it does     said chad  coming up behind steve .     it   s no accident  either .  walking birds in our own time  such as ostriches and emus  are among the closest living relatives of dinosaurs .         really .  are they descendants of dinosaurs like this one .     steve asked .      the answer to that is still being debated     said chad .     some experts say they are .  others feel that birds are descended from an ancestor common to the dinosaurs .  that would make them descendants of  you might say  dinosaurs    cousins .      steve nodded  impressed with chad   s knowledge .  that was the most civil conversation he and chad had yet exchanged .  he didn   t want to ruin it  so he said nothing else .   hunter had used a small bit to go into the mouth of his mount and had tied a small bridle together out of rope .  the struthiomimus   s head was higher than hunter   s  and hunter had to guide him with long reins .  he sat on the small makeshift saddle  which was tightly cinched around the creature   s body .      how did you tame him so soon .     chad asked .      after he calmed down  he became very responsive to me     said hunter .     i fed him with certain leaves and he let me get close .  since steve needed his sleep  i spent a couple of hours making the saddle and bridle .         wait a minute .  you mean he just let you ride him .     steve asked doubtfully .      no  not exactly .  he did not like the saddle or bridle much at all .  i had to tie him up again to put them on and he fought them for another couple of hours after i untied him .         he got used to them pretty fast     said chad .     maybe he   s smarter than the experts thought .         i judge him to be somewhat less intelligent than a horse     said hunter .      how long have you been riding him .     steve asked .      about three hours     said hunter .     the first time  i had to sneak up on him and jump on .  the third law allowed this  because falling from this height is not too serious .  i can control my falls .         and now he   s trained enough to ride     said chad .     that   s pretty good work .         at least for the moment     said hunter .     he may resist again if i get off .         he   s day broke     said steve .      what .     hunter asked .      a horse that has to be broken to ride every day is called    day broke .             i see .  yes  i think that is what he is     said hunter .     however  to keep him under control  i should stay mounted on him through the day unless a more pressing concern develops .         okay     said steve .     i   ll get breakfast going right away .  but then what do we do .         i want you to make another saddle for chad     said hunter .     one we can strap on behind mine up here .  he will ride double with me .  also another bridle that he will use tomorrow if all goes well .  now that we have one mount to ride  we should be able to run down another struthiomimus fairly easily .         hey  that   s right     said chad .     no more sitting around waiting .  and we won   t have to drag it on foot with ropes either .         what about steve and me .     jane asked  joining them at the corral .      in the excitement last night  i never asked you for a debriefing     said hunter .     what did you find .         mc     s trail is all over the place     said jane .     he   s roaming  not just running .  steve did a great job of tracking him .         can you infer his motives .         well  maybe .  i   ve been thinking about it .  since he   s not trying to put simple distance between himself and us  two general possibilities present themselves .  one is that he has malfunctioned in some way .  a physical malfunction may have impaired his ability to judge what he is doing and where he is going .         he has no trouble running     said steve .     he can move fast .  we even glimpsed him once  watching us .         that brings me to the second possibility     said jane .     he may have some reason for staying close and watching us  even though that means greater risk for him .         i would like you to continue tracking him today     said hunter .     i hope that tomorrow we will have two mounts on which to follow him  so tomorrow morning we will want to pick up his trail in the most recent spot you can give us .      when breakfast was finished  steve provisioned a day pack for chad  cooking some of the fish and making sandwiches .  then he prepared the new saddle and bridle .  soon everyone was ready .   steve handed chad his pack and carried the saddle inside the corral .  while hunter held his mount steady  steve  tingling with excitement  swung the new saddle up onto the back of the struthiomimus .  he was ready to jump aside and run for the corral fence at the first sudden movement .   hunter held the dinosaur firmly in place .  without incident  steve cinched the saddle tight and waved to chad  who was waiting at the gate .  then chad  carrying the bridle  reluctantly came forward .  steve gave him a leg up into the saddle .      wow     chad said quietly  settling into the saddle .     i   m actually riding a dinosaur .         put your arms around me and hang on     said hunter .     its gait is reliable  since it walks on only two legs .  but it moves its head up and down on that long neck to eat and to look around .  the body angle shifts a little at the same time .         right     said chad  looking up at the struthiomimus   s head with a new interest .   steve ran to open the gate .  steve and jane watched as the others rode out of the corral .  then  with a hesitant but controlled walk  hunter and chad   s mount carried them into the forest .      so far  so good     said steve .      they   ll be fine     said jane .     you know hunter can   t let either one of them get hurt if he can help it .         yeah  i know     said steve .     i just hope he knows what he   s doing .      steve prepared their day pack and they started out again on foot .  he followed his landmarks back to their terminal point of the day before .  they picked up the trail again  still wandering through the dense forest on a curving  crisscrossing route .   after only an hour or so  steve stopped for a moment .     this is silly .  he   s not going anywhere .  neither are we .  we were in this spot twice yesterday and now today .      jane looked down at the tracks  which were thick here .     is he slowing down .  are those walking tracks instead of running tracks .         yeah .     steve grinned at her .     you   re learning .         what i said yesterday goes double today .  he really isn   t trying to escape at all .         no  i   d have to agree with you .     steve studied the footprints around them .     if he wanted to lose us  he could be wading up or down that stream .  then he wouldn   t leave any trail at all .  or he might find some rocky ground somewhere .         yesterday  i thought he was just circling back to watch us .  but he   s not just doing that  either  or he would leave even less of a trail  don   t you think .         that would make sense     said steve .     but i   m just here to track our quarry through the forest .  you   re the expert on how robots think .         i guess we   ll just have to keep following him     said jane .     but i wish i knew why he was hanging around like this .         this way     said steve .     hunter rode for the first hour or so  giving most of his attention to his mount .  the first law had him deeply concerned about letting chad ride with him .  finally  however  hunter concluded that the dinosaur was truly under enough control for them to ride safely .      i   d like to name it    strut         said chad happily  over his shoulder .      a mount should have a name .  besides     struthiomimus    is just too long a word to say all the time .         strut     said hunter .     very well .         i thought that was kind of funny .  don   t you think that   s a good name .         short  distinctive  and a mnemonic for the species     said hunter .     yes  it is an appropriate name .         and it walks upright .         yes .         you don   t have much sense of humor  do you .      hunter quickly searched his data on the subject .  he recalled that humor was important to humans .  however  with the urgency of finding mc governor or his components  hunter had never taken the time to consider the subject .      i apologize     said hunter .      no need .     chad laughed .     never mind .      puzzled  hunter simply nodded .   throughout midday  hunter guided their mount quietly through the forest  looking for another struthiomimus .  they could not find one .  hunter stopped at several places along the stream  where they waited again for dinosaurs to come to drink .  whenever a new species appeared  chad quickly looked up its name and traits  but they did not see a specimen they could ride .  so hunter moved on .   behind him  chad ate his lunch as they rode .  when he had finished  hunter passed him the reins so that he could learn to ride strut on his own .  hunter remained in the forward saddle  but that seemed to make no difference .  chad guided their mount without a problem .      i   ve been looking in my belt computer for more species that might be good prospects     said chad .     maybe the struthiomimus just isn   t common in this neighborhood right now .         what data were you checking .         only a few traits .     chad relaxed the reins so that their mount could crane its long neck forward to browse on some leaves .     cranial capacity  for learning ability .  size and strength of leg bones  to make sure they can carry us .  the structure of the pelvis and spine of bipedal dinosaurs  to judge whether or not they are likely to bend far forward and then straighten up suddenly again  throwing us .         what have you found .         well  so far  not much        hunter held up his hand for silence .  his hearing had just detected movement ahead .  the four footsteps he heard sounded like those of something very heavy .  at the same time  he heard the faint swishing and snapping of twigs   many of them at once  suggesting massive size to match the great weight of the creature .   hunter waved his hand forward .   chad urged the struthiomimus to walk .  at first it moved casually enough  but then it suddenly stopped and turned its head in the direction of the animal hunter had heard .  chad had to kick its body to urge it forward again .   then hunter got his first glimpses of the big dinosaur   s body  though its head was still out of sight .  it was roughly seven meters long and the curve of its back was nearly three meters from the ground .  from the sound of its patient footsteps  he judged its weight at over four tons .   behind hunter  chad drew in his breath sharply .  hunter felt a tap on his left shoulder .  he looked and saw the creature raise its head .   the dinosaur had a short  thick nose horn and two long brow horns about a hundred centimeters long  curving forward .  its beak was turtlelike in shape .  a smooth  solid frill covered the back and sides of its neck .      a triceratops     chad whispered .      is it ridable .     hunter asked softly .      i   m not sure .  it   s an herbivore and it   s fourlegged   and much too heavy to rear up .         obviously strong enough     said hunter .     it does not look as though it can run fast .         not for very long  probably     said chad .     but if you can ride it  you can probably chase mc   .  the real problem is that they were   are  that is  aggressive .         how aggressive .         no one really knows .  it might be like trying to tame and ride a rhinoceros .      hunter reviewed his data .     i do not know much about those  either .  is that difficult .         uh   the third law probably wouldn   t allow it .         i see .     hunter adjusted the coil of rope on his shoulder as he watched the triceratops calmly eating the leaves from a large  full bush .     chad  can you ride strut alone now .         alone .  i suppose so .         i think you will be safe enough .  also  i believe we have left mc   alone too long .  we must get on with our pursuit under the general first law imperative .  that requires that i take a chance under the third law .     hunter suddenly reached up to a strong overhead branch and swung out of the saddle .   chad gasped in surprise  but kept strut reined .   hunter pulled himself up into the tree .     be careful     he whispered .     stay close if you can  but ride back to camp if you have to .  you know the way .         yeah .  the stream is directly behind us and i can find the camp from there .      hunter nodded .  then  taking great care to move quietly and safely  he climbed higher into the tree .  when he could  he moved to a branch on a nearby tree  closer to the triceratops .  he was going to climb right above it  where a certain branch angled over its frill .   hunter reached that branch and swung out below it over the big dinosaur  moving forward hand over hand .  with each arm movement  his weight shook the branch  rattling the leaves .  the triceratops twitched its ears curiously but otherwise did not move from the bush it was eating .  assessing its massive build and heavily armed head and neck  hunter judged that it was simply not concerned with anything small enough to climb trees .   when hunter was hanging directly over the back of the dinosaur   s frill  he let go with his right hand and slipped the coil of rope down his arm .  still hanging by his left hand  he shook the loop loose and tossed it downward  toward the right brow horn of the triceratops .  a second later  he dropped onto the creature   s back .   the shock of hunter   s weight landing on the triceratops made it jerk in surprise .  then it lumbered forward  crashing through bushes and flattening some of the smaller trees .  hunter leaned forward and grabbed the left brow horn in his free hand  bracing his right hand with the taut rope .  he gripped the dinosaur   s broad body with his legs as hard as he could and kept his head low as he rode the triceratops through the forest .           steve and jane returned to the camp first .  as they walked out of the forest into the clearing  however  steve stopped in alarm .  the tent had collapsed .  the sleeping bags were lying askew out on the ground and containers of food and equipment were spread around  some of their contents spilled out .      what happened .     jane asked  startled .      careful     said steve quietly .     maybe the scent of the food attracted some dinosaurs .         i don   t see any .  they must have gone .         not all dinosaurs are real big .  some smaller ones might still be roaming around .  let   s go slowly .         all right .      steve moved up first  warily circling the tent and scattered belongings .  jane followed him .  finally  satisfied that the intruder or intruders had gone  he relaxed .      tell me     said steve  plodding wearily back to the tent and slipping the day pack to the ground .     did we do anything today that was different from yesterday .     he started gathering up containers and checking the contents .      not much  i admit     said jane .     we were able to mark the latest tracks of mc    though .         what for .  so we can do the same thing tomorrow .  this is pointless .      jane sighed  nodding agreement .  she picked up some of the equipment too .     it only means something if we start chasing him for real .      they both turned as chad rode into view .  the front saddle was empty .  he glanced around the camp .      what a mess .  is hunter back .         no     said jane .     what happened to him .         he jumped on a triceratops     said chad .     i was so surprised  i never had a chance to try to talk him out of it .         really .     steve grinned  amazed .     even i know what that is .  wow .         the next thing i knew  it ran off with him .  that was hours ago .  i followed him for a while  that triceratops left a trail smashing through the forest that nobody could miss .  but then i thought maybe hunter had gotten off at some point and would just walk back to camp .         he hasn   t been here     said steve .     unless you think the triceratops trampled everything here .      chad rode closer .     what kind of tracks have you found .         i haven   t looked yet .     steve looked down at the ground .  in most places  footsteps had left only dull impressions in the heavy sod  revealing very little .  in a muddy spot  however  he saw a heel print .      that   s no dinosaur     said jane  joining him .     and it   s too small to be hunter   s .         it must be mc       said steve .  he walked quickly back to the tent and the spilled containers .     definitely .  some of these lines were actually untied  not just broken or pulled down .  and no dinosaur could have unlatched these containers .  our salt and flour were opened and poured onto the ground  but nothing is actually broken .         i   m going to dismount in the corral     said chad .     be right back .     he turned and rode away quickly .      now i have the answer to the question that was bothering me     said jane .      which one .         why mc   was hanging around  evading us but never really running away .         what .  you think he just wanted to trash our camp .     steve bent down to pick up a few more items and set them upright .     he could have done it yesterday  but he didn   t .         it   s more than that  steve .  he wants to disrupt our search .  yesterday he probably studied our habits to figure out how he would do it .         so he   s trying to chase us away .         to discourage us  at least .  he has an insurmountable problem  however .  the first law won   t let him do anything even potentially harmful to us humans  such as poisoning our food and water  or sabotaging our equipment .         say  that   s right .  but he dumped some food out onto the ground .         he knows we won   t eat it if we can see it   s not safe anymore .  and i bet he left us enough so that we won   t starve .  he can   t take that chance  either .      steve glanced into a few more containers .     yeah  he did .  we   re still okay .         he can   t even set traps for us or take our supplies away .  he has to leave us everything we need to remain safe .     jane smiled wryly .     ina way  i feel sorry for him .  he   s trying to do the impossible .         yeah  i see .     steve squinted toward the reddening sunlight filtering through the trees .     it   s too late in the day to track him now .  at least tomorrow we can start following him from right here .         what a mess     said chad  joining them from the corral .  he winced as he walked .     riding that struthiomimus is fun  but i   m saddle sore .      jane laughed .     but you   re the first human ever to ride a living dinosaur .  for a paleontologist  that   s quite a distinction  isn   t it .         yeah .  i love that part .     he grinned  then looked past her toward the trees .     hey  there   s hunter now .         hunter .     jane called .      you okay .     steve asked .      yes  yes .     he hiked briskly toward them .     i am fine  no damage .         what happened  hunter .     chad asked .     i followed you for most of the day  or at least i followed the triceratops .  then at sundown i figured i   d better get back to camp .         i am glad you did     said hunter .     it means i can trust you to take care of yourself under my first law responsibilities .  as for myself  i rode the triceratops for quite a long time .  it does not buck or roll over on its back  so i just hung on .         then what happened .     steve asked .      it was a stalemate .     hunter shrugged .     i was not strong enough to steer it by pulling on the brow horns and it could not get me off by charging around through the trees  as long as i stayed low .  finally i decided that i just was not accomplishing anything and jumped off .     he studied the camp behind them .     did this happen while everyone was gone .         yes  we had a visitor     said jane .      so i see     said hunter .     what happened .         mc       said steve .     he left his tracks .      hunter studied the damage .     not too serious  i see .  but i think the delay in our direct pursuit of him has lasted long enough .  i will have to alter my priorities after all .  tomorrow morning i will chase him on foot alone .         you and i can ride after him     said chad .     if you   re willing to leave all three of us on our own  then you can leave them and take me again .         i will be more efficient alone     said hunter .     and i will feel less pressure under the first law if you three humans are together .         wait a minute     said chad .     why .         then only one danger  if any  is likely to approach you .  when you divide up  the chance of your encountering harm increases .  since i have only the one transmitter to warn me of danger to you  i must ask all three of you to wait here in camp for me tomorrow .  be ready to call me through the transmitter at the slightest hint of possible harm .         all right     said jane .     if this arrangement will help you track down mc   and grab him  then we can all go home sooner this way .         i could use a break from all this hiking around for no particular reason     said steve .     but right now i want to get dinner going .         the rest of us will help put the camp back into shape     said hunter .      good idea     said jane .   chad hesitated  but when hunter and jane began raising the tent  he joined the manual labor .  steve grinned to himself  but said nothing .  he made dinner with more of the fish that hunter had caught .     as the humans ate and relaxed afterward  hunter finished putting the camp back into shape .  he was now eager to get on the trail of mc   himself  feeling that delaying to capture mounts might have been a mistake .  however  he knew he could not set out tonight .   the day   s effort to ride the triceratops had used up too much of his energy .  he did not have enough stored up to remain fully active until sunrise  when the light could replenish it .  if he chased mc   during the night until his energy ran out  then stopped to wait for dawn  he would have none to use in the event of a first law emergency at the camp .  besides  while the humans slept  they could be surprised by some problem that would prevent them from calling him on the transmitter .   hunter sat down outside the tent .  he stayed motionless in order to store his remaining energy  but kept his mind alert and all his sensors active to detect the sounds  sights  smells  and vibrations that would mean another visitor .  if either mc   or any animal approached  he would still have enough energy to protect the humans .   in the morning  as soon as hunter heard steve stir in the tent  he returned to full activity .  the dawn light was speckling the camp through the trees overhead .  hunter inspected the line of tracks that led away from camp .      hi  hunter     said steve  as he came out of the tent .     you about ready to go .         yes .  before i left  i wanted to make sure that at least one of you was awake to call me on the transmitter in the event of trouble .         well  here i am .         yes .  there you are .     hunter hesitated  not sure if this was a form of farewell or not .  when steve began inspecting the breakfast materials  hunter decided that it was .  he turned to the tracks and stored a careful visual memory of them .  then he set off at a jog .     as he made breakfast  steve watched the struthiomimus with curiosity .  it was wandering around the corral in apparent contentment  eating leaves from the trees .  after breakfast chad and jane joined him in a walk to the corral  where they watched strut in his temporary home .      quite a creature     said jane .     the resemblance to an ostrich really is very strong .         yes     said chad .     it was odd riding it  but i got used to it fast enough .         so what do you think about all these dinosaurs now  .     steve asked .      what do you mean .         well  before we got here  everything you knew about dinosaurs came from fossils and guesswork .  now you   ve seen them for real .  what do you think .         i wouldn   t say it was guesswork     chad said huffily .     paleontologists have been studying fossil remains and living entities for years with great care .  we   ve figured out all kinds of things through more than guesswork .         all right  all right .  but have you learned anything new since we   ve been here .     steve demanded impatiently .      well  of course i have .  we can surmise the color of some dinosaurs from their environment  and the kind of camouflage they must have needed   but now i know for sure what color some of them were .      steve was getting angrier by the moment .     yeah .  and how did you know what kind of environment they lived in from only a bunch of fossils .         from where they   re found     chad snapped .     we can tell from the kind of rock they   re in .  to me  a fossil in sandstone means that the specimen died in water .  the overall shape and other nearby fossils will tell me if it was a streambed or an ocean .  to you  of course  sandstone is just a rock .         i can live out in the sand of a desert     steve said coldly     where you   d die if you didn   t have all your modern conveniences and robots to protect you .         now wait a minute     said jane .     chad made a good point here .  paleontology isn   t a guessing game .         don   t bother  jane     said chad with a sneer .     i wouldn   t expect a desert rat to understand advanced logic .         now you aren   t being fair either     she said .   chad ignored her .     for instance  dinosaurs walked with their legs nearly straight and erect  many of the bipeds were very active  fast runners  the bone tissue of some is similar to that of mammals  and some species seemed to travel in herds and take care of their young .  steve  can you tell me what theory these facts indicate .      steve glared at him  but had no answer .      you know the term    endotherm     by any chance .         no .         warm blooded  steve .  all those characteristics i just listed are limited to warm blooded animals in modern times .  that means dinosaurs with those qualities are probably warm blooded too .  it   s not guesswork  but you can   t figure it out unless you actually know your stuff .         i   m sure that the entire planet has benefited from this knowledge     steve growled .      and what have you ever accomplished .     chad folded his arms  grinning at steve .      i take care of myself .         yeah .     chad nodded .     and exactly what good does that do for anyone else .         i don   t share anyone else   s water or energy     said steve .     i don   t take anything from anyone else or consume anything in the environment that can   t be replaced .         in other words  after you   re gone  no one will even notice you ever lived .  is that what you   re so proud on    chad could hardly keep from laughing .      he doesn   t bother anyone     said jane .     he hasn   t hurt anybody .         neither do we     chad said sharply .     but we also contribute something to society .         maybe she does     said steve  hotly .     robotics is important to everybody in our time .  but what good do you do for people   digging up fossils and trying to figure out what the animal used to be like .         science doesn   t have to give you a specific goal     said chad  in a bored tone of voice .     knowledge is good for its own sake .  you can   t always plan what you can use it for .         then what   s the point .     steve demanded .   chad grinned at jane  who looked uncomfortable .     all right  i   ll explain .  for instance  what if paleontology had never existed .  i wouldn   t be in this profession now and when hunter needed somebody to come back to this time period  no one would have been available .  in science you never know what knowledge might be good for someday .     he shook his head .     not that you   d understand that  of course .      steve had no answer to that .  he turned and walked briskly away  not sure where he was going .   the other two were silent behind him .  he remembered  of course  that they had all told hunter that they would remain in camp .  just then  he couldn   t stand the thought of listening to chad all day .  he stomped past the tent  aware that he should find some excuse to stop and do chores .  instead  he just snatched up a rope and kept right on walking .           hunter moved through the forest steadily  usually at a brisk walk or even a slow jog .  sometimes the dense trees and bushes forced him to slow down .  he often had to climb over rocks and fallen tree trunks .  still  at the very least  he was sure that he was keeping an even pace with mc   .   as hunter maintained his pursuit  he recorded in his memory everything he saw and heard for future reference .  he knew that mc     s head start had begun from the moment the component robot had left the camp the previous afternoon .  still  he was hoping that mc   had continued his earlier pattern of staying close to the camp .  in any event  hunter would not go too far from it in case the humans called him with an emergency .   near midday hunter came to a sudden halt at the edge of the stream .  he was upstream from the point where he and chad had been fishing .  mc     s tracks led into the water  but he could see that they did not lead out on the opposite bank .   he is learning  hunter thought to himself .  he waded into the cold  swirling water and stopped to look upstream and downstream .   the water sparkled in the sunlight .  if mc   had been only a short distance ahead  hunter could have detected which way he had gone .  if he had gone upstream  the water here would have been muddy for a while  with the muddy streambed kicked up by his footsteps .  conversely  if he had gone downstream  it would have remained clear .   the water was clear now  but too much time had passed for that to mean anything .  mc   had certainly been out of the water for hours  giving the stream time to clear no matter which way he had gone .  hunter magnified his vision and carefully studied each bank on both sides  up and down the current .   hunter saw no sign of footprints leaving the water .  he had no way of judging how far to look in the direction that the stream was flowing before looking upstream instead .  fortunately  he found mc     s tracks another nine meters downstream .  mc   had left the water on the opposite bank  still running .      good move     hunter thought with grudging appreciation .  mc   had certainly waded much faster than hunter had been able to follow him .  that meant mc   had gained some distance on him .   hunter jogged after him  always alert for predatory dinosaurs .  his senses brought him advance warning of heavy footsteps and sometimes sounds of eating or even breathing before he could see any animals  so he avoided most creatures of significant size before he encountered them .  he could hear the smaller animals scampering out of his way through the underbrush .   soon hunter realized that mc   was making a wide curve to the left  taking him back to the brook nearly fifty meters downstream .  before long  mc     s tracks entered the water again  leaving hunter with exactly the same choice he had made before .  he still had to pick a direction arbitrarily .  this time he waded upstream to look for mc     s tracks .   after a kilometer of carefully studying the ground and brush on each side of the stream  hunter turned and moved downstream another kilometer .  at this point  he had virtually lost the trail .  mc   could have chosen to go in either direction for any distance he chose .  hunter ducked under a low hanging branch and stopped to consider the problem  still standing in the flowing water .      excellent performance     hunter thought .  his respect for his fellow robot was sincere  despite his need to catch mc   and take him home .   the data hunter had gathered at this point told him that in mc     s evasive patterns so far  he had never continued in a straight line for more than ten meters .  that did not mean he could not or would not do so  but it lowered the odds .  he had set up a pattern that used many curves and circles  often crisscrossing his own path .   hunter suspected that mc   had somehow managed to get out of the water unnoticed within ten meters of the spot where he had entered it .  he had done this without leaving a track or a broken branch that hunter had seen .  hunter began to examine that area again  magnifying his vision even more .   with great care hunter moved through the water  slowly studying every centimeter of the bank and each branch and twig above it .  he ignored the leaves brushing his face and ducked the overhanging branches with single minded dedication .  when he had reviewed the same area  he still had no sign of where mc   had left the stream .      i am losing too much time     hunter thought  standing up straight .  he moved a slender  leafy branch away from his face  then suddenly looked at it again .  for the first time he looked up at the different tree branches that overhung the stream from each side .   at first he saw nothing .  then he turned  still using his magnified vision  and looked upstream .  four and a half meters away  a branch arched over the water low enough for mc     s arms to have reached it .  the branch was thick enough to support his weight and hunter could see scratches on the bark that had been made recently .      it could have been an animal     hunter reminded himself cautiously .  he waded upstream for a closer look .  then he followed the marks on the branch to the right bank .  he stepped out of the water  seeing marks that indicated the route of something or someone .  the marks continued on the tree at a height of two and three meters .  on the far side  deep footprints showed him where mc   had jumped to soft ground  well out of sight of the water .   grimly satisfied  hunter followed the trail again .        what a jerk     steve muttered as he hiked angrily through the forest .  he was anxious to get away from chad   s sneer though he knew that his knowledge about dinosaurs and scientific matters was not the equal of the other man   s .  the whole unpleasant conversation had started with a question that steve felt had been reasonable .  chad just took every chance that he could find to insult steve .   despite his anger  steve was not reckless .  he walked toward the stream so he would have it as a landmark .  by the time he reached it  he had cooled off .  he decided to sit down by the water and relax .      this is a ridiculous place and time to be sitting around     he said out loud .   after a while  he stood up and worked his way upstream  just looking around .  then he saw a fairly large two legged dinosaur bending over the bank  drinking .   steve had no idea what species it was .  still  it looked big enough to ride .  it was dark green and moved in a fairly slow  calm manner .  he couldn   t see its face .   slowly  steve crept toward it  expecting it to hear him and run at any moment .  it remained where it was  however  lifting its head to listen and look around  then dipping back down to drink again .  steve found himself moving up on its left side .   steve felt a surge of excitement at the idea of jumping onto a dinosaur .  he shook loose his lasso  picking out the angle of this throw .  the next time the dinosaur raised its head  steve tossed the rope .   the loop landed on the top of the dinosaur   s head  but part of it rested on its duck shaped bill .  the dinosaur shook its head and plunged into the water  then hesitated uncertainly .  the shaking motion had thrown off the lasso .  steve ran forward and leaped for the dinosaur   s back .   he landed sideways across the back of its neck  clutching for a handhold .  the dinosaur reared up on its hind legs  screeching in surprise .  the trees overhead whizzed past in a blur as steve spun backward through the air and splashed into the cold brook .   the water was less than a meter deep .  steve pushed himself to his feet  watching the startled dinosaur flee through the underbrush .  he climbed onto the bank  looping his rope around one forearm .     time for a bath  anyway     he said aloud  grinning ruefully .     late in the afternoon  hunter was still moving quickly through the forest following a fairly clear section of mc     s trail .  suddenly  he stopped .  he had left the camp behind at some distance and the first law just would not let him go too far from the humans .  reluctantly  he noted the direction of mc     s trail and turned back .   he walked directly back toward the camp .  it was a much shorter route than following the meandering path he had taken all day while tracking mc   .  fortunately  he had heard nothing from the emergency transmitter .   hunter was still an eleven minute hike from the camp at a moderate speed when he heard an authoritative human male voice in the nearby trees .      stop  robot .  do nothing more except obey my further instructions .      hunter could hear the man   s heartbeat and a faint gurgle in his digestive system  proving that he was human and not a humaniform robot .  hunter stopped and remained motionless  as the second law required .   a man he did not recognize stepped out of the forest cover and came up in front of hunter .  he wore a small backpack .  according to the data hunter had been originally programmed with  this man was middle aged and of northern and western european descent .  obviously  he too had come from the future  but these facts were all that hunter could deduce about him .      identify yourself     said the man .      i am r .  hunter  humaniform robot .         i was pretty sure you were a robot .  not many humans are as big  strong  and single minded as you are .  i   ve been watching you when i could keep up .  now  tell me if you know who i am .         no .         you will call me wayne .  you will make no attempt to contact your party in any way .  do not do anything that would help you evade my second law imperatives .  acknowledge your understanding and cooperation .         acknowledged  pending only a first law imperative .     hunter realized that now he could not shut off his hearing to avoid wayne   s orders .      of course  of course .  we will approach your camp together .  you will make every effort to keep yourself hidden and you will make no move that would cause me to give myself away .  i will show you that the humans in your party are in no danger .  acknowledge .         acknowledged .     even as the second law required him to obey  hunter realized that wayne   s priorities were clearly not the same as his own .  he could also see by wayne   s clear and precise instructions that this man was accustomed to dealing with robots and their priorities .      with my instructions still in force  lead me back to your camp .      hunter did so .  he walked slowly  required by his orders  to remain quiet and out of sight and to pick a route that would help wayne do the same .  when the camp was in sight through the forest cover  he stopped .   wayne came up next to him .   chad was sitting against the base of a tree trunk  reading and entering information into his belt computer .  jane was standing in a small open area  looking up at a pterosaur gliding lazily across the sky .  steve was not visible .      your first law concerns should be satisfied     wayne whispered .     right .         i do not see one member of the party .         maybe he   s in the tent or out at the latrine or something     said wayne .      i cannot be sure he is safe .         then tell me if you have any reason to believe he is in danger .         i have no specific reason  no .         then the second law is still in force .  come with me .     wayne turned and crept away .   hunter felt a twinge of uncertainty under the first law  but nothing in the behavior of chad and jane suggested that they were worried about steve .  the imperative of the second law was clear and direct .  he slipped through the brush after wayne  wondering where they were going and why wayne wanted his companionship .     jane loved watching the flying creature circling overhead against the blue sky .  it was so much like a bird and yet strange and different at the same time .  she could hardly see it because of the heavy forest canopy  but she watched it for as long as she could before it finally glided out of sight .   under a tree  chad yawned and frowned at the little screen on his belt computer .      what were the flying ones like .     jane asked .      hm .  oh  the pterodactyls .         i guess so .         well  the pterodactyls aren   t actually dinosaurs  for one thing .     chad squinted up at the sky  but none were in sight at the moment .      what are they .         they   re actually a suborder of pterosaurs  or flying reptiles .  the pterosaurs are cousins  you might say  of dinosaurs .     he referred to his belt computer .     let   s see what we have here on them .         are birds descended from them .         no .  birds have a separate ancestry .  here we are .  early pterodactyls were as small as a sparrow .  by this time  though  in the late cretaceous  some of them were huge .  they could have wingspreads up to twelve meters .         wow .         they had long  curved necks and long faces .  some had teeth and some didn   t .  they either had short tails or none at all and some had big crests on their heads .         there it is again .  what kind is that .     jane pointed excitedly .      again .     chad jumped up .     you mean you saw it before .  why didn   t you tell me .         well   i don   t know .  i was just so caught up in watching it  i forgot           thanks a lot     he snapped  hurrying to the open area where he could see the sky .   jane backed away a little and looked up again .   chad looked up at the shape in the sky and quickly entered some of its traits  muttering to himself .     no tail .  very long  sharp crest on the back of its head .         it glides  doesn   t it .  i mean  it   s not flying real hard or anything .      chad nodded .     we can   t see if it has teeth from here  of course .  can   t really judge its size  either  without a reference point in the sky .         it   s definitely not sparrow sized     said jane .     i think that wingspan could be three or four meters or more .         yes  it could .     chad studied the screen for a moment .     well  i don   t have enough detail to give us an exact species .  we just can   t see it well enough .         do you have any educated guesses .     jane suppressed a smile  remembering his earlier argument with steve about educated surmises of this sort .      could be a pteranodon     chad said slowly .     except that those fossils have been found in kansas  not alberta .  it ate fish  back when kansas was under water .  this one might be a close relative  though .         kansas .  that   s a long way .         the pteranodon weighed about fifteen kilograms and had wingspreads of up to eight meters .  it was probably endothermic and may have had fur .         fur .  really .         maybe .         i wish we could see one up close     said jane  still watching the flying reptile glide through the sky .      me too     said chad .     still  at least we   ve seen one .  maybe pteranodons lived in alberta .  i   ll consider the possibility anyway .  the ocean isn   t too far from here in this time period  just as in our own  so it would have plenty of fish .      jane nodded  watching as the creature drifted out of sight again .  chad certainly knew his subject .  still  she felt he was somehow missing the experience .   she turned to look at chad  who was still referring to his belt computer .  he was so concerned over gathering and classifying data that he just didn   t seem to be enjoying the sheer wonder of watching the pterodactyl .  maybe that was the quality in him that seemed to bother steve .           when wayne had led hunter safely out of sight and hearing of the camp  he stopped again .     tell me if you have any reason to believe the humans in your party noticed our presence .         i have none .         good .  we   ll talk longer a little later .  however  for the moment  you will lead us deeper into the forest .  you will make every attempt to avoid the notice of the humans .  if you become aware of any sign of mojave center governor   s whereabouts  you will inform me without alarming him .  for that matter  do you know where he is now .         no .         all right .  r .  hunter  lead the way into the forest .  pick a direction away from camp and stop when you find a place that is fairly safe from predators .      hunter obeyed .  wayne was obviously counting on him to provide first law protection from predators .  since jane could still call him with her transmitter if necessary  staying with wayne had become a more immediate first law imperative .   hunter adjusted his senses to set new priorities .  now they would warn him first of predatory animals instead of searching for mc     s tracks .  patiently  he moved at a pace through the forest that was comfortable for wayne .  at this point  without more information about wayne  hunter was simply gathering data and obeying instructions under the second law .   after half an hour  hunter stopped .  they were near the stream again  though farther upstream than hunter had ever been before .  it was a shady spot with slightly less underbrush than usual  providing more visibility .      we stopping here .     wayne asked .      yes .  this is fairly safe  i believe .         okay .     wayne glanced around  then sat down on a large rock .      i   m a little out of shape to go hiking around all day long  so i   ll sit .      hunter waited  saying nothing .      tell me if you have made any progress in finding mojave center governor .         i have made some limited progress .         explain it to me .      hunter hesitated very briefly  even by fast robotic standards .  he didn   t know what wayne wanted  but so far he was not aware of any first law objection that could override the second law .  he would have to answer .      i have been following the track of one of mc governor   s component robots .         ah .  really .     wayne grinned .     interesting .  so mc governor chose to split up and become six fugitives instead of one .  very clever .     then he frowned thoughtfully .     more trouble for us  though .  what else .         mc   has chosen to remain nearby .  i have followed his track on evasive patterns  and he disrupted the camp yesterday when everyone was out  within the confines of the first law of robotics .         i see .  tell me the likelihood of capturing him soon .         that remains unclear .         you should be able to calculate probabilities .         too many variables make the calculation meaningless at this time .         tell me what they are .         i brought a team of three humans with me .  i hired two of them for their knowledge and a third to provide life support for all three .  that may have been a mistake .  my need under the first law to protect first them  and now you  is interfering with my freedom to pursue mc   .         hm .  of course .  yes  i see .     wayne nodded and let out a long breath .   hunter said nothing  waiting .  he could not avoid revealing information when the second law was in effect  but he did not have to volunteer anything .      tell me the names and skills of the humans in your party     said wayne .   hunter did so .      do you know who i am .     wayne asked .      no .         if you were programmed with data regarding the governor robots  you probably have my picture in it somewhere .  search for it .      hunter had not bothered to do this before .  now he found the data .     you are wayne nystrom  inventor of the governor robots and many other significant innovations in robotics and robotic municipalities .         that   s me  all right .  well  i   m glad someone gave you something nice to say about me .      again hunter waited without speaking .      you and i have to discuss our separate missions     said wayne .     we will do it amicably .  in order to know where you stand  though  i also need to know about any hidden priorities you interpret regarding the first law .  tell me about any that you feel are in effect .         a clear first law concern over your being out here alone .  a slightly lesser concern over the humans in the camp  since they have a transmitter they can use to call me in an emergency .  i am still wondering if steve is in camp or elsewhere  without the transmitter  since jane has it .  the largest problem is that of our presence here changing history .         changing history .  you mean by altering evolution  or something of that sort .         yes  even indirectly by leaving behind substances that poison animals or consuming too much food and oxygen .  it may already be too late  but the effort to return mc   to our own time remains worth the continuing risk .      wayne smiled broadly .     i   m glad to hear you say that .  you see  our missions aren   t really that different at all .  i want to take mc governor  or his components  home with me  too .  so we can work together without a problem over that large scale first law concern of yours .  agreed .         agreed .     hunter noted to himself  however  that this agreement only applied to getting mc   and everyone else back to their own time .  wayne and hunter were not necessarily in agreement over other priorities .  however  he kept that opinion to himself .      you said you were tracking mc       said wayne .     are the other component robots in this time period .         i do not know     said hunter .      why not .  what data do you have .         i have no data pertaining to whether mc governor split before coming to this time or after arriving .  in addition  of course  he might have split in mojave center but still sent all the components here anyway .         yes  yes .  i see .  well i am instructing you to lead me on the trail of mc       said wayne .     tell me if you have a first law objection of fulfilling that instruction faithfully .         no  i have none .         let   s go .     wayne stood up .     which way .         the human party could help     said hunter .     why do you want to keep them uninformed of your efforts .      wayne stiffened .   hunter waited  not moving .      go     said wayne .     do not ask any more questions .      hunter turned and took several steps through the forest toward the last known spot on mc     s trail .  then he stopped  feeling a first law concern .      i said go     growled wayne .      the first law demands that i know where i stand regarding the other humans .     hunter turned and looked down at wayne  who was substantially shorter .   wayne glared up at him  clearly angry .     all right     he said after a moment .     all right .  one reason i love robots is that they   re consistent within the laws and their own data .      hunter waited .      i will be harmed if the governor robot oversight committee gets their hands on mc governor before i do     said wayne carefully .     you can understand that .  those humans won   t .  that   s why i don   t want them to know i   m here or what i   m doing .         in what way will you be harmed .         in what way .  they   ll ruin me .  destroy my career .  economically  personally  emotionally .  .  .     he shook his head .     the governor robots virtually are my career .         not entirely     hunter said quietly .      all right .     wayne took a deep breath and spoke more calmly .     i know that the governor robots have a basic design flaw  maybe more than one .  follow me .         yes .         good .     wayne watched him intently .     now  i also know that the oversight committee has all the other governors in its possession .  my only chance to save my career is to participate in correcting those flaws .         why don   t we all work together .         they won   t let me .  the only way i can prove myself is to get my hands on mc governor and fix him .  then i can patent the corrections and show everybody that the gestalt governors are still the wave of the future in their field .         i see .  this is why the hunt for mc   is so important to you .     hunter considered the larger situation .     how did you come back to this time .         huh .     wayne eyed him carefully .     what does that have to do with the first law .         if other robots or humans from our time can follow us here  then the sequence of evolution and history is in very grave danger .  to prevent others from arriving in the same manner you used  i would have to postpone the search for mc   and eliminate that possibility immediately .         wait a minute  robot .  if it   s all that important  why didn   t you ask me this before .         i was too tightly focused in my thinking .  my concentration on mc   distracted me .         you mean  until now  you hadn   t thought of it .     wayne grinned wryly .      yes .         well  that   s great .     wayne rolled his eyes .     the great and mighty robot .  all right .  i got here with the help of one r .  ishihara in the bohung research center .  that   s how mc governor got here  or at least his component  and i   m betting you did  too .         yes  that is right .         i ordered ishihara not to volunteer any information     said wayne .     i had privileged information about mc governor that helped me track him .  did the committee program you with data about him .         yes .         of course they did     wayne said with exaggerated patience .     no one else will have it and no one else will find it .  and when we   re finished here  we   ll return just a few minutes after we left .  do you see what i   m getting at .         i understand .  that procedure will give others no time and opportunity to acquire or figure out the necessary information to follow us .         exactly .  now  can we start following mc   again  or do you have any more first law objections .         i have no more at this time .         finally .  let   s go .      hunter nodded and led the way through the forest .  behind him  wayne was muttering short  angry words that hunter had not heard before .  his stored data informed him that these words were considered by humans to be extremely impolite .     steve finally plodded back to camp late in the day .  he had not tried to jump on another dinosaur  but he had spent the rest of the afternoon hiking around  keeping an eye out for predators .  nothing eventful had happened .   chad was looking up into a tree and entering information into his belt computer .  jane was pacing along the perimeter of the empty corral .  then she saw him .      steve .  are you okay .     she waved and hurried toward him .      sure .     steve grinned and shrugged wearily .     i could use some water though .         so the prodigal returns     said chad  turning around .     have a nice little walk .  you don   t think hunter   s rules apply to you  eh .         nothing happened     steve said sourly .     no evolution is going to change because i took a walk today .         oh  well  i guess that fixes everything     chad said sarcastically .      forget it     said jane .     he   s back and nothing happened .  let   s all just forget it .         what about next time .     chad shook his head  glaring at steve .     hunter had good reason for wanting us to stay safely here and you know it .         i know you   re just a good little boy who doesn   t dare do anything you   re not told to do     said steve .     just like a robot under the second law .     steve walked around chad to one of the water containers and got a drink  pointedly ignoring him .      hunter was right     jane said quietly  joining steve at the water .     did you see him .         no .  i guess he   ll be back any time .         so what did you do .  where did you go .      steve decided to skip his attempt to ride the dinosaur at the stream .     well  i just wandered around .         you must have seen more dinosaurs .         well  sure .  lots of them .  but i don   t know what they all were .         what were they like .         a lot of them are these two legged guys .  the ones with faces like ducks .         hadrosaurids     said chad  who was still standing where he had been before .      a family of dinosaurs that includes many different species .      steve shrugged .     you should have come .  you might have seen some new ones .      chad shook his head in disgust and walked away .      you would have enjoyed it  though  wouldn   t you .     steve asked jane .     i can tell .         yeah .     she smiled reluctantly .     i sure would .         maybe you should come with me next time .     he grinned  challenging her .      well .  .  . hunter knows what he   s talking about .  we still shouldn   t take any risks .         neither one of you has any sense of adventure .  i guess i   ll just make dinner .              hunter had become more skilled at tracking mc   as he had found that the component robot kept repeating certain patterns .  again and again  mc   doubled back in arcs of similar degrees and waded upstream or downstream for only limited distances .  now that hunter knew mc   would climb into the trees for short intervals every so often  he regularly watched carefully for signs of climbing  and found them without delay .   as twilight deepened around hunter and wayne  hunter could see that mc     s trail was growing fresher .  they were clearly making up ground now that hunter could often anticipate mc     s movements and take shortcuts to intersect the far end of a predictable pattern .  soon hunter estimated that they were only a few minutes behind mc   .      i suggest caution     hunter whispered  stopping for a moment .     mc   probably has his hearing still turned off to avoid receiving orders from humans under the second law  but i cannot be sure of that .         i can just shout orders     said wayne .     if he hears me  he   ll have to obey .  if not  then we don   t have to worry about making too much noise .  anyhow  why are you whispering .         in case i am wrong     said hunter .     we must locate him before we risk alerting him .         how can shouting warn him if he can   t hear me .     wayne grinned  suppressing a laugh .      your shout will probably startle some animals .  he will be alerted to potential danger when he sees animals in a state of alarm .     hunter   s hearing told him that mc   was very close but still moving away from them .      i see .  what do you suggest .         i will move up quickly .  according to my data  i can outrun the component robots  though in the woods his greater agility will be a factor in the chase .  you will stay as close to me as you can after my movement reveals our presence to him .  when he becomes aware of us  begin shouting instructions to him .         so basically  you   ll just have to grab him and hold on .  if he slips away  we start over .         that should not be necessary .  i believe that when i rush him  he may turn on all his senses in order to facilitate escaping .  at that point  he will hear your shouts .         okay     wayne said carefully .     but i   m giving you this instruction .  you will apprehend and hold mc   for me .  this is more immediate than your original mission .  acknowledge your acceptance .         acknowledged .         and one more thing  hunter .         yes .         i am instructing you not to turn off your hearing to escape me .  acknowledge again .         acknowledged .      hunter slipped forward gently through the deep shade .  for now  the second law required cooperation .  still  he anticipated that the first law might possibly come into effect .  if he were to judge that wayne was trying anything that would actually interfere with hunter   s long range plan of returning mc   to their own time  then hunter would not be bound by second law instructions .   for hunter  the challenge was to interpret a difference in his goals and wayne   s that involved the first law .  he would have to be on the alert to see one .  at the moment  however  he had to get mc   into custody .   finally hunter saw mc      s small  slight human shape ahead  moving between two large  full bushes .  hunter   s vision instantly measured the ground and plant cover separating them .  then he leapt forward and ran after mc   .   when hunter   s feet pounded the ground  mc   ran without bothering to look at him .  hunter understood .  mc l   s hearing had been turned off  but he had felt the vibrations of hunter   s footsteps and had reacted instantly to the pursuit .      mojave governor component       hunter radioed .     you must stop .  a first law problem is in effect .  your presence may alter the future and harm human history .         unproven     mc   radioed back .   at least that meant he had turned on his radio link .   hunter flung himself forward in a flying tackle and snagged one of mc      s narrow ankles in his right hand .  they both crashed through leafy branches to the ground .  instantly  hunter gathered his legs under him and jumped forward again  landing bodily on mc   .      stop .  i order you to stop .     wayne shouted from behind hunter .   mc   still struggled .  hunter had guessed wrong .  mc     s hearing was still turned off .  hunter held him firmly against the damp ground .  wayne was still pushing through the underbrush toward them .      listen carefully     hunter said to mc   by radio communication  at maximum robotic speed .     this human and i have some differences between us .  right now he is controlling me by the second law  but i consider his long range plans possibly suspect under the first law .         then you can disobey him     said mc   .      not yet  because my interpretation is not clear enough     said hunter .     i warn you to be suspicious of this human in regard to the first law and his overall motives .         acknowledged     said mc   .   hunter was glad that wayne had not thought to prohibit him from communicating with mc   privately .  at some point in the future  hunter might need to confer with mc   this way again .     do nothing that would remind wayne of our ability to communicate by radio  he seems to have forgotten this for the moment and you and i may need to confer without his knowledge in the future as well .  now turn on your hearing .         i refuse .  you cannot make me obey you .  we both know the second law does not apply to instructions from one robot to another .      hunter pushed himself up into a sitting position  his weight still on top of mc   .     i repeat  you may be in violation of the first law .  according to some theories of history  anything we do here in the past may change the future and bring harm to humans .  to avoid this  you must cooperate with me under the third law .         you are not certain of this  are you .         no     hunter said truthfully .     however  i consider it a first law risk that cannot be taken .         in the absence of stronger evidence  i refuse to accept your argument .  my third law imperative to save myself is stronger .         i cannot let you escape     said hunter .     if you refuse to activate your aural senses  i will have to disable you physically  perhaps by ripping your legs off .         i have changed my mind     said mc lout loud  no longer speaking by radio .     the third law requires that i protect myself from immediate harm .  my hearing is activated .      their conversation had lasted no longer than it had taken wayne to come running up to them .      you will not try to escape or resist us     said wayne firmly .     you will call me wayne .     he hesitated  then turned to hunter .     can he hear me .         yes  i can     said mc   .     i acknowledge my cooperation under the second law .      hunter got up and drew mc   to his feet .      i order you both to cover our tracks in some way and take evasive action for all three of us     said wayne .     hunter  choose a route that will lose any pursuit from the humans in your camp .  then find a place that they aren   t likely to locate and build a small shelter for me .  big enough for you two also if you need it .         all right     said hunter .     night had fallen completely by the time steve had gathered up the dinner dishes and put everything away .  he and chad had not spoken during dinner .  all three of them kept looking up at the slightest sound in the forest .      something must be wrong     steve said finally .      hunter   s a robot     said jane .     his strength is much greater than any human   s his size .  and with his specialized sight and hearing  he can stay away from dangerous dinosaurs .  maybe he   s hot on mc     s trail .         maybe he ran into a dinosaur he couldn   t handle     said chad .     we should have considered that possibility .  i mean  if a triceratops trampled him  even his strength and durability wouldn   t save him .      the three of them looked at each other slowly in the unblinking illumination from one of the camp lights .      hunter still has the device that takes us back to our own time     steve said quietly  putting their mutual concern into words .      we could be stuck right here     said jane slowly  her eyes widening .     forever .         this whole project should have been planned better     chad said angrily .      hold it     said steve .     no need to panic .  hunter could come walking back into camp any minute .         yeah     said chad doubtfully  glaring at him .     but what if he doesn   t .         well  we shouldn   t just sit here forever     said steve .     at some point  we should go out looking for him .         i   m not so sure     said jane .   steve and chad both looked at her in surprise .      why not .     chad asked .      as a roboticist  i know that hunter can handle himself better than we can .  if he can   t get himself out of trouble  then i don   t think we   ll be able to help him .  we sure aren   t any stronger or smarter or tougher than hunter .         you have a point     chad admitted .      i think we should trust in his abilities and simply wait here for him     said jane .     that way he   ll know where to find us  the way he planned .         look     said chad .     what i said about hunter   s getting trampled bya triceratops still goes  but that   s not the end of it .  a lot of dinosaurs have too much sheer mass for hunter to handle and a large predator might have thought he was edible .         that wouldn   t last long     said jane .     not after a dinosaur tasted him .         it might be too late for hunter by then     said steve  allowing himself a grim smile .     even if he got spat out again .  or what was left of him .         that   s true     said jane .     but he   s not very late .  we were expecting him back at sundown .  that was no more than an hour ago  was it .         just about an hour     said chad .     i guess we   re so used to robots being precise that it seems longer .         suppose hunter is damaged but not completely destroyed     said steve .     the sooner we get to him  the better all our chances are going to be .         we have one other option     said jane .     i don   t like it much  but .  .  .         what is it .     steve asked .      the transmitter .     she patted her pocket .     if i call him on it  that will activate a first law alarm that will bring him in a hurry if he can come at all .         i forgot all about that     chad said .     but you sound reluctant to use it .  at least if we do  it would tell us if he   s capable of returning to camp or not .         it   s the problem of crying    wolf     of course     said jane .     at the moment  we really aren   t in immediate danger .  what we   re talking about is potential harm .         crying    wolf    won   t matter to a robot  will it .     steve asked .     doesn   t the first law require him to check on us if we call for help .         not exactly     said jane  shaking her head .     the first law says that hunter can   t allow us to come to harm if he can prevent it .  however  he has some ability of his own to judge and interpret the extent and immediacy of the harm in question .  strictly speaking  asking for help doesn   t really prove to a robot that we need it .         but suppose we call him on the transmitter     said chad .     he can   t make any interpretation until he gets here to check it out  so he   ll still have to show up if he can .         that   s true in this case     said jane .     but this is where the story of crying    wolf    comes in .  if we make a first law alarm that   s phony  hunter will have to consider that the next time we call for help .         okay  i get it     steve said wearily .     we   ll damage our credibility .         bluntly  yeah     said jane .      i suggest a compromise     said steve .     we won   t get much done in the dark tonight anyway .  so for now  we go to sleep and hope hunter shows up by morning .         and if he doesn   t .     jane asked .   steve turned to chad .     can that struthiomimus carry all three of us .         yes  i   m sure it can .         then tomorrow  if hunter isn   t back  we   ll ride out looking for him .  i   ll rig up a third saddle tonight  just in case .         agreed     said chad .      all right     said jane .     hunter and mc   led wayne to a campsite at the bank of the stream .  a fallen tree near a bend in the streambed provided a thick  heavy shelter from the wind .  the two robots used dead wood and mud to make a more finished sleeping cubicle for wayne .  he stretched out to sleep and the two robots sat quietly  husbanding their energy until dawn could replenish it .   in the morning  wayne ate packaged food from his backpack .  he drank from the stream  having made the water safe by using some chemical pellets he had also brought in his pack .  the robots sat quietly  waiting for instructions .  finally wayne turned to mc   .      now then     said wayne .     i understand that mc governor was in danger of entering the same endless loop that rendered the other governor robots helpless and useless .  i wish to have a look at some of your internal systems .         the third law prevents me from allowing this     said mc    stiffly .      stop bluffing     wayne said with an amused smile .     the second law overrides the third and you know it even better than i do .  open your chest cavity for me .         stop     hunter ordered firmly .      don   t waste your time on these games     wayne said  now irritated .     the second law doesn   t apply to instructions from you .         i am not referring to the second law     said hunter .     i cannot allow this under the first law .         what .     wayne looked at him sharply .     explain your interpretation .         my mission is to return mc governor to our own time to prevent changes in history that will harm everyone .  dismantling and studying mc   is going to cause delays and increase the chances of some unforeseen problem developing .         that sounds like a thin argument to me     said wayne .     my instructions to you are clear and direct .         the relative importance of these issues weighs heavily on the side of the first law     said hunter .     your second law instructions can be carried out in our own time with no threat of altering evolution .  they can be delayed without causing harm to your personal concerns .      wayne looked at him in silence  obviously trying to think of a counterargument .     i disagree     he said finally .      in what way .     hunter asked .     my second law instructions should in no way obstruct your mission .         my first law obligation is too great to take that risk     hunter said simply .      then we   re at a stalemate .         in debate  perhaps     said hunter .     but the first law requires that i prevent mc   from cooperating and if necessary  prevent you from interfering .         correction     said wayne  shaking his head .     you win .      hunter felt a growing suspicion of wayne   s motives .  wayne   s argument did not  in his opinion  demonstrate sufficient respect for hunter   s first law imperative .  in the future  hunter would have to take that into consideration when listening to wayne   s opinions .   suddenly hunter heard the sound of human voices shouting his name in the distance  too far away for wayne to hear .           hunter did not react outwardly to his realization that the humans from his camp were growing closer .  he regretted not bringing more sophisticated communication gear from their own time to equip them .  the humans had no way to receive a transmission from him .   of course  he had not anticipated mc governor   s splitting into components or wayne   s interfering with his mission .  by his original estimate  this project should have been concluded much faster and more easily .  he should have finished and returned his team to their own time long before this .   hunter radioed to mc   before the component robot could react outwardly to the presence of other humans .  hunter did so without looking at him  so that wayne would not be suspicious .     i hear my human team approaching  shouting my name  i assume you can hear them too .  do not take any action that would alert wayne to their presence .  i hope to get both of us away from wayne   s second law imperatives .  i believe he is a negative influence on my first law imperative .         then why do you not simply act on this now .         i do not have sufficient certainty .         if you might be wrong  then why should i cooperate with you .     mc   demanded .      for the same reason i gave you yesterday     hunter radioed .     the third law requires that you protect yourself from harm .  if you do not do as i say  i will tear off one of your arms and club your artificial cranium with it .         not convincing .  you just told us that you could not  under a first law imperative  allow wayne to dismantle me .         that was to prevent him from unnecessary activities .  under the first law  your cooperation with me is necessary .  i will enforce it one way or another .         i am convinced     mc   said shortly .   this discussion had been conducted at robotic speed .  it had started and ended in less time than wayne required to inhale .  he had not noticed any sign of it in their behavior .      your first law imperative is vague and indistinct     said wayne .  he went on to argue that hunter and mc   were more tightly bound by the second law to follow his instructions  but he was not saying anything new .   as wayne essentially repeated the same case he had made before  hunter considered his options .  shouting for steve and the others was a poor risk at this distance .  since wayne could not hear them yelling  they probably would not hear hunter  but hunter would have given away their presence to wayne .   right now  leaving mc   temporarily with wayne would be acceptable .  hunter   s top priority was to become free to act on his own once more .  after all  even if wayne returned with mc   to their own time first  hunter now knew that wayne would be going back to the bohung institute .  hunter could intercept them there  or at least pick up their trail .   meanwhile  wayne was still arguing with him .   hunter suddenly realized that he could shut off his own hearing  despite wayne   s second law order not to do it .  with hunter   s team close  the first law imperative to put the mission back on track overrode wayne   s order .  first he looked away from wayne so that he could not read wayne   s lips .  then he shut off his hearing as well .  now he was free of wayne   s instructions under the second law .   with a sudden leap  hunter ran through the underbrush toward the humans .   of course  hunter knew very well that wayne was yelling for him to stop .  he was a big robot  however  and before he could attain full speed in the heavy forest growth  he felt two arms encircle his legs .  a second later  he felt the momentum of wayne   s body as he slammed into hunter   s legs .   at maximum speed  hunter considered his options .  he could easily pull free of wayne  but of course the first law would not allow him to risk harming wayne in this circumstance  where no greater or clearer first law imperative was at work .  hunter allowed himself to fall to the ground so as to avoid hurting wayne .   hunter had not given up yet  though .  he rolled over  still avoiding looking at wayne   s face so as not to read his lips .  as wayne grappled with him  hunter gripped him under the arms and lifted him off .  maybe  hunter reflected  his best option was to carry wayne to the other humans and then discuss the situation .      release him .     mc   radioed angrily  jumping in between them .  he grabbed one of hunter   s wrists in both hands and pried hunter   s grip free .      what are you doing .     hunter demanded in surprise  also by radio .      you will harm the human .         of course i will not .  back off .         taking him into custody will harm him .      hunter found himself in a three way wrestling match .  wayne was by far the weakest of them  but of course the first law protected him from any really rough handling .  hunter struggled to get free of both of them .     at dawn steve had prepared a quick breakfast  after which they had saddled up and ridden out as soon as possible .  the struthiomimus had resisted chad at first  but once chad had it under control from the front saddle  jane and steve were able to mount easily .   they had been shouting hunter   s name as they rode  following his trail as best they could .  if he had been injured  but was able to hear and respond  this would help .  steve   s biggest worry was that if hunter had been destroyed   in essence  was dead   they could be looking for a long time .   they had been riding for some time when the struthiomimus began prancing around  repeatedly looking off to the right .  chad struggled with the reins to keep it moving .  it took several more steps forward  but kept looking to the right .      maybe a predator   s over there     said chad .     i think i should let him go the way he wants  maybe to avoid it .         that makes sense     said jane .      it might be hunter     said steve .      yeah  that   s right .     chad pulled on the reins in the direction of the disturbance .  the struthiomimus pranced and fought him .   steve grabbed jane around the waist to keep his seat  just as she was suddenly holding on to chad in front of her .  the struthiomimus ducked and swung its head on its long neck  stepping sideways .  it didn   t buck .      i can   t make it go that way     said chad .     it   s an herbivore  apparently conditioned to stay away from unknown disturbances .  and it isn   t trained to the point where i can really force it .         maybe it knows what it   s doing     said jane .     chad  what do you think .         it   s possible .  a large predator could be over there  attacking its prey .  we don   t want to walk into that situation  especially without hunter .         well  what if it   s not a predator over there .     steve asked .     what if a couple of herbivores are just butting heads or something .         a disturbance can attract one     said chad .     a hungry predator might go check out an unknown situation .  this struthiomimus knows more about survival here than we do .         well  how are we going to find hunter if we don   t look around .     steve demanded      i can   t make this beast go that way anyhow .     chad yelled over his shoulder .   the struthiomimus was darting forward a few steps  then stopping to struggle against the reins .      hold it .     steve yelled .  he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and swung one leg over his saddle .  then he jumped to the ground  backing away quickly so the struthiomimus couldn   t trample him in its confusion .      what   s happened .     chad asked over his shoulder  as he pulled on the reins again .      where are you going .     jane asked quickly .     we should stay together .  what are you doing .         i   m going to take a look .     steve jogged in the direction the dinosaur had been avoiding .   steve slowed down quickly  as he had to push through the bushes and around the trees .  he had only a general direction in which to go .  also  he became more cautious  knowing that chad and jane had a point .      steve .  chad .  jane .     hunter   s voice reached him in a faint shout .      hunter .     encouraged  steve moved more quickly  confident that if he ran across a predator  he could yell for hunter   s help .  he plunged through the forest  ducking his head and feeling the branches scratch his face .  hunter shouted again and steve changed direction slightly to follow his voice .      coming .     steve called back .   finally steve burst through a couple of tall  leafy bushes to find three figures rolling around on the ground .  he assumed that the smallest human figure struggling with hunter was mc    but he was momentarily shocked to see another human .      hold it .  nobody move .     steve yelled at last .   mc   stopped .  hunter did not  however  until he realized that mc   was backing away .  then he looked around  saw steve  and halted his movements .   motion in the dense trees behind them caught steve   s attention .  he froze .  a two legged dinosaur with a pointed face  big eyes  and serrated teeth was leaping through the brush at them .      hunter .     steve screamed .   instantly  hunter and mc   whirled to look .  the dinosaur  about four meters tall  came rushing at them with its teeth gleaming .  steve jumped to one side  rolling .   the two robots  driven by the first law  sprang forward to meet the predator .  hunter slammed into it bodily and hung on  digging for traction in the soft sod .  mc   threw his arms around the dinosaur   s narrow neck and pulled  dragging it down .  the dinosaur was heavier and stronger than the robots  but not by very much .   hunter suddenly twisted his body and yanked the dinosaur to one side .  mc    acting in concert  pulled its neck harder in the same direction  throwing the dinosaur off balance .  steve was sure that the two robots were communicating by radio link at robotic speed .   steve jumped up and dodged behind a tree trunk .  he didn   t see much point in running or climbing .  the safest place for him was near the two robots .   the robots threw the dinosaur to the ground with a thump  but they couldn   t hold it .  with a snarl  it rose to its feet again  but this time it turned and hurried away .  in a moment it was out of sight .   hunter turned to steve .     i had just switched my hearing back on when i became aware of the first law threat from the dinosaur .  where are chad and jane .         on the struthiomimus  behind me .  not very far  but chad couldn   t get it to come this way .         i understand .  we must join them so i can protect all of you .      behind hunter  wayne was out of sight .     mc    come with me     he called from somewhere in the trees .     protect me .      hunter spun around again .     stop  both of you .         i order it  mc       steve called quickly .     under the second law  stop .      however  mc   ran after the other man .      get him .     steve shouted urgently .  he started forward himself .      no .     hunter grabbed his upper arm in a firm grip and stopped him without any apparent effort .     i cannot .  with the predator nearby  i must follow the most immediate first law imperative of protecting you  chad  and jane .         but what about the rest of human history and all that stuff .  this is your chance .         i will have more chances .  you three may not .  first take me back to chad and jane .         all right .     steve sighed .     robot logic drives me crazy .  hunter  is that first law imperative the reason mc   didn   t stop when i told him to .  to protect that other guy .  and who is he  anyhow .         yes     hunter said  as they began to walk .     he has to take care of dr .  wayne nystrom  the man who invented the governor robots and came to take mc governor back himself .      hunter and steve exchanged reports about the previous night as they walked .  then hunter shouted for chad .  after the fourth yell  chad and jane called back .   finally the small head of the struthiomimus came into view through the trees .  chad steered it cautiously forward and reined in .     glad to see you  hunter .         and i  you .  is everyone well .         yeah     said chad .      we   re fine     said jane .      we will stay together now     said hunter .     steve  mount up .  i can keep up with the struthiomimus on foot .         mc   is just up ahead     said steve .     so is dr .  wayne nystrom .         what .     jane started .     he is .         i will tell you all about it     said hunter        as we follow them .              as soon as wayne realized that mc   was responding to his call for help  he stopped in the thick underbrush and waited for the small robot to catch up .      you agree that the first law requires you to protect me .     wayne asked in a whisper .      yes .  hunter will fulfill that duty with his own team well enough .         good     said wayne .     carry me on your back .  even at your size  we can move faster that way .  take evasive patterns immediately   and vary them from the patterns you   ve been using .  hunter has identified too many consistencies in your behavior .         are you going to return me with you to our own time .  you can do that from right here .  from your earlier information  i expected that to be your next act .         i have thought about that     said wayne .     but back in mojave center  i   ll have a lot of distractions .  i want to get you somewhere safe so that i can have a quick look at your insides .  if we can get away from hunter for a while  i   ll have more privacy here in this time .         as you wish .     mc   bent forward .   wayne jumped on his back .  the robot gently hoisted wayne up slightly  still crouching low under his weight .  wayne tensed at the uncomfortable position .      acceptable .     mc   asked .      yes .  hurry .  as soon as hunter has gathered his party  they   ll be after us .     mc   took off at a jog  a pace wayne could not have maintained for very long on his own .     the team had all seen that mc     s footprints had deepened at the spot where dr .  nystrom   s had disappeared .  now they were following them  hunter in the lead .  steve  in the third saddle again  listened with curiosity as hunter described the predator to chad .      sounds like a tro  don     chad reported  holding the reins in one hand and his belt computer in the other .     its fossils have been found in montana  which isn   t too far from here   at least in zoological terms .         what else do you know about it .     jane asked .      well  let   s see     said chad .     it was one of the most intelligent of all dinosaurs  maybe the very smartest .  possibly warm blooded .  its widely spaced eyes gave it good depth perception .  combining that with intelligence  it was one of the most dangerous predators around  even though it wasn   t very big as dinosaurs go .         smart enough to investigate the disturbance my struggle with wayne and mc   caused     said hunter .     it probably heard the noise and approached quietly to take a look before it decided we might make a good lunch .         a reasonable scenario     said chad .      i don   t get it     said steve .     hunter  if nystrom   s idea is to take mc governor back himself   whole or in components   why is he still here .  why doesn   t he go back to mojave center right now .         i am not certain     said hunter  holding a tree branch out of the way for the struthiomimus .     however  i do not dare simply return our party to the bohung institute and wait for them .  i want to get both of them under control .         they can   t be very far ahead     said chad .     if we need a plan  we   d better make one now .         what about wayne   s influence .     jane asked .     hunter  you can   t just jump on mc   now .  the same problem will come up as before .  wayne will order you to stop and he   ll interfere .  the first and second laws will stop you .         i will need your help this time     said hunter .      what do you have in mind .     steve asked .      if the three of you can grab wayne without any real threat of harm to him  i can allow that .  at the same time  i can restrain mc   .         you may still have a conflict between our instructions and wayne   s under the second law     said jane .      we   ll hold his mouth shut     said steve .   chad laughed .      might work .     jane smiled  too .     but we really should have something more effective than that .         what do you suggest .     hunter asked     a first law imperative is the only guarantee of overriding the second law .         we can   t count on predatory dinosaurs showing up at the right time     said steve .      if i understand you     said hunter     you are pointing out that if at least one human were in danger  mc   would have to turn his attention to protecting the human and so make himself vulnerable to me .         wouldn   t that work .     steve asked .      not necessarily     said hunter .     assuming that i am on the scene at the same time  the first law would require me to protect the human from immediate harm as well .  i would not be free to act purely on my own judgment .         we   ll set up a hoax     said jane .      i like that     said steve .      a hoax .     hunter asked .     of what design .         well  i   m not sure .  but suppose mc   is made to believe that steve  chad  and i are in danger .  that will free him from dr .  nystrom   s orders .         yes  clearly     said hunter .      so if you know that the implied danger is false  then the first law won   t hamper your actions .  right .         correct     said hunter .      so you can pounce on him     said steve .     it ought to work  i   d say .         what about dr .  nystrom .     chad asked .     i guess we don   t want to leave him running around the late cretaceous period  either  do we .         no     said hunter .     if any of us can apprehend him  we must do so .  however  wayne remains our second priority .  his only reason to be here is to control mc    so if we return to our time with mc    then wayne will follow .  he has no other reason to be here .         that   s clear enough     said steve .      what will our hoax be .     hunter asked .     it must make a great deal of noise and commotion to attract mc     s attention  wherever he is .         wait a minute     said jane .     what if he has turned off his hearing again .         i believe he no longer has any reason to do that     said hunter .     now he has a human companion and a first law imperative to protect him from predatory animals .  to do that most efficiently  he will need to maintain his auditory sense .         the previous question still stands  though     said chad .     what will our hoax be .         chad  let   s use dinosaurs     said steve .      how .         can we stampede some of them in the direction of mc   and wayne .         hold it     said hunter .     that would put wayne into genuine danger .         once we get the stampede started  we   ll ride out ahead of it  yelling for help     said steve .     you   ll be running with us .  if the first law forces you to intervene  you   ll be right there on hand .         wait a minute     said chad .     how can we start a stampede from behind and then ride in front of it .         a stampede starts slowly     said steve .     even a predator can be startled and made to run for safety .  .  . or at least  in our time they can .         well .  .  . i don   t know .  i suppose they would react the same way they do in response to a forest fire .  their survival instinct would be triggered by seeing all the animals fleeing in the same direction .         i   m sure mc   would interpret a dinosaur stampede as a first law problem     said jane  holding back laughter .     i really don   t imagine any robot would have a problem making that particular judgment .         good     said steve .     we   ll ride along the stream  where a certain number of dinosaurs are likely to be .  we   ll ride fast and yell a lot and get some of them running toward mc   and wayne .  since we know where we   re going  we can ride alongside the rush and get out ahead of them .  a forest stampede doesn   t really move at a dead run .  it faces too many natural obstacles and too much confusion .         i might be able to go along with this     said hunter .     chad  what does our resident paleontologist think .         it might be a big mistake .         in what way .         i barely have control of this struthiomimus as it is .  setting a bunch of dinosaurs in motion  out of control  is just asking for trouble .         i understand that this plan has a significant unpredictability     said hunter .     so far  i interpret the degree of unpredictability to be acceptable .  do you have other objections .         yeah .  we have no idea what species we   ll be dealing with .  it   s not just the predators  large and small .  many of the herbivores are gigantic  too  you know .  they won   t be fast  relatively speaking  but once they   re on the move  a stampede of elephants will seem downright manageable by comparison .      steve laughed .     you still have no sense of adventure .  you   re just too sheltered  timid  and intellectual to take action in the real world .      in the front saddle  chad turned angrily to look over his shoulder  but hunter spoke first .      we will try this plan     said hunter .     since you are all on one mount  i can run beside you and perform my first law duties if any arise .      steve could see chad shake his head in silence .      steve  putting this plan into action strikes me as your area     said hunter .     on this project i ask you to give the instructions .  what should we do .         make your best guess about the position of mc   and wayne .  then calculate where they may be  roughly  during the next half hour .         then what do we do .         take us back to the stream .      hunter nodded .  he was unusually quiet  but he changed the direction of their journey through the forest .  none of them spoke .   when they reached the stream  hunter began wading up the middle of the current .  it was no more than waist deep to him at the deepest  and usually more shallow than that .  chad guided the struthiomimus after him .      this is a good spot     chad said quietly .   hunter stopped and waited for them to ride up next to him .     what do you mean .      chad pointed .     we have a lot of herbivores visible here if you look carefully .  there   s an anodontosaurus feeding on the left  up ahead .  a stegoceras   maybe even the same one we captured   is drinking a little past it .  i can see the heads of some hadrosaurs   the duckbill guys   in the distance .         is this a good place to begin the stampede .     hunter asked .      i would say so .  in a forest this dense  the wildlife we can see at anyone time is only a small fraction of what   s actually present .         so if we can see this many  we have a good start     said jane .     okay  now what do we do .         steve  what is your opinion .     hunter asked .      i think chad   s right     said steve .     but which way do we chase them .  where is mc   .         that way .     hunter pointed ahead at an angle to the right of the stream .      all right     said steve .     we   ll start slow and see how they react .  chad  move up slowly .  we   ll all start yelling and waving our arms and try to get them moving .         all right .     now that chad had accepted the proposed action  he was giving it all his attention .     now .      the struthiomimus leaped forward and began splashing upstream .  steve yelled and whooped  and chad and jane did the same .  hunter tried a variety of noises and finally settled on a rumbling  leonine roar from his versatile larynx .   small animals in the tree branches responded first  jumping away or fluttering into the air .  steve saw the family of duckbill dinosaurs glance quickly at them and then slip away into the dense forest .  the swishing of branches and shaking of large bushes were the only signs that many other animals were starting to move .      hyah .     steve shouted  waving one arm and holding on to his saddle with the other .     chad  chase    em .  into the woods .      chad reined to the right  and the struthiomimus sprang up the bank  threatening to throw its three riders for a moment .  then they were up into the forest  still yelling and chasing the dinosaurs .  hunter jogged nearby  staying close .   steve laughed as he shouted  easily the most boisterous of the group .  this was the kind of adventure he relished  though certainly even he had never stampeded dinosaurs before .  chad and jane were clearly enjoying themselves as well .   ahead of them  more and more dinosaurs were becoming visible as they were startled from their feeding  hunting  or sleeping .  the riders followed in a crooked  haphazard path around the trees and bigger bushes .  as the momentum of the chase increased  the stampede grew  the animals always running in roughly the same direction .  soon the forest was filled with the sound of thundering feet and breaking branches .      that should be plenty     steve called .      definitely     jane shouted over her shoulder .     this will scare the lubricant out of mc   .         around to the left .     steve yelled at chad .   chad drew on the reins and the struthiomimus responded .  they angled left and soon had worked their way over to the left rear of the stampeding dinosaurs .  hunter  of course  kept his pace and position with no trouble .      still the right direction .     steve shouted to hunter .      yes     he called back .   now that they were riding off to one side of the stampede  the struthiomimus lost some of its hesitancy and ran even faster on its two long legs .  they began moving up on the host of dinosaurs .  steve could see chad rising half out of the front saddle on his stirrups  gleefully yelling and waving one hand .   jane  too  looked at chad and laughed .  she even glanced over her shoulder and winked at steve .  chad had loosened up a lot on this ride .      hunter .  do you know where they are .     steve shouted  as the struthiomimus pranced out to the fore of the stampede  still safely to the left .      the tracks are fresh     hunter called back  now at a faster run to keep up .     no more than a quarter kilometer ahead of us  and not much less .         we   d better get well ahead of the rush     steve yelled to everyone .      that   s right     jane answered .  she turned to speak to steve over her shoulder  but stopped  staring back at the stampede with widening eyes .     look .      steve looked .  even he recognized the two tall  monstrous fanged dinosaurs that towered over the rest of the stampede in the distant trees .  the stampede had flushed out two tyrannosaurus hexes  and both of them were running in the humans    direction .              chad .     jane pounded on his shoulder and pointed to the rear of the stampede .   chad started in shock  but didn   t say anything .  now that the two gigantic carnivores were running in the rear of the stampede  the smaller animals were not going to stop any time soon .  chad pulled on the reins to angle away from the frantic rush they had begun .      hunter .  see    em .     steve yelled .      yes .  we must find wayne and mc   .  stay with me     hunter shouted back with robotic calm .     i am now in radio contact with mc   about the impending first law imperative .      steve looked back at the stampede .     we don   t have much time to find    em .         there they are .     chad shouted  pointing ahead .   steve leaned around jane to look .  mc   was struggling through the woods toward hunter with wayne on his back  moving faster than a human could run for very long .  however  he was going much too slowly to escape the stampede .   as hunter ran toward them  mc   made what progress he could .  obviously  mc   had seen that the first law now required that he use hunter   s help to save wayne .  chad guided the struthiomimus in the same direction .   steve looked back over his shoulder .  the stampede had broken up .  the smaller dinosaurs were scattering in all directions  trying to flee the tyrannosauruses  making all kinds of different noises as they ran .   the tyrannosauruses were at least five meters tall .  their jaws alone were nearly one meter long and full of dagger shaped teeth .  tiny forearms with long claws reached out from their massive bodies as they ran on powerful legs .   a triceratops  maybe the one hunter had told them of finding or maybe another one  had stopped running .  it had originally been caught up in the stampede as a general alarm  but it clearly had no fear of a tyrannosaurus .  as steve watched  it simply turned warily to protect itself .   one tyrannosaurus was too close to turn its back .  it bellowed in a deep roar and the triceratops charged it  the three horns on its head at the level of the carnivore   s abdomen .  the tyrannosaurus dodged to one side and snapped downward with its great jaws .   the two massive dinosaurs turned and shuffled against each other .  the triceratops  on its four legs  rammed forward .  the tyrannosaurus  tall on its two powerful legs  shifted laterally to get around the heavy frill protecting the neck and back of the triceratops .  they trampled all the underbrush and smashed down tree trunks that got in their way .   chad was just pulling up next to mc   and hunter .     now what do we do .         hurry     jane yelled .      unnecessary advice     hunter said patiently .      i can   t believe this     said wayne  staring at the dinosaurs racing in all directions behind them .      remain calm .     hunter took wayne on his own back .     i will save wayne .     he took off at a run .   steve leaned down and spoke to mc   .     you follow us and stay close .  right .         right     said mc   .   jane also turned to the small robot .     after the first law imperative has passed  you stay with us or join us if we get separated .  ignore all statements from wayne until we get a chance to talk to you .  we have to explain a complex first law problem that you haven   t had a chance to consider .  acknowledge your agreement under the second law .         agreed .         then let   s get of here .     steve yelled to chad urgently .      look out .     while the triceratops rammed the first tyrannosaurus again  tearing at its insides  the second tyrannosaurus was lumbering through the forest directly toward them  smashing everything in its path underfoot .  by now  most of the other dinosaurs had put more distance between themselves and the battling giants .  that left the struthiomimus  its riders  and mc   as the closest prey it could see .   chad yanked on the reins and all three human riders kicked their mount .  it took off after hunter  with mc   running along behind .  steve stole another look over his shoulder .  the tyrannosaurus was crashing toward them  its eyes fixed on him and its rows of teeth gleaming .      faster .     steve yelled  though he realized the struthiomimus could hardly run at top speed while carrying the weight of three humans .   in front of them hunter was slipping through the bushes with wayne on his back .  suddenly  as steve watched  wayne simply vanished .  steve figured he had activated his version of the device that would take him forward to their own time .   steve saw hunter stop to glance behind him  but the robot obviously reached the same conclusion about wayne .  hunter looked up and waved for the humans to ride past him .  then he leapt into the air  grabbed a tree branch and pulled himself up .        go back to the camp .     hunter shouted at chad  as the struthiomimus rushed below him .  at the same time he was still climbing the tree to get above the head of the tyrannosaurus .      right .     chad shouted back  over his shoulder .   hunter shifted to radio communication .     mc    climb a tree near me .  we must work together to distract this dinosaur from pursuing them .         agreed .     now running just a short distance ahead of the roaring tyrannosaurus  mc   also found a low hanging branch within reach .  he grabbed it and quickly scrambled up into a tree next to hunter   s and climbed to a safe height .     what do you suggest .         we will jump on its back     said hunter .     time your jump .  .  . now .      using his precise vision  timing  and coordination  hunter leapt onto the back of the tyrannosaurus   s head  his arms and legs spread eagled to hang on .  as he had calculated  he was barely able to slide down to the dinosaur   s neck  which was just narrow enough for him to catch .   startled  the tyrannosaurus stopped and turned  trying to shake the sudden weight off the back of its neck .      prepare for my weight     mc   radioed .  in that moment mc   dropped from his tree on top of hunter .  only this time  while hunter clung to the back of the creature   s neck  mc   expertly slid over to one side and down hunter   s right leg .   the tyrannosaurus was prancing and jerking madly  trying to shake off its two tormentors .  hunter looked down and saw mc   deliberately drop down to and grab one of the short forearms of the tyrannosaurus .   now the tyrannosaurus shook his forearms and clawed at mc   with his free hand .  he could not  however  bend down close enough to snap at mc   with his jaws .  the dinosaur   s skeletal structure would not let him reach mc   .      i cannot hold this position long     mc   radioed .     he will claw me off in a moment .  do you have further suggestions .         drop to the ground and run for another tree     hunter answered .     watch carefully .  if the tyrannosaurus continues to pursue the humans  we must distract it further .  otherwise  stand by for me to join you .      hunter saw mc   release the tyrannosaurus   s forearm and land on his feet .  then mc   avoided the big  shuffling feet of the tyrannosaurus and dived behind a big tree trunk .  as the tyrannosaurus bent down  snapping its huge jaws just behind mc    hunter snagged a tree branch in one hand and pulled himself up .   hunter climbed hand over hand as fast as he could .  he drew is legs up to keep them away from the tyrannosaurus .  in only a moment he was out of the predator   s reach .      i am safe     hunter radioed .     acknowledge .         safe     said mc   .     when the dinosaur straightened up to snap at you  i was able to climb to safety .      the tyrannosaurus glared up at hunter  but knew the robot was out of reach .  after a moment  it lumbered away .  hunter watched it go .      it seems to have forgotten the humans     said hunter .     we will watch it a little longer .      the two robots remained motionless and silent as the big predator gradually wandered away .  it was clearly hunting  or at least scavenging  but the robots were of no more interest to it than any other prey .  finally hunter   s senses indicated that the tyrannosaurus was gone .      we will move to the ground and join the humans at the camp     hunter radioed .     i over heard steve and jan  two of the humans  give you second law instructions to this effect .  do you have any objection to this .         no     said mc   .     i am under the second law obligation that you observed .         let us go     said hunter  as he began to climb down .     since i do not want to leave the humans without our company any longer than necessary  we will run .      agreed .        steve jumped off the struthiomimus at the camp and paced anxiously  stretching his legs .  jane also dismounted and looked frantically back through the trees for the robots .  chad remained mounted .      i hope they   re okay     jane muttered .     that whole project got out of control .         at least we   re okay     said chad .     if the robots are okay  then it turned out fine .         wayne disappeared     said steve .      yeah     said chad .     back to our time  i guess .      the three of them waited in silence after that .  steve  too nervous to sit still  began straightening up the camp .  after a long wait  he heard jane gasp      there .  they   re okay .     she ran to meet them .   steve hurried after her and chad rode toward them too .      are they following you .  the tyrannosauruses .     chad asked .     we can keep moving .         not necessary     said hunter .     their pursuit has ended .  since wayne appears to have returned to mojave center  he is no longer an influence under the second law .  so mc   is now cooperative and will remain under second law imperatives from you .         correct     said mc   .   the humans paced the robots back to the camp .  chad finally rode to the corral and dismounted .  mc   waited patiently next to hunter .      i think we should all sit down     said steve  collapsing on the ground under a tree .     that was enough excitement for me .         i haven   t ever been in that much danger before     said chad  grinning as he came back from the corral .     so that   s what real life is like out in the wild  huh .         that was a crazier ride than i ever had before either     said steve .     you handled that real well .         i   m glad you were there to make suggestions .     chad sat down and leaned back against another tree .      hunter     said jane .     whenever you   re ready to interview mc    just say so .         then the three of you are well .     hunter asked .      we   re fine     said steve .     let   s get this under way so we can go home .         very well     said hunter .      mc       said jane .     i instruct you to answer hunter   s questions honestly and completely .         agreed     said mc   .      where are the rest of the components of mc governor .     hunter asked .      i do not know     said mc   .      are they in this time period .     hunter asked .      no .         explain what you do know     said jane .      mc governor made the decision to split into components and flee investigation     said mc   .      under an interpretation of the third law .     hunter asked .      yes .         and you fled into time  as well as using miniaturization to escape detection .         yes .         why don   t you know where the others went .     jane asked .     it seems to me that all of you might need to know  so you could join together again someday .         that was never intended     said mc   .     we knew that we would never meet again .  our flight was intended to preserve our existence  with the knowledge that survival at microscopic size in different time periods would be the best way for all of us to remain safe from harm .         so the component robots chose not to share their destinations in order to handle situations like this .     hunter asked .      yes .  since i am unable to tell you the destinations in time and place of the other components  your catching me does not endanger the others .         i believe i can trace them through the equipment in the bohung institute     said hunter .     however  wayne will already be on that trail .  we will have to deal with him also in apprehending the other component robots .         dr .  nystrom .     jane   s eyes widened .     then we should get going .  he has a head start as it is .         no need to hurry     said hunter .     no matter when we leave here  we will return to the bohung institute right after we left  which is about the same time that wayne will return .         wait a minute     said steve suddenly .     how do you know that .  he can go back to any time he wants  can   t he .         he will not risk going back before he left     said hunt er .     he might run into himself and he is educated enough to know that such a time paradox is too dangerous to risk .  and if he goes   had gone   back just a little before we left  then we would have already run into him back at the institute .  on the other hand  if he goes back much later  we might slip in ahead of him and capture him  so he will try to avoid that .  i am certain that he timed his return just after we left to come here         yeah     steve said slowly .     i get it .  i think .         before we return  i want to run a diagnostic check on mc       said hunter .     the miniaturization and subsequent return to full size has certainly caused fundamental changes .           i instruct you to cooperate  mc       said jane .      agreed .         remain still     said hunter .     i will access the jack at the base of your skull .         do you wish me to shut down .     mc   asked .      that is not necessary at this time .      steve watched curiously as hunter moved behind mc   .  hunter simply placed an index finger against the back of mc     s head .  both robots stood motionless for only a moment .      i ran the test twice     said hunter  withdrawing his finger .     the time travel and miniaturization have created some critically important instabilities .         what kind .     jane asked .      none that will cause a problem now that he is in our custody     said hunter .     certain of his atoms have suffered .  if he were to remain in this time over the years  without returning with us  his unstable atoms would explode when he reached our own time .              steve stared at hunter  who remained impassive .  then he turned to chad and jane for their reactions .  they in turn looked at him and at each other .      explosion .     steve asked .     atoms .         each unstable atom that explodes will do so with nuclear energy     said hunter .     in each component robot  the first explosion will set off the other unstable atoms .  the combination will be of considerable force .         exactly what do you mean by    our own time    .     chad asked .     that   s a vague phrase .         i calculate that the explosions will occur within twenty four to forty eight hours of the time the mc component robots left for the past .         are you saying that if mc   goes back with us  he won   t explode .     jane asked .      yes  that is right     said hunter  with his usual robotic steadiness .     the problem will be neutralized when mc   returns with us in the subatomic particle shower .         but we don   t know where the others are     said chad .     that   s the problem now  isn   t it .         yes     said hunter .     five major nuclear explosions are pending in locations around the world in our own time that no one knows about .         maybe the robots won   t survive that long     said chad .     we   re talking about more than sixty million years .  a lot can happen in that amount of time .         even at the atomic level .     jane asked .      well  the robot   s atoms could wind up almost anywhere .  think about it .  right now  the land mass that will become north america is attached to europe .  south america is completely detached from any other continent .  the western hemisphere doesn   t even exist yet .  neither do mammals or birds as we know them  we   ve talked about this before .  five microscopic robots will have to deal with uncounted generations of hostile microbes .  they might not outlast the dinosaurs  or the woolly mammoths  or even early human years  once they reach the time of humans .         they will not have to survive in robot form to be a threat     said hunter .     if their unstable atoms still exist in any form  the danger of nuclear explosion remains in effect .         the microscopic robots will have a pretty good chance to survive for most of that time     said jane .     they won   t be operating simply by random chance .  their intelligence and stored data will help them make deliberate choices  driven by the third law to keep themselves from harm .         the other danger  of course  is still to be found when their miniaturization ends     said hunter .     especially if some of them return to full size in the human era  when the second law will force them to obey any instructions they receive that do not violate the first law .         but they didn   t explode     said steve .     we were still in mojave center for a while after mc governor disappeared from his position .  right .         that   s true     said jane .     what about that  hunter .         my calculations have a degree of uncertainty     said hunter .     the explosions may take place a little later than i calculated  and  i suspect  not all at once .  this makes the first law weigh on me even more heavily than before .         the robots could be anywhere in our own time     said chad .     under the ocean  deep under the earth .  anywhere .  nuclear explosions that occur a substantial distance underground may not affect any form of life at all .         if the robots are still functioning  they   ll be on the surface     said jane .     they would arrange that deliberately as part of their survival under the third law .         we should return now     said hunter .     we can continue these deliberations later .         all right     said jane .     mc    you will continue to cooperate with us in every way .  you won   t make any attempt to escape our custody or to avoid further examinations .  the first law requires that you be studied .  if wayne makes contact with you again  you will remember to interpret my instructions under the second law in the knowledge that a first law imperative is behind them .         acknowledged     said mc   .      i   ll start packing up the camp     said steve .     the team returned to the bohung institute less than a minute after they had left .  as soon as hunter saw that the particle shower had ended and the process was turned off  he immediately rushed out of the unit .  hunter was hoping to catch wayne in the room  but he was not there .   no one else was either .   steve climbed out next and helped jane .  mc   aided chad .  meanwhile  apparently at hunter   s radioed signal  r .  ishihara entered the room .  ishihara had been waiting outside the room for half a minute  as hunter had instructed before they had left .      has anyone left this room .     hunter asked .      no     said ishihara .     have you completed your mission .         our trip is over but only partly successful     said hunter  with quiet formality .     a new security problem has arisen .  dr .  wayne nystrom may come into f     or attempt to leave .  i understand now that you cooperated with him under the second law earlier .  if at all possible  you must apprehend him and hold him for me under a first law concern .         acknowledged .     ishihara walked into the room and waited patiently .     i heard the equipment in use for several seconds twice between the time of your departure and your return .  perhaps that was he  arriving and leaving again .      hunter nodded impassively .   steve started lifting gear out of the big sphere .  mc   got out and stood motionless .  while steve unpacked the equipment  hunter accessed the records of the unit   s use that were stored in the control panel .      are you finding anything important .     chad asked hunter .      yes     said hunter stiffly .     wayne has come and gone  as ishihara suggested .  let me explain .  i did not dare time our return any closer to when we left .  the first law prevented me from taking a risk as serious as meeting ourselves .  wayne  as a human  was able to take a greater risk with his own life .         you think he got back here ahead of us .     jane asked .     are you sure .         yes .     hunter   s voice had a monotone that he had never used before .     the standard records in the control panel say nothing about additional trips into the past .  that is why i did not see them before .  mc    can you  explain this .         yes .  i was the last of the components to travel .  i erased all the records of the previous trips but could not erase the record of my own .  consequently you were able to track me .      at the odd sound of his voice  everyone turned to listen to hunter .      this time  instead of just reading the control panel  i analyzed power usage and the extent and intensity of the particle showers recorded by the internal monitors of the system .  that process has given me enough information to re create the erased records  using the trips on record to the late cretaceous for calibrations .         what have you found .     jane asked softly .      nine time trips into the past have been taken .  that accounts for the six component robots fleeing  wayne   s trip back to the late cretaceous  and ours .  .  . plus one more .         so he   s been here and gone     said steve .     but you can calculate where each of the component robots went .         yes     said hunter .     the last trip into the past matches one of the other five trips .  it clearly represents wayne   s pursuit of another component robot .         what do we do next .     steve asked .     we have to make sure that mc   is secure     said hunter .     right now  we will all go to mc governor   s office .  i will arrange for a security escort to meet us on the way .         you sound worried     said jane .     what is it .         no matter how long wayne remains in the past  he may come back at any time of his choosing .  this time i will leave ishihara here in the room to apprehend wayne in the expectation that he will come back soon .         that sounds good to me     said steve .      ishihara may catch wayne     said hunter .     however  wayne may anticipate this plan .  he could come back far enough in the future that unpredictable factors will obtain here .  i do not dare interfere with the equipment in any way  the first law will not let me take any risk with his ability to return .  at the moment i want to get mc   away from this room .      ishihara remained on guard in the room .  hunter walked out with mc    followed by the three humans .  he explained to them that he was radioing the city computer for a security detail and vehicle .  when the vehicle arrived  the detail transported everyone to mc governor   s office .   steve saw that a security robot was on duty there .  hunter greeted him briefly out loud  apparently so that the humans could hear what he was saying .     horatio  please be on the alert for dr .  wayne nystrom .  apprehend him and hold him if you can .         agreed     said horatio .   hunter took his own party inside the office and closed the door .      well .     steve said .     now what .  you   re acting a little strange  hunter .         maybe you have forgotten the question of whether or not we would change history by even small actions that we took in the past     said hunter .      i did     steve admitted .     but i don   t see anything different so far .         i don   t  either     said jane .     we have come back safely  haven   t we .         so far     hunter said carefully     i believe that we have returned to the world just as we left it .  that means that none of the changes we caused have brought about noticeable changes .         then the chaos theory applied to time is incorrect     said chad .      precise calculations may have to be re examined     said hunter .     the degree of accuracy is still in question .         something else is bothering you     said jane .     ever since we got back  your manner has been stiff .  what is it .         a little while ago  i accessed the news through the city computer to look for changes     said hunter .     the networks have just reported an unexplained nuclear explosion of considerable size on the island nation of jamaica .  that is where wayne went  after another one of the component robots .      steve felt a tingling sensation .     a nuclear explosion .         it set off tidal waves     said hunter .     they have smashed into port cities allover the caribbean sea  including miami and the florida coast .  the coasts on the gulf of mexico will be affected too .  millions of people have died and others are injured and homeless .      no one spoke for a moment .      wait a minute     said chad .     we only left here a short time ago .  why didn   t we hear about this before we left .         none of us was paying attention to the news     said hunter .     i  for one  was focused on preparing for our trip .  and the news is very recent .         that   s right     said steve .     the trip was all we talked about .         you feel you have failed under the first law     said jane quietly .      correct     said hunter .     the only reason that i have not become completely nonfunctional is that i have had to secure mc   here and inform the three of you in private .  next i shall report my failure under the first law to the governor robot oversight committee  so that they can find another robot to take over my task .  after that  i will shut down .         not so fast     jane said sharply .     under the second law  i order you to hear me out .         what is it .         you may still be able to reverse the situation     said jane .     you   ve already gathered valuable experience from the first trip .  you can do a better job than another robot .  let   s all go after mc   in jamaica back in whatever time he chose .         he went back only a few centuries  well into human history .     hunter looked at her with interest .     you feel i could correct my failures .         the jamaican explosions will never happen if we can get back there and bring mc   home again with us     said steve .     all those lives will be saved .         i see     said hunter cautiously .     we can leave mc   guarded here in this office  where wayne cannot reach him .  however  i must ask you this .  when i hired you three  i thought this trip would require only one quick trip into the past .  my calculations failed in that estimate  as well .  you would be willing to work with me again  even after i failed the first time .         sure .     steve shrugged .      of course     said jane  smiling .      i would     said chad .     but you won   t need a paleontologist just a couple of centuries into the past .  i guess i should say goodbye .      clearly relieved at the new plan  hunter became more natural and spontaneous again .     goodbye  chad .  thank you for your contribution .  we could not have caught mc   without you .  i am authorizing through the city computer that your fee be credited to your account right now .         thank you  hunter     said chad  shaking his hand .     i have much more than my fee .  i was the first human to ride a dinosaur and i   ve seen more live ones than anyone else in my field .     he patted his belt computer .     the data i   ve brought back will make history of its own .      jane threw her arms around chad and hugged him .     goodbye  chad .         goodbye  jane .      steve grinned awkwardly and held out his hand .     chad .      chad shook hands with him .     steve  you   re okay .  i guess i learned a lot about living in the wild on this trip .  you know your stuff .         so do you  chad .     steve punched him on the arm .     you handled that dinosaur stampede real well .         thanks .      chad waved to them all and left the office .      where do we go next  hunter .     steve asked .     i   ll need different equipment this time .         i will have to hire an historian  too     said hunter .     so we will not be leaving right away .  we have to do too much preparation .  you two should indulge in some human comforts  such as a good dinner and a full night   s sleep .         good idea     said steve .      quit stalling  hunter     jane said excitedly .     come on .  where and when is our next destination .         port royal  jamaica  in          said hunter .     the time of sir henry morgan  pirate and privateer on the spanish main .        robot visions  by isaac asimov    i suppose i should start by telling you who i am .  i am a very junior member of the temporal group .  the temporalists  for those of you who have been too busy trying to survive in this harsh world of      to pay much attention to the advance of technology  are the aristocrats of physics these days .   they deal with that most intractable of problems   that of moving through time at a speed different from the steady temporal progress of the universe .  in short  they are trying to develop time travel .   and what am i doing with these people  when i myself am not even a physicist  but merely a    .  well  merely a merely .   despite my lack of qualification  it was actually a remark i made some time before that inspired the temporalists to work out the concept of vpit     virtual paths in time     .   you see  one of the difficulties in traveling through time is that your base does not stay in one place relative to the universe as a whole .  the earth is moving about the sun  the sun about the galactic center  the galaxy about the center of gravity of the local group   well  you get the idea .  if you move one day into the future or the past   just one day   earth has moved some   .   million kilometers in its orbit about the sun .  and the sun has moved in its journey  carrying earth with it  and so has everything else .   therefore  you must move through space as well as through time  and it was my remark that led to a line of argument that showed that this was possible  that one could travel with the space time motion of the earth not in a literal  but in a    virtual    way that would enable a time traveler to remain with his base on earth wherever he went in time .  it would be useless for me to try to explain that mathematically if you have not had temporalist training .  just accept the matter .   it was also a remark of mine that led the temporalists to develop a line of reasoning that showed that travel into the past was impossible .  key terms in the equations would have to rise beyond infinity when the temporal signs were changed .   it made sense .  it was clear that a trip into the past would be sure to change events there at least slightly  and no matter how slight a change might be introduced into the past  it would alter the present  very likely drastically .  since the past should seem fixed  it makes sense that travel back in time is impossible .   the future  however  is not fixed  so that travel into the future and back again from it would be possible .   i was not particularly rewarded for my remarks .  i imagine the temporalist team assumed i had been fortunate in my speculations and it was they who were entirely the clever ones in picking up what i had said and carrying it through to useful conclusions .  i did not resent that  considering the circumstances  but was merely very glad   delighted  in fact   since because of that  i think  they allowed me to continue to work with them and to be part of the project  even though i was merely a   well  merely .   naturally  it took years to work out a practical device for time travel  even after the theory was established  but i don   t intend to write a serious treatise on temporality .  it is my intention to write of only certain parts of the project  and to do so for only the future inhabitants of the planet  and not for our contemporaries .   even after inanimate objects had been sent into the future   and then animals   we were not satisfied .  all objects disappeared  all  it seemed  traveled into the future .  when we sent them short distances into the future   five minutes or five days   they eventually appeared again  seemingly unharmed  unchanged  and  if alive to begin with  still alive and in good health .   but what was wanted was to send something far into the future and bring it back .      we   d have to send it at least two hundred years into the future     said one temporalist .     the important point is to see what the future is like and to have the vision reported back to us .  we have to know whether humanity will survive and under what conditions  and two hundred years should be long enough to be sure .  frankly  i think the chances of survival are poor .  living conditions and the environment about us have deteriorated badly over the last century .       there is no use in trying to describe which temporalist said what .  there were a couple of dozen of them altogether  and it makes no difference to the tale i am telling as to which one spoke at anyone time  even if i were sure i could remember which one said what .  therefore  i shall simply say    said a temporalist     or    one said     or    some of them said     or    another said     and i assure you it will all be sufficiently clear to you .  naturally  i shall specify my own statements and that of one other  but you will see that those exceptions are essential .    another temporalist said rather gloomily     i don   t think i want to know the future  if it means finding out that the human race is to be wiped out or that it will exist only as miserable remnants .         why not .     said another .     we can find out in shorter trips exactly what happened and then do our best to so act  out of our special knowledge  as to change the future in a preferred direction .  the future  unlike the past  is not fixed .      but then the question arose as to who was to go .  it was clear that the temporalists each felt himself or herself to be just a bit too valuable to risk on a technique that might not yet be perfected despite the success of experiments on objects that were not alive  or  if alive  objects that lacked a brain of the incredible complexity that a human being owned .  the brain might survive  but  perhaps  not quite all its complexity might .   i realized that of them all i was least valuable and might be considered the logical candidate .  indeed  i was on the point of raising my hand as a volunteer  but my facial expression must have given me away for one of the temporalists said  rather impatiently     not you .  even you are too valuable .      not very complimentary .      the thing to do     he went on     is to send rg    .      that did make sense .  rg    was a rather old fashioned robot  eminently replaceable .  he could observe and report   perhaps without quite the ingenuity and penetration of a human being   but well enough .  he would be without fear  intent only on following his orders  and he could be expected to tell the truth .   perfect .   i was rather surprised at myself for not seeing that from the start  and for foolishly considering volunteering myself .  perhaps  i thought  i had some sort of instinctive feeling that i ought to put myself into a position where i could serve the others .  in any case  it was rg    that was the logical choice  indeed  the only one .   in some ways  it was not difficult to explain what we needed .  archie  it was customary to call a robot by some common perversion of his serial number  did not ask for reasons  or for guarantees of his safety .  he would accept any order he was capable of understanding and following  with the same lack of emotionality that he would display if asked to raise his hand .  he would have to  being a robot .   the details took time  however .      once you are in the future     one of the senior temporalists said     you may stay for as long as you feel you can make useful observations .  when you are through  you will return to your machine and come back with it to the very moment that you left by adjusting the controls in a manner which we will explain to you .  you will leave and to us it will seem that you will be back a split second later  even though to yourself it may have seemed that you had spent a week in the future  or five years .  naturally  you will have to make sure the machine is stored in a safe place while you are gone  which should not be difficult since it is quite light .  and you will have to remember where you stored the machine and how to get back to it .      what made the briefing even longer lay in the fact that one temporalist after another would remember a new difficulty .  thus  one of them said suddenly     how much do you think the language will have changed in two centuries .      naturally  there was no answer to that and a great debate grew as to whether there might be no chance of communication whatever  that archie would neither understand nor make himself understood .   finally  one temporalist said  rather curtly     see here  the english language has been becoming ever more nearly universal for several centuries and that is sure to continue for two more .  nor has it changed significantly in the last two hundred years  so why should it do so in the next two hundred .  even if it has  there are bound to be scholars who would be able to speak what they might call    ancient english .      and even if there were not  archie would still be able to make useful observations .  determining whether a functioning society exists does not necessarily require talk .      other problems arose .  what if he found himself facing hostility .  what if the people of the future found and destroyed the machine  either out of malevolence or ignorance .   one temporalist said     it might be wise to design a temporal engine so miniaturized that it could be carried in one   s clothing .  under such conditions one could at any time leave a dangerous position very quickly .         even if it were possible at all     snapped another     it would probably take so long to design so miniaturized a machine that we   or rather our successors   would reach a time two centuries hence without the necessity of using a machine at all .  no  if an accident of some sort takes place  archie simply won   t return and we   ll just have to try again .      this was said with archie present  but that didn   t matter  of course .  archie could contemplate being marooned in time  or even his own destruction  with equanimity  provided he were following orders .  the second law of robotics  which makes it necessary for a robot to follow orders  takes precedence over the third  which makes it necessary for him to protect his own existence .   in the end  of course  all had been said  and no one could any longer think of a warning  or an objection  or a possibility that had not been thoroughly aired .   archie repeated all he had been told with robotic calmness and precision  and the next step was to teach him how to use the machine .  and he learned that  too  with robotic calmness and precision .   you must understand that the general public did not know  at that time  that time travel was being investigated .  it was not an expensive project as long as it was a matter of working on theory  but experimental work had punished the budget and was bound to punish it still more .  this was most uncomfortable for scientists engaged in an endeavor that seemed totally    blue sky .      if there was a large failure  given the state of the public purse  there would be a loud outcry on the part of the people  and the project might be doomed .  the temporalists all agreed  without even the necessity of debate  that only success could be reported  and that until such a success was recorded  the public would have to learn very little  if anything at all .  and so this experiment  the crucial one  was heart stopping for everyone .   we gathered at an isolated spot of the semi desert  an artfully protected area given over to project four .   even the name was intended to give no real hint of the nature of the work  but it always struck me that most people thought of time as a kind of fourth dimension and that someone ought therefore guess what we were doing .  yet no one ever did  to my knowledge .    then  at a certain moment  at which time there was a great deal of breath holding  archie  inside the machine  raised one hand to signify he was about to make his move .  half a breath later   if anyone had been breathing   the machine flickered .   it was a very rapid flicker .  i wasn   t sure that i had observed it .  it seemed to me that i had merely assumed it ought to flicker  if it returned to nearly the instant at which it left   and i saw what i was convinced i ought to see .  i meant to ask the others if they  too  had seen a flicker  but i always hesitated to address them unless they spoke to me first .  they were very important people  and i was merely   but i   ve said that .  then  too  in the excitement of questioning archie  i forgot the matter of the flicker .  it wasn   t at all important .   so brief an interval was there between leaving and returning that we might well have thought that he hadn   t left at all  but there was no question of that .  the machine had definitely deteriorated .  it had simply faded .   nor was archie  on emerging from the machine  much better off .  he was not the same archie that had entered that machine .  there was a shopworn look about him  a dullness to his finish  a slight unevenness to his surface where he might have undergone collisions  an odd manner in the way he looked about as though he were re experiencing an almost forgotten scene .  i doubt that there was a single person there who felt for one moment that archie had not been absent  as far as his own sensation of time was concerned  for a long interval .   in fact  the first question he was asked was     how long have you been away .      archie said     five years  sir .  it was a time interval that had been mentioned in my instructions and i wished to do a thorough job .         come  that   s a hopeful fact     said one temporalist .     if the world were a mass of destruction  surely it would not have taken five years to gather that fact .      and yet not one of them dared say  well  archie  was the earth a mass of destruction .   they waited for him to speak  and for a while  he also waited  with robotic politeness  for them to ask .  after a while  however  archie   s need to obey orders  by reporting his observations  overcame whatever there was in his positronic circuits that made it necessary for him to seem polite .   archie said      all was well on the earth of the future .  the social structure was intact and working well .         intact and working well .     said one temporalist  acting as though he were shocked at so heretical a notion .     everywhere .         the inhabitants of the world were most kind .  they took me to every part of the globe .  all was prosperous and peaceful .      the temporalists looked at each other .  it seemed easier for them to believe that archie was wrong  or mistaken  than that the earth of the future was prosperous and peaceful .  it had seemed to me always that  despite all optimistic statements to the contrary  it was taken almost as an article of faith  that earth was on the point of social  economic  and  perhaps  even physical destruction .   they began to question him thoroughly .  one shouted     what about the forests .  they   re almost gone .         there was a huge project     said archie     for the reforestation of the land  sir .  wilderness has been restored where possible .  genetic engineering has been used imaginatively to restore wildlife where related species existed in zoos or as pets .  pollution is a thing of the past .  the world of      is a world of natural peace and beauty .         you are sure of all this .     asked a temporalist .      no spot on earth was kept secret .  i was shown all i asked to see .      another temporalist said  with sudden severity      archie  listen to me .  it may be that you have seen a ruined earth  but hesitate to tell us this for fear we will be driven to despair and suicide .  in your eagerness to do us no harm  you may be lying to us .  this must not happen  archie .  you must tell us the truth .      archie said  calmly     i am telling the truth  sir .  if i were lying  no matter what my motive for it might be  my positronic potentials would be in an abnormal state .  that could be tested .         he   s right there     muttered a temporalist .   he was tested on the spot .  he was not allowed to say another word while this was done .  i watched with interest while the potentiometers recorded their findings  which were then analyzed by computer .  there was no question about it .  archie was perfectly normal .  he could not be lying .   he was then questioned again .     what about the cities .         there are no cities of our kind  sir .  life is much more decentralized in      than with us  in the sense that there are no large and concentrated clumps of humanity .  on the other hand  there is so intricate a communication network that humanity is all one loose clump  so to speak .         and space .  has space exploration been renewed .      archie said     the moon is quite well developed  sir .  it is an inhabited world .  there are space settlements in orbit about the earth and about mars .  there are settlements being carved out in the asteroid belt .         you were told all this .     asked one temporalist  suspiciously .      this is not a matter of hearsay  sir .  i have been in space .  i remained on the moon for two months .  i lived on a space settlement about mars for a month  and visited both phobos and mars itself .  there is some hesitation about colonizing mars .  there are opinions that it should be seeded with lower forms of life and left to itself without the intervention of the earthpeople .  i did not actually visit the asteroid belt .      one temporalist said     why do you suppose they were so nice to you  archie .  so cooperative .         i received the impression  sir     said archie     that they had some notion i might be arriving .  a distant rumor .  a vague belief .  they seemed to have been waiting for me .      did they say they had expected you to arrive .  did they say there were records that we had sent you forward in time .         no  sir .         did you ask them about it .         yes  sir .  it was impolite to do so but i had been ordered carefully to observe everything i could  so i had to ask them   but they refused to tell me .      another temporalist put in     were there many other things they refused to tell you .         a number  sir .      one temporalist stroked his chin thoughtfully at this point and said     then there must be something wrong about all this .  what is the population of the earth in       archie .  did they tell you that .         yes  sir .  i asked .  there are just under a billion people on earth in      .  there are     million in space .  the numbers on earth are stable .  those in space are growing .         ah      said a temporalist     but there are nearly ten billion people on earth now  with half of them in serious misery .  how did these people of the future get rid of nearly nine billion .         i asked them that  sir .  they said it was a sad time .         a sad time .         yes  sir .         in what way .         they did not say  sir .  they simply said it was a sad time and would say no more .      one temporalist who was of african origin said coldly     what kind of people did you see in      .         what kind  sir .         skin color .  shape of eyes .      archie said     it was in      as it is today  sir .  there were different kinds  different shades of skin color  hair form  and so on .  the average height seemed greater than it is today  though i did not study the statistics .  the people seemed younger  stronger  healthier .  in fact  i saw no undernourishment  no obesity  no illness   but there was a rich variety of appearances .         no genocide  then .         no signs of it  sir     said archie .  he went on     there were also no signs of crime or war or repression .         well     said one temporalist  in a tone as though he were reconciling himself  with difficulty  to good news     it seems like a happy ending .         a happy ending  perhaps     said another     but it   s almost too good to accept .  it   s like a return of eden .  what was done  or will be done  to bring it about .  i don   t like that    sad time .             of course     said a third     there   s no need for us to sit about and speculate .  we can send archie one hundred years into the future  fifty years into the future .  we can find out  for what it   s worth  just what happened  i mean  just what will happen .         i don   t think so  sir     said archie .     they told me quite specifically and carefully that there are no records of anyone from the past having arrived earlier than their own time   the day i arrived .  it was their opinion that if any further investigations were made of the time period between now and the time i arrived  that the future would be changed .      there was almost a sickening silence .  archie was sent away and cautioned to keep everything firmly in mind for further questioning .  i half expected them to send me away  too  since i was the only person there without an advanced degree in temporal engineering  but they must have grown accustomed to me  and i  of course  didn   t suggest on my own that i leave .      the point is     said one temporalist     that it is a happy ending .  anything we do from this point on might spoil it .  they were expecting archie to arrive  they were expecting him to report  they didn   t tell him anything they didn   t want him to report  so we   re still safe .  things will develop as they have been .         it may even be     said another  hopefully     that the knowledge of archie   s arrival and the report they sent him back to make helped develop the happy ending .         perhaps  but if we do anything else  we may spoil things .  i prefer not to think about the sad time they speak of  but if we try something now  that sad time may still come and be even worse than it was   or will be   and the happy ending won   t develop  either .  i think we have no choice but to abandon temporal experiments and not talk about them  either .  announce failure .         that would be unbearable .         it   s the only safe thing to do .         wait     said one .     they knew archie was coming  so there must have been a report that the experiments were successful .  we don   t have to make failures of ourselves .         i don   t think so     said still another .     they heard rumors  they had a distant notion .  it was that sort of thing  according to archie .  i presume there may be leaks  but surely not an outright announcement .      and that was how it was decided .  for days  they thought  and occasionally discussed the matter  but with greater and greater trepidation .  i could see the result coming with inexorable certainty .  i contributed nothing to the discussion  of course   they scarcely seemed to know i was there   but there was no mistaking the gathering apprehension in their voices .  like those biologists in the very early days of genetic engineering who voted to limit and hedge in their experiments for fear that some new plague might be inadvertently loosed on unsuspecting humanity  the temporalists decided  in terror  that the future must not be tampered with or even searched .   it was enough  they said  that they now knew there would be a good and wholesome society  two centuries hence .  they must not inquire further  they dared not interfere by the thickness of a fingernail  lest they ruin all .  and they retreated into theory only .   one temporalist sounded the final retreat .  he said     someday  humanity will grow wise enough  and develop ways of handling the future that are subtle enough to risk observation and perhaps even manipulation along the course of time  but the moment for that has not yet come .  it is still long in the future .     and there had been a whisper of applause .   who was i  less than any of those engaged in project four  that i should disagree and go my own way .  perhaps it was the courage i gained in being so much less than they were   the valor of the insufficiently advanced .  i had not had initiative beaten out of me by too much specialization or by too long a life of too deep thought .   at any rate  i spoke to archie a few days later  when my own work assignments left me some free time .  archie knew nothing about training or about academic distinctions .  to him  i was a man and a master  like any other man and master  and he spoke to me as such .   i said to him     how did these people of the future regard the people of their past .  were they censorious .  did they blame them for their follies and stupidities .      archie said     they did not say anything to make me feel this  sir .  they were amused by the simplicity of my construction and by my existence  and it seemed to me they smiled at me and at the people who constructed me  in a good humored way .  they themselves had no robots .         no robots at all  archie .         they said there was nothing comparable to myself  sir .  they said they needed no metal caricatures of humanity .         and you didn   t see any .         none  sir .  in all my time there  i saw not one .      i thought about that a while  then said     what did they think of other aspects of our society .         i think they admired the past in many ways  sir .  they showed me museums dedicated to what they called the    period of unrestrained growth .      whole cities had been turned into museums .         you said there were no cities in the world of two centuries hence  archie .  no cities in our sense .         it was not their cities that were museums  sir  but the relics of ours .  au of manhattan island was a museum  carefully preserved and restored to the period of its peak greatness .  i was taken through it with several guides for hours  because they wanted to ask me questions about authenticity .  i could help them very little  for i have never been to manhattan .  they seemed proud of manhattan .  there were other preserved cities  too  as well as carefully preserved machinery of the past  libraries of printed books  displays of past fashions in clothing  furniture  and other minutiae of daily life  and so on .  they said that the people of our time had not been wise but they had created a firm base for future advance .         and did you see young people .  very young people  i mean .  infants .         no  sir .         did they talk about any .         no  sir .      i said     very well  archie .  now  listen to me        if there was one thing i understood better than the temporalists  it was robots .  robots were simply black boxes to them  to be ordered about  and to be left to maintenance men   or discarded   if they went wrong .  i  however  understood the positronic circuitry of robots quite well  and i could handle archie in ways my colleagues would never suspect .  and i did .   i was quite sure the temporalists would not question him again  out of their newfound dread of interfering with time  but if they did  he would not tell them those things i felt they ought not to know .  and archie himself would not know that there was anything he was not telling them .   i spent some time thinking about it  and i grew more and more certain in my mind as to what had happened in the course of the next two centuries .   you see  it was a mistake to send archie .  he was a primitive robot  and to him people were people .  he did not   could not   differentiate .  it did not surprise him that human beings had grown so civilized and humane .  his circuitry forced him  in any case  to view all human beings as civilized and human  even as god like  to use an old fashioned phrase .   the temporalists themselves  being human  were surprised and even a bit incredulous at the robot vision presented by archie  one in which human beings had grown so noble and good .  but  being human  the temporalists wanted to believe what they heard and forced themselves to do so against their own common sense .   i  in my way  was more intelligent than the temporalists  or perhaps merely more clear eyed .   i asked myself if population decreased from ten billion to one billion in the course of two centuries  why did it not decrease from ten billion to zero .  there would be so little difference between the two alternatives .   who were the billion who survived .  they were stronger than the other nine billion  perhaps .  more enduring .  more resistant to privation .  and they were also more sensible  more rational  and more virtuous than the nine billion who died as was quite clear from archie   s picture of the world of two hundred years hence .   in short  then  were they human at all .   they smiled at archie in mild derision and boasted that they had no robots  that they needed no metal caricatures of humanity .   what if they had organic duplicates of humanity instead .  what if they had humaniform robots  robots so like human beings as to be indistinguishable from them  at least to the eyes and senses of a robot like archie .  what if the people of the future were humaniform robots  all of them  robots that had survived some overwhelming catastrophe that human beings had not .   there were no babies .  archie had seen none .  to be sure  population was stable and long lived on earth  so there would be few babies in any case .  those few would be taken care of  made much of  be well guarded  and might not be distributed carelessly through society .  but archie had been on the moon for two months and population there was growing   and he had still seen no babies .   perhaps these people of the future were constructed rather than born .   and perhaps this was a good thing .  if human beings had died out through their own rages  hatreds  and stupidities  they had at least left behind a worthy successor  a kind of intelligent being that valued the past  preserved it  and moved on into the future  doing their best to fulfill the aspirations of humanity  in building a better  kinder world and in moving out into space perhaps more efficiently than we    real    human beings would have .   how many intelligent beings in the universe had died out leaving no successor .  perhaps we were the first ever to leave such a legacy .   we had a right to feel proud .   ought i to tell all this to the world .  or even to the temporalists .  i did not consider that for a moment .   for one thing  they were likely not to believe me .  for another  if they did believe me  in their rage at the thought of being replaced by robots of any kind  would they not turn on them and destroy every robot in the world and refuse ever to build others .  this would mean that archie   s vision of the future  and my own vision  would never come to pass .  that  however  would not stop the conditions that were to destroy humanity .  it would just prevent a replacement  stop another group of beings  made by humans and honoring humans  from carrying human aspirations and dreams through all the universe .   i did not want that to happen .  i wanted to make sure archie   s vision  and my own improvement of it  would come to pass .   i am writing this  therefore  and i will see to it that it will be hidden  and kept safe  so that it will be opened only two hundred years from now  a little sooner than the time at which archie will arrive .  let the humaniform robots know that they should treat him well and send him home safely  carrying with him only the information that would cause the temporalists to decide to interfere with time no more  so that the future can develop in its own tragic happy way .   and what makes me so sure i am right .  because i am in a unique position to know that i am .   i have said several times that i am inferior to the temporalists .  at least i am inferior to them in their eyes  though this very inferiority makes me more clear eyed in certain respects  as i have said before  and gives me a better understanding of robots  as i have also said before .   because  you see  i  too  am a robot .   i am the first humaniform robot  and it is on me and on those of my kind that are yet to be constructed that the future of humanity depends .
