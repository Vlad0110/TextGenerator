this book is not part of the foundation series  the robot series  or the empire series .  it stands independently .  i just thought i d warn you of that to avoid misapprehension .  of course  i might someday write another novel tying this one to the others  but  then again  i might not .  after all  for how long can i keep flogging my mind to make it work out these complexities of future history .   another point .  i made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing  to be clear .  i have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally  or in any of the other modes that might  if i were good enough  get me a pulitzer prize .  i would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers  and the professional critics  well  they can do whatever they wish .   however  my stories write themselves  i m afraid  and in this one i was rather appalled to find out that i was writing it in two strands .  one set of events was taking place in the story s present  and another set was taking place in the story s past  but steadily approaching the present .  i am sure you will have no trouble following the pattern  but since we are all friends  i thought i would let you know .       nemesis      prologue    he sat there alone  enclosed .   outside were the stars  and one particular star with its small system of worlds .  he could see it in his mind s eye  more clearly than he would see it in reality if he merely de opacified the window .   a small star  pinkish red  the color of blood and destruction  and named appropriately .   nemesis .   nemesis  the goddess of divine retribution .   he thought again of the story he had once heard when he was young  a legend  a myth  a tale of a worldwide deluge that wiped out a sinful degenerate humanity  leaving one family with which to start anew .   no flood  this time .  just nemesis .   the degeneration of humanity had returned and the nemesis that would be visited upon it was an appropriate judgment .  it would not be a deluge .  nothing as simple as a deluge .   even for the remnant who might escape  where would they go .  why was it he felt no sorrow .  humanity could not continue as it was .  it was dying slowly through its own misdeeds .  if it exchanged a slow excruciating death for a much faster one  was that a cause for sorrow .   here  actually circling nemesis  a planet .  circling the planet  a satellite .  circling the satellite  rotor .   that ancient deluge carried a few to safety in an ark .  he had only the vaguest idea of what the ark was  but rotor was its equivalent .  it carried a sampling of humanity who would remain safe and from which a new and far better world would be built .   but for the old world  there would be only nemesis .   he thought of it again .  a red dwarf star  moving on its inexorable path .  itself and its worlds were safe .  not so earth .   nemesis was on its way  earth .   wreaking its divine retribution .       one  marlene      .     marlene had last seen the solar system when she was a little over one year old .  she didn t remember it  of course .   she had read a great deal about it  but none of the reading had ever made her feel that it could ever have been part of her  nor she a part of it .   in all her fifteen years of life  she remembered only rotor .  she had always thought of it as a large world .  it was eight kilometers across  after all .  every once in a while since she was ten  once a month when she could manage it  she had walked around it for the exercise  and sometimes had taken the low gravity paths so she could skim a little .  that was always fun .  skim or walk  rotor went on and on  with its buildings  its parks  its farms  and mostly its people .   it took her a whole day to do it  but her mother didn t mind .  she said rotor was perfectly safe .   not like earth   she would say  but she wouldn t say why earth was not safe .   never mind   she would say .   it was the people marlene liked least .  the new census  they said  would show sixty thousand of them on rotor .  too many .  far too many .  everyone of them showing a false face .  marlene hated seeing those false faces and knowing there was something different inside .  nor could she say anything about it .  she had tried sometimes when she had been younger  but her mother had grown angry and told her she must never say things like that .   as she got older  she could see the falseness more clearly  but it bothered her less .  she had learned to take it for granted and spend as much time as possible with herself and her own thoughts .   lately  her thoughts were often on erythro  the planet they had been orbiting almost all her life .  she didn t know why these thoughts were coming to her  but she would skim to the observation deck at odd hours and just stare at the planet hungrily  wanting to be there  right there on erythro .   her mother would ask her  impatiently  why she should want to be on an empty barren planet  but she never had an answer for that .  she didn t know .   i just want to   she would say .   she was watching it now  alone on the observation deck .  rotorians hardly ever came here .  they had seen it all  marlene guessed  and for some reason they didn t have her interest in erythro .   there it was  partly in light  partly dark .  she had a dim memory of being held to watch it swim into view  seeing it every once in a while  always larger  as rotor slowly approached all those years ago .   was it a real memory .  after all  she had been getting on toward four then  so it might be .   but now that memory  real or not  was overlaid by other thoughts  by an increasing realization  of just how large a planet was .  erythro was over twelve thousand kilometers across  not eight kilometers .  she couldn t grasp that size .  it didn t look that large on the screen and she couldn t imagine standing on it and seeing for hundreds  or even thousands  of kilometers .  but she knew she wanted to .  very much .   aurinel wasn t interested in erythro  which was disappointing .  he said he had other things to think of  like getting ready for college .  he was seventeen and a half .  marlene was only just past fifteen .  that didn t make much difference  she thought rebelliously  since girls developed more quickly .   at least they should .  she looked down at herself and thought  with her usual dismay and disappointment  that somehow she still looked like a kid  short and stubby .   she looked at erythro again  large and beautiful and softly red where it was lit .  it was large enough to be a planet but actually  she knew  it was a satellite .  it circled megas  and it was megas  much larger still  that was really the planet  even though everyone called erythro by that name .  the two of them together  megas and erythro  and rotor  too  circled  the star nemesis .    marlene .   marlene heard the voice behind her and knew that it was aurinel .  she had grown increasingly tongue tied with him of late  and the reason for it embarrassed her .  she loved the way he pronounced her name .  he pronounced it correctly .  three syllables  mar  lay  nuh  with a little trill to the  r .   it warmed her just to hear it .   she turned and mumbled   hi  aurinel   and tried not to turn red .  he grinned at her .   you re staring at erythro  aren t you .    she didn t answer that .  of course that s what she would be doing .  everyone knew how she felt about erythro .   how come you re here .    tell me you were looking for me  she thought .    aurinel said   your mother sent me .    oh well .    why .     she said you were in a bad mood and every time you felt sorry for yourself  you came up here  and i was to come and get you because she said it would just make you grumpier to stay here .  so why are you in a bad mood .     i m not .  and if i am  i have reasons .     what reasons .  come on  now .  you re not a little kid any more .  you ve got to be able to express yourself .    marlene lifted her eyebrows .   i am quite articulate  thank you .  my reasons are that i would like to travel .    aurinel laughed .   you ve traveled  marlene .  you ve traveled more than two light years .  no one in the whole history of the solar system has ever traveled even a small fraction of a light year .    except us .  so you have no right to complain .  you re marlene insigna fisher  galactic traveler .    marlene suppressed a giggle .  insigna was her mother s maiden name and whenever aurinel said her three names in full  he would salute and make a face  and he hadn t done that in a long time .  she guessed it was because he was getting close to being a grown up and he had to practice being dignified .   she said   i can t remember that trip at all .  you know i can t  and not being able to remember it means it doesn t matter .  we re just here  over two light years from the solar system  and we re never going back .     how do you know .     come on  aurinel .  do you ever hear anyone talk about going back .     well  even if we don t  who cares .  earth is a crowded world and the whole solar system was getting crowded and used up .  we re better off out here  masters of all we survey .     no  we re not .  we survey erythro  but we don t go down there to be its masters .     sure we do .  we have a fine working dome on erythro .  you know that .     not for us .  just for some scientists .  i m talking about us .  they don t let us go down there .     in time   said aurinel cheerfully .    sure  when i m an old woman .  or dead .     things aren t that bad .  anyway  come on out of here and into the world and make your mother happy .  i can t stay here .  i have things to do .  dolorette   marlene felt a buzzing in her ears and she didn t hear exactly what aurinel said after that .  it was enough to hear  dolorette .   marlene hated dolorette  who was tall and  and vacuous .   but what was the use .  aurinel had been hanging around her  and marlene knew  just by looking at him  exactly how he felt about dolorette .  and now he had been sent to find her and he was just wasting his time .  she could tell that was how he felt and she could also tell how anxious he was to get back to that  to that dolorette .   why could she always tell .  it was so hateful sometimes .    quite suddenly  marlene wanted to hurt him  to find words to give him pain .  true words  though .  she wouldn t lie to him .  she said   we re never going back to the solar system .  i know why not .     oh  why s that .   when marlene  hesitating  said nothing  he added   mysteries .    marlene was caught .  she was not supposed to say this .  she mumbled   i don t want to say .  i m not supposed to know .   but she did want to say .  at the moment she wanted everyone to feel bad .    but you ll tell me .  we re friends  aren t we .     are we .   marlene asked .  she said   okay  i ii tell you .  we re not ever going back because earth is going to be destroyed .    aurinel didn t react as she had expected .  he burst into a loud squawk of a laugh .  it took him a while to settle down  and she glared at him indignantly .    marlene   he said   where did you hear that .  you ve been viewing thrillers .     i have not .     but what makes you say anything like that .     because i know .  i can tell .  from what people say  but don t say  and what they do  when they don t know they re doing it .  and from things the computer tells me when i ask the right questions .     like what things it tells you .     i m not going to tell you .      isn t it possible .  just barely possible   and he held up two fingers very closely together   that you re imagining things .     no  it isn t possible .  earth won t be destroyed right away  maybe not for thousands of years  but it s going to be destroyed .   she nodded solemnly  her face intense .   and nothing can stop it .    marlene turned and walked away  angry at aurinel for doubting her .  no  not doubting her .  it was more than that .  he thought she was out of her mind .  and there it was .  she had said too much and had gained nothing by it .  everything was wrong .   aurinel was staring after her .  the laughter had ceased on his boyishly handsome face and a certain uneasiness was creasing the skin between his eyebrows .       .     eugenia insigna had grown middle aged during the trip to nemesis  and in the course of the long stay after arrival .  over the years she had periodically warned herself  this is for life  and for our children s lives into the unseen future .   the thought always weighed her down .   why .  she had known this as the inevitable consequence of what they had done from the moment rotor had left the solar system .  everyone on rotor  volunteers all  had known it .  those who had not had the heart for eternal separation had left rotor before takeoff  and among those who had left was    eugenia did not finish that thought .  it often came  and she tried never to finish it .   now they were here on rotor  but was rotor  home  .  it was home for marlene  she had never known anything else .  but for herself  for eugenia .  home was earth and moon and sun and mars and all the worlds that had accompanied humanity through its history and prehistory .  they had accompanied life as long as there had been life .  the thought that  home  was not here on rotor clung to her even now .   but  then  she had spent the first twenty eight years of her life in the solar system and she had done graduate work on earth itself in her twenty first to twenty third years .   odd how the thought of earth periodically came to her and lingered .  she hadn t liked earth .  she hadn t liked its crowds  its poor organization  its combination of anarchy in the important things and governmental force in the little things .  she hadn t liked its assaults of bad weather  its scars over the land  its wasteful ocean .  she had returned to rotor with an overwhelming gratitude  and with a new husband to whom she had tried to sell her dear little turning world  to make its orderly comfort as pleasant to him as it was to her  who had been born into it .   but he had only been conscious of its smallness .   you run out of it in six months   he had said .   she herself hadn t held his interest for much longer than that .  oh well  it would work itself out .  not for her .  eugenia insigna was lost forever between worlds .  but for the children .  eugenia had been born to rotor and could live without earth .  marlene had been born  or almost born  to rotor alone and could live without the solar system  except for the vague feeling that she had originated there .  her children would not know even that  and would not care .  to them  earth and the solar system would be a matter of myth  and erythro would have become a rapidly developing world .   she hoped so .  marlene had this odd fixation on erythro already  though it had only developed in the last few months and might leave just as quickly as it had come .   altogether  it would be the height of ingratitude to complain .  no one could possibly have imagined a habitable world in orbit about nemesis .  the conditions that created habitability were remarkable .  estimate those probabilities and throw in the nearness of nemesis to the solar system and you would have to deny that it could possibly have happened .   she turned to the day s reports  which the computer was waiting  with the infinite patience of its tribe  to give her .   yet before she could ask  her receptionist signaled and a soft voice came from the small button speaker pinned to the left shoulder of her garment   aurinel pampas wishes to see you .  he has no appointment .    insigna grimaced  then remembered that she had sent him after marlene .  she said   let him come in .    she cast a quick look at the mirror .  she could see that her appearance was reasonable .  to herself  she seemed to look younger than her forty two years .  she hoped she looked the same way to others .   it seemed silly to worry about her appearance because a seventeen year old boy was about to enter  but eugenia insigna had seen poor marlene looking at that boy and she knew what that look portended .  it didn t seem to insigna that aurinel  who was so fond of his own appearance  would ever think of marlene  who had never been able to rid herself of her childhood pudginess  in any way other than as an amusing child .  still  if marlene had to face failure in this  let her not feel that her mother had contributed to that failure in any way and had been anything but charming to the boy .   she ll blame me anyway  thought insigna with a sigh  as the boy walked in with a smile that had not yet outgrown its adolescent shyness .    well  aurinel   she said .   did you find marlene .     yes  ma am .  right where you said she d be  and i told her you wanted her out of there .      and how is she feeling .     if you want to know  dr .  insigna  i can t tell if it s depression or something else  but she has a rather funny idea in her head .  i don t know that she d like my telling you about it .     well  i don t like setting spies on her either  but she frequently has strange ideas and she worries me .  please tell me what she said .    aurinel shook his head .    all right  but don t tell her i said anything .  this one is really crazy .  she said that earth was going to be destroyed .    he waited for insigna to laugh .  she did not .  instead  she exploded .   what .  what made her say that .     i don t know  dr .  insigna .  she s a very bright kid  you know  but she gets these funny ideas .  or she may have been putting me on .    insigna cut in .   she may have been doing exactly that .  she has a strange sense of humor .  so listen  i don t want you to repeat this to anyone else .  i don t want silly stories to get started .  do you understand .     certainly  ma am .     i m serious .  not a word .   aurinel nodded briskly .    but thanks for telling me  aurinel .  it was important to do so .  i ll speak to marlene and find out what s bothering her  and i won t let her know you told me .     thank you   said aurinel .   but just one thing  ma am .     what s that .     is earth going to be destroyed .    insigna stared at him  then forced a laugh .   of course not .  you may go now .    insigna looked after him and wished earnestly that she could have managed a more convincing denial .       .     janus pitt made an impressive appearance  which had helped him in his rise to power as commissioner of rotor .  in the early days of the formation of the settlements  there had been a push for people of no more than average height .  there had been thoughts of having a smaller per capita requirement for room and resources .  eventually  the caution had been deemed unnecessary and had been abandoned  but the bias was still there in the genes of the early settlements and the average rotorian remained a centimeter or two shorter than the average citizens of later settlements .   pitt was tall  though  with iron gray hair  and a long face  and deep blue eyes  and a body that was still in good shape  despite the fact that he was fifty six .   pitt looked up and smiled as eugenia insigna entered  but felt the usual small surge of uneasiness .  there was something always uneasy making about eugenia  even wearying .  she had these causes  capital c  that were hard to deal with .    thank you for seeing me  janus   she said   on such short notice .    pitt placed his computer on hold  and leaned back in his chair  deliberately producing an air of relaxation .    come   he said   there s no formality between us .  we go back a long way .     and have shared a great deal   said insigna .    so we have   said pitt .    and how is your daughter .     it s about her i wish to speak  as a matter of fact .  are we shielded .    pitt s eyebrows arched .   why shielded .  what is there to shield and from whom .    the very question activated pitt s realization of the odd position in which rotor found itself .  to all practical purposes  it was alone in the universe .  the solar system was more than two light years away  and no other intelligence bearing worlds might exist within hundreds of light years or  for all anyone knew  billions of light years in any direction .   rotorians might have fits of loneliness and uncertainty  but they were free of any fear of outside interference .  well  almost any fear  thought pitt .   insigna said   you know what there is to shield .  it was you who have always insisted on secrecy .    pitt activated the shield and said    are we to take that up again .  please  eugenia  it s all settled .  it was settled when we left fourteen years ago .  i know that you brood about it now and then      brood about it .  why not .  it s my star   and her arm flailed outward as if in the direction of nemesis .   it s my responsibility .    pitt s jaw tightened .  do we have to go through all this again .  he thought .   aloud  he said   we re shielded .  now  what s bothering you .     marlene .  my daughter .  somehow she knows .     knows what .     about nemesis and the solar system .     how could she know .  unless you ve told her .    insigna spread her arms helplessly .   of course i didn t tell her  but i don t have to .  i don t know how it is  but somehow marlene seems to hear and see everything .  and from the little things she hears and sees  she works things out .  she s always been able to do it  but in the last year it s grown much worse .     well then  she guesses  and sometimes she makes lucky guesses .  tell her she s wrong  and see that she doesn t talk about it .     but she s already told a young man  who came to tell me .  that s how i know .  aurinel pampas .  he s a friend of the family .     ah yes .  i m aware of him  somewhat .  simply tell him not to listen to fantasies made up by a little girl .     she s not a little girl .  she s fifteen .     to him  she s a little girl  i assure you .  i said i m aware of the young man .  i m under the impression he s pushing adulthood very hard and i remember  when i was his age  that fifteen year old girls were beneath contempt  especially if they were     insigna said bitterly   i understand .  especially if they are short  plump  and plain .  does it matter that she s highly intelligent .     to you and to me .  certainly .  to aurinel  certainly not .  if necessary  i ll talk to the boy .  you talk to marlene .  tell her the idea is ridiculous  that it isn t true  and that she must not spread disturbing fairy tales .     but what if it is true .     that s beside the point .  look  eugenia  you and i have concealed this possibility for years  and it would be better if we continued to conceal it .  if it gets around  it will be exaggerated  and there will be rising sentiment about the matter  useless sentiment .  it will only distract us from the job that has occupied our time ever since we left the solar system  and which will continue to occupy us for generations  perhaps .    she looked at him  shocked  unbelieving .   have you really no feeling for the solar system  for earth  the world on which humanity originated .     yes  eugenia  i have all sorts of feelings .  but they re visceral and i can t let them sway me .  we left the solar system because we thought it was time for humanity to spread outward .  others  i m sure  will follow  maybe they are already doing so .  we have made humanity a galactic phenomenon and we mustn t think in terms of a single planetary system any more .  our job is here .     they stared at each other  then eugenia said  with a touch of hopelessness   you ll talk me down again .  you ve talked me down for so many years .     yes  but next year i ll have to again  and the year after .  you won t stay down  eugenia  and you tire me .  the first time should have been enough .   and he turned away  back to his computer .       two  nemesis      .     the first time he had talked her down had been sixteen years ago in the year       that exciting year in which the possibilities of the galaxy had opened up for them .   janus pitt s hair was a dark brown then  and he was not yet commissioner of rotor  though everyone spoke of him as the up and coming man .  he did head the department of exploration and commerce  however  and the far probe was his responsibility  and  to a large extent  the result of his actions .   it was the first attempt to push matter through space with a hyperassisted drive .   as far as was known  only rotor had developed hyper assistance and pitt had been the strongest proponent of secrecy .   he had said at a meeting of the council .   the solar system is crowded .  there are more space settlements than can easily be found room for .  even the asteroid belt is only an amelioration .  it will be uncomfortably crowded soon enough .  what s more  each settlement has its own ecological balance and we are drifting apart in that respect .  commerce is being throttled for fear of picking up someone else s strains of parasites or pathogens .    the only solution  fellow councillors  is to leave the solar system  without fanfare  without warning .  let us leave and find a new home  where we can build a new world  with our own brand of humanity  our own society  our own way of life .  this can t be done without hyper assistance  which we have .  other settlements will eventually learn the technique and will leave  too .  the solar system will be a dandelion gone to seed  its various components drifting in space .    but if we go first  we will find a world  perhaps  before others follow .  we can establish ourselves firmly  so that when others do follow and  perhaps  come across us in our new world  we will be strong enough to send them elsewhere .  the galaxy is large and there are bound to be elsewheres .    there had been objections  of course  and fierce ones .  there were those who argued out of fear  fear of leaving the familiar .  there were those who argued out of sentiment  sentiment for the planet of birth .  there were those who argued out of idealism  the desire to spread knowledge so that others might go  too .   pitt had scarcely thought he would win out .  he had done so because eugenia insigna had supplied the winning argument .  what an incredible stroke of luck it was that she had come to him first .   she was quite young then  only twenty six  married but not yet pregnant .  she was excited  flushed  and laden down with computer sheets .   pitt had frowned  he recalled  at her intrusion .  he was secretary of the department and she  well  she was nobody although  as it happened  this was the very last moment when she would be nobody .   at the time  he didn t realize this  of course  and he was annoyed that she had forced her way in .  he cringed at the obvious excitement of the young woman .  she was going to make him go through the infinite complexities of whatever it was she was holding in her hand  and do so with an enthusiasm that would quickly exhaust him .   she should give a brief summary to one of his assistants .  he decided to say so .   i see you have data there  dr .  insigna  that you wish to bring to my attention .  i ll be glad to look at it in due course .  why don t you leave it with one of my people .   and he indicated the door  hoping ardently that she would about face and move in that direction .   sometimes  in idle moments in later years  he would wonder what would have happened if she had  and his blood would run cold at the thought .    but she said   no no  mr .  secretary .  i must see you and no one else .   her voice trembled as she spoke  as though her inner excitement was unbearable .   it s the greatest discovery anyone has made since  since    she gave up .   it s the greatest .     pitt looked dubiously at the sheets she was holding .  they were quivering  but he felt no answering excitement of his own .  these specialists always thought some micro advance in their micro field was system shattering .   he said  resigned   well  doctor  can you explain it simply .     are we shielded  sir .     why do we have to be shielded .     i don t want anyone else to hear till i m sure  sure   i have to check again and recheck  till there s no doubt .  but  really  i have no doubt .  i m not making sense  am i .     no  you re not   said pitt coldly  placing his hand on a contact .   we re shielded .  now tell me .     it s all here .  i ll show it to you .      no .  first tell me .  in words .  briefly .     she drew a deep breath .   mr .  secretary  i ve discovered the nearest star .   her eyes were wide and she was breathing rapidly .   pitt said   the nearest star is alpha centauri and that s been known for four centuries .     it s the nearest star we ve known  but it isn t the nearest we can know .  i have discovered one that is closer .  the sun has a distant companion .  can you believe it .    pitt considered her carefully .  it was rather typical .  if they were young enough  enthusiastic enough  inexperienced enough  they would explode prematurely every time .   he said    are you sure .     i am .  really .  let me show you the data .  it s the most exciting thing that has happened in astronomy since      if it s happened .  and don t show me the data .  i ll look at it later .  tell me .  if there s a star much closer than alpha centauri  why hasn t it been discovered before now .  why was it left to you to do so  dr .  insigna .   he knew he was sounding sarcastic  but she didn t seem to pay attention to his tone .  she was far too excited .    there s a reason .  it s behind a cloud  a dark cloud  a puff of dust that just happens to be between the companion star and ourselves .  without the absorption of the dust  it would be an eighth magnitude star  and it would certainly have been noticed .  the dust cuts down the light and makes it nineteenth magnitude  lost among many millions of other faint stars .  there was no reason to notice it .  no one looked at it .  it s in earth s far southern sky  so that most of the telescopes in pre settlement days couldn t even point in that direction .     and if so  how is it you ve noticed it .     because of the far probe .  you see  this neighbor star and the sun are changing positions relative to each other  of course .  i assume it and the sun are revolving about a mutual center of gravity very slowly in a period of millions of years .  some centuries ago  the positions may have been such that we could have seen the neighbor star to one side of the cloud in its full brightness  but we would still have needed a telescope to see it and telescopes are only six centuries old  less old than that in those places on earth from which the neighbor star would be visible .  some centuries from now  it will be seen clearly again  shining from the other side of the dust cloud .  but we don t have to wait for centuries .  the far probe did it for us .    pitt could feel himself igniting  a distant core of warmth arising within him .  he said   do you mean that the far probe took a picture of that section of the sky containing this neighbor star and that the far probe was far enough out in space to see around the cloud and detect the neighbor star at full brightness .     exactly .  we had an eighth magnitude star where no eighth magnitude star ought to be  and the spectrum was that of a red dwarf .  you can t see red dwarf stars far away  so it had to be pretty close .     yes  but why closer than alpha centauri .     naturally  i studied the same area of the sky as seen from rotor and the eighth magnitude star wasn t there .  however  fairly near it was a nineteenth magnitude star that wasn t present in the photograph taken by the far probe .  i assumed that the nineteenth magnitude star was the eighth magnitude star  obscured  and the fact that they weren t exactly in the same place had to be the result of parallactic displacement .     yes  i understand about that .  a nearby objects appears to be in different places against the distant background as one views it from different spots .     that s right  but the stars are so distant that even if the far probe went out a big fraction of a light year that change in position wouldn t produce a noticeable shift in distant stars  but it would in nearby stars .  and for this neighbor star  it produced a huge shift  i mean  comparatively .  i checked the sky for different positions of the far probe on its journey outward .  there were three photographs taken during those intervals when it was in normal space  and the neighbor star was progressively brighter as the probe viewed it farther and farther toward the edge of the cloud .  from the parallactic displacement  the neighbor star turns out to be at a distance of just over two light years .  it s at half the distance of alpha centauri .    pitt looked at her thoughtfully and  in the long silence that followed  she grew restless and uncertain .    secretary pitt   she said   do you want to see the data now .     no   he said .   i m satisfied with what you ve told me .  now i must ask you some questions .  it seems to me  if i understand you correctly  that the chance that someone would concentrate on a nineteenth magnitude star  and try to get its parallax and determine its distance  is negligible .     just about zero .     is there any other way of noticing that an obscure star must be very near to us .     it may have a large proper motion  for a star .  i mean that if you watch it steadily  its own motion would change its place in the sky in a more or less straight line .     would that be noticed in this case .     it might be  but not all stars have a large proper motion  even if they are close to us .  they are moving in three dimensions and we see the proper motion only in a two dimensional projection .  i can explain      no  i m continuing to take your word for it .  has this star got a large proper motion .     that would take some time to determine .  i do have a few older pictures of that part of the sky and i could detect an appreciable proper motion .  that would need more work .     but do you think it has the kind of proper motion that would force itself on astronomers  if they just happened by accident to note the star .     no  i don t .     then is it possible that we on rotor are the only ones who know about this neighbor star  since we re the only ones who ve sent out a far probe .  this is your field  dr .  insigna .  do you agree that we re the only ones who ve sent out a far probe .     the far probe isn t entirely a secret project  mr .  secretary .  we ve accepted experiments from the other settlements and discussed that part of it with everyone  even earth  which isn t too interested in astronomy these days .     yes  they leave it to the settlements  which is sensible .  but have any other settlements sent out a far probe that they have kept secret .     i doubt that very much  sir .  they would need hyper assistance for that  and we have kept the technique of hyper assistance entirely secret .  if they had hyper assistance  we d know .  they d have to perform experiments in space that would give the fact away .     according to the open science agreement  all data obtained by the far probe is to be published generally .  does that mean that you have already informed     insigna interrupted indignantly .   of course not .  i would have to find out a good deal more before i publish .  what i have now is only a preliminary result that i m telling you in confidence .     but you are not the only astronomer working on the far probe .  i presume you ve shown the results to the others .    insigna flushed and looked away .  then she said defensively   no  i haven t .  i noticed this datum .  i followed it up .  i worked out its significance .  i .  and i want to make sure i get the credit for it .  there is only one star that is nearest to the sun and i want to be in the annals of science as its discoverer .     there might be a still closer one   and now pitt permitted himself the first smile of the interview .    it would have been long known .  even my star would be known but for the very unusual existence of that tiny obscuring cloud .  to have another  and closer  star is quite out of the question .     then it boils down to this  dr .  insigna .  you and i are the only ones to know of the neighbor star .  am i right .  no one else .     yes  sir .  just you and i  so far .     not just so far .  it must remain a secret to us until i am prepared to tell certain specific others .     but the agreement  the open science agreement      must be ignored .  there are always exceptions to everything .  your discovery involves settlement security .  if settlement security is involved  we are not required to make the discovery an open one .  we don t make hyper assistance open  do we .     but the existence of the neighbor star has nothing to do with settlement security .     on the contrary  dr .  insigna  it does .  perhaps you don t realize it  but you have come upon something that can change the destiny of the human species .        .     she stood there  frozen  staring at him .    sit down .  we are conspirators  you and i  and we must be friendly .  from now on  you are eugenia to me when we re alone  and i am janus to you .    insigna demurred .   i don t think that s proper .     it will have to be  eugenia .  we can t conspire on frigid  formal terms .     but i don t want to conspire with anyone about anything  and that s all there is to it .  and i don t see the point about keeping secret the facts concerning the neighbor star .     i suppose you are afraid of losing the credit .    insigna hesitated the merest moment  then said   you can bet your last computer chip i am  janus .  i want my credit .     for the moment   he said   forget that the neighbor star exists .  you know that i ve been arguing for quite a while that rotor ought to leave the solar system .  where do you stand on that .  would you like to leave the solar system .    she shrugged .   i m not sure .  it would be nice to see some astronomical object close up for the first time  but it s a little frightening  too  isn t it .     you mean  leaving home .     yes .     but you wouldn t be leaving home .  this is home .  rotor .   his arm flipped from side to side .   it would come with you .     even so  mr .  sec  janus  rotor isn t all there is to home .  we have a neighborhood  the other settlements  the planet earth  the whole solar system .     it s a crowded neighborhood .  eventually  some of us will have to go  whether we want to or not .  on earth there was once a time when some people had to cross mountain ranges and oceans .  two centuries ago  people on earth had to leave their planet for settlements .  this is just another step forward in a very old story .     i understand  but there are some people who never went .  there are people who are still on earth .  there are people who ve lived in one small region of earth for countless generations .     and you want to be one of these non movers .     i think my husband crile does .  he s quite outspoken about your views  janus .     well  we have freedom of speech and thought on rotor  so he can disagree with me if he pleases .  now here s something else i d like to ask you .  when people generally  on rotor or elsewhere  think of moving away from the solar system  where do they think of going .     alpha centauri  of course .  it s the star everyone believes is closest .  even with hyper assistance  we can t end up going faster than the speed of light on the average  so it would take us four years .  anywhere else  it would take much longer  and four years is long enough to travel .     suppose it were possible to travel even faster  and suppose you could reach much farther than alpha centauri  where would you go then .    insigna paused in thought awhile  then said   i suppose  still alpha centauri .  it would still be in the old neighborhood .  the stars at night would still seem quite the same .  that would give us a comfortable feeling .  we would be closer to home  if we wanted to return .  besides  alpha centauri a  which is the largest of the three star alpha centauri system  is practically a twin of the sun .  alpha centauri b is smaller  but not too small .  even if you ignore alpha centauri c  a red dwarf  you would still have two stars for the price of one  so to speak  two sets of planets .     suppose a settlement has left for alpha centauri and found decent habitability there and settled down to build a new world  and back in the solar system  it was known that this had happened .  where would the next settlements go  once they decided to leave the solar system .     to alpha centauri  of course   said insigna without hesitation .   so the human species would tend to go to the obvious place  and if one settlement succeeds  others would follow quickly  until the new world was as crowded as the old  until there were many people with many cultures  and eventually many settlements with many ecologies .     then it will be time to move on to other stars .     but always  eugenia  success in one place will draw other settlements .  a salubrious star  a good planet  will bring others flocking .     i suppose so .     but if we go to a star that is only a little over two light years away  only half the distance of alpha centauri  and no one knows about it except us  who will follow us .     no one  until they find out about the neighbor star .     but that might take a long time .  for that long time  they would all flock to alpha centauri  or to any of a few other obvious choices .  they would never notice a red dwarf star at their doorstep  or if they did notice it  they would dismiss it as unfit for human life  if they didn t know that human beings had already made it a going concern .    insigna stared at pitt uncertainly .   but what does all this mean .  suppose we go to the neighbor star and no one knows about it .  what is the advantage .     the advantage is that we can fill the world .  if there is a habitable planet      there won t be .  not around a red dwarf star .     then we can use whatever raw material that exists there to build any number of settlements .     you mean there would be more room for us .     yes .  much more room than if they came flocking in after us .     so we would have a little more time  janus .  eventually we would fill the room available for us at the neighbor star  even if we were alone .  so it would take us five hundred years instead of two hundred .  what difference would that make .     all the difference you can imagine  eugenia .  let the settlements crowd in as they wish and we will have a thousand different cultures  bringing with them all the hatreds and misfittings of earth s dismal history .  give us time to be here alone and we can build a system of settlements that will be uniform in culture and ecology .  it will be a far better situation less chaotic  less anarchic .     less interesting .  less variegated .  less alive .     not at all .  we ll diversify  i m sure .  the different settlements will have their differences  but there will  at least  be a common base from which those differences will spring .  it will be a far better group of settlements for that .  and even if i am wrong  surely you see that it s an experiment that must be tried .  why not devote one star to such a reasoned development and see if it works .  we can take one star  a red dwarf throwaway that no one would be ordinarily interested in  and use it to see if we can build a new kind of society and possibly a better one .    let us see what we can do   he went on   if we don t have our energies worn out and broken by useless cultural differences  and our overall biology constantly perverted by alien ecological inroads .    insigna felt herself moved .  even if it didn t work  humanity would have learned something  that this wouldn t work .  and if it did work .   but then she shook her head .   it s a useless dream .  the neighbor star will be independently discovered  no matter how we try to keep it secret .     but how much of your own discovery  eugenia  was accidental .  be truthful now .  you just happened to notice the star .  you just happened to compare it with what you could see on another map .  might you not have missed it altogether .  and might not others have missed it under similar circumstances .    insigna did not answer  but the expression on her face was satisfactory to pitt .   his voice had grown softer  almost hypnotic .    and if there is a delay of only a hundred years .  if we are given only a hundred years to ourselves to build our new society  we would be large enough and strong enough to protect ourselves and make the others pass by and go on to other worlds .  we won t have to hide any longer than that .    again insigna did not answer .  pitt said   have i convinced you .   she seemed to shake herself .   not entirely .     then think about it  and i ll ask you just one favor .  while you think about it  don t say a word to anyone about the neighbor star and let me have all the data in connection with it for safekeeping .  i won t destroy it .  my promise .  we will need it if we are going to go to the neighbor star .  will you go that far at least  eugenia .     yes   she said at last in a small voice .  then she fired up .   one thing  though .  i must be able to name the star .  if i give it a name  then it s my star .    pitt smiled briefly .   what do you want to call it .  insigna s star .  eugenia s star .     no .  i m not that foolish .  i want to call it nemesis .     nemesis .  n e m e s i s .     yes .     but why .     there was a brief period of speculation back in the late twentieth century about the possibility of a neighbor star for the sun .  it came to nothing at that time .  no neighbor star was found  but it had been referred to as  nemesis  in the papers devoted to it .  i would like to honor those daring thinkers .     nemesis .  wasn t there a greek goddess of that name .  an unpleasant one .     the goddess of retribution  of justified revenge  of punishment .  it entered the language as a rather flowery word .  the computer called it  archaic  when i checked .     and why would those old timers have called it nemesis .     something to do with the cometary cloud .  apparently  nemesis   in its revolution about the sun  passed through the cloud and induced cosmic strikes that killed off large portions of earth life every twenty six million years .    pitt looked astonished .   really .     no  not really .  the suggestion didn t survive  but i want nemesis to be the name just the same .  and i want it to go on record that i named it .     i promise you that  eugenia .  it s your discovery and that will enter our records .  eventually  when the rest of humanity discovers the nemesian region  would that be the right way of putting it .   they will then learn who made the discovery and how it came about .  your star  your nemesis  will be the first star  other than the sun itself  to shine over a human civilization  and the first  without exception  to shine over a human civilization that originated elsewhere .    pitt watched her leave and felt  on the whole  confident .  she would fall in line .  his letting her name the star was the perfect touch .  surely she would want to go to her own star .  surely she would feel the attraction of building a logical and orderly civilization about her star  one from which civilizations all over the galaxy might descend .   and then  just as he might have relaxed in the glow of a golden future  he was shaken by a faint touch of horror that was utterly alien to him .   why nemesis .  why should it have occurred to her to name it for the goddess of retribution .   he was almost weak enough to think of it as an evil omen .       three  mother      .     it was dinnertime  and insigna was in one of those moods when she was just a little afraid of her own daughter .   those moods had become more pronounced lately  and she didn t know why .  perhaps it was marlene s increasing tendency to silence  to being withdrawn  to be always seeming to commune with thoughts too deep for speech .   and sometimes the uneasy fear in insigna was mixed with guilt  guilt because of her lack of motherly patience with the girl  guilt because of her too great awareness of the girl s physical shortcomings .  marlene certainly didn t have her mother s conventional prettiness or her father s wildly unconventional good looks .   marlene was short and  blunt .  that was the only word that insigna could find that exactly fit poor marlene .   and poor  of course .  it was the adjective she almost always used in her own mind and could just barely keep out of her speech .   short .  blunt .  thick without being fat  that was marlene .  nothing graceful about her .  her hair was dark brown  rather long  and quite straight .  her nose was a little bulbous  her mouth turned down just a bit at the ends  her chin small  her whole attitude passive and turned in upon itself .   there were her eyes  of course  large and lustrously dark  with meticulous dark eyebrows that curved above them  long eyelashes that looked almost artificial .  still  eyes alone could not make up for everything else  however fascinating they might be at odd moments .   insigna had known since marlene was five that she was unlikely ever to attract a man on the physical plane alone  and that had become more obvious with each year .   aurinel had kept a languid eye on her during her preteen years  obviously attracted to her precocious intelligence and her almost luminous understanding .  and marlene had been shy and pleased in his presence  as though dimly realizing that there was something about an object called a  boy  that was somehow endearing  but not knowing what it might be .   in the last couple of years  it seemed to insigna that marlene had finally clarified in her mind what  boy  meant .  her omnivorous reading of books and viewing of films too old for her body  if not her mind  undoubtedly helped her in this  but aurinel had grown older  too  and as his hormones began to exert their sway over him  it was no longer badinage he was in search of .   at dinner that night  insigna asked   what kind of day did you have  dear .     a quiet one .  aurinel came looking for me and i suppose he reported to you .  i m sorry you have to take the trouble to hunt me down .    insigna sighed .   but  marlene  i can t help but think sometimes that you re unhappy and isn t it natural for me to be concerned about that .  you re alone too much .     i like to be alone .     you don t act it .  you show no signs of happiness at being alone .  there are many people who would like to be friendly and you would be happier if you allowed them to be .  aurinel is your friend .     was .  he s all busy these days with other people .  today that was obvious .  it infuriated me .  imagine him getting all wrapped up because he was thinking about dolorette .    insigna said   you can t quite blame aurinel  you know .  dolorette is his age .     physically   said marlene .   what a bubblehead .     physically counts a great deal at his age .     he shows it .  it makes a bubble head out of him  too .  the more he slobbers over dolorette  the emptier his head gets .  i can tell .     but he ll keep on getting older  marlene  and when he s a little older  he might find out what the really important things are .  and you ll be getting older  too  you know     marlene stared at insigna quizzically .  then she said   come on  mother .  you don t believe what you re trying to imply .  you don t believe it for a minute .    insigna flushed .  it suddenly occurred to her that marlene wasn t guessing .  she knew  but how did she know .  insigna had made her remark as sincerely as she could  had tried to feel it .  but marlene had seen through it without effort .  it wasn t the first time either .  insigna had begun to feel that marlene weighed the inflections  the hesitations  the motions  and always knew what you didn t want her to know .  it must be this quality that made insigna increasingly frightened of marlene .  you don t want to be glass to another s scornful glance .   what had insigna said  for instance  that had led marlene to believe the earth was doomed to destruction .  that would have to be taken up and discussed .   insigna suddenly felt tired .  if she couldn t ever fool marlene  why try .  she said   well  let s get down to it  dear .  what is it you want .    marlene said   i see you really want to know  so i ii tell you .  i want to get away .     get away .   insigna found herself unable to understand the simple words her daughter had used .   where is there to get away to .     rotor isn t all there is  mother .     of course not .  but it s all there is within more than two lightyears .     no  mother  that s not so .  less than two thousand kilometers away is erythro .     that scarcely counts .  you can t live there .     there are people living there .     yes  but under a dome .  a group of scientists and engineers live there because they are doing necessary scientific work .  the dome is much smaller than rotor .  if you feel cramped here  what will you feel there .     there s a whole world on erythro outside the dome .  someday people will spread out and live allover the planet .     maybe .  it s by no means a certain thing .     i m sure it is a certain thing .     even if it is  it would take centuries .     but it has to begin .  why can t i be part of the beginning .     marlene  you re being ridiculous .  you ve got a very comfortable  home here .  when did all this start .    marlene pressed her lips together  then said   i m not sure .  a few months ago  but it s getting worse .  i just can t stand it here on rotor .    insigna looked at her daughter  frowning .  she thought  she feels she has lost aurinel  she is heartbroken forever  she will leave and punish him by doing so .  she will send herself into exile on a barren world  and he will be sorry  yes  that line of thought was entirely possible .  she remembered when she herself was fifteen .  hearts are so fragile then that a slight tap will crack them .  teenagers heal quickly  but no fifteen year old would or could believe that at the time .  fifteen .  it is later  later that  no use thinking about it .   she said   what is it that attracts you about erythro  marlene .     i m not sure .  it s a large world .  isn t it natural to want a large world   she hesitated  before adding the last two words  but she gulped them out somehow    like earth .     like earth .   insigna spoke with vehemence .   you ve never been on earth .  you don t know anything about earth .     i ve seen a great deal about it  mother .  the libraries are full of films about earth .     yes  they were .  pitt had felt for some time now that such films ought to be sequestered  or even destroyed .  he maintained that to break away from the solar system meant to break away  it was wrong to maintain an artificial romanticism about earth .  insigna had disagreed strongly  but now she suddenly thought that she could see pitt s point .    she said   marlene  you can t go by those films .  they idealize things .  they talk about the long past for the most part  when things on earth were better  and  even so  it was never as good as they picture things to have been .     even so .     no  not  even so .   do you know what earth is like .  it s an unlivable slum .  they s why people have left it to form all the settlements .  people went from the large dreadful world of earth to small civilized settlements .  no one wants to go in the other direction .     there are billions of people who still live on earth .     that s what makes it an unlivable slum .  those who are there leave as soon as they can .  that s why so many settlements have been built and are so crowded .  that s why we left the solar system for here  darling .    marlene said in a lower voice   father was an earthman .  he didn t leave earth  even though he might have .     no  he didn t .  he stayed behind .   she frowned  trying to keep her voice level .    why  mother .     come  marlene .  we ve talked about this .  many people stayed home .  they didn t want to leave a familiar place .  almost every family on rotor had stay on earths .  you know that very well .  do you want to return to earth .  is that it .     no  mother .  not at all .     even if you wanted to go  you re over two light years away and you can t go .  surely you understand that .     of course i understand that .  i was just trying to point out that we have another earth right here .  it s erythro .  that s where i want to go  that s where i long to go .    insigna couldn t stop herself .  it was almost with horror that she heard herself say   so you want to break away from me  as your father did .    marlene flinched  then recovered .  she said   is it really true  mother  that he broke away from you .  perhaps things might have been different if you had behaved differently .   then she added quietly  just as though she were announcing that she was done with dinner .   you drove him away  didn t you  mother .        four  father      .     odd  or perhaps stupid  that she was still capable of hurting herself unbearably with thoughts of that kind after fourteen years .   crile was   .   meters tall where  on rotor  the average height for men was a bit under   .   meters .  that alone  as in the case of janus pitt  gave him a commanding aura of strength that persisted well after the time when she came to recognize  without ever quite admitting it to herself  that she could not rely on his strength .   he had a craggy face  too  a prominent nose and cheekbones  a strong chin  a look  somehow  of hunger and wildness .  everything about him spoke of strong masculinity .  she could almost smell it when she met him  and was struck with fascination at once .   insigna was still a graduate student in astronomy at the time  completing her stint on earth  looking forward to returning to rotor so that she could qualify for work on the far probe .  she dreamed of the wide advances the far probe would make possible  and never dreamed that she herself would make the most astonishing one  .   and then she met crile and found herself  to her own confusion  madly in love with an earthman  an earthman .  overnight she felt herself abandoning the far probe in her mind  becoming ready to remain on earth just to be with him .   she could still remember the way he had looked at her in astonishment and said   remain here with me .  i d rather come to rotor with you .   she could not have imagined that he would want to abandon his world for her .   how crile managed to obtain permission to come to rotor  insigna did not know and had never found out .   the immigration rules were strict  after all .  once any settlement had a sizable population  it clamped down on immigration  first  because it could not exceed a certain definite limit on the number of people it could support comfortably  and  second  because it made a desperate effort to keep its ecological balance stable .  people who came on important business from earth  or even from other settlementshad to undergo tedious decontamination procedures  a certain degree of isolation  and an enforced departure as soon as possible .   yet here was crile from earth .  he complained to her once of the weeks of waiting that had been part of the decontamination  and she was secretly pleased at the way he had persisted .  clearly  he must have wanted her very badly to submit to it .   yet there were times when he seemed withdrawn and inattentive and she would wonder then what had really driven him to rotor over such obstacles .  perhaps it was not she  but the need to escape earth that had been the motivating force .  had he committed a crime .  made a murderous enemy .  fled a woman he had grown tired of .  she had never dared ask .   and he had never offered information .  even after he had been allowed to enter rotor  there was a question as to how long he might be able to remain .  the bureau of immigration would have to grant a special permit to make him a full citizen of rotor and that was not ordinarily likely .   insigna had found all the things that made crile fisher unacceptable to rotorians additional inducements for fascination .  she found that his being earth born lent him a difference and a glamour .  true rotorians would be bound to despise him as an alien  citizen or not  but she found even that a source of erotic excitement .  she would fight for him  and triumph  against a hostile world .   when he tried to find some sort of work that would enable him to earn money and occupy a niche in the new society  it was she who pointed out to him that if he married a rotorian woman  rotorian for three generations  that would be a powerful inducement for the bureau of immigration to grant him full citizenship .   crile seemed surprised at that  as though it hadn t occurred to him  and then pleased .  insigna had found it a little disappointing .  it would be much more flattering to be married for the sake of love than for the sake of citizenship  but then she thought to herself  well  if that s what it takes  so  after a typical long rotorian engagement  they were married .  life went on without much change .  he was not a passionate lover  but he had not been that before the marriage either .  he had offered her an absent affection  an occasional warmth that kept her constantly near happiness if not altogether immersed in it .  he was never actively cruel and unkind  and he had given up his world for her and gone through considerable inconvenience to be with her .  surely that might be counted in his favor  and insigna counted it so .   even as a full citizen  which he had been granted after their marriage  there remained a kernel of dissatisfaction within him .  insigna was aware of this and could not entirely blame him .  he might be a full citizen  yet he was still not a native born rotorian and many of the most interesting activities on rotor were closed to him .  she did not know what his training had been  for he never mentioned how much of an education he had had .  he didn t sound uneducated  and there was no disgrace in being self educated  but insigna knew that on earth the population did not take higher education as a given  the way that settlement populations did .   the thought bothered her .  she didn t mind crile fisher being an earthman and facing down her friends and colleagues where that was concerned .  she didn t know  though  if she could quite handle his being an uneducated earthman .   but no one ever suggested he was  and he listened to the tales of her work on the far probe with patience .  she never tested his education by discussing the technical details  of course .  yet sometimes he asked questions or made comments that reflected on such things and she valued them  when they came  for she always managed to convince herself that they were intelligent questions and comments .   fisher had a job on one of the farms  a perfectly respectable job  even an essential one  but a job that was not high on the social scale .  he did not complain or make a fuss about that  she d give him that  but he never talked about it  or showed any pleasure in it .  and there was always that air of discontent about him .   insigna learned  therefore  to attempt no cheery   and what happened to you at work today  crile .    the few times she had asked  just at first  the answer had been a flat  nothing much .   and that would be all  except for a short annoyed look .   eventually  she grew nervous about talking to him even of petty office politics and annoying errors .  that  too  might serve as an unwelcome comparison of her work with his .   insigna had to admit that her fears went against the evidence there  an example of her own insecurity rather than his .  fisher didn t show signs of impatience when she did find herself forced to discuss the day s work .  sometimes he even asked  with a pallid interest  about hyper assistance  but insigna knew little or nothing about that .   he was interested in rotorian politics and showed an earthman s impatience with the smallness of its concerns .  she fought with herself not to show displeasure at that .   eventually  there fell a silence between them  broken only by indifferent discussions concerning the films they had viewed  the social engagements they undertook  the small change of life .   it didn t lead to active unhappiness .  cake had quickly changed to white bread  but there were worse things than white bread .   it even had a small advantage .  working under tight security meant talking to no one about one s work  but how many managed to whisper partial confidences to wife or husband .  insigna had not done so  for she had little in the way of temptation  since her own work required little in the way of security .   but when her discovery of the neighbor star was suddenly placed under tight wraps  without warning  could she have managed .  surely it would have been the natural thing to do  to tell her husband of the great discovery that was bound to put her name into the astronomy texts for as long as humanity existed .  she might have told him even before she told pitt .  she might have come bouncing in   guess what .  guess what .  you ll never guess     but she hadn t .  it didn t occur to her that fisher would be interested .  he might talk to others about their work  even to farmers or sheet metal workers  but not to her .   so it was no effort to mention nothing to him of nemesis .  the matter was dead between them  was not missed  did not exist  until that dreadful day when their marriage came to an end .       .     when did she move over wholeheartedly to pitt s side .   at the start  insigna had been horrified at the thought of keeping the neighbor star a secret  profoundly uneasy at the prospect of moving away out of the solar system to a destination concerning which they knew nothing but the location .  she found it ethically wrong and indecently dishonorable to set about building a new civilization by stealth  one which excluded all the rest of humanity .   she had given in on the grounds of settlement security  but she had intended to fight pitt privately  to bring up points of argument .  she had rehearsed them in her own mind till they were foolproof and irrefutable and then  somehow  she never presented them .   always  always  he took the initiative .   pitt said to her  early on   now remember  eugenia  you discovered the companion star more or less by accident  and one of your colleagues may do so as well .     it s not likely    she began .    no  eugenia  we re not going to depend on unlikelihood .  we re going to make certain .  you re going to see to it that no one looks in that direction  that no one wants to study the particular computer sheets that would give away the location of nemesis .     how can i possibly do that .     very easily .  i have spoken to the commissioner and  as of now  you are in complete charge of the far probe research .     but that would mean i ve been moved over the head      yes .  it means an advance in responsibility  in pay  in social stature .  to which of these do you object .     i don t object to any of this   said insigna  her heart beginning to pound .    i m sure you can fulfill the job of chief astronomer more than adequately  but your chief aim will be to see to it that the work done can be of the highest possible quality and significance  provided that what is done has nothing to do with nemesis .     but  janus  you can t keep it completely secret forever .     i don t intend to .  once we move out of the solar system  we will all know where we re going .  till then  as few as possible will know  and those few will learn as late as possible .    her promotion  insigna noted with a little shame  cooled her objections .   on another occasion  pitt said to her   what about your husband .     what about my husband .   insigna was immediately on the defensive .    he is an earthman  i understand .    insigna s lips pressed together .   he is of earth origin  but he is a rotorian citizen .     i understand .  i assume you have told him nothing of nemesis .     absolutely nothing .     has this husband of yours ever told you why he left earth and worked so hard to become a rotorian citizen .     no  he hasn t .  and i haven t asked him .     but don t you ever wonder .    insigna hesitated and then told the truth .   yes  i have  sometimes .   pitt smiled .   i should tell you  perhaps .    and he did  little by little .  never in any overly obtrusive manner .  it was never a bludgeon  it was rather the dripping of water at every conversation .  it brought her out of her intellectual shell .  to live on rotor  after all  made it entirely too easy to consider only things rotorian .   but thanks to pitt  to what he told her  to the films he suggested she view  she became aware of earth and its billions  of its endemic starvation and violence  its drugs and alienation .  she began to understand it as an abysmal pit of misery  something to flee from .  she did not wonder any longer why crile fisher had left .  she wondered why so few earthmen followed his example .   nor were the settlements so much better off .  she became aware of how they closed in on themselves  how people were prevented from moving freely from one to another .  no settlement wanted the microscopic flora and fauna of any other .  trade dwindled slowly  and was increasingly carried on by automated vessels with carefully sterilized loads .   the settlements quarreled and found each other hateful .  the circum martian settlements were almost as bad .  only in the asteroid zone were the settlements multiplying freely  and even those were growing suspicious of all the inner settlements .   insigna could feel herself begin to agree with pitt  even to grow enthusiastic over a flight from intolerable misery and the beginning of a system of worlds where the seeds of suffering had been eradicated .  a new start  a new chance .   and then she found that a baby was on the way and her enthusiasm began to wither .  to risk herself and crile on the long journey seemed worthwhile .  to risk an infant  a child  pitt was unperturbed .  he congratulated her .   it will be born here and you will have a little time to accustom yourself to the situation .  it will be at least a year and a half before we re ready to go .  and by then you will realize how fortunate you will be not to have to wait any longer .  the child will have no memory of the misery of a ruined planet and a desperately divided humanity .  it will know only a new world with a cultural understanding among its members .  lucky child .  fortunate child .  my son and daughter are already grown  already marked .    and again insigna began to think in that fashion  and by the time marlene was born  she had indeed begun to dread delay  to fear that before they left  the child would be imprinted with the crowded failure that was the solar system .   she was entirely on pitt s side by this time .  fisher seemed fascinated by marlene  to insigna s great relief .  she had not thought that he would make much of a father .  yet he hovered over marlene and took on his share of the duties involved in bringing her up .  he seemed actually to grow cheerful as a result .   during the time marlene was approaching her first birthday  rumors grew throughout the solar system that rotor intended to leave .  it produced what was almost a system wide crisis  and pitt  who was now clearly in line for commissionerhood  was grimly amused .    well  what can they do .   he said .   there s no way they can stop us  and all the outcries of disloyalty  together with their own display of solar system chauvinism  will only serve to inhibit their investigations into hyper assistance  which will serve us well .    insigna said   but how did it get out  i wonder  janus .     i saw to it that it did .   he smiled .    at this point  i don t any longer object to their learning the fact of our leaving  as long as they don t know our destination .  it would  after all  be impossible to hide our leaving for much longer .  we must take a vote on the matter  you know  and once all rotorians know of our leaving  all the rest of the system will know  in any case .     a vote .     why  of course .  think it through .  we can t take off with a settlement load of people who are too fearful or too homesick for their own sun .  we d never make it .  we want only those with us who are willing  even eager .    he was completely right .  the campaign to win approval for leaving the solar system began almost at once and the fact that the news had already leaked out served as a cushion to ease the reaction outside rotor  and within it as well .   some rotorians were excited at the prospect  some were afraid .  fisher reacted with thunderous brow  and one day he said   this is crazy .     it s inevitable   said insigna with careful neutrality .    why .  there s no reason to start wandering among the stars .  where would we go .  there s nothing out there .     there are billions of stars out there .     how many planets .  we don t know of any habitable planets anywhere  and very few of any other kind .  our solar system is the only home we know .     exploration is in the blood of humanity .   it was one of pitt s phrases .    that s romantic nonsense .  does anyone think that people are actually going to vote to separate themselves from humanity and vanish into space .    insigna said   my understanding  crile  is that sentiment on rotor is rather in favor of it .     that s just council propaganda .  you think people will vote to leave the earth .  leave the sun .  never .  if it comes to that  we ll be going to earth .    she felt something clutch at her heart .  she said   oh no .  do you want one of those simoons  or blizzards  or mistrals  or whatever you call them .  do you want lumps of ice and falling water and blowing  whistling air .    he lifted his eyebrows at her .   it s not that bad .  there are storms occasionally  but they can be predicted .  actually  they re interesting   when they re not too bad .  it s fascinating  a little cold  a little heat  a little precipitation .  it makes for variation .  it keeps you alive .  and then  think of the variety of cuisines .     cuisines .  how can you say that .  most people on earth are starving .  we re always collecting food shipments to send to earth .     some people go hungry .  it s not universal .     well  you certainly can t expect marlene to live under such conditions .     billions of children do .     and mine won t be one of them   said insigna fiercely .   all her hopes lay in marlene now .  she was going on ten months of age  had two small teeth in the upper gum  two in the lower  could shamble about holding onto the rods of her playpen  and looked at the world with those wondering intelligent eyes .   fisher was still clearly fond of his unpretty daughter  more fond than ever  in fact .  when he wasn t dandling her  he was staring at her and remarking fondly on her beautiful eyes .  he stressed her one lovely feature and it seemed to make up to him for everything else that was lacking .   surely fisher would not go back to earth if it meant leaving marlene forever .  insigna  somehow  lacked any confidence that he would choose her  the woman he had loved and married  over earth  but surely marlene would be the sticking point .   surely .       .     the day after the vote  eugenia insigna found fisher white with rage .  he said  or choked out   it was a fixed vote .    she said   sh .  you ll wake the baby .    and for a moment  he grimaced and visibly held his breath .  insigna relaxed just a bit and said in a small voice   there s no question that the people want to go .     did you vote to go .    she considered .  there was no use trying to placate him by lying .  she had made her feelings obvious enough .  she said   i did .    he said   pitt ordered you to  i suppose .    that caught her by surprise .   no .  i m capable of making my own decisions .     but you and he    he let it trail off .   she felt her blood pressure rise suddenly .   what do you mean .   she said  angry now in her turn .  was he going to accuse her of infidelity .    that  that politician .  he s heading for commissioner at any price .  everyone knows that .  and you re planning to rise with him .  political loyalty will get you someplace  too  won t it .     where will it get me .  there s no place i want to get .  i m an astronomer  not a politician .     you ve been promoted  haven t you .  you ve been pushed over the head of older  more experienced people .     through hard work  i like to think .    how was she going to defend herself now  without being able to tell him the truth .     i m sure you do like to think that .  but it was through pitt .   insigna drew a deep breath .   where is this leading us .     listen .   his voice was low  as it had been since she had reminded him that marlene was sleeping .   i cannot believe that a whole settlement of people are going to risk traveling with hyper assistance .  how do you know what will happen .  how do you know it will work .  it could kill us all .     the far probe worked well .     were there living things on this far probe .  if not  how do you know how living things will react to hyper assistance .  what do you know about hyper assistance .     not a thing .     why not .  you re working right there in the laboratory .  you re not working on the farms  as i am .     he is jealous  thought insigna .   aloud  she said   when you say the laboratory  you seem to imply we re all piled together in one room .  i told you .  i m an astronomer and i know nothing about hyper assistance .      you mean that pitt never tells you anything about it .     about hyper assistance .  he doesn t know himself .     are you telling me no one knows .     of course i m not telling you that .  the hyperspatialists know .  come on  crile .  those who are supposed to know  know .  others don t .     to all except the specialist few  it s a secret  then .     exactly .     then you don t really know that hyper assistance is safe .  only the hyperspatialists know .  how do you suppose they know .     i assume they ve experimented .     you assume .      it s a reasonable assumption .  they assure us it s safe .     and they never lie  i suppose .     they ll be going  too .  besides  i m sure they experimented .    he looked at her out of narrowed eyes   now you re sure .  the far probe was your baby .  did they have life forms aboard .     i was not involved with the actual procedures .  i only dealt with the astronomical data that was gained .     you re not answering my question about the life forms .    insigna lost her patience .   look  i don t feel like being grilled endlessly  and the baby is beginning to be restless .  i have a question or two myself .  what do you plan to do .  are you coming along .     i don t have to .  the terms of the vote are that anyone who doesn t want to come along doesn t have to .     i know you don t have to  but will you .  surely you don t want to break up the family .    she tried to smile as she said this  but it didn t feel convincing .  fisher said  slowly and a little grimly   i also don t want to leave the solar system .     you would rather leave me .  and marlene .     why would i have to leave marlene .  even if you want to risk yourself on this wild scheme  must you risk the child .    she said tightly   if i go  marlene goes .  get that through your head  crile .  where would you take her .  to some half finished asteroidal settlement .     of course not .  i m from earth and i can return there if i wish .     return to a dying planet .  great .     it s got some years of life left to it  i assure you .     then why did you leave it .     i thought i d be improving myself .  i didn t know that coming to rotor would mean a one way ticket to nowhere .     not to nowhere   insigna burst out  tormented past endurance .   if you knew where we were going  you wouldn t be so ready to turn back .     why .  where is rotor going .     to the stars .     to oblivion .        they stared at each other  and marlene  opening her eyes  emitted a soft mew of wakefulness .  fisher looked down at the baby and  with a softening of his tone  said   eugenia  we don t have to split up .  i certainly don t want to leave marlene .  or you either .  come with me .     to earth .     yes .  why not .  i have friends there .  even now .  as my wife and child  you ll have no trouble getting in .  earth doesn t worry much about ecological balance .  we ll be on a whole giant planet out there  not on a little stinking bubble in space .     just on a whole giant bubble  enormously stinking .  no no  never .     let me take marlene  then .  if you find the voyage worth the risk because you are an astronomer and want to study the universe  that s your business  but the baby should stay here in the solar system  and be safe .     safe on earth .  don t be ridiculous .  is that what this whole thing has been for .  a device to take my baby .     our baby .     my baby .  you leave .  i want you to leave  but you can t touch my baby .  you tell me i know pitt  and  yes  i do .  that means i can arrange to have you sent to the asteroids whether you want to go or not  and then you can find your own way back to your decomposing earth .  now get out of my quarters and find your own place to sleep till you are sent away .  when you let me know where you ll be  i ll send along your personal possessions .  and don t think you can come back .  this place will be under guard .    at the moment that insigna said this  with the bitterness in her heart overflowing  she meant it .  she might have pled with him  cajoled him  begged  argued .  but she hadn t .  she had turned a harsh  unforgiving eye upon him and had sent him away .   and fisher did leave .  and she did send along his things .  and he did refuse to come with rotor .  and he was sent away .  and she supposed he had gone to earth .   he was gone forever from her and from marlene .  she had sent him away and he was gone forever .       five  gift       .     insigna sat there  deeply surprised at herself .  she had never told the story to anyone  though she had lived with it almost every day for fourteen years .  she had never dreamed of telling it to anyone .  she had assumed that she would take it to the grave with her .  not that it was disgraceful in any way  merely private .  and here she had told it  at length and without reserve  to her adolescent daughter  to someone who  until the moment she had begun talking  she had considered a child  a peculiarly hopeless child .   and that child now looked at her solemnly  out of her dark eyes  unblinking  owlishly adult  somehow  and finally said   then you did drive him away  didn t you .     in a way  yes .  but i was furious .  he wanted to take you .  to earth .    she paused  then said tentatively   you understand .    marlene asked   did you want me so much .   insigna said indignantly   certainly .   and then  under the calm gaze of those eyes  she stopped to think the unthinkable .  had she really wanted marlene .   but then she calmly said   of course .  why wouldn t i .   marlene shook her head and  for a moment  there was that sullen look on her face .   i think i probably wasn t a charming baby .  perhaps he wanted me .  were you unhappy because he wanted me more than he wanted you .  did you keep me just because he wanted me .     what horrible things you re saying .  that s not it at all   said insigna  not at all sure whether she believed that or not .  there was getting to be no comfort in discussing these things with marlene .  more and more  marlene was developing this dreadful way of cutting under the skin .  insigna had noticed this before and had put it down to the occasional lucky blows of an unhappy child .  but it was happening more and more often  and marlene now seemed to be wielding the scalpel deliberately .   insigna said   marlene .  what made you think i had driven your father away .  i had never said so  surely  or given you any reason to think so  have i .     i don t really know how i know things  mother .  sometimes you mention father to me  or to someone else  and you always sound as though there s something you regret  something you wish you could do over .     there is .  i never feel that .     and little by little  as i get these impressions  they get clearer .  it s the way you talk  the way you look     insigna gazed at her daughter intently  then said very suddenly   what am i thinking .    marlene jumped slightly and then gave a short giggle .  she was not a laugher  and that giggle was as far as ever she went  usually .  she said   that s easy .  you re thinking that i know what you re thinking  but you re wrong .  i don t read minds .  i just tell from words and sounds and expressions and movements .  people just can t keep what they think hidden .  and i ve watched them so long .     why .  i mean  why have you felt it necessary to watch them .     because when i was a kid  everyone lied to me .  they told me how sweet i was .  or they told you that when i was listening .  they always had a look plastered allover them that said   i don t really think that at all .   and they didn t even know it was there .  i couldn t believe at first they didn t know .  but then i said to myself   i guess it s more comfortable for them to make believe they re telling the truth .      marlene paused and then abruptly asked her mother   why didn t you tell father where we were going .     i couldn t .  it was not my secret .     perhaps if you had  he would have come with us .    insigna shook her head vigorously .   no  he wouldn t .  he had made up his mind to return to earth .     but if you had told him  mother  commissioner pitt wouldn t have let him leave  would he .  father would have known too much .     pitt wasn t commissioner then   said insigna with absent irrelevance .  then  with sudden vigor   i wouldn t have wanted him on those terms .  would you .     i don t know .  i can t tell how he would have been if he had stayed .     but i can tell .   insigna felt as though she were burning again .  her mind went back to that last conversation and her last wild shout telling fisher to go  that he must go .  no  it had been no mistake .  she wouldn t have wanted him as a prisoner  an enforced member of rotor .  she hadn t loved him that much .  for that matter  she hadn t hated him that much either .   and then she changed the subject quickly  allowing no time for her expression to give her away .   you upset aurinel this afternoon .  why did you tell him earth would be destroyed .  he came to me about that and was very concerned .     all you had to do was to tell him that i was just a kid and no one listens to what a kid says .  he would have believed that right away .    insigna ignored that .  maybe it was a good idea to say nothing in order to avoid the truth .   do you really think earth will be destroyed .     i do .  you talk about earth sometimes .  you say   poor earth .   you almost always say   poor earth .      insigna felt herself flush .  did she really speak of earth in those terms .  she said   well  why not .  it s overcrowded  worn out  full of hatred and famines and miseries .  i m sorry for the world .  poor earth .     no  mother .  you don t say it that way .  when you say it    marlene held up her hand in a groping gesture  feeling for something  her fingertips just missing it .    well  marlene .     it s clear in my mind  but i don t know how to put it in words .     keep on trying .  i must know .     the way you say it  i can t help but think you feel guilty  as though it were your fault .     why .  what do you think i ve done .      i heard you say it once when you were in the view room .  you looked at nemesis  and it seemed to me  then  that nemesis was mixed up in it .  so i asked the computer what nemesis meant and it told me .  it s something that relentlessly destroys  something that infiicts retribution .     that wasn t the reason for the name   cried insigna .   you named it   said marlene quietly  inexorably .   that was no secret  of course  any longer  once they had left the solar system behind them .  insigna had then taken the credit for the discovery and for the name .    it s because i named it that i know that that wasn t the reason for the name .     then why do you feel guilty  mother .     silence  if you don t want to tell the truth .    insigna said at last   how do you think earth will be destroyed .     i don t know  but i think you know  mother .     we re speaking at cross purposes  marlene  and let s let it go for now .  what i want  though  is to make sure you understand that you are not to talk about any of this to anyone  not about your father  and not about this nonsense of earth s destruction .     if you don t want me to  of course i won t  but the destruction bit is not nonsense .     i say it is .  we ll define it as nonsense .    marlene nodded .   i think i ll go view for a while   she said with seeming indifference .   then i ll go to bed .      good .   insigna watched her daughter leave .   guilty  thought insigna .  i feel guilty .  i wear it on my face like a bright banner .  anyone who looks can see it .   no  not anyone .  just marlene .  she has the gift of doing so .  marlene had to have something to compensate for all she didn t get .   intelligence wasn t enough .  it didn t make up sufficiently  so she had this gift of reading expression  intonation  and otherwise invisible bodily twitches  so that no secret was safe from her .   how long had she kept this dangerous attribute to herself .  how long had she known about it .  was it something that grew stronger with age .  why did she allow it to emerge now  to peep out from behind the curtain she seemed to have drawn over it  and to use it as something with which to beat her mother .   was it because aurinel had rejected her  finally and definitely  according to what she had seen in him .  was she striking out blindly in consequence .   guilty  thought insigna .  why shouldn t i feel guilty .  it is all my fault .  i should have known from the start  from the instant of discovery  but i didn t want to know .       six  approach       .     how early had she known .  from the moment she had named the star nemesis .  had she felt what it was and what it meant  and had she named it appropriately without conscious thought .   when she had first spotted the star  it had been only the act of finding it that counted .  there had been no room in her mind for anything but immortality .  it was her own star  insigna s star .  she had been tempted to call it that .  how glorious that had sounded  even as she had reluctantly avoided it with a hollow internal grimace of mock modesty .  how unbearable it would have been now if she had fallen into that trap .   after the discovery  there had come the shock of pitt s demand for secrecy  and then the furious preparation for the leaving .   would that be what it would be called in the history books someday .  the leaving .  capitalized .    then  after the leaving  there were two years in which the ship skipped steadily and barely into and out of hyperspace  and the endless calculations that were involved in that hyper assistance  for which astronomical data was constantly required  with herself supervising the supply .  the density and composition of interstellar matter alone    at no time in those four years had she been able to think of nemesis in detail  not once could she zero in on the obvious .   was that possible .  or did she simply turn away from what she did not want to see .  had she deliberately sought refuge in all the secrecy and scurry and excitement that presented itself to her .   but there came a time when the last hyperspatial period was behind them  when  for a month  they would be decelerating through an initial hail of hydrogen atoms  which they struck with such speed that those atoms were converted into cosmic ray particles .   no ordinary space vehicle could have endured that  but rotor had a layer of soil around it that had been thickened for the trip  and the particles were absorbed .   there would come a time  she had been assured by one of the hyperspatialists when one would enter and leave hyperspace at ordinary speeds .   given hyperspace in the first place   he had said   no new conceptual breakthrough is required .  it s just engineering .    maybe .  the remaining hyperspatialists  however  considered the notion so much star exhaust .   insignia hurried in to see pitt when the appalling truth descended upon her .  he had had little time for her in the last year  and she had understood .  there was a certain tension that became more and more evident as the excitement of the trip wound down  as people realized that in a matter of months they would be in the neighborhood of anther star .  they would then have the constant problem of having to survive over a long period in the vicinity of a strange red dwarf star without any guarantee of reasonable planetary material to serve as a supply source  let alone a living place .   janus pitt no longer looked like a young man  although his hair was still dark  his face unlined .  only four years had passed since she had come to him with the news of nemesis  existence .  there was  however  a harried look in his eyes  a sense of having had his joy rubbed away and his cares left naked to the world .   he was commissioner elect now .  perhaps that might account for a great deal of what might be troubling him  but who could tell .  insignia had never known true power  or the responsibility that accompanied it  but something told her it might have the capacity for souring one who did .   pitt smiled at her absently .  they had been forced to be close when they had shared a secret that at first no one  and then almost no one   had shared with them .  they could then talk unguardedly with each other  when they could not do so with anyone else .  after the leaving  however  when the secret was revealed  they had grown apart again .    janus   she said   there is something eating away at me and i had to come to you with it .  it s nemesis .     is there anything new .  you can t say you ve found out it isn t where you thought it was .  it s right out there  less than sixteen billion kilometers away .  we can see it .     yes  i know .  but when i first found it  at a distance of two plus light years  i took it for granted that it was a companion star  that nemesis and the sun were circling a common center of gravity .  something that close would almost have to be .  it would be so dramatic .     all right .  why shouldn t things be dramatic now and then .     because as close as it is  it is clearly too far away to be a companion star .  the gravitational attraction between nemesis and the sun is terribly weak  so weak that the gravitational perturbations of nearby stars would make the orbit unstable .     but nemesis is there .     yes  and more or less between ourselves and alpha centauri .     what has alpha centauri got to do with it .     the fact is that nemesis is not much farther from alpha centauri than it is from the sun .  it s just as likely to be a companion star of alpha centauri .  or  more likely  whichever system it belongs to  the presence of the other star is now disrupting it  or has already disrupted it .    pitt looked at insigna thoughtfully and tapped his fingers lightly on the arm of his chair .   how long does it take nemesis to go around the sun  assuming it s the sun s companion .     i don t know .  i d have to work out its orbit .  that s something i should have done before the leaving  but there were so many other things occupying me then  and now  too  but that s no excuse .     well  make a guess .   insigna said   if it s a circular orbit  it would take nemesis just over fifty million years to make a circuit about the sun  or  more properly  about the center of gravity of the system  with the sun making a similar circuit .  the line between the two  as they moved  would always pass through that center .  on the other hand  if nemesis is following a highly elliptical orbit and is now at its farthest  as it must be  for if it ventured farther still  it would certainly not be a companion star  then perhaps as little as twenty five million years .     last time  then  that nemesis was in this position  more or less between alpha centauri and the sun  alpha centauri must have been in a much different position than it is now .  twenty five to fifty million years would move alpha centauri  wouldn t it .  how much .     a good fraction of a light year .     would that mean that this is the first time nemesis is being fought over by the two stars .  till now  would it have been circling peacefully .     not a chance  janus .  even if you count out alpha centauri  there are other stars .  one star may have arrived now  but there had to be another star in interfering distance at some other part of its orbit in the past .  the orbit just isn t stable .     what s it doing here in our neighborhood  then  if it isn t orbiting the sun .     exactly   said insigna .    what do you mean   exactly  .     if it were orbiting the sun  it would be moving at a speed  relative to the sun  of somewhere between eighty and one hundred meters a second  depending on nemesis  mass .  that s very slow motion for a star  so it would seem to stay in the same place for a long time .  it would therefore remain behind the cloud for a long time  especially if the cloud is moving in the same direction relative to the sun .  with such a slow motion and its light dimmed  it s no wonder it s never been noticed till now .  however    she paused .   pitt  who made no effort to seem devouringly interested  sighed and said   well .  can you get to the point .     well  if it s not in orbit about the sun  then it is in independent motion and it should be moving relative to the sun at a hundred kilometers a second or so  a thousand times as fast as if it were in orbit .  it just happens to be in our neighborhood now  but it is moving on  will pass the sun  and will never return .  but  just the same  it stays behind the cloud  scarcely budging from its position .     why should that be .     there s one way it can be moving at a good clip  and yet not seem to be moving from its position in the sky .     don t tell me it s vibrating back and forth .   insigna s lip curled .   please don t try to make jokes  janus .  this isn t funny .  nemesis might be moving more or less straight toward the sun .  it wouldn t be shifting either to the right or left  so that it would not seem to be changing position  but it would be coming right toward us  that is  right toward the solar system .    pitt stared at her in surprise .  .  is there evidence for that .     not yet .  there was no reason to take the spectrum of nemesis when it was first spotted .  it was only after i had noticed the parallax that a spectral analysis would have made sense  and then i never got around to it .  if you remember  you put me at the head of the far probe project  and told me to direct everyone s attention away from nemesis .  i couldn t have arranged a close spectral analysis at that time  and since the leaving  well  i haven t .  but i will investigate the matter now  you can be sure .     let me ask you a question .  wouldn t it produce the same effect of motionlessness  if nemesis were moving directly away from the sun .  it s a fifty fifty chance whether it s moving toward the sun or away from it  isn t it .     spectral analysis will tell us .  a red shift of the spectral lines will mean there s a recession  a violet shift  an approach .     but it s too late now .  if you take its spectrum  it will tell you it s approaching us  because we re approaching it .     right now  i wouldn t take the spectrum of nemesis .  i d take it of the sun .  if nemesis is approaching the sun  then the sun will be approaching nemesis  and we can allow for our own motion .  besides  we re slowing and  in a month or so  we will be moving so slowly that our motion won t be affecting the spectroscopic results appreciably .    for the space of half a minute  pitt seemed lost in thought  staring at his uncluttered desk  his hand slowly stroking the computer terminal .  then he said  without bothering to look up   no .  these are observations that need not be made .  i don t want you worrying yourself about it any more  eugenia .  it s a non problem  so just forget it .    the wave of his hand made it clear that she was to leave .        .     insigna s breath made a whistling sound as it was forced out of angrily tightened nostrils .  she said in a low husky voice   how dare you  janus .  how dare you .     how dare i what .   pitt frowned .    how dare you order me out of here as though i were a computer puncher .  if i hadn t found nemesis  we wouldn t be here .  you wouldn t be commissioner elect .  nemesis is mine .  i have a say in it .     nemesis isn t yours .  it s rotor s .  so please leave now and let me get on with the business of the day .     janus   she said  raising her voice .   i tell you again that  in all likelihood  nemesis is moving toward our solar system .     and i tell you again that it is only a fifty fifty chance that it is .  and even if it were heading toward the solar system  not our solar system any longer  by the way  but their solar system  don t tell me it s going to hit the sun .  i won t believe you if you do .  in its whole nearly five billion year history  the sun has never been struck by a star  or even come close .  the odds against stellar collisions even in relatively crowded parts of the galaxy are enormous .  i may not be an astronomer  but i know that much .     odds are just odds  janus  not certainties .  it s conceivable  however unlikely  that n emesis and the sun might collide  but i recognize that it s very unlikely they will .  the trouble is that a close approach  even without collision  might be fatal to earth .     how close is a close approach .     i don t know .  it will take a great deal of computation .     all right  then .  you suggest that we take the trouble to make the necessary observations and computations and  if we find out that the situation is indeed fraught with danger to the solar system  then what .  do we warn the solar system .     well yes .  what choice would we have .     and how would we warn them .  we have no means of hypercommunication and  even if we had  they have no system for receiving hypermessages .  if we sent out a luminal message of some sort  light  micro waves  modulated neutrinos  it would take over two years to reach earth  assuming we have a beam powerful enough  or sufficiently coherent .  and even then  how would we know if they had received it .  if they had and bothered to answer  that answer would take another two years to return .  and what will be the final result of the warning .  we will have to tell them where nemesis is and they will see that the information is coming from that direction .  the whole point of our secrecy  the whole plan for establishing a homogeneous civilization around nemesis  free of interference  would be lost .     whatever the cost  janus  how could you consider not warning them .     where s your concern .  even if nemesis is moving toward the sun  how long would it take for it to reach the solar system .     it could reach the neighborhood of the sun in five thousand years .    pitt sat back in his chair and regarded insigna with a kind of wry amusement .   five thousand years .  only five thousand years .  look  eugenia  two hundred and fifty years ago  the first earthman stood on the moon .  two and a half centuries have passed and here we are at the nearest star .  where will we be in another two and a half centuries  at this rate .  at any star we wish .  and in five thousand years  fifty centuries  we will be allover the galaxy  barring the presence of other intelligent forms of life .  we will be reaching out to other galaxies .  within five thousand years  technology will have advanced to the point where  if the solar system were really in trouble  all its settlements and its entire planetary population could take off for deep space and other stars .    insigna shook her head .   don t think that technological advance means that you can empty the solar system by a mere wave of the hand  janus .  to remove billions of people without chaos and without tremendous loss of life would require long preparation .  if they are in mortal danger five thousand years from now  they must know now .  it is not too soon to begin to plan .    pitt said   you have a good heart  eugenia  so i ll offer a compromise .  suppose we take a hundred years in which to establish ourselves here  to multiply  to build a cluster of settlements that will be strong enough and stable enough to be secure .  then we can investigate nemesis  destination and  if necessary  warn the solar system .  they will still have nearly five thousand years in which to prepare .  surely a small delay of a century will not be fatal .    insigna sighed .   is that your vision of the future .  humanity squabbling endlessly over the stars .  each little group trying to establish itself as supreme over this star or that .  endless hatred  suspicion  and conflict  of the kind we had on earth for thousands of years  expanded into the galaxy for thousands more .     eugenia  i have no vision .  humanity will do as it pleases .  it will squabble as you say  or it will perhaps set up a galactic empire  or do something else .  i can t dictate what humanity will do  and i don t intend to try to shape it .  for myself  i have only this one settlement to care for  and this one century in which to establish it at nemesis .  by then  you and i will be safely dead  and our successors will handle the problem of warning the solar system  if that should be necessary .  i m trying to be reasonable  not emotional  eugenia .  you are a reasonable person  too .  think about it .    insigna did .  she sat there  looking somberly at pitt  while he waited with almost exaggerated patience .   finally she said   very well .  i see your point .  i will get on with analyzing nemesis  motion relative to the sun .  perhaps we can forget the whole thing .     no .   pitt raised an admonishing finger .   remember what i said earlier .  these observations will not be made .  if it turns out that the solar system is not in danger  we will have gained nothing .  we will then merely do what i insist we do in any case  spend a century strengthening the civilization of rotor .  if  however  you find that there is danger  then your conscience will hurt and you will be consumed with apprehensions and fears and guilt .  the news will somehow get out and it will weaken the resolve of rotorians  many of whom may be as sentimental as you are .  we would then lose a great deal .  do you understand me .    she was silent  and he said   good .  i see you do .   again  the wave of his hand made it clear that she was to leave .   this time she left  and pitt  looking after her  thought  she is really becoming insupportable .       seven  destruction .        .     marlene watched her mother owlishly .  she was careful to keep her expression flat and meaningless  but within herself she was both pleased and surprised .  her mother was finally telling her of the events involving her father and commissioner pitt .  she was being treated as a grown up .   marlene said   i would have checked nemesis  motions regardless of what commissioner pitt said  mother  but i see you didn t .  your guilt makes it plain .    insigna said   i can t get used to the notion that i wear my guilt like a label on my forehead .     no one hides their feelings   said marlene .   if you really watch  you can always tell .     others couldn t .  marlene had learned that only slowly  and with difficulty .  people just didn t look  they didn t sense  they didn t care .  they didn t watch faces  and bodies  and sounds  and attitudes  and little nervous habits .     you shouldn t really watch like that  marlene   said insigna  as though their thoughts had taken parallel paths .  she put her arm around the girl s shoulder to prevent her words from sounding like a scolding .   people get nervous when those large dark eyes of yours fix on them soulfully .  respect people s privacy .     yes  mother   said marlene  noting without effort that her mother was trying to protect herself .  she was nervous about herself  wondering how much she gave away at each moment .   then marlene said   how is it that despite all your guilty feelings about the solar system  you did nothing .     a number of reasons  molly .     not  molly   thought marlene with anguish .  marlene .  marlene .  marlene .  three syllables .  accent on the second .  grown up .     like what reasons .   asked marlene sulkily .   couldn t her mother detect the wave of hostility that swept over marlene each time a kid name was used .  surely it twisted her face  smoldered her eyes  convulsed her lips .  why didn t people notice .  why didn t people look .     for one thing  janus pitt was very convincing .  however odd the points he makes  however hostile you feel toward them at the time  he always makes you see that he has good reasons for his viewpoints .     if that s true  mother  he s awfully dangerous .    insigna seemed to break away from her thoughts to glance curiously at her daughter .   why do you say that .     every point of view can have good reasons behind it .  if someone can seize those reasons quickly  and present them convincingly  he can argue anyone into anything  and that s dangerous .     janus pitt has those abilities  i ll admit .  i m surprised you understand these things .     marlene thought  because i m only fifteen  and you re used to thinking i m a child .    aloud  she said   you learn a lot watching people .     yes  but remember what i told you .  control the watching .    never .    so mr .  pitt persuaded you .     he made me see there d be no harm in waiting awhile .     and you weren t even curious to study nemesis and see exactly where it was going .  you would have to be .     i was  but it s not as easy as you think .  the observatory is in constant use .  you have to wait your turn to use the instruments .  even if i m the head  i can t use them freely .  then  too  when someone does use them  there s no secret about it .  we know what it s being used for and why .  there was very little chance i would be able to develop a really detailed spectrum of nemesis and of the sun  or to use the observatory computer on the necessary calculations  without people knowing at once what i was doing .  i suspect that pitt had a few people in the observatory watching me  too .  if i had stepped out of line  he would have known at once .     he couldn t do anything to you about it  could he .     he couldn t have me shot for treason if that s what you mean  not that he d dream of doing such a thing  but he could relieve me of my observatory duties and put me to work in the farms .  i wouldn t want that .  it wasn t long after i d had that little talk with pitt that we discovered that nemesis had a planet  or a companion star .  to this day  we re not sure what to call it .  they were only separated by a distance of four million kilometers and the companion object didn t radiate in visible light at all .     you re talking about megas  aren t you  mother .     yes  i am .  it s an old word meaning  big  and  for a planet  it s very big  considerably bigger than the solar system s largest planet  jupiter .  but it s very small for a star .  some think of megas as a brown dwarf .   she broke off and eyed her daughter narrowly  as though suddenly uncertain as to her capacity to absorb matters .   do you know what a brown dwarf is  molly .     marlene is my name  mother .   insigna flushed slightly .   yes .  i m sorry if i forget now and then .  i can t help it  you know .  i had a very dear little girl once whose name was molly .     i know .  and next time i m six  you can call me molly all you want .    insigna laughed .   do you know what a brown dwarf is  marlene .     yes  i do  mother .  a brown dwarf is a small star like body  with too little mass to develop the temperatures and pressures to bring about hydrogen fusion in its interior  but enough mass to bring about secondary reactions that keep it warm .     that s right .  not bad .  megas is on the borderline .  it s either a very warm planet or a very dim brown dwarf .  it gives off no visible light  but emits richly in the infrared .  it s not quite like anything we ve ever studied .  it was the first extrasolar planetary body  that is  the first planet outside the solar system  that we have been able to study in detail  and the observatory was totally immersed in it .  i wouldn t have had a chance to work on nemesis  motion even if i had wanted to  and  to tell you the truth  i forgot about it for a time .  i was as interested in megas as everyone else was  you see .     um   said marlene .    it turned out it was the only sizable planetary body circling nemesis  but it was enough .  it was five times the mass      i know  mother .  it s five times the mass of jupiter  and one thirtieth the mass of nemesis .  the computer taught me that long ago .     of course  dear .  and it s no more habitable than jupiter is  less  if anything .  that was disappointing at first  even though we didn t really expect to find a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star .  if a planet were close enough to a star like nemesis to keep water liquid  tidal influences would force it to face one side to nemesis at all times .     isn t that what megas does  mother .  i mean  one side always faces nemesis .     yes  it does .  that means it has a warm side and cold side  with the warm side quite warm .  it would be at red heat  if it weren t that the circulation of its dense atmosphere tends to equalize temperatures somewhat .  because of this and because of megas  own inner warmth  even the cold side is quite warm .  there are many things about megas that were unique in astronomical experience .  and then we discovered that megas had a satellite or  if you want to consider megas a very small star  it had a planet  erythro .     which rotor orbits  i know .  but  mother  it s been over eleven years since there was all that fuss about megas and erythro .  in all that time  haven t you managed to sneak a look at the spectra of nemesis and the sun .  haven t you done a little figuring .     well     marlene said hastily   i know you have .     by my expression .     by everything about you .     you can be a very uncomfortable person to have around  marlene .  yes  i have .     and .     yes  it s heading for the solar system .    there was a pause .  then marlene said in a low voice   is it going to hit .     no  as far as my figures are concerned .  i m quite sure it s not going to hit the sun  or the earth  or any significant part of the solar system  for that matter .  but it doesn t have to  you see .  even if it misses  it will probably destroy the earth .         .     it was quite clear to marlene that her mother did not like to talk about earth s destruction  that there was internal friction inhibiting her discourse  that if she were left to herself  she would stop talking .  her expression  the way she pulled away a little from marlene  as though anxious to leave  the way she licked her lips very delicately  as though she were trying to remove the taste of her words  was clarity itself to marlene .   but she did not want her mother to stop .  she had to know more .  she said gently   if nemesis misses  how will it destroy the earth .     let me try to explain .  the earth goes around the sun  just as rotor goes around erythro .  if all there were in the solar system were the earth and the sun  then the earth would go around in the same path almost eternally .  i say  almost  because  as it turns  it radiates gravitational waves that bleed the earth s momentum  and that causes it very  very slowly to spin into the sun .  we can ignore that .    there are other complicating factors because earth isn t alone .  the moon  mars  venus  jupiter  every object in the neighborhood pulls at it .  the pulls are very minor compared to that of the sun  so earth remains in its orbit more or less .  however  the minor pulls  which are shifting in direction and intensity in a complicated way  as the various objects themselves move  introduce minor changes in earth s orbit .  earth moves in and out slightly  its axial tilt veers and changes its slant a bit  the eccentricity alters somewhat  and so on .    it can be shown  it has been shown  that all these minor changes are cyclic .  they don t progress in one direction  but move back and forth .  what it amounts to is that the earth  in its orbit about the sun  quivers slightly in a dozen different ways .  all the bodies in the solar system quiver in this way .  earth s quiver doesn t prevent it from supporting life .  at the worst  it may get an ice age or an ice disappearance and a rise and fall in sea level  but life has survived everything for well over three billion years .    but now let us suppose nemesis dashes by and misses  that it doesn t approach closer than a light month or so .  that would be less than a trillion kilometers .  as it passes  and it would take a number of years to pass  it would give a gravitational push to the system .  it would make the quivering worse  but then  when it was gone  the quivers would settle down again .    marlene said   you look as though you think it would be a lot worse than you make it sound .  what s so bad about nemesis giving the solar system a little extra quiver  if it all settles down again afterward .     well  will it settle down again in quite the same place .  that s the problem .  if earth s equilibrium position is a little different  a little farther from the sun  a little nearer  if its orbit is a little more eccentric or its axis a little more tilted  or less  how will that affect earth s climate .  even a small change might make it an uninhabitable world .     can t you calculate it out in advance .     no .  rotor isn t a good place to calculate from .  it quivers  too  and a great deal .  it would take considerable time and considerable calculation to deduce from my observations here exactly what path nemesis is taking  and we just won t be sure till it gets considerably closer to the solar system  long after i am dead .     so you can t tell exactly just how closely nemesis will pass the solar system .     it is almost impossible to calculate .  the gravitational field of every nearby star within a dozen light years has to be taken into account .  after all  the tiniest uncalculated effect may build up to such a deviation in over two light years as to make a passage that is calculated as a near hit come out  actually  to be a total miss .  or vice versa .     commissioner pitt said everyone in the solar system will be able to leave if they want to by the time nemesis arrives .  is he right .     he might be .  but how can one tell what will happen in five thousand years .  what historical twists will take place and how that will affect matters .  we can hope everyone will get off safely .     even if they re not warned   said marlene  feeling rather diffident at pointing out an astronomical truism to her mother   they ll find out for themselves .  they ve got to .  nemesis will come closer and closer and it will be unmistakable after a while and they can calculate its path much more accurately as it comes closer .     but they will have that much less time to make their escape  if one is necessary .    marlene stared at her toes .  she said   mother  don t be angry with me .  it seems to me as though you d be unhappy even if everyone got away from the solar system safely .  something else is wrong .  please tell me .    insigna said   i don t like the thought of everyone leaving earth .  even if it is done in orderly fashion  with plenty of time and with no casualties to speak of  i still don t like the thought .  i don t want earth to be abandoned .     suppose it must be .     then it will be .  i can bow to the inevitable  but i don t have to like it .     are you sentimental about earth .  you studied there  didn t you .     i did my graduate work in astronomy there .  i didn t like earth  but that doesn t matter .  it s the place where human beings originated .  do you know what i mean  marlene .  even if i didn t think much of it when i was there  it s still the world where life developed over the eons .  to me it s not only a world but an idea  an abstraction .  i want it to exist for the sake of the past .  i don t know if i can make that clear .    marlene said   father was an earthman .    insigna s lips tightened a bit .   yes  he was .     and he went back to earth .     the records say he did .  i suppose he did .     i m half an earthperson  then .  isn t that so .    insigna frowned .   we re all earthpeople  marlene .  my great great grandparents lived on earth all their lives .  my great grandmother was born on earth .  everyone  without exception  is descended from earthpeople .  and not just human beings .  every speck of life on every settlement  from a virus to a tree  is descended from earth life .    marlene said   but only human beings know it .  and some are closer than others .  do you think about father  sometimes  even now .   marlene looked up briefly at her mother s face and winced .   it s none of my business .  that s what you re going to tell me .     that s the feeling i just had  but i don t have to be guided by my feelings .  after all  you re his daughter .  yes  i think about him now and then .   she shrugged her shoulders slightly .   insigna said   do you think about him  marlene .     i have nothing to think of .  i don t remember him .  i ve never seen any holograms  or anything .     no  there was no point in    her voice trailed off .    but when i was littler  i used to wonder why some fathers stayed with their children when the leaving happened  and some fathers didn t .  i thought that maybe the ones who left didn t like their children  and that father didn t like me .    insigna stared at her daughter .   you never told me that .     it was a private thought when i was little .  when i got older  i knew that it was more complicated than that .     you should never have had to think so .  it s not true .  i would have assured you of that  if i had had the slightest idea      you don t like to talk about those times  mother .  i understand .     i would have anyway  if i had known about that thought of yours  if i could read your face as you read mine .  he did love you .  he would have taken you with him if i had allowed it .  it s my fault  really  that you two are separated .     his  too .  he might have stayed with us .     well  he might have  but now that the years have passed  i can see and understand his problems a little better than i could then .  after all  i wasn t leaving home  my world was coming with me .  i may be over two light years from earth  but i m still at home on rotor where i was born .  your father was different .  he was born on earth and not on rotor  and i suppose he couldn t bear the thought of leaving earth altogether  and forever .  i think about that now and then  also .  i hate the thought of earth being deserted .  there must be several billion people there whose hearts would break to leave it .    there was silence between them for a moment  then marlene said   i wonder what father is doing back on earth right now .     how can we possibly tell  marlene .  twenty trillion kilometers is a long  long way  and fourteen years is a long  long time .     do you suppose he s still alive .     we can t even know that   said insigna .   life can be very short on earth .   then  as though suddenly aware she wasn t talking to herself  she said   i m sure he s alive  marlene .  he was in excellent health when he left  and he s only just approaching fifty now .   then softly   do you miss him  marlene .    marlene shook her head .   you can t miss what you ve never had .    but you had him  mother  she thought .  and you miss him .        eight  agent       .     oddly enough  crile fisher found it necessary to become accustomed to earth  or reaccustomed to it .  he had not thought that rotor had become so much a part of him in a matter of not quite four years .  it had been the longest period during which he had been away from earth  but surely it had not been long enough to make earth seem strange to him .   there was now the sheer size of earth  the distant horizon ending sharp against the sky instead of turning up mistily .  there were the crowds  the unchanging gravity  the sense of wild and willful atmosphere  of temperature soaring and diving  of nature out of all control .   it was not that he had to experience any of this to feel it .  even when he was in his own quarters  he knew it was all out there and the ferality of it all pervaded his spirit  somehow invaded it .  or it might be that the room was too small  too full  that the drift of sound was too unmistakable  as though he were being pressed in on by a crowded and decaying world .   strange that he had missed earth so intensely in those years on rotor  and that  now that he was back on earth  he missed rotor so intensely .  was he to spend his life wanting to be where he was not .   the signal light flashed and he heard the buzz .  it flickered  things on earth tended to flicker  while on rotor everything was constant with an almost aggressive efficiency .   enter   he said in a low voice  but it was loud enough to activate the de locking mechanism .   garand wyler entered  fisher knew it would be he  and looked at the other with an amused expression .   have you budged since i left  crile .     here and there .  i ve eaten .  spent some time in the bathroom .     good .  you re alive  then  even if you don t look it .   he was grinning broadly  his skin smooth and brown  his eyes dark  his teeth white  his hair thick and crisp .   brooding about rotor .     i think of it now and then .     i kept meaning to ask  but never got around to it .  it was snow white without the seven dwarfs  wasn t it .     snow white   said fisher .   i never saw one black person there .     in that case  good riddance to them .  did you know that they re gone .   fisher s muscles tightened and he nearly got to his feet  but he resisted the impulse .  he said  nodding   they said they would be .     they meant it .  they drifted away .  we watched as far as we could  eavesdropped their radiation .  they pumped up speed with this hyper assistance of theirs and  in a split second  while we could still make them out loud and clear  they were gone .  everything cut off .     did you pick them up when they got back into space .     several times .  each time weaker .  they were traveling at the speed of light after they had really flexed their muscles  and after three blips  into hyperspace and back into space  they were too far to be picked up .    fisher said bitterly   their choice .  they kicked out the nays  like me .     i m sorry you weren t there .  you should have been .  it was interesting to watch .  you know there were some hard liners who insisted to the very end that hyper assistance was a fraud  that it was all faked up  for some reason .     rotor had the far probe .  they couldn t have it sent as far away as they did without hyper assistance .     faked .  that s what the hard liners said .     it was genuine .     yes  now they know it was .  all of them .  when rotor just vanished off the instruments  there was no other explanation .  every settlement was watching .  no mistake .  it vanished on every set of instruments at the same second .  the irritating thing is  we can t tell where it s going .     alpha centauri  i suppose .  where else .     the office keeps thinking that it might not be alpha centauri and that you might know that .    fisher looked annoyed .   i ve been debriefed all the way to the moon and back .  i haven t held back anything .     sure .  we know that .  it s nothing you know about .  they want me to talk to you  friend to friend  and see what you may know that you don t know about .  something may turn up that you haven t thought of .  you were there four years  married  had a kid .  you couldn t have missed everything .     how could i .  if there were the slightest notion that i was after anything  i d have been kicked off .  just being from earth made me completely suspect .  if i hadn t married  given that kind of proof that i planned to stay rotorian  i would have been kicked off anyway .  and as it was  they kept me far away from anything critical or sensitive .    fisher looked away .    and it worked .  my wife was just an astronomer .  i didn t have my pick  you know .  i couldn t put an ad on holovision announcing that i was in the market for a young lady who was a hyperspatialist .  if i had met one  i would have done my best to hook on to her even if she looked like a hyena  but i never met one in all my time there .  the technology was so sensitive  i think they kept the key people in complete isolation .  i think they must all have worn masks in the laboratories and used code names .  four years  and i never got a hint  never found out a thing .  and i knew it would mean i was through with the office .    he turned to garand and said with sudden passion   things got so bad that i turned into some kind of lout .  the sense of failure was just overpowering .    wyler was sitting across the table from fisher in the cluttered  room  teetering back on the rear legs of his chair  but carefully holding the table lest he teeter too far .   he said   crile  the office can t afford to be delicate  but it isn t totally unfeeling .  they regret having to approach you like this  but they must .  and i regret being given the job  but i must .  we are concerned that you ve failed and brought us nothing .  if rotor hadn t left  we might have felt there was nothing to bring .  but they did leave .  they did have hyper assistance  and yet you ve brought us nothing .     i know that .     but that doesn t mean we want to throw you out or  get rid of you .  we hope we can still use you .  so i have to make sure that your failure was an honest one .     what does that mean .     i have to be able to tell them that you didn t fail because of any personal weakness .  after all  you married a rotorian woman .  was she pretty .  were you fond of her .    fisher snarled   what you re really asking is whether  out of love for a rotorian woman  i deliberately protected rotor and helped them keep their secret .     well   said wyler  unmoved .   did you .     how can you ask that .  if i had decided to be a rotorian  i would have left with them .  by now i would be lost in space and you might never find me .  but i didn t do that .  i got off rotor and returned to earth  even though i knew my failure would probably destroy my career .     we appreciate your loyalty .     there s more loyalty in this than you think .     we recognize that you probably loved your wife and that  as a matter of duty  you had to leave her .  that would count in your favor  if we could be sure      not so much my wife .  it was my daughter .    wyler viewed fisher thoughtfully .   we know you have a one year old daughter  crile .  under the circumstances  perhaps you shouldn t have given that particular hostage to fortune .     i agree .  but i can t treat myself as though i were a well oiled robot .  things happen against one s will sometimes .  and once the child was born and i had had her for a year      that is understandable  but it was only a year .  scarcely time  really  to build a relationship     fisher grimaced .   you may think it understandable  but you don t understand .      explain  then .  i ll try .     it was my sister  you see .  my younger sister .    wyler nodded .   there s mention of that in your compufile .  rose  i think .     roseanne .  she died in the san francisco riots eight years ago .  she was only seventeen .     i m sorry .     she wasn t a participant on either side .  she was one of those innocent bystanders who is so more apt to get hurt than the ringleaders or the officers .  at least we found her body and i had something to cremate .    wyler maintained a half embarrassed silence .   fisher said finally   she was only seventeen .  our parents died    he brushed his hand to one side  as though indicating it was not something he wished to discuss   when she was four and i was fourteen .  i worked after school and i saw to it that she was fed  and clothed  and comfortable  even when i was not .  i taught myself programming  not that i ever made a decent living out of that either  and then  when she was seventeen  when she had never hurt a soul  when she didn t even know what all the fighting and shouting was about  she was simply trapped     wyler said   i can see why you volunteered for rotor .     oh yes .  for a couple of years i was just numb .  i joined the office partly to keep my mind occupied and partly because i thought there would be danger in it .  i rather looked forward to death for a while  if i could manage to do something useful en route .  when the problem of placing an agent on rotor was discussed  i volunteered for it .  i wanted to get off earth .      and now you re back .  do you regret that .     a little bit  yes  but rotor choked me .  with all its faults  earth has room .  if only you could have seen roseanne  garand .  you have no idea .  she wasn t pretty  but she had such eyes .   fisher s own eyes were focused on the past  a slight pucker between his brows as though he were peering hard to clearly focus .   beautiful eyes  but frightening ones .  it seemed to me that i could never meet them without feeling nervous .  she could look right into you  if you know what i mean .     actually  i don t   said wyler .   fisher paid no attention .   she always knew when you were lying or hiding the truth .  you couldn t be silent without her guessing what the trouble was .     you re not going to tell me she was a telepath .     what .  oh no .  she used to say she read expressions and listened to intonations .  she said no one could hide what they were thinking .  no matter how you laughed  you could not hide the tragic undercurrent  no smile sufficed to hide bitterness .  she tried to explain  but i could never grasp what it was she did .  she was something special  garand .  i was in awe of her .  and then my child was born .  marlene .     yes .     she had the same eyes .     the baby had your sister s eyes .     not immediately  but i watched them develop .  when she was six months old  those eyes made me flinch .     your wife flinched  too .     i never noticed her being affected  but then  she never had a sister roseanne .  marlene hardly cried at all  she was peaceful .  i remember roseanne was like that as a baby .  and marlene didn t show any signs that she was going to be particularly pretty either .  it was as though roseanne had come back to me .  so you see how hard it turned out to be .     coming back to earth  you mean .     doing that and leaving them behind .  it was like losing roseanne a second time .  i ll never see her now .  never .     but you came back anyway .     loyalty .  duty .  but if you want the truth  i almost didn t .  i was standing there  torn .  torn apart .  i was desperately wanting not to leave roseanne marlene .  you see  i confuse the names .  and eugenia  my wife  said to me in a heartbroken way   if you knew where we were going  you wouldn t be so ready to turn back .   and at that moment i didn t want to leave .  i asked her to come to earth with me .  she refused .  i asked her to let me take ro  marlene  at least .  she refused .  and then  when i might have given in and stayed  she went wild and ordered me out .  and i went .    wyler stared at fisher reflectively .     if you knew where we were going  you wouldn t be so ready to turn back .   is that what she said .     yes  that s what she said .  and when i said   why .  where is rotor going .    she said   to the stars .       that can t be right  crile .  you knew they were planning to go to the stars  but she said   if you knew where we were going    there was something you didn t know .  what was it you didn t know .     what are you talking about .  how can anyone know what he doesn t know .    wyler shrugged it off .   did you tell this to the office during the debriefing .    fisher considered .   i guess not .  i didn t even think of it till i started telling you the story about how i nearly stayed .   he closed his eyes  then said slowly   no  this is the first time i ve talked about that .  it s the first time i ve let myself think about it .     very well  then .  now that you think about it  where was rotor going .  did you hear any speculations on rotor about that .  any rumors .  any guesses .     the assumption was that it would be to alpha centauri .  where else .  it s the nearest star .     your wife was an astronomer .  what did she say about it .     nothing .  she never discussed it .     rotor sent out the far probe .     i know .     and your wife was involved  as an astronomer .     she was  but she never discussed it either  and i was careful not to do so .  my mission would have been aborted  and perhaps i might have been imprisoned  or executed  for all i know  if i displayed an unhealthy curiosity too openly .     but as an astronomer  she would know the destination .  she as much as said so .   if you knew    you see .  she knew and if you knew  too     fisher didn t seem interested .   since she didn t tell me what she knew  i can t tell you .     are you sure .  no casual remarks whose significance you didn t note at the time .  after all  you re not an astronomer and she might have said something you didn t quite get .  do you remember anything at all she said that set you to puzzling .     i can t think of anything .     think .  is it possible that the far probe located a planetary system around one or both of the sun like stars of alpha centauri .     i can t say .     or planets about any star .   fisher shrugged .    think .   said wyler urgently .   is there any reason for you to think that she meant   you think we re going to alpha centauri  but there are planets circling it and we re heading for those .   or could she have meant   you think we re going to alpha centauri  but we re going to another star where we re sure there will be a useful planet .   something like that .     i couldn t possibly guess .    garand wyler s generous lips compressed themselves tightly for a moment .  then he said   i ll tell you what  crile  my old friend .  there are three things that are going to happen now .  first  you re going to have to undergo another debriefing .  second  i suspect we re going to have to persuade the ceres settlement to allow us the use of their asteroid telescope  and use it to inspect  very closely  every star within a hundred light years of the solar system .  and  third  we ll have to whip our hyperspatialists into jumping a little higher and farther .  you watch and see if that s not what happens .        nine  erythro       .     there were times  once in a while  once in an ever longer while as the years passed  or so it seemed to him   when janus pitt found time to sit back in his chair  alone and silent  and just allow his mind to relax .  those were moments when there were no orders to give  no information to absorb  no immediate decisions to make  no farms to visit  no factories to inspect  no regions in space to penetrate  no one to see  no one to listen to  no one to foil  no one to encourage  and always when such times came  pitt allowed himself the final and least exhaustible luxury  that of self pity .   it was not that he would have anything different than what it was .  he had planned for all his adult life to be commissioner because he thought that no one could run rotor as he could  and now that he was commissioner  he still thought so .   but why  among all the fools of rotor  could he find no one who could see long range as he could .  it was fourteen years since the leaving  and still no one could really see the inevitable  not even after he had explained it carefully .   someday  back in the solar system  sooner rather than later  someone would develop hyper assistance as the hyperspatialists on rotor had  perhaps even in a better form .  someday humanity would set out in its hundreds and thousands of settlements  in its millions and billions of people  to colonize the galaxy  and that would be a brutal time .   yes  the galaxy was enormous .  how often had he heard that .  and beyond it were other galaxies .  but humanity would not spread out evenly .  always  always  there would be some star systems that  for one reason or another  were better than other star systems  and they would be the ones snarled and fought over .  if there were ten star systems and ten colonizing groups  all ten would zero in on one of the star systems  and one only .   and sooner or later  they would discover n emesis and the colonizers would appear .  how would rotor survive then .   only if rotor gained as much time as possible  built up a strong civilization  and expanded reasonably .  if they had enough time  they might expand their hold over a group of stars .  if not  nemesis alone would be enough  but it must be made impregnable .   pitt did not dream of universal conquest  of conquest of any kind .  what he wanted was an island of tranquility and security against the days when the galaxy would be aflame and in chaos as a result of conflicting ambitions .   but he alone could see this .  he alone bore the weight of it .  he might live another quarter century and might remain in power through all that time  either as actual commissioner or as an elder statesman whose word would be decisive .  yet  eventually  he would die  and to whom could he then bequeath his far sightedness .   then pitt felt a twinge of self pity .  he had labored for so many years  would labor for so many more  yet was appreciated  truly appreciated  by none .  and it would all come to an end anyway  because the idea would be drowned in the ocean of mediocrity that constantly lapped at the ankles of those few who could see beyond the years .   it was fourteen years since the leaving and when  at any time  had he been able to be quietly confident .  he went to sleep each night with the fear that he would be awakened before morning with the news that another settlement had arrived  that nemesis had been found .   he passed through every day with some hidden part of him paying no attention to what was immediately on the agenda  but listening  listening for the fatal words .   fourteen years and they were still not safe .  one additional settlement had been built  new rotor .  there were people living on it  but it was a new world  of course .  it still smelled of paint  as the old saying had it .  three more settlements were in various stages of construction .   soon  within the decade  at any rate  the number of settlements under construction would increase  and they would be given that oldest of all commands  be fruitful and multiply .   with the example of earth before them  with the knowledge that each settlement had a narrow and unexpandable capacity  procreation had always been under strict control in space .  there the immovable needs of arithmetic met the possibly irresistible force of instinct and immovability won .  but as the number of settlements grew  there would come a time when more people would be needed  many more  and the urge to produce them could be unleashed .   it would be temporary  of course .  no matter how many settlements there were  they could be filled without effort by any population that could easily double its numbers every thirty five years  or less .  and when the day came when the rate of settlement formation passed through its inflection point and began to diminish  it might be far harder to stuff the djinn back into its bottle than it had been to release it .   who would see this well in advance  and prepare for it once pitt himself was gone .   and there was erythro  the planet that rotor orbited in such a way that huge megas and ruddy nemesis rose and set in an intricate pattern .  erythro .  that had been a question from the beginning .   pitt remembered well the early days of their entry into the nemesian system .  the limited intricacy of the planetary family of nemesis had exposed itself little by little  as rotor raced toward the red dwarf star .   megas had been discovered at a distance of four million kilometers from nemesis  only one fifteenth the distance of mercury from the sun of the solar system .  megas obtained about the same amount of energy as earth got from its sun  but with a lesser intensity of visible light and a higher intensity of infrared .   megas  however  was clearly not habitable  even at first glance .  it was a gas giant  with one side always facing nemesis .  both its rotation and revolution were twenty days long .  the perpetual night on half of megas cooled it only moderately  since its own interior heat rose to the surface .  the perpetual day on the other half was unendurably hot .  that megas kept its atmosphere under this heat was entirely because  with its mass higher and its radius smaller than that of jupiter  its surface gravity was fifteen times that of jupiter  and forty times that of earth .   nor did nemesis have any other sizable planet .  but then  as rotor drew closer  and megas could be seen more clearly  the situation was altered again .   it was eugenia insigna who brought pitt the news .  it was not that she had made the discovery herself .  it had merely showed up on the computer enhanced photographs  and had been brought to insigna s attention since she was chief astronomer .  with considerable excitement  she had brought it to pitt in his commissioner s chambers .   she had begun simply enough  keeping her voice level  though it was shaking with emotion .    megas has a satellite   she said .  pitt had lifted his eyebrows ever so slightly  but then he said   isn t that to be expected .  the gas giants of the solar system have anywhere up to a score of satellites .     of course  janus  but this is not an ordinary satellite .  it s large .   pitt kept his cool .   jupiter has four large satellites .     i mean  really large  with almost earth s size and mass .     i see .  interesting .     more than that .  much more than that  janus .  if this satellite revolved about nemesis directly  tidal influences would cause only one side to face nemesis  and it would be uninhabitable .  instead  only one side faces megas  which is much cooler than nemesis .  furthermore  the satellite s orbit is tilted substantially to megas  equator .  this means that in the satellite s sky  megas is seen from only one hemisphere and it moves north and south with a cycle of about one day  while nemesis moves across the sky  rising and setting  again with a cycle of one day .  one hemisphere has twelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light .  the other hemisphere has the same but during its daytime  nemesis is frequently in eclipse for up to half an hour at a time  with the cooling made up for by megas  mild warmth .  during the dark hours  in that hemisphere  the darkness is ameliorated by megas  reflected light .     the satellite has an interesting sky  then .  how fascinating for astronomers .     it s not just an astronomical lollipop  janus .  it s possible that the satellite has an equable temperature at the right range for human beings .  it may be a habitable world .    pitt smiled .   even more interesting  but it wouldn t have our kind of light  though  would it .    insigna nodded .   that s true enough .  it would have a ruddy sun and a dark sky because there would be no short wave light to be scattered .  and there would be a reddish landscape  i suppose .     in that case  since you named nemesis  and one of your people named megas  i ll take the privilege of naming the satellite .  call it erythro  which if i recall correctly  is related to the greek word for  red .      the news remained good for quite some time thereafter .  an asteroid belt of respectable size was located beyond the orbit of the megas erythro system  and those asteroids would clearly be an ideal source of material for building more settlements .   and as they approached erythro  the nature of its habitability seem to grow ever more favorable .  erythro was a planet of sea and land  though its seas  from preliminary estimates of its cloud cover as made out in visible light and the infrared  seemed shallower than earth s oceans  and really impressive mountains on the land were very few .  insigna  on the basis of further calculations  insisted that the climate on the planet as a whole would be entirely suitable for human life .   and then when the inflight had brought them to a distance from which erythro s atmosphere could be studied spectroscopically with precision  insigna said to him   erythro s atmosphere is a little denser than earth s and it contains free oxygen     percent of it  plus   percent argon and the rest nitrogen .  there must be small quantities of carbon dioxide  but we haven t detected it yet .  the point is  it s a breathable atmosphere .     sounds better and better   said pitt .   who could have imagined this when you first spotted nemesis .     better and better for the biologist .  maybe not very good for rotor on the whole  though .  a sizable content of free oxygen in the atmosphere is a sure indication of the presence of life .     life .   said pitt  momentarily stupefied at the thought .    life   said insigna  boring in  taking an apparent perverse pleasure in stressing the possibilities .    and if life  then possibly intelligent life  perhaps even a high civilization .         .     what followed was a nightmare for pitt .  he had not only to live with the terrible apprehension of his own earthpeople pursuing and overtaking him  superior in number certainly  and in technology possibly   but there was an accompanying fear now that was  if anything  greater .  they might be approaching and infringing on an old and advanced civilization capable of eradicating them in a moment of absent minded annoyance as a human being might  without thinking  crush a mosquito that buzzed too near his ear .   as they continued to approach nemesis  pitt said to insigna with a deeply troubled air   need oxygen truly imply the existence of life .     it s a thermodynamic inevitability  janus .  in an earth like planet   and  as nearly as we can tell  erythro is earth like  free oxygen cannot exist  any more than in any earth like gravitational field  a rock can be suspended in open air of its own accord .  oxygen  if present in the atmosphere to begin with  would spontaneously combine with other elements in the soil  giving off energy .  it would only continue to exist in the atmosphere if some process were to supply energy and continually regenerate free oxygen .     i understand that  eugenia  but why need the energy supply process necessarily involve life .     because nothing has ever been encountered in nature that would do the job  except the photosynthetic action of green plants that make use of solar energy to release oxygen .     when you say  nothing has ever been encountered in nature   you mean in the solar system .  this is another system with a different sun and a different planet under different conditions .  the laws of thermodynamics may still hold  but what if there is some chemical process that we haven t encountered in the solar system and that is forming the oxygen here .     if you re a betting man   said insigna   don t bet on it .   what was needed was evidence  and pitt had to wait for the evidence to appear .   to begin with  nemesis and megas turned out to have extremely weak magnetic fields .  this created no particular stir for it had been expected  since both star and planet rotated very slowly .  erythro  with a rotational period of twenty three hours and sixteen minutes  equal to the period of its revolution about megas   had a magnetic field that was similar  in intensity  to earth s .   insigna expressed her satisfaction .   at least we don t have to worry about dangerous radiation effects from intense magnetic fields  especially since nemesis  stellar wind is bound to be much less intense than that of the sun .  that s good  because it means we might be able to detect the presence or absence of life on erythro at a distance .  technological life  anyway .     why s that .   asked pitt .   it s not at all likely that a high level of technology can be reached without copious use of radio wave radiation  which would be speeding away from erythro in all directions .  we ought to be able to differentiate between it and any random radio wave radiation from the planet itself  when such natural radiation is minor  considering that its magnetic field is weak .    pitt said   i ve been thinking that this may not be necessary  that we can reason out erythro s lifelessness  even though it does have an oxygen atmosphere .     oh .  i d like to hear how that might be done .     i ve thought this out .  listen .  didn t you say that tidal influences slow the rotations of nemesis  megas  and erythro .  and didn t you say that  as a result  megas has moved farther from nemesis  and erythro has moved farther from megas .     yes .     therefore  if we look into the past  megas was once closer to nemesis and erythro was closer to megas and to nemesis  too .  that means that erythro was far too warm for life to begin with  and may only have become hospitable to life recently .  there might not have been enough time for a technological civilization to develop .    insigna laughed gently .   good point .  i mustn t underestimate your astronomical ingenuity  but not good enough .  red dwarf stars have a long life and nemesis might easily have been formed in the very youth of the universe  say  fifteen billion years ago .  the tidal influence would have been very strong at first  when the bodies were closer together  and most of the driving apart may have taken place in the first three or four billion years .  the tidal influence decreases as the cube of the distance and  in the last ten billion years or so  there would not have been much change and that would be plenty of time for several technological civilizations to be built up  one after the other .  no  janus  let s not speculate .  let s wait and see if we can detect radio wave radiation  or not .      closer still to nemesis .   it was a tiny red orb now to the unaided eye  but its dimness could be looked at without trouble .  to one side  megas was visible as a ruddy dot .  in the telescope  it showed at something less than half phase as a result of the angle it made with rotor and with nemesis .  erythro could be made out in the telescope  too  as a dimmer crimson dot .   it grew brighter with time  and insigna said   it s good news for you  janus .  no suspicious radio wave radiation of possibly technological origin has yet been detected .     wonderful .   pitt felt the wave of relief as though it were a physical warmth washing over him .    don t leap  though   said insigna .   they might use less radio wave radiation that we might expect .  they might shield it very well .  they might even use something else in place of radio waves .    pitt s mouth quirked into a small half smile .    are you suggesting that seriously .    insigna shrugged uncertainly .   pitt said   because if you re a betting woman  don t bet on it .     closer still to nemesis  and erythro was now a large orb to the unaided eye  with bloated megas near it  and nemesis on the other side of the settlement .  rotor had adjusted its velocity to keep pace with erythro  which  through the telescope  showed drifting broken clouds in the familiar spiral shapes of a planet of earth type temperature and atmosphere  and  therefore  it should be counted on as possessing an at least vaguely earth like climate .   insigna said   there are no signs of light on the night side of erythro .  that should please you  janus .     the absence of light is not consistent with a technological civilization  i suppose .     it certainly isn t .     let me play devil s advocate  then   said pitt .   with a red sun and dim light  wouldn t a civilization produce a dim artificial light as well .     it might be dim in the visible region  but nemesis is rich in the infrared and we would expect artificial light to be similarly rich .   what infrared we detect  however  is planetary .  it appears  more or less equally  over the entire land surface  whereas artificial light would have patterns  coming off richly in population concentrations  sparsely elsewhere .     then forget it  eugenia   said pitt buoyantly .   there is no technological civilization .  it might make erythro less interesting in some ways  but you can t want us to face our equals  or  perhaps  our superiors .  we would have to leave and go elsewhere  and we have nowhere else to go  and perhaps an insufficient energy supply to get there if we did .  as it is  we can stay .     there s still copious oxygen in the atmosphere  so there s still certain to be life on erythro .  it s only a technological civilization that s lacking .  it means we ll have to go down and study its life forms .     why .     how can you ask  janus .  if we have another sample of life here  one that is altogether independent of the life developed on earth  what a bonanza it would be for our biologists .     i see .  you re talking about scientific curiosity .  well  the life forms won t go away  i suppose .  there will be time enough for that later .  first things first .     what can come ahead of a study of a totally new form of life .     eugenia  be reasonable .  we must establish ourselves here .  we must build other settlements .  we must create a large and well ordered society  one far more homogeneous  self understanding  and peaceful than ever existed in the solar system .     for that we ll need material supplies  which takes us down to erythro again  where we ll have to study the life forms      no  eugenia .  to land on erythro and to take off again in the face of its gravitational field would be too costly at the present moment .  the intensity of the gravitational fields of erythro and of megas  don t forget megas  is great enough  even out here in space .  one of our people calculated it for me .  we ll have a problem getting our supplies even from the asteroid belt  but it will be less of a problem than getting them from erythro .  in fact  if we station ourselves in the asteroid belt  matters would be even more price effective .  the asteroid belt will be where we build our settlements .     are you proposing to ignore erythro .     for a while  eugenia .  when we are strong  when our energy supply is much greater  when our society is stable and growing  time enough then to investigate erythro s life forms or  perhaps  its unusual chemistry .    pitt smiled soothingly  understandably  at insigna .  the side issue of erythro  he knew  had to be delayed as long as possible .  if it bore no technological society  then whatever other life forms and resources it had could wait .  the pursuing hordes from the solar system were the true enemy .   why couldn t others see what had to be done .  why were others so easily diverted into useless side paths .   how would he ever dare to die and leave the fools unprotected .       ten  persuasion       .     so now  twelve years after the discovery that no technological civilization existed on erythro  and twelve years during which no settlements from earth had suddenly appeared to ruin the new world that was gradually being constructed  pitt could appreciate these rare moments of rest .  and yet  even in these rare moments  doubts crept in .  he wondered whether rotor would not have been better off  if he had clung to that original resolve of his  if they had not remained in orbit about erythro  and if the dome on erythro had never been built .   he was leaning back in his soft chair  the restraining fields cushioning him  the aura of peace lulling him almost into sleep  when he heard the soft buzz that drew him back  reluctantly  into reality .   he opened his eyes  he had not realized they were closed  to look at the small view patch on the opposite wall .  a touch of a contact magnified it into holovision .   it was semyon akorat  of course .   there he was with his bald bullet head .   akorat shaved off the dark fringe that would otherwise show  feeling  quite rightly  that a few fugitive hairs would but make the desert in the center look the more pathetic  whereas a shapely skull  unmarred by interruption  could look almost stately .   there he was  also  with his worried eyes  which always looked worried even when there was no cause for worry .   pitt found him unpleasant  not because of any failure in loyalty or efficiency  he could not be improved on  either way  but simply because of conditioned response .  akorat always announced an invasion of pitt s privacy  an interruption of his thoughts  a necessity for doing what he would rather not do .  in short  akorat was in charge of pitt s appointments and said who could see him and who could not .   pitt frowned slightly .  he could not recall that he had an appointment  but he often forgot and relied on akorat not to .    who is it .   he said resignedly .   no one important  i hope .     no one at all of any real significance   said akorat   but perhaps you had better see her .     is she within earshot .     commissioner   said akorat reproachfully  as though he were being accused of dereliction of duty .   of course not .  she is on the other side of the screen .   he had an enormous precision of speech  which pitt found soothing .  there was never any question of mistaking his words .   pitt said   she .  i presume it dr .  insigna  then .  well  stick to my instructions .  not without an appointment .  i ve had enough of her for a while  akorat .  enough of her for the last twelve years  in fact .  make up an excuse .  say i m in meditation  no  she won t believe that  say      commissioner  it s not dr .  insigna .  i would not have disturbed you if it were .  it s  it s her daughter .     her daughter .   for a moment  he fumbled over her name .   you mean marlene fisher .     yes .  naturally  i told her you were busy  and she said that i ought to be ashamed of myself for telling a lie  for my expression showed it was a lie  up and down  and that my voice was too tense to be telling the truth .   he recited this with baritone indignation .   in any case  she won t leave .  she insists you will see her if you know she is waiting .  would you see her  commissioner .  those eyes of hers rattle me  frankly .     it seems to me i ve heard of her eyes  too .  well  send her in  send her in  and i ll try to survive her eyes .  come to think of it  she has some explaining to do .    she entered .   remarkably self possessed  pitt thought  though properly demure and with no sign of defiance .    she sat down  her hands loosely in her lap  and clearly waited for pitt to speak first .  he let her wait a little  while he considered her in a rather absent fashion .  he had seen her occasionally when she was younger  but not for a while  now .  she had not been a pretty child and she wasn t any prettier now .  she had broad cheekbones  and a certain gracelessness about her  but she did have remarkable eyes  and shapely eyebrows and long eyelashes  too .   pitt said   well  miss fisher  i m told you wanted to see me .  may i ask why .    marlene looked up at him  her eyes cool  and seemed entirely at ease .  she said   commissioner pitt  i think my mother must have told you that i told a friend of mine that the earth was going to be destroyed .    pitt s eyebrows hunched down over his own rather ordinary eyes .  he said   yes  she did .  and i hope she told you that you must not speak of such matters in so foolish a way again .     yes  she did  commissioner  but not speaking about it doesn t mean it isn t so  and calling it foolish doesn t make it so .     i am commissioner of rotor  miss fisher  and it is my function to concern myself with such matters  and therefore you must leave it entirely to me  whether it is so or not so  whether it is foolish or not foolish .  how did you get the idea that the earth was going to be destroyed .  is this something your mother told you .     not directly  commissioner .     but indirectly .  is that it .     she couldn t help that  commissioner .  everyone speaks in all sorts of ways .  there s the choice of words .  there s intonation  expression  the flicker of eyes and eyelids  little tricks of clearing the throat .  a hundred things .  do you know what i mean .     i know exactly what you mean .  i watch for those things myself .     and you feel very proud of that  commissioner .  you feel you re very good at it and that that s one of the reasons you re commissioner .    pitt looked startled .   i didn t say that  young woman .     not in words  commissioner .  you didn t have to .   her eyes were fixed on his .  there was no trace of a smile on her face  but her eyes seemed amused .    well then  miss fisher  is that what you came to tell me .     no  commissioner .  i came because my mother has found it difficult to see you recently .  no  she didn t tell me so .  i just gathered it .  i thought you might see me  instead .     all right  you re here .  now what is it you came to tell me .     my mother is unhappy about the chance that earth may be destroyed .  my father s there  you know .    pitt felt a small spasm of anger .  how could a purely personal matter be allowed to interfere with the welfare of rotor and all that it might become in the future .  this insigna  for all her usefulness in having found nemesis in the first place  had long been an albatross about his neck with her unfailing way of heading down every wrong path .  and now  when he would see her no more  she sent her mad daughter .   he said    are you under the impression that this destruction you speak of will happen tomorrow  or next year .     no  commissioner  i know that it will happen in just a little bit less than five thousand years .     if that is the case  your father will be long gone by then  as will your mother  and i  and you .  and when we re all gone  it will still be nearly five thousand years before destruction for earth and possibly other planets of the solar system  if that destruction happens at all  which it won t .     it s the idea of it  commissioner  whenever it happens .     your mother must have told you that long before the time comes  the people of the solar system will be aware of  of whatever you think will happen  and will deal with it .  besides  how can we complain of planetary destruction .  every world faces it eventually .  even if there are no cosmic collisions  every star must pass through a red giant stage and destroy its planets .  just as all human beings will die someday  so will all planets .  planetary lifetimes are a little longer  but that s all .  do you understand all that  young lady .     yes  i do   said marlene seriously .   i have a good relationship with my computer .     i ll bet she does  thought pitt  and then  too late  tried to wipe out the small sardonic smile that had twitched into existence on his face .  she had probably used it to understand his attitude .    he said with a note of finality   then we come to the end of our conversation .  the talk of destruction is foolish  and even if it weren t  it has nothing to do with you  and you must never speak of it again  or not only you  but your mother as well  will be in trouble .     we re not at the end of our conversation yet  commissioner .    pitt felt himself losing patience  but he said  quite calmly   my dear miss fisher  when your commissioner says it s the end  it is  regardless of what you think .    he half rose  but marlene sat where she was .   because i want to offer you something you would dearly like to have .     what .     the good riddance of my mother .    pitt sank back into his chair  truly puzzled .   what do you mean by that .     if you will listen to me  commissioner  i will tell you .  my mother can t live like this .  she s concerned about earth and the solar system and  and she thinks about my father sometimes .  she thinks that nemesis may be the nemesis of the solar system and since she gave it the name  she feels responsible .  she s an emotional person  commissioner .     yes .  you ve noticed that  have you .     and she bothers you .  she reminds you every once in a while about matters that she feels strongly about  and you don t want to hear about  and so you refuse to see her  and you wish she d go away .  you can send her away  commissioner .     indeed .  we ve got one other settlement .  shall i send her to new rotor .     no  commissioner .  send her to erythro .     erythro .  but why should i send her there .  just because i want to get rid of her .     that would be your reason .  yes  commissioner .  it would not be my reason  though .  i want her on erythro because she can t really work at the observatory .  the instruments always seem to be in use and she feels she s being watched all the time .  she feels your annoyance .  and besides  rotor isn t a good base for delicate measurements .  it turns too rapidly and too unevenly for good measurements .     you have it all at your fingertips .  did your mother explain this to you .  no  you don t have to tell me .  she didn t tell you directly  did she .  only indirectly .     yes  commissioner .  and there s my computer .     the one you have friendly relations with .     yes  commissioner .     and so you think she will be able to work better on erythro .     yes  commissioner .  it will be a stabler base  and she might make the kind of measurements that will convince her that the solar system will survive .  even if she finds out otherwise  it will take a long time for her to be sure of that and for that time  at least  you ll be rid of her .     i see that you want to be rid of her  too  is that it .     not at all  commissioner   said marlene with composure .   i would go with her .  you d be rid of me  too  which would please you even more than being rid of her .     what makes you think i want to get rid of you  too .    marlene fixed her gaze on him  somber  unblinking .   now you do  commissioner  since you now know that i have no trouble in interpreting your inner feelings .    suddenly  pitt found himself desperately wanting to get rid of this monster .  he said   let me think about this   and turned his head .  he felt that he was being childish in looking away  but he did not want this horrible youngster to read his face like the open book it was .   it was  after all  the truth .  he did now want to get rid of mother and daughter alike .  where the mother was concerned  he had indeed thought  on several occasions  of exiling her to erythro .  but since she would scarcely have wanted to go  there would have been a most unappetizing fuss and he had no stomach for that .  now  though  her daughter had given him a reason why she might indeed want to go to erythro  and that  of course  changed things .   he said slowly   if your mother really wants this      she really does  commissioner .  she hasn t mentioned it to me  and it may be she hasn t even thought of it yet  but she will want to go .  i know that .  trust me .     do i have a choice .  and do you want to go .     very much  commissioner .     then i will arrange for it at once .  does that satisfy you .     yes  it does  commissioner .     then shall we now consider the interview at an end .    marlene rose and ducked her head in a graceless bow  presumably one that was intended to be respectful .   thank you  commissioner .    she turned and left  and it wasn t till she had been gone for several minutes that pitt dared unclench the grip that had kept his face in place till it was aching .   he dared not have allowed her to deduce from anything he said or did or seemed  the final item that he  and only one other person  knew about erythro .       eleven  orbit       .     pitt s quiet time was over  but he did not wish it to be over .  quite arbitrarily  he canceled his afternoon appointments .  he wanted more thinking time .   specifically  he wanted to think about marlene .  her mother  eugenia insigna fisher  was a problem  and had  in fact  grown to be more of one over the last dozen years .  she was emotional and jumped far ahead of anything reason would allow .  yet she was a human being  she could be led and controlled  she could be pent up within the comfortable walls of logic  and though she might be restless at times  she could be made to remain there .   not so with this marlene .  pitt had no doubt that she was a monster  and he could only be grateful that she had foolishly revealed herself in order to help her mother on so trivial an occasion .  but then she was inexperienced and lacked the wisdom to have kept her abilities hidden until she could use them in a truly devastating fashion .   but she would only grow more dangerous as she grew older  so she would have to be stopped now .  and she would be stopped by that other monster  erythro .   pitt gave himself credit .  he had recognized erythro as a monster from the start .  it had its own expression to read  the reflection of the bloody light of its star  an expression that was ominous and menacing .   when they had reached the asteroid belt  a hundred million miles outside the orbit in which megas and erythro circled nemesis  pitt had said  with full confidence   this is the place .    he had expected no difficulty .  the rational view admitted nothing else .  among the asteroids  nemesis cast little heat and light .  the loss of natural heat and light was nothing  since rotor had fully functional micro fusion .  in fact  it was actually a benefit .  with its red light dimmed to almost nothing  it did not weigh down the heart  darken the mind  and shiver the soul .   then  too  a base in the asteroidal belt would place them in an area where the gravitational effects of nemesis and megas would be weak  and where maneuverability would  in consequence  be less energy expensive .  the asteroids would be more easily mined  and considering the feeble light of nemesis  there should be plenty of volatiles on those little bodies .   ideal .  and yet the people of rotor made it clear that  by an overwhelming majority  they wanted to move the settlement into orbit around erythro .  pitt labored to point out that they would be bathed in angrily depressing red light  that they would be held firmly in the grip of megas as well as erythro  and that they might still have to go to the asteroids for raw materials .   pitt discussed it angrily with tambor brossen  the ex commissioner  to whose post he had succeeded .  the rather weary brossen openly enjoyed his new role as elder statesman far more than he had ever enjoyed being commissioner .   he had been known to say that he lacked pitt s pleasure in making decisions .    brossen had laughed at pitt s concern over the matter of settlement location  not outright  to be sure  but gently  with his eyes .  he said   there s no need  janus  to feel that you must educate rotor into absolute agreement with you .  let the settlement have its own way once in a while  they will be all the readier to let you have your way at other times .  if they want to orbit erythro  let them orbit erythro .     but it makes no sense  tambor .  don t you understand that .     of course i understand that .  i also understand that rotor has been in orbit around a sizable world all its existence .  that s what seems right to rotorians and that s what they want to have again .     we were in orbit about earth .  erythro is not earth  it is nothing like earth .     it is a world and is about the same size as earth .  it has land and sea .  it has an atmosphere with oxygen in it .  we could travel thousands of light years before finding a world this much like earth .  i tell you again .  let the people have it .    pitt had followed brossen s advice  though something within him muttered dissension every step of the way .  new rotor was also in orbit around erythro and so were the two others in process of construction .  of course  settlements in the asteroid belt were on the drawing boards  but the public clearly lacked eagerness to put them through .   of all that had happened since the discovery of nemesis  it was this orbiting of erythro that pitt considered rotor s greatest mistake .  it should not have happened .  and yet  and yet  could even he have forced it on rotor .  might he have tried harder .  and would that merely have led to a new election and his displacement .   it was nostalgia that was the great problem .  people tended to look back and pitt could not always make them turn their head and look forward .  consider brossen  he had died seven years ago and pitt had been at his deathbed .  pitt alone had happened to catch the old man s dying words .  brossen had beckoned to pitt  who had leaned close to him .  brossen had reached out a feeble hand  the skin dry as paper .  clutching feebly at pitt  he had whispered   how bright the sun of earth was   and had died .   so because rotorians could not forget how bright the sun had once been  and how green the earth had once been  they cried out in exasperation against pitt s logic and demanded that rotor orbit a world that was not green  and that circled a sun that was not bright .   it meant the loss of ten years in the rate of progress .  they would have been ten years farther ahead had they been located in the asteroid belt from the start .  pitt was convinced of that .   that alone was enough to poison pitt s feelings toward erythro  but there was  in connection with it  matters that were worse  much worse .       twelve  anger       .     as it happened  crile fisher  having given earth its first hint that there was something peculiar about rotor s destination  gave it its second hint as well .   he had been back on earth two years now  with rotor growing dimmer in his mind .  eugenia insigna was a rather perplexing memory  what had he felt for her .    but marlene remained a bitterness .  he found he could not separate her from roseanne in his mind .  the one year old daughter he remembered and the seventeen year old sister he also remembered fused into one personality .   life was not hard .  he drew a generous pension .  they had even found work for him to do  an easy administrative position in which he was required to make decisions on occasion that were guaranteed to affect nothing of importance .  they had forgiven him  at least in part  he thought  because he had remembered that one remark of eugenia s   if you knew where we were going     yet he had the impression that he was kept under watch  anyway  and he had grown to resent it .   garand wyler appeared now and then  always friendly  always inquisitive  always returning the subject to rotor in one way or another .  he had  in fact  made his appearance now  and the subject of rotor came up  as fisher expected it would .   fisher scowled  and said   it s been nearly two years .  what do you people want of me .    wyler shook his head .   i can t say i know  crile .  all we have is that remark of your wife s .  it s obviously not enough .  she must have said something else in the years you spent with her .  consider the conversations you have had  the talk that bounced back and forth between the two of you .  is there nothing there .     this is the fifth time you ve asked that  garand .  i have been questioned .  i have been hypnotized .  i have been mind probed .  i have been squeezed dry  and there is nothing in me .  let me go and find something else to tackle .  or put me back to work .  there are a hundred settlements out there  with friends confiding in each other and enemies spying on each other .  who knows what one of them may know   and may not even know that he knows .    wyler said   to be truthful  old man  we ve been moving in that direction  and we ve also been concentrating on the far probe .  it stands to reason that rotor must have found something the rest of us don t know .  we ve never sent out a far probe .  neither has any other settlement .  only rotor had the capacity for it .  whatever rotor found must be in the far probe data .     good .  look through that data .  there must be enough there to keep you busy for years .  as for me  leave me alone .  all of you .    wyler said    as a matter of fact  there is enough there to keep us busy for years .  rotor supplied a great deal of data in line with the open science agreement .  in particular  we have their stellar photography at every range of wavelength .  the far probe cameras were able to reach almost every part of the sky  and we ve been studying it in detail and have found nothing in it of interest .     nothing .     so far  nothing  but  as you say  we can continue to study it for years .  of course  we already have any number of items the astronomy people are delighted with .  it keeps them happy and busy  but not a single item  not the sniff of one seems to help us decide where they went .  not so far .  i gather that there is absolutely nothing  for instance  to lead us to think that there are planets orbiting either large star of the alpha centauri system .  nor are there are any unexpected sun like stars we don t know about in our neighborhood .  personally  i wouldn t expect to find much anyway .  what could the far probe see that we couldn t see from the solar system .  it was only a couple of light months away .  it should make no difference .  yet some of us feel that rotor must have seen something and rather quickly  too .  which brings us back to you .     why me .     because your ex wife was the head of the far probe project .     not really .  she became chief astronomer after the data had been collected .     she was the head afterward and certainly an important part during .  did she never say anything to you about what they had found in the far probe .     not a word .  wait  did you say that the far probe cameras were able to reach almost every part of the sky .     yes .     how much is  almost every part .       i m not in their confidence to the point where i can give you exact figures .  i gather it s at least    percent .     or more .     maybe more .     i wonder          what do you wonder .     on rotor  we had a fellow named pitt running things .     we know that .     but i think i know how he would do things .  he would hand out the far probe data a little at a time  living up to the open science agreement  but just barely .  and somehow  by the time rotor left  there would have been some of the data     percent or less  that he would not have had time to get to you .  and that would be the important    percent or less .     you mean the part that tells us where rotor went .     maybe .     only we haven t got it .     sure  you have it .     how do you make that out .     just a little while ago you wondered why you should expect to see anything in the far probe photographs that you couldn t see in the solar system records .  so why are you wasting your time on what they gave you .  map out the part of the sky they didn t give you and study that part on your own maps .  ask yourself if there s anything there that might look different on a far probe map  and why .  that s what i would do .   his voice suddenly rose to a formidable shout .   you go back there .  tell them to look at the part of the sky they don t have .    wyler said thoughtfully   topsy turvy .     no  it isn t .  perfectly straightforward .  just find someone in the office who does more with his brain than sit on it  and you may get somewhere .    wyler said   we ll see .   he held out his hand to fisher .  fisher scowled and wouldn t take it .   it was months before wyler made an appearance again  and fisher didn t welcome him .  he had been in a quiet mood on this off day from work  and had even been reading a book .   fisher was not one of those people who felt that a book was a twentieth century abomination  that only viewing was civilized .  there was something  he thought  about holding a book  about the physical turning of pages  about the ability to lose one s self in thought over what one has read  or even to drowse off  without coming to  and finding the film a hundred pages beyond  or flickering at its close .  fisher was rather of the opinion that the book was the more civilized of the two modes .   he was all the more annoyed at being roused out of his pleasant lethargy .    now  what  garand .   he said ungraciously .   wyler did not lose his urbane smile .  he said  between his teeth   we ve found it  just exactly as you said we would .     found what .   said fisher  not remembering .  then  realizing what this must refer to  he said hastily   don t tell me anything i m not supposed to know .  i won t be tangled with the office anymore .     too late  crile .  you re wanted .  tanayama himself wants you in front of him .     when .     as soon as i can get you there .     in that case  tell me what s going on .  i don t want to face him cold .     that s what i intend to do .  we studied every portion of the sky that the far probe did not report on .  apparently those who did so asked themselves  as you advised  what it was that a far probe camera could see that a solar system camera could not .  the obvious answer was a displacement of the nearer stars  and once that was in their heads  the astronomers found an astonishing thing  something they couldn t have predicted .     well .     they found a very dim star with a parallax of well over one second of arc .     i m not an astronomer .  is that unusual .     it means that the star is at only half the distance of alpha centauri .     you said  very dim .       it s behind a small dust cloud  they tell me .  listen  if you re not an astronomer  your wife on rotor was .  perhaps she discovered it .  did she ever say anything to you about it .    fisher shook his head .   not a word .  of course      yes .     in the last few months  there was an excitement about her .  a kind of brimming over .     you didn t ask why .     i assumed it was the imminent departure of rotor .  she was excited about going and that drove me mad .     on account of your daughter .   fisher nodded .    the excitement may have been over the new star  too .  it all fits .  naturally  they d go to this new star .  and if your wife had discovered it  they would be going to her star .  that would account for some of her eagerness to go .  doesn t it make sense .     maybe .  i can t say it doesn t .     all right  then .  that s what tanayama wants to see you about .  and he s angry .  not at you  apparently  but he s angry .         .     it was later that same day  for there was no delay on this occasion  that crile fisher found himself in the office of the terrestrial board of inquiry  or  as it was far better known to its employees  simply the office .   kattimoro tanayama  who had directed the office for over thirty years  was getting quite elderly .  the holographs shown of him  there weren t many  had been recorded years before  when his hair was still smooth and black  his body straight  his expression vigorous .   now his hair was gray  his body  never tall  was slightly bent  and possessed an air of frailty .  he might  thought fisher  be reaching the point where he was considering retiring  if it were conceivable that he intended to do anything but die in harness .  his eyes  fisher noted  were  between their narrowed lids  as keen and as sharp as ever .   fisher had a little trouble understanding him .  english was as nearly universal a language on earth as it was possible for a language to be  but it had its varieties  and tanayama s was not the north american variety fisher was accustomed to .   tanayama said coldly   well  fisher  you failed us on rotor .   fisher saw no point in arguing the matter  and no point in arguing with tanayama  in any case .    yes  director   he said tonelessly .     yet you may still have information for us .    fisher sighed silently  then said   i have been debriefed over and over .     so i have been told  and so i know .  you have not been asked everything  however  and i have a question to which i  i  want an answer .     yes  director .      in your stay on rotor  have you been aware of anything that would lead you to believe that the rotorian leadership hated earth .    fisher s eyebrows climbed .   hate .  it was clear to me that the people on rotor  as on all settlements  i think  looked down on earth  despised it as decadent  brutal  and violent .  but hatred .  i don t think they thought enough of us  frankly  to feel hatred .      i talk of the leadership  not of the multitude .     so do i  director .  no hatred .     there s no other way of accounting for it .       accounting for what  director .  if that is a question i may ask .   tanayama looked up at him sharply  the force of his personality made one rarely aware of just how short he was  .   do you know that this new star is moving in our direction .  quite in our direction .    fisher  startled  looked quickly toward wyler  but wyler sat in comparative shadow  well out of range of the sunlight from the window  and was not  in appearance  looking at anything .   tanayama  who was standing  said   well  sit down  fisher  if it will help you think .  i will sit down  too .   he sat down on the edge of his desk  his short legs dangling .    did you know about the motion of the star .     no  director .  i didn t know of the existence of the star at all till agent wyler told me .     you didn t .  surely it was known on rotor .     if so  no one told me .     your wife was excited and happy in the last period before rotor left .  so you told agent wyler .  what was the reason .     agent wyler had thought it might be because she had discovered the star .     and perhaps she knew of the star s motion and was pleased at the thought of what would happen to us .     i can t see why that thought should make her happy  director .  i must tell you that i do not actually know that she knew of the star s motion or even that it existed .  i do not  of my own knowledge  know that anyone on rotor knew that the star existed .    tanayama looked at him thoughtfully  rubbing one side of his chin lightly  as though relieving a slight itch .   he said   the people on rotor were all euros  i believe  weren t they .    fisher s eyes widened .  he hadn t heard that vulgarism in a long time  never from a government functionary .  he remembered wyler s comment soon after he had returned to earth about rotor being  snow white .   he had dismissed it as a piece of lighthearted sarcasm  and had given no heed to it .   he said resentfully   i don t know  director .  i didn t study them all .  i don t know what their ancestries may be .     come  fisher .  you don t have to study them .  judge by their appearances .  in all your stay on rotor  did you encounter one face that was afro  or mongo  or hindo .  did you encounter a dark complexion .  an epicanthic fold .    fisher exploded .   director  you re being twentieth century .    if he had known a stronger way of putting it  he would have .    i don t give these things thought  and no one on earth should .  i m surprised you do  and i don t think it would help your position if it were known that you do .     don t indulge in fairy tales  agent fisher   said the director  moving one gnarled finger from side to side in admonition .   i am talking about what is .  i know that on earth we ignore all variation among ourselves  at least outwardly .     just outwardly .   said fisher in indignation .    just outwardly   said tanayama coldly .   when earth s people go out to the settlements  they sort themselves out by variation .  why should they do that  if they ignored all variation .  on any settlement  all are alike  or  if there is some admixture to begin with  those who are well outnumbered feel ill at ease  or are made to feel ill at ease  and shift to another settlement where they are not outnumbered .  isn t that so .    fisher found he could not deny this .  it was so  and he had somehow taken it for granted without questioning it .  he said   human nature .  like clings to like .  it set up a  neighborhood .     human nature  of course .  like clings to like  because like hates and despises unlike .     there are m mongo settlements  too .   fisher stumbled over the word  and realized full well that he might be mortally offending the director  an easy and dangerous man to offend .   tanayama did not blink .   i know that well  but it s the euros who most recently dominated the planet  and they cannot forget it  can they .     the others  perhaps  cannot forget that either  and they have more cause to hate .     but it s rotor that went flying off to escape from the solar system .     it happened to be they who had discovered hyper assistance .     and they went to a nearby star that only they knew of  one which is heading toward our solar system and may pass closely enough to disrupt it .     we don t know they know that  or that they even know the star .     of course they know it   said tanayama with what was almost a snarl .   and they left without warning us .     director  with respect  this is illogical .  if they are going to establish themselves on a star that will  on its approach  disrupt our solar system  the star s own system will also be disrupted .     they can easily escape  even if they build more settlements .  we have an entire world of eight billion people to evacuate  a much more difficult task .     how much time do we have .    tanayama shrugged .  .  .  several thousand years  they tell me .     that s a great deal of time .  it might not have occurred to them  just conceivably  that it was necessary to warn us .  as the star approaches  it will surely be discovered without warning .     and by that time  we will have less time to evacuate .  their discovery of the star was accidental .  we would not have discovered it for a long time  but for your wife s indiscreet remark to you  and but for your suggestion  a good one  that we look closely at the part of the sky that had been omitted .  rotor was counting on our discovery being as belated as possible .     but  director  why should they want such a thing .  sheer motiveless hate .     not motiveless .  so that the solar system  with its heavy load of non euros  might be destroyed .  so that humanity can make a new start on a homogenous basis of euros only .  eh .  what do you think of that .    fisher shook his head helplessly .   impossible .  unthinkable .     why else should they have failed to warn us .     might it not be that they did not themselves know of the star s motion .     impossible   said tanayama ironically .   unthinkable .  there is no other reason for what they have done but their willingness to see us destroyed .  but we will discover hyperspatial travel for ourselves  and we will move out to this new star and find them .  and we will even the score .        thirteen  dome       .     eugenia insigna greeted her daughter s statement with a half laugh of disbelief .  how does one go about doubting a young daughter s sanity as an alternative to doubting one s own hearing capacity .    what did you say  marlene .  what do you mean i m going to erythro .     i asked commissioner pitt  and he said he would arrange it .   insigna looked blank .   but why .    betraying a bit of irritation  marlene answered   because you say you want to make delicate astronomical measurements and you can t do it delicately enough from rotor .  you can do it from erythro .  but i see i m not answering your real question .     you re right .  what i meant was why should commissioner pitt have said he would arrange it .  i ve asked several times before this  and he has always refused .  he s unwilling to let anyone go to erythro   except for some specialists .     i just put it to him in a different way  mother .   marlene hesitated a moment .   i told him that i knew he was anxious to get rid of you and this was his chance .    insigna drew in her breath so sharply that she choked slightly and had to cough .  then  eyes watering  she said   how could you say that .     because it s true  mother .  i wouldn t have said it if it weren t true .  i ve heard him speak to you  and i ve heard you speak about him  and it s just so clear that i know you see it  too .  he s annoyed with you  and wishes you d stop bothering him about  about whatever you bother him about .  you know that .    insigna pressed her lips together and said   you know  darling  i m going to have to take you into my confidence from now on .  it really embarrasses me to have you worm these things out .     i know  mother .   marlene s eyes dropped .   i m sorry .     but i still don t understand .  you didn t have to explain to him that he s annoyed with me .  he must know he is .  why  then  didn t he send me to erythro when i asked him to do so in the past .     because he hates having anything to do with erythro  and just getting rid of you wasn t enough to overcome his dislike of the world .  only this time it s not just you going .  it s you and i .  both of us .    insigna leaned forward  placing her hands flat on the table between them .   no  molly marlene .  erythro is not the place for you .  i won t be there forever .  i ii take my measurements and come back and you ll stay right here and wait for me .     i m afraid not  mother .  it s clear that he s only willing to let you go because that s the only way we can get rid of me .  that s why he agreed to send you when i asked that we both go  and wouldn t agree when you asked that just you go .  do you see .    insigna frowned .   no  i don t .  i really don t .  what do you have to do with it .     when we were talking  and i explained that i knew he would like to get rid of both of us  his face froze  you know  so he could wipe out all expression .  he knew i could understand expressions and little things like that  and he didn t want me to guess what he was feeling  i suppose .  but that s also a giveaway  you see  and tells me a lot .  besides  you can t suppress everything .  your eyes flicker  and i guess you don t even know it .     so you knew he wanted to get rid of you  too .     worse than that .  he s scared of me .     why should he be scared of you .     i suppose because he hates having me know what he doesn t want me to know .   she added with a dour sigh   lots of people get upset with me for that .    insigna nodded .   i can understand that .  you make people feel naked  mentally naked  i mean  like a cold wind is blowing across their minds .    her eyes focused on her daughter .   sometimes i feel that way myself .  looking back  i think you ve disturbed me since you were a small child .  i told myself often enough that you were simply unusually intelli      i think i am   said marlene quickly .    that  too  yes  but it was clearly something more than that  though i didn t see it very clearly .  tell me  do you mind talking about this .     not to you  mother   said marlene  but there was a note of caution in her voice .    well then  when you were younger and found out that you could do this and other children couldn t  and even other grown ups couldn t  why didn t you come and tell me about it .     i tried once  actually  but you were impatient .  i mean  you didn t say anything  but i could tell you were busy and couldn t be bothered with childish nonsense .    insigna s eyes widened .   did i say it was childish nonsense .     you didn t say it  but the way you looked at me and the way you were holding your hands said it .     you should have insisted on telling me .     i was just a little kid .  and you were unhappy most of the timeabout commissioner pitt  and about father .     never mind about that .  is there anything else you can tell me now .     there s only one thing   said marlene .   when commissioner pitt said we could go  there was something about the way he said it that made me think he left out something  that there was something he didn t say .     and what was it  marlene .     that s just it  mother .  i can t read minds  so i don t know .  i can only go by outside things and that leaves things hazy  sometimes .  still      yes .     i have the feeling that whatever it was he didn t say was rather unpleasant  maybe even evil .         .     getting ready for erythro took insigna quite a while  of course .  there were matters on rotor that could not be left at midpoint .  there had to be arrangements in the astronomy department  instructions to others  appointment of her chief associate to the position of chief astronomer pro tem  and some final consultations with pitt  who was oddly noncommunicative on the matter .   insigna finally put it to him during her last report before leaving .   i m going to erythro tomorrow  you know   she said .    pardon me .   he looked up from the final report she had handed him  and which he had been staring at  though she was convinced he wasn t reading it .   was she picking up some of marlene s tricks and not knowing how to handle it .  she mustn t begin to believe that she was penetrating below the surface when  in fact  she was not .    she said patiently   i m going to erythro tomorrow  you know .     is it tomorrow .  well  you ll be coming back eventually  so this is not good bye .  take care of yourself .  look upon it as a vacation .     i intend to be working on nemesis  motion through space .     that .  well    he made a gesture with both hands as though pushing something unimportant away .   as you wish .  a change of surroundings is a vacation even if you continue working .     i want to thank you for allowing this  janus .     your daughter asked me to .  did you know she asked me to .     i know .  she told me the same day .  i told her she had no right to bother you .  you were very tolerant of her .    pitt grunted .   she s a very unusual girl .  i didn t mind obliging her .  it s only temporary .  finish your calculations and return .    she thought  that s twice he mentioned my return .  what would marlene make out of that if she were here .  something evil  as she says .  but what .   she said evenly   we ll come back .    he said   with the news  i hope  that nemesis will prove harmless   five thousand years from now .     that s for the facts to decide   she said grimly  then left .        .     it was strange  eugenia insigna thought .  she was over two light years from the spot in space where she was born and yet she had only been on a spaceship twice and then for the shortest possible journeys  from rotor to earth and then back to rotor again .   she still had no great urge to travel in space .  it was marlene who was the driving force behind this trip .  it was she who  independently  had seen pitt and persuaded him to succumb to her strange form of blackmail .  and it was she who was truly excited  with this odd compulsion of hers to visit erythro .  insigna could not understand that compulsion and viewed it as another part of her daughter s unique mental and emotional complexity .  still  whenever insigna quailed at the thought of leaving safe  small  comfortable rotor for the vast empty world of erythro  so strange and menacing  and fully six hundred and fifty thousand kilometers away  nearly twice as far away as rotor had been from earth   it was marlene s excitement that reinvigorated her .   the ship that would take them to erythro was neither graceful nor beautiful .  it was serviceable .  it was one of a small fleet of rockets that acted as ferries  blasting up from the stodgy gravitational pull of erythro  or coming down without daring to give in to it by even a trifle  and  either way  working one s way through the cushiony  windy  unpredictability of an untamed atmosphere .   insigna didn t think the trip would be pleasurable .  through most of it they would be weightless and two solid days of weightlessness would  no doubt  be tedious .   marlene s voice broke into her reverie .   come on  mother  they re waiting for us .  the baggage is all checked and everything .    insigna moved forward .  her last uneasy thought as she passed through the airlock was  predictably  but why was janus pitt so willing to let us go .        .     siever genarr ruled a world as large as earth .  or  to be more accurate perhaps  he ruled  directly  a domed region that covered nearly three square kilometers and was slowly growing .  the rest of the world  however  nearly five hundred million square kilometers of land and sea  was unoccupied by human beings .  it was also occupied by no other living things above the microscopic scale .  so if a world is considered as being ruled by the multicellular life forms that occupied it  the hundreds who lived and worked in the domed region were the rulers  and siever genarr ruled over them .   genarr was not a large man  but his strong features gave him an impressive look .  when he was young  this had made him look older than his age  but that had evened itself out now that he was nearly fifty .  his nose was long and his eyes somewhat pouchy .  his hair was in the first stages of grizzle .  his voice  however  was a musical and resonant baritone .   he had once thought of the stage as a career  but his appearance doomed him to occasional character roles  and his talents as an administrator took precedence .    it was those talents  partly  that had kept him in the erythro dome for ten years  watching it grow from an uncertain three room structure to the expansive mining and research station it had now become .   the dome had its disadvantages .  few people remained long .  there were shifts  since almost all those who came there considered themselves in exile and wished  more or less constantly  to return to rotor .  and most found the pinkish light of nemesis either threatening or gloomy  even though the light inside the dome was every bit as bright and homelike as that on rotor .   it had its advantages  too .  genarr was removed from the hurly burly of rotorian politics  which seemed more ingrown and meaningless each year .  even more important  he was removed from janus pitt  whose views he generally  and uselessly  opposed .   pitt had been strenuously opposed to any settlement on erythro from the start  even to rotor orbiting around erythro .  here  at least  pitt had been defeated by overwhelming public opinion  but he saw to it that the dome was generally starved for funds and that its growth was slowed .  if genarr had not successfully developed the dome as a source of water for rotor  far cheaper than it could be obtained from the asteroids  pitt might have crushed it .   in general  though  pitt s principle of ignoring the dome s existence as far as possible meant that he rarely attempted to interfere with genarr s administrative procedures  which suited genarr right down to erythro s damp soil .   it came as a surprise to him  then  that pitt should have bothered to inform him personally of the arrival of a pair of newcomers  instead of allowing the information to show up in the routine paperwork .  pitt had  indeed  discussed the matter in detail  in his usual clipped and arbitrary manner that invited no discussion  or even comment  and the conversation had been shielded  too .   it came as an even greater surprise that one of the people coming to erythro was eugenia insigna .   once  years before the leaving  they had been friends  but then  after their happy college days  genarr remembered them wistfully as rather romantic   eugenia had gone to earth for her graduate studies and had returned to rotor with an earthman .  genarr had scarcely seen her  except once or twice  at a distance  since she had married crile fisher .  and when she and fisher had separated  just before the leaving  genarr had had work of his own and so had she  and it never occurred to either to renew old ties .   genarr had  perhaps  thought of it occasionally  but eugenia was quite apparently sunk in sorrow  with an infant daughter to raise  and he was reluctant to intrude .  then he was sent to erythro and that ended even the possibility of renewal .  he had periodic vacation time on rotor  but he was never at ease there any longer .  some old rotorian friendships remained  but only in lukewarm fashion .   now eugenia was coming with her daughter .  genarr  at the moment  didn t remember the girl s name  if he had ever known it .  certainly  he had never seen her .  the daughter should be fifteen by now  and he wondered  with a queer little interior tremble  if she was beginning to look anything like the young eugenia had .   genarr looked out his office window with an almost surreptitious air .  he had grown so used to erythro dome that he no longer saw it with a critical eye .  it was the home of working people of both sexes  adults  no children .  shift workers  signed up for a period of weeks or possibly months  sometimes returning eventually for another shift  sometimes not .  except for himself and four others who  for one reason or another  had learned to prefer the dome  there were no permanents .   there was no one to take pride in it as an ordinary abode .  it was kept clean and orderly as a matter of necessity  but there was also an air of artificiality about it .  it was too much a matter of lines and arcs  planes and circles .  it lacked irregularity  lacked the chaos of permanent life  where a room  or even just a desk  had adjusted itself to the hollows and waverings of a particular personality .   there was himself  of course .  his desk and his room reflected his own angular and planar person .  that  perhaps  might be another reason he was at home in the erythro dome .  the shape of his inner spirit matched its spare geometry .   but what would eugenia insigna think of it .   he was rather pleased she had resumed her maiden name .   if she were as he remembered her  she would revel in irregularity  in the unexpected touch of frippery  for all she was an astronomer .   or had she changed .  did people ever change  essentially .  had crile fisher s desertion embittered her  twisted her  genarr scratched the hair at his temple where it had gone distinctly gray and thought that these speculations were useless and time wasting .  he would see eugenia soon enough  for he had left word that she was to be brought to him as soon as she had arrived .   or should he have gone to greet her in person .  no .  he had argued that with himself half a dozen times already .  he couldn t look too anxious  it wouldn t suit the dignity of his position .   but then genarr thought that that wasn t the reason at all .  he didn t want to make her uneasy  he didn t want her to think he was still the same uncomfortable and incompetent admirer who had retreated in so shambling a manner before the tall and brooding good looks of the earthman .  and eugenia had never looked at him again after she had seen crile  never seriously looked at him .   genarr s eyes scanned the message from janus pitt  dry  condensed  as his messages always were  and with that indefinable feel of authority behind it  as though the possibility of disagreement were not merely unheard of  but actually unthought of .   and he now noted that pitt spoke more forcefully of the young daughter than of the mother .  there was especially pitt s statement that the daughter had expressed a deep interest in erythro  and if she wished to explore its surface  she was to be allowed to .   now why was that .        .     and there she was .  fourteen years older than at the time of the leaving .  twenty years older than she was in her pre crile youth  the day they had gone into farming area c and climbed the levels into low gravity  and she had laughed when he tried a low somersault and had turned too far and had come down on his belly .   actually  he could easily have hurt himself  for though the sensation of weight decreased  mass and inertia did not  and damage could follow .  fortunately  he had not suffered that humiliation .   eugenia looked older  too  but she had not thickened very much  and her hair  shorter now  and straight  was more matter of fact somehow  but was still a lively dark brown .   and when she advanced toward him  smiling  he could feel his traitor heart speed a bit .  she held out both hands and he took them .    siever   she said   i have betrayed you  and i m so ashamed .     betrayed me  eugenia .  what are you talking about .   what was she talking about .  surely not her marriage to crile .   she said   i should have thought of you every day .  i should have sent you messages  given you the news  insisted on coming to visit you .     instead  you never thought of me at all .     oh  i m not that bad .  i thought of you every once in a while .  i never really forgot you .  don t think that for a moment .  it s just that my thoughts never really prompted me to do anything .    genarr nodded .  what was there to say .  he said   i know you ve been busy .  and i ve been here  out of sight and  therefore  out of mind .     not out of mind .  you ve scarcely changed at all  siever .     that s the advantage of looking old and craggy when you re twenty .  after that  you never change  eugenia .  time passes and you just look a trifle older and a trifle craggier .  not enough to matter .     come now  you make a profession of being cruel to yourself so that soft hearted women will leap to your defense .  that hasn t changed at all .     where s your daughter  eugenia .  i was told she would be coming with you .     she came .  you can be sure of that .  erythro is her idea of paradise  for no reason i can possibly think of .  she went to our quarters to straighten them out and unpack for the two of us .  she s that kind of young woman .  serious .  responsible .  practical .  dutiful .  she possesses what someone once described to me as all the unlovable virtues .    genarr laughed .   i m quite at home with them .  if you only knew how hard i ve tried  in my time  to cultivate at least one charming vice .  i ve always failed .     oh well  as one grows older  i suspect one needs more unlovable virtues and fewer charming vices .  but why did you retreat permanently to erythro  siever .  i understand that erythro dome has to be administered  but surely you re not the only one on rotor who can do the job .    genarr said    actually  i like to think i am .  in a way  though  i enjoy it here and i do get to rotor on occasion for a short vacation .     and never come to see me .     just because i have a vacation doesn t mean you do .  i suspect you re far busier than i am  and have been ever since you discovered nemesis .  but i m disappointed .  i wanted to meet your daughter .     you will .  her name s marlene .  actually  it s molly in my heart  but she won t allow that .  at the age of fifteen  she has become remarkably intolerant and insists on being called marlene .  but you ll meet her  never fear .  actually  i didn t want her here the first time .  how could we reminisce freely with her present .     do you want to reminisce  eugenia .     about some things .    genarr hesitated .   i m sorry crile didn t join the leaving .   insigna s smile became fixed .    about some things  siever .   she turned away and walked to the window  staring out .   this is an elaborate place you have here  by the way .  just the little i ve seen of it is impressive .  bright lights .  actual streets .  sizable buildings .  and yet the dome is hardly ever spoken of or referred to back on rotor .  how many people live and work here .     it varies .  we have our slow and busy times .  we ve had as many as nearly nine hundred people here .  at the moment  the number is five hundred and sixteen .  we know every individual present .  it s not easy .  each day sees some come  some go .     except you .     and a few others .     but why the dome  siever .  after all  erythro s atmosphere is breathable .    genarr pushed out his lower lip and  for the first time  he did not meet her eyes .   breathable  but not really comfortable .  the light level is wrong  when you get outside the dome  you re bathed in a pinkish light  tending to orange when nemesis is high in the sky .  it s bright enough .  you can read .  still  it doesn t seem natural .  then  too  nemesis itself doesn t look natural .  it looks too large  and most people think it looks threatening and that its reddish light makes it seem angry  and they get depressed .  nemesis is dangerous in actual fact  too  at least in a way .  because it isn t blindingly bright  there is a tendency to gaze at it and watch for sunspots .  the infrared can easily harm the retina .  people who must go out in the open wear a special helmet for that reason  among other things .     then the dome is more of a device to keep normal light in  so to speak  rather than to keep anything out .     we don t even keep air out .  the air and water that circulates in the dome is drawn from erythro s planetary supply .  naturally  though  we re careful to keep something out   said genarr .   we keep out the prokaryotes .  you know  the little blue green cells .    insigna nodded thoughtfully .  that had turned out to be the explanation for the oxygen content in the air .  there was life on erythro  even all pervasive life  but it was microscopic in nature  only equivalent to the simplest forms of cellular life in the solar system .   she said    are they really prokaryotes .  i know that s what they re called  but that s what our bacteria are also called .  are they bacteria .     if they re equivalent to anything in the history of solar system life  it is to the cyanobacteria  those that photosynthesize .  you re right to ask the question  though .  no  they re not our cyanobacteria .  they possess nucleoprotein  but with a structure fundamentally different from that which prevails in our form of life .  they also have a kind of chlorophyll that lacks magnesium and works on infrared so that the cells tend to be colorless rather than green .  different enzymes  trace minerals in different proportions .  still  they resemble earth cells sufficiently in outer appearance to be called prokaryotes .  i understand that biologists are pushing for the word  erythryotes  but for nonbiologists like ourselves  prokaryotes is good enough .     and they re efficient enough in their workings to account for the oxygen in erythro s atmosphere .     absolutely .  nothing else could possibly explain its existence there .  by the way  eugenia  you re the astronomer  so what s the latest thinking on how old nemesis might be .    insigna shrugged .   red dwarfs are next to being immortal .  nemesis can be as old as the universe and still go on for another hundred billion years or so without visible change .  the best we can do is judge by the contents of the minor elements making up its structure .  supposing that it s a first generation star and didn t begin with anything beyond hydrogen and helium  it is a bit over ten billion years old  a little more than twice the age of the sun of the solar system .     then erythro is ten billion years old  too .     absolutely .  a stellar system is formed all at once and not piecemeal .  why are you asking .     it just strikes me as odd that in ten billion years  life hasn t got past the prokaryote stage .     i don t think that s surprising  siever .  on earth  for somewhere between two and three billion years after life first appeared  it remained strictly prokaryote  and here on erythro the energy concentration in sunlight is far less than it is on earth .  it takes energy to form more complicated life forms .  this sort of thing has been pretty well discussed among the rotorians .     i m sure of it   said genarr   but it doesn t seem to reach us here at the dome .  our minds are too fixed  i suppose  on our local duties and problems  though you d think anything to do with the prokaryotes would come under that heading .     for that matter   said insigna   we don t hear much about the dome on rotor .     yes  things tend to compartmentalize .  but then  of course  there s nothing glamorous about the dome  eugenia .  it s just a workshop  so i m not surprised it gets lost in the press of events on rotor .  it s the new settlements that are being built that get all the attention .  are you going to move to one of them .     never .  i m a rotorian  and i intend to stay one .  i wouldn t even be here  if you ll pardon my saying so  if it weren t an astronomical necessity .  i ve got to make a number of observations from a base that is more stable than rotor .     so i have been informed by pitt .  i am instructed to give you my full cooperation .     good .  i m sure you will .  incidentally  you mentioned earlier that the dome would like to keep the prokaryotes out .  do you succeed in doing so .  is the water here safe to drink .    genarr said   obviously  since we drink it .  there are no prokaryotes in the dome .  any water that comes in  anything at all that comes in  is bathed in blue violet light that destroys the prokaryotes in a matter of seconds .  the short wave photons in the light are too energetic for the little things and break down key components of the cells .  and even if some of them come in  they re not poisonous  as far as we can tell  or harmful in any way .  we ve tested them on animals .     that s a relief .     it works the other way  too .  our own microorganisms can t compete with erythro s prokaryotes under erythrotic conditions .  at least when we seed erythro s soil with our own bacteria  they don t succeed in growing and multiplying .     what about multicellular plants .     we ve tried it  but with very poor results .  and it must be due to the quality of nemesis  light because we can grow plants perfectly well inside the dome  using erythro s soil and water .  we report these things back to rotor  of course  but i doubt that the information gets widely publicized .  as i said  rotor isn t interested in the dome .  certainly the fearsome pitt isn t interested in us  and he s really all that counts on rotor  isn t he .    genarr said that with a smile  but the smile seemed strained .   what would marlene have said about it .  insigna wondered .    she said   pitt isn t fearsome .  he s sometimes tiresome  but that s a different thing .  you know  siever  i always thought when we were young that you might be commissioner someday .  you were enormously bright  you know .     were .     still are  i m sure  but in those days you were so politically oriented  had such ideas .  i used to listen to you  entranced .  in some ways  you would have been a better commissioner than janus is .  you would have listened to people .  you wouldn t have insisted on getting your own way as much .     which is precisely why i would have made a very poor commissioner .  you see  i don t have any precise goals in life .  i just have the desire to do what seems to me to be the right thing at the moment  in the hope that it will end up with something bearable .  now  pitt knows what he wants and intends to get there by any means .     you re misjudging him  siever .  he s got strong views  but he s a very reasonable man .     of course  eugenia .  that s his great gift  his reasonableness .  whatever course he pursues  he always has a perfectly good  a perfectly logical  a perfectly human reason for it .  he can make one up at any given moment  and is so sincere about it  he convinces even himself .  i m sure if you ve had any dealings with him  you ve managed to let him talk you into doing what you at first didn t want to do  and that he won you over not by orders and threats but by very patient  very rational arguments .     insigna said weakly   well    at that  genarr added sardonically   i see you have indeed suffered from his reasonableness .  you can see for yourself  then  what a good commissioner he is .  not a good person  but a good commissioner .     i wouldn t go so far as to say he wasn t a good person  siever   said insigna  shaking her head slightly .    well  let s not argue about it .  i want to meet your daughter .   he rose to his feet .   why don t i visit your quarters after dinner .     that would be delightful   said insigna .   genarr looked after her with a fading smile as she left .  eugenia had wanted to reminisce  and his own first reaction was to mention her husband  and she had frozen .   he sighed inwardly .  he still had that extraordinary faculty of ruining his own chances .        .     eugenia insigna said to her daughter   his name is siever genarr  and he is properly addressed as commander  because he s the head of the erythro dome .     of course  mother .  if that s his title  i ll call him that .     and i don t want you to embarrass him      i wouldn t do that .     you would do so all too easily  marlene .  you know that .  just accept his statements without correcting them on the ground of body language .  please .  he was a good friend of mine at college and for a while afterward .  and even though he s been here in the dome for ten years and i haven t seen him in all that time  he s still an old friend .     i think he must have been a boyfriend .     now that s just what i mean   said insigna .   i don t want you watching him and telling him what he really means or thinks or feels .  and for your information  he was not my boyfriend  exactly  and we were certainly not lovers .  we were friends and we liked each other  as friends .  but after your father    she shook her head  and gestured vaguely .    and be careful what you say about commissioner pitt  if that subject comes up .  i get the feeling commander genarr distrusts commissioner pitt     marlene bestowed one of her rare smiles on her mother .   have you been studying commander siever s subliminal behavior .  because what you have is more than a feeling .    insigna shook her head .   you see .  you can t stop for a moment .  very well  it s not a feeling .  he actually said he didn t trust the commissioner .  and you know   she added  half to herself   he may have reason     she turned to marlene and said suddenly   let me repeat  marlene .  you are perfectly free to watch the commander and find out all you can  but don t say anything to him about it .  tell me .  do you understand .     do you think there s danger  mother .     i don t know .     i do   said marlene matter of factly .   i ve known there was danger as soon as commissioner pitt said we could go to erythro .  i just don t know what the danger is .         .     seeing marlene for the first time was a shock to siever genarr  one that was made worse by the fact that the girl looked at him with a sullen expression that made it seem that she knew perfectly well that he had received a shock  and just why .   the fact was that there was not a thing about her that seemed to indicate she was eugenia s daughter  none of the beauty  none of the grace  none of the charm .  only those large bright eyes that were now boring into him  and they weren t eugenia s either .  they were the one respect in which she exceeded her mother  rather than fell short .   little by little  though  he revised his first impression .  he joined them for tea and dessert  and marlene behaved herself with perfect propriety .  quite the lady  and obviously intelligent .  what was it that eugenia had said .  all the unlovable virtues .  not quite that bad .  it seemed to him that she ached for love  as plain people sometimes do .  as he himself did .  a sudden flood of fellow feeling swept over him .   and after a while  he said   eugenia  i wonder if i might have a chance to speak to marlene alone .    insigna said with an attempt at lightness    any particular reason  siever .    genarr said   well  it was marlene who spoke to commissioner pitt and it was she who persuaded the commissioner to allow the two of you to come to the dome .  as commander of the dome  i m pretty much dependent on what commissioner pitt says and does  and i would value what marlene can tell me of the meeting .  i think she would speak more freely if it were just the two of us .    genarr watched insigna leave and then turned to marlene  who was now sitting in a large chair in a corner of the room  almost lost in its soft capaciousness .  her hands were clasped loosely in her lap and her beautiful dark eyes regarded the commander gravely .   genarr said with a hint of humor in his voice   your mother seemed a little nervous about leaving you here with me .  are you nervous  too .     not at all   said marlene .    and if my mother was nervous  it was on your behalf  not on mine .     on my behalf .  why .     she thinks i might say something that would offend you .     would you  marlene .     not deliberately  commander .  i ll try not to .     and i m sure you ll succeed .  do you know why i want to see you alone .     you told my mother you want to find out about my interview with commissioner pitt .  that s true  but you also want to see what i m like .    genarr s eyebrows drew together just a trifle .   naturally  i would want to get to know you better .     it s not that   said marlene quickly .   what is it  then .    marlene looked away .   i m sorry  commander .     sorry about what .    marlene s face twitched unhappily and she was silent .   genarr said softly   now  marlene  what is wrong .  you must tell me .  it is important to me that we talk frankly .  if your mother told you to watch what you say  please forget that .  if she implied that i was sensitive and easily offended  please forget that  too .  in fact  i command you to speak to me freely and not to worry a bit about offending me  and you must obey my command because i m the commander of the erythro dome .    marlene laughed suddenly .   you re really anxious to find out about me  aren t you .     of course .     because you re wondering how i can look the way i do  when i m my mother s daughter .    genarr s eyes opened wide .   i never said anything of the sort .     you didn t have to .  you re an old friend of my mother s .  she told me that much .  but you were in love with her  and you haven t quite gotten over it  and you were expecting me to look the way she did when she was young  so when you saw me  you winced and drew back .     i did .  it was noticeable .     it was a very small gesture because you re a polite man and you tried to repress it  but it was there .  i saw it easily .  and then your eyes turned to my mother and back to me .  and then there was the tone of your first words to me .  it was all very plain .  you were thinking i didn t look at all like my mother and you were disappointed .    genarr leaned back in his chair and said   but this is marvelous .   and a great gladness lit up marlene s face .   you mean it  commander .  you mean it .  you re not offended .  you re not uncomfortable .  it makes you happy .  you re the first one  the first one .  even my mother doesn t like it .     liking or not liking it doesn t matter .  that is totally irrelevant when it s a question of coming up against the extraordinary .  how long have you been able to read body language in this way  marlene .     always  but i ve gotten better at it .  i think anyone must be able to do it  if they only watch  and think .     not so  marlene .  it can t be done .  don t think it .  and you say i love your mother .     no doubt about it  commander .  when you re near her  you give it away with every look  every word  every twitch .     do you suppose she notices .     she suspects you do  but she doesn t want you to .   genarr looked away .   she never did .     it s my father .     i know .    marlene hesitated .   but i think she s wrong .  if she could see you the way i do right now      but she can t  unfortunately .  it makes me so happy that you do  though .  you re beautiful .    marlene flushed .  then she said   you mean that .     of course i do .     but      i can t lie to you  can i .  so i won t try .  your face isn t beautiful .  your body isn t beautiful .  but you are beautiful and that s what s important .  and you can tell i really believe that .     yes  i do   said marlene  smiling with such genuine happiness that even her face had a sudden distant cast of beauty .   genarr smiled  too  and said   shall we now talk about commissioner pitt .  now that i know what an uncommonly shrewd young woman you are  it is all the more important i do so .  are you willing .    marlene clasped her hands lightly in her lap  smiled demurely  and said   yes  uncle siever .  you don t mind if i call you that  do you .     not at all .  in fact  i m honored .  now  tell me all about commissioner pitt .  he has sent me instructions that i m to give your mother all possible cooperation and that i am to make freely available to her all our astronomical equipment .  why do you suppose that is .     my mother wants to make delicate measurements of nemesis  motion relative to the stars  and rotor is too unsteady a base for those measurements .  erythro will do much better .     is this project of hers a recent one .     no  uncle siever .  she s been trying to get the necessary data for a long time  she told me .     then why didn t your mother ask to come here a long time ago .     she did  but commissioner pitt refused .     why did he agree now .     because he wanted to get rid of her .     i m sure of that  if she kept bothering him with her astronomical problems .  but he must have been tired of her a long time ago .  why does he send her now .    marlene s voice was low .   he wanted to get rid of me .         fourteen  fishing       .     five years had now passed since the leaving .  crile fisher found that hard to believe since it seemed so much longer than that  infinitely longer .  rotor was not in the past  but in another life altogether  one that he could only view with gathering incredulity .  had he really lived there .  had he had a wife .   he remembered only his daughter clearly  and even that had its element of confusion  for sometimes it seemed to him he remembered her as a teenager .   of course  the problem was compounded by the fact that his life in the last three years  ever since earth had discovered the neighbor star  had been a hectic one .  he had visited seven different settlements .  all of these were inhabited by settlers of his own skin shade who spoke more or less his language and shared more or less his cultural orientation .   that was the advantage of earth s variety .  earth could supply an agent similar in appearance and culture to the general population of any settlement .    of course  there was a limit to how closely he could melt into any settlement .  no matter how he matched its population superficially  he still had a distinctive accent of speech  he could not remain as graceful as they under changes of gravitational pull  he could not skim along as they did in low gravity .  in a dozen ways  he betrayed himself on each settlement he visited  and always they withdrew from him just slightly  even though  in each case  he had gone through quarantine and medical treatment before being allowed to even enter the settlement proper .   of course  he remained on each settlement only a few days to a few weeks .  never was he expected to remain on a settlement on a semipermanent basis or to build himself a family there as he had done on rotor .  but then rotor had had hyper assistance  and since then earth had been looking for items of narrower importance  or at least he had been sent on tasks of narrower importance .   he had been back now for three months .  there was no word of a new assignment and he was not anxious for one .  he was tired of the uprooting  tired of not fitting in  tired of the pretense of being a tourist .   and there was garand wyler  his old friend and colleague  fresh from a settlement of his own and staring at him with tired eyes .  the dark skin of his graceful hand glimmered in the light as he raised his sleeve to his nose for a moment  then let it drop .   fisher half smiled .  he knew the gesture  had gone through it himself .  each settlement had its own characteristic odor  depending on the crops it grew  the spices it used  the perfumes it affected  the very nature of the machinery and lubricants it used .  it quickly went unnoticed  but on the return to earth  the settlement odor clung to one quite detectably .  and though the person might be bathed  and the clothing washed so that others did not notice  one still noticed the smell on himself .   fisher said   welcome back .  how was your settlement this time .     as always  terrible .  old man tanayama is correct .  what all the  settlements fear and hate most is variety .  they don t want differences in appearance  tastes  ways  and life .  they select themselves for uniformity and despise everything else .    fisher said   you re right .  and it s too bad .   wyler said   that s a mild  unfeeling way of putting it .   too bad .     oops  i dropped the dish .  oh  too bad .    whoops  my contact seal is out of line .  oh  too bad .   we re talking humanity here .  we re talking about earth s long struggle to find a way of living together  all cultures  all appearances .  it isn t perfect yet  but compare it to how it was even a century ago  and it s heaven .  then  when we get a chance to move into space  we shuck it all off and move right back into the dark ages .  and you say   too bad .   that s some reaction to something that s an enormous tragedy .     i agree   said fisher   but unless you can tell me something practical i can do about it  what does it matter how eloquently i denounce it .  you were at akruma  weren t you .     yes   said wyler .    did they know about the neighbor star .     certainly .  as far as i know  the news has now reached every settlement .     were they concerned .     not a bit .  why should they be .  they ve got thousands of years .  long before the neighbor star is anywhere near  and if it should seem to be dangerous  which isn t absolutely certain  you know  they can wander off .  they can all wander off .  they admire rotor  and only wait for a chance to get away themselves .   wyler was frowning  his tone bitter .   he went on   they ll all leave  and we ll be stuck .  how are we going to build enough settlements for eight billion human beings and get them all away .     you sound just like tanayama .  what good will it do us to chase them down and punish them  or destroy them .  we ll still be here and we ll still be stuck .  if they all stayed behind like good kids and faced the neighbor star with us  would we be better off .     you re cold about this  crile .  tanayama is hot  and i m on his side .  he s hot enough to pull the galaxy apart if necessary to find hyper assistance on our own .  he wants it so we can chase after rotor and blow them out of space  but even if that does no good  we re going to need hyper assistance to get as many people off earth as possible if it turns out that the neighbor star will make it necessary .  so what tanayama is doing is right  even if his motives are wrong .     and suppose we have hyper assistance and then we find we only have the time and the resources to get a billion people off .  which is the billion that goes .  and what happens if those who are in charge start saving only their own kind .    wyler growled   it doesn t bear thinking of .     it doesn t   agreed fisher .   let s be glad we ll be long gone before even the barest beginning can be made .     if it comes to that   said wyler  his voice suddenly dropping .   the barest beginning may already have been made .  i suspect we have hyper assistance now  or just about have it .    fisher s expression was one of deep cynicism .   what makes you think that .  dreams .  intuition .     no .  i know a woman whose sister knows someone on the old man s staff .  will that do you .     of course not .  you ll have to give me more than that .     i m not in a position to .  look  crile  i m your friend .  you know i helped you get back your status in the office .    crile nodded .   i do and i appreciate it .  and i ve tried to make an adequate return now and then .     you have done so and i appreciate that .  now what i want to do is give you some information which is supposed to be confidential and which i think you will find useful and important .  are you ready to accept it and keep me clear .     always ready .     you know what we ve been doing  of course .    fisher said   yes .   it was the kind of useless  rhetorical question that required no other answer .   for five years agents of the office  for the last three years  fisher among them  had been rummaging in the informational garbage heaps of the settlements .  scavenging .   every settlement was working on hyper assistance  just as earth itself was  ever since the word had leaked out that rotor had it  and certainly ever since rotor had proved the fact by leaving the solar system .   presumably most settlements  perhaps all  had obtained some scrap of what it was that rotor had done .  by the open science agreement  each one of those scraps should have been laid on the table and if all were then put together  it might have meant practical hyper assistance for all .  that  however  was clearly too much to ask in this particular case .  there was no telling what useful side effects might be born of the new technique and no settlement could abandon the hope that it might be first in the field and  in this way  gain an important lead on the others in one way or another .  so each hoarded what it had   if it had anything  and not one of them had enough .   and earth itself  with its vastly elaborate terrestrial board of inquiry  sniffed at all the settlements indiscriminately .  earth was fishing  and fisher  appropriately enough  was one of the fishermen .   wyler said slowly   we ve put what we ve got together and i gather it s enough .  we ll be able to have hyper assisted travel .  and i m thinking we ll go out to the neighbor star .  wouldn t you want to be on that trip when it goes out there .     why do i want to be on it  garand .  if there s going to be such a trip  which i doubt .     i m pretty sure there will be .  i can t give you my source  but take my word for it  it s reliable .  and  of course  you ll want to make the trip .  you might see your wife .  or if not her  your kid .    fisher moved restlessly .  it seemed to him he spent half his days now trying not to think of those eyes .  marlene would be six years old now  talking in a quiet deliberate way  like roseanne .  seeing through people  like roseanne .   he said   you re talking nonsense  garand .  even if there were such a flight  why would they let me be on it .  they would send specialists of one sort or another .  besides  if there s one person the old man will keep off  it s me .  he may have let me get back into the office and given me assignments  but you know how he is about failures  and i certainly failed him on rotor .     yes  but that s the very point .  that s what makes you a specialist .  if he s going after rotor  how can he fail to include the one earthman who lived on rotor for four years .  who would understand rotor better and who would know better how to deal with them .  ask to see him .  point this out  but remember  you re not supposed to know that we have hyper assistance .  just talk possibilities  make use of the subjunctive .  and don t drag me into it in any way .  i m not supposed to know about it either .    fisher s brow furrowed in thought .  was it possible .  he dared not hope .        .     the next day  while fisher was still wondering whether to risk asking for an interview with tanayama  the decision was taken out of his hands .  he was summoned .   a simple agent is rarely summoned by the director .  there are plenty of deputies to grind away at them .  and if an agent is summoned by the old man  it is almost never good news .  so crile fisher prepared himself with grim resignation for an assignment as an inspector of the fertilizer factories .   tanayama looked up at him from behind his desk .  fisher had seen him only rarely and briefly in the three years since earth s discovery of the neighbor star  and he seemed unchanged .  he had been small and shriveled for so long that there seemed no room for any further physical change .  the sharpness of his eyes had not abated either  nor the withered grim set of his lips .  he might even be wearing the same garments he had worn three years before .  fisher could not tell .   but if the harsh voice  too  was the same  the tone was surprising .  apparently  in the face of astronomical odds  the old man had called him in for the purpose of praising him .   tanayama said in his queer  and not altogether unpleasant  distortion of planetary english   fisher  you have done well .  i want you to hear that from me .    fisher  standing  he had not been invited to sit down   managed to suppress his small start of surprise .   the director said   there can be no public celebration of this  no laser beam parade  no holographic procession .  it is not in the nature of things .  but i tell you this .     that is quite enough  director   said fisher .   i thank you .    tanayama stared fixedly at fisher out of his narrow eyes .  finally  he said    and is that all you have to say .  no questions .     i presume  director  you will tell me what i need to know .     you are an agent  a capable man .  what have you found out for yourself .     nothing  director .  i do not seek to find out anything but what i am instructed to find out .    tanayama s small head nodded very slightly .   an appropriate answer  but i seek inappropriate ones .  what have you guessed .     you seem pleased with me  director  and it may therefore be that i have brought in some information that has proved useful to you .     in what respect .     i think nothing would prove more useful to you than having obtained the technique of hyper assistance .    tanayama s mouth made a noiseless   ah h h .   he said   and next .  assuming this to be so  what are we to do next .     travel to the neighbor star .  locate rotor .     nothing better than that .  that is all there is to do .  you see no farther .    and at this point  fisher decided it would be foolish not to gamble .  he could not possibly be handed a better opportunity .   one thing better  that  when the first earth vessel goes out of the solar system by means of hyper assistance  i be on it .    fisher had scarcely said that when he knew his gamble was lost  or at least not won .  tanayama s face darkened .  he said in a sharply imperative tone   sit down .    fisher could hear the soft movement of the chair behind him  rolling toward him at the words of tanayama  words that its primitive computerized motor could understand .   fisher sat down  without looking behind him to make certain the chair was there .  to have done so would have been insulting and  at the present moment  there was no room to insult tanayama .   tanayama said   why do you want to be on the vessel .    with an effort  fisher kept his voice level .   director  i have a wife on rotor .     a wife you abandoned five years ago .  do you think she would welcome you back .     director  i have a child .     she was one year old when you left .  do you think she knows she has a father .  or cares .    fisher was silent .  these were points that he had thought about himself  over and over .   tanayama waited briefly  then said   but there will be no flight to the neighbor star .  there will be no vessel for you to be on .    again  fisher had to suppress surprise .  he said   forgive me  director .  you did not say we had hyper assistance .  you said   assuming this to be so    i should have noted your choice of words .     so you should have done .  so you should always do .  nevertheless  we do have hyper assistance .  we can now move through space  just as rotor has done  or at least we will  once we build a vehicle and are sure the design is adequate  and all its features workable  which may take a year or two .  but then what .  are you seriously suggesting we take it to the neighbor star .    fisher said cautiously   surely that is an option  director .     a useless one .  think it out  man .  the neighbor star is over two light years away .  no matter how skillfully we make use of hyper assistance  it will take us more than two years to arrive there .  our theoreticians now tell me that while hyper assistance will allow a ship to go faster than light for brief periods of time  the faster  the briefer  the end result is always that it cannot reach any point in space faster than a ray of light would have  if the two had started from the same point of origin .     but if that is so      if that is so  you would be forced to remain on a spaceship in close quarters with several other crew people for over two years .  do you think you can endure that .  you know very well that small ships have never made long trips .  what we need is a settlement  a structure large enough to provide a reasonable environment  like rotor .  how long will that take .     i couldn t say  director .     perhaps ten years if all works well  if there are no hitches or mishaps .  remember  we haven t built a settlement in nearly a century .  all the recent settlements have been built by other settlements .  if  suddenly  we begin building one  we will attract the attention of all the settlements that already exist  and that must be avoided .  then  too  if such a settlement can be built  and outfitted with hyper assistance  and sent to the neighbor star in over a two year flight  what will it do when it gets there .  as a settlement  it will be vulnerable and easy to destroy if rotor has warships  as it certainly will have .  rotor will have more warships than we could possibly carryon our traveling settlement .  after all  they have been there for three years already  and may be there for twelve more years before we get there .  they will blow our settlement out of space on sight .     in that case  director      no further guessing  agent fisher .  in that case  we must have true hyperspatial travel  so that we may move any distance we like in as short a period as we like .     pardon me  director  but is that possible .  even in theory .     that is not for you or me to say .  we need scientists to concentrate on the matter  and we don t have them .  for a century or more  earth has suffered a brain drain to the settlements .  so now we must reverse that .  we must raid the settlements  after a fashion  and persuade the best physicists and engineers to come to earth .  we can offer them a great deal  but it will have to be done carefully .  we can t be too open  you understand  or the settlements will certainly forestall us .  now     he paused  and studied fisher thoughtfully .   fisher stirred uneasily and said   yes  director .     the physicist i have my eye on is one t .  a .  wendel  who  i m told  is the best hyperspatialist in the solar system      it was the hyperspatialists on rotor who discovered hyper assistance .   fisher could not resist allowing a certain dryness to enter his voice .   tanayama ignored that .  he said   discoveries can be made by happy accident  and an inferior mind can stumble ahead while a superior one is taking the time to lay a firm foundation .  that has frequently happened in history .  besides  rotor only has what proved  in the end  to be merely hyper assistance  a speed of light drive .  i want a superluminal drive  one that is far beyond the speed of light .  and i want wendel .     and do you wish me to get him for you .     her .  she s a woman .  tessa anita wendel of adelia .     oh .     that is why we want you for the job .  apparently   and here tanayama seemed to radiate a quiet amusement  although nothing in his facial expression seemed to indicate that   you are irresistible to women .    fisher s expression grew wooden .   i ask pardon for contradicting you  director  but i do not find it so .  i have never found it so .     the reports are persuasive  just the same .  wendel is a middle aged woman  in her forties  twice divorced .  she should not be hard to persuade .      to be honest  sir  i find the assignment distasteful and  under those circumstances  it is possible another agent would be better suited for the task .     but i want you just the same .  if you fear that you would not be your flirtatious and maddeningly attractive self if you approached her with face averted and nose wrinkled  i will sweeten matters for you  agent fisher .  you failed on rotor  but your service since has  in part  made up for it .  you can now completely make up for it .  if  however  you do not bring back this woman  that will be a far greater failure than rotor was  and you will never have the chance to make up for that .  still  i don t want you governed by apprehension alone .  i will throw in a bit of anticipation .  bring back wendel and when a superluminal vessel is built and heads out toward the neighbor star  you will be on it if you wish .     i will do my best   said fisher   and i would have done my best even if there were no occasion for either apprehension or anticipation .     an excellent answer   said tanayama  allowing himself the thinnest of smiles   and undoubtedly well rehearsed .    and fisher left  fully realizing that he had been sent out on his most crucial fishing expedition yet .       fifteen  plague       .     eugenia insigna smiled at genarr over dessert .   you seem to lead a pleasant life here .    genarr smiled  too .   pleasant enough  but claustrophobic .  we live on a huge world  but i m bounded by the dome .  the people here tend to be ingrown .  when i do meet someone interesting  they leave in a couple of months  at most .  generally  the people here in the dome bore me most of the time  though probably not as much as i bore them .  that s why the arrival of you and your daughter would have been a holovision item  even if you were anyone else .  of course  since it s you      flatterer   said insigna sadly .   genarr cleared his throat .   marlene warned me  for my own good  you understand  that you have not quite gotten over     but insigna overrode him suddenly .   i can t say i ve noticed any holovision attention .    genarr gave up .  he said   just a manner of speaking .  we re planning a little party tomorrow evening  and you ll then be formally introduced and everyone will get a chance to know you .     and discuss my appearance  and choice of costume  and chew over whatever is known about me .     i m sure of it .  but marlene will be invited  too  and that means  i suppose  that you will know a great deal more about all of us than we will about you .  your information will be more reliable  too .    insigna looked uneasy   did marlene act up .     you mean  did she read my body language .  yes  ma am .     i told her not to .     i don t think she can help it .     you re right .  she can t .  but i told her not to tell you about it .  i take it she did tell you .     oh yes .  i ordered her to do so .  actually  i commanded her to do so in my role as commander .     well  i m sorry .  it can be so annoying .     but it wasn t .  not to me .  eugenia  please understand this .  i like your daughter .  i like her very much .  i have the idea that she has had a miserable life being someone who knows too much and whom no one likes .  that she has turned out full of what you referred to as the unlovable virtues is little short of a miracle .     i warn you .  she ll tire you out .  and she s only fifteen .    genarr said   there s some law  i think  that prevents mothers from ever remembering when they themselves were fifteen .  she casually mentioned a boy  and you may know that the pangs of unrequited love hurt as deeply at fifteen as at twenty five  maybe even more so .  though your teenage years may well have been sunny ones  considering your appearance .  remember  too  that marlene is in a particularly bad position .  she knows she s plain and she knows she s intelligent .  she feels that intelligence should much more than make up for lack of beauty and she also knows that it doesn t  so she rages helplessly and knows that that does no good either .     well  siever   said insigna  trying to sound light   you re quite the psychologist .      no  not at all .  it s just this one thing i understand .  i ve been through it myself .     oh    insigna seemed at a loss .    it s all right  eugenia .  i have no intention of being sorry for myself  and i wasn t trying to lure you into sympathy for a poor  broken soul  because i m not .  i m forty nine  not fifteen  and i ve made my peace with myself .  had i been handsome and stupid when i was fifteen  or twenty one  as  at that time in life  i wished i had been  i would undoubtedly now no longer be handsome  but i d still be stupid .  so  in the long run  i ve won out  and so  i m positive  will marlene  if there is a long run .     and what do you mean by that  siever .     marlene tells me that she talked to our good friend pitt  and that she deliberately antagonized him in order to make him willing to send you to erythro because that meant getting rid of her  too .     i don t approve of that   said eugenia .   i don t mean about manipulating pitt  because i don t think pitt is that easy to manipulate .  i mean trying to do it .  marlene is getting to the point where she thinks she can pull puppet strings  and this may get her into serious trouble .     eugenia  i do not wish to frighten you  but i think marlene is in serious trouble right now .  at least  it may be pitt s hope that she will be .     now  siever  that s impossible .  pitt may be opinionated and overbearing  but there s nothing vicious about him .  he s not going to strike out at a teenage girl just because she played foolish games with him .    the dinner was over  but the lights were still somewhat lowered in genarr s rather elegant quarters  and insigna reacted with a slight frown as genarr leaned over to close the contact that activated the shield .    secrets  siever .   she said with a forced laugh .    yes  as a matter of fact  eugenia .  i m going to have to play the psychologist again .  you don t know pitt as i do .  i ve competed with him  and that s why i m out here .  he wanted to get rid of me .  in my case  however  separation is enough .  it may not be enough in marlene s case .    another forced laugh .   come  siever .  what are you saying .     listen  and you ll understand .  pitt is secretive .  he has a fixed aversion to anyone knowing what he intends .  it gives him a sense of power to be moving down a hidden road and dragging others  all unwitting  with him .     you may be right .  he kept nemesis secret  and forced the secrecy on me  too .     he s got many secrets  more than you and i know  i m sure .  but here s marlene  to whom a person s hidden motives and thoughts are as clear as day .  no one likes that  pitt  least of all .  so he s sent her out here  and you  too  since he couldn t send her without you .     all right .  what of that .     you don t suppose he wants her back  do you .  ever .     that s paranoid  siever .  you can t really believe pitt would intend to keep her in permanent exile .     he can  in one way .  you see  eugenia  you don t know the early history of the dome as i do  and as pitt does  and as hardly anyone else does .  you know pitt s penchant for secrecy and it works here  too .  you have to understand why we remain in the dome and make no effort to colonize erythro .     you explained .  the character of the light      that is the official explanation  eugenia .  accept the light  it is something we can grow accustomed to .  consider what else we have  a world with a normal gravity  a breathable atmosphere  a pleasant temperature range  weather cycles reminiscent of earth  no life forms above the prokaryote stage  and with those prokaryotes not infectious in any way .  yet we make no move to colonize the world  even in a limited fashion .     well  then  why not .     in the early days of the dome  people went out freely to explore outside .  they took no special precautions  breathed the air  drank the water .     yes .     and some of them fell ill .  mentally .  permanently .  not violently insane  but  divorced from reality .  some have improved with time  but none  as far as i know  has recovered completely .  it is  apparently  not contagious  and they are taken care of on rotor  quietly .    eugenia frowned .   are you making this up  siever .  i haven t heard a word of it .     i remind you again of pitt s penchant for secrecy .  this was not something you had a need to know .  it was not your department .  it was something i had a need to know because i was sent here to deal with it .  if i failed  we might have had to abandon erythro altogether  and a pall of fear and discontent would have fallen over us all .    he fell silent for a moment  then said   i shouldn t be telling you this .  i am  in a sense  violating my oath of office .  still  for marlene s sake     a look of deepest apprehension crossed eugenia s face .   what are you saying .  that pitt      i m saying that pitt may have thought that marlene might come down with what we called  erythrotic plague .   it wouldn t kill her .  it wouldn t even make her ill in the ordinary sense  but it would sufficiently disorder her brain to put her peculiar gift out of action  perhaps  and that is what pitt would want .     but that is horrible  siever .  unthinkable .  to subject a child      i m not saying it will happen  eugenia .  what pitt wants is not necessarily what pitt will get .  once i got here  i introduced drastic methods of protection .  we don t go out in the open  except in the equivalent of protective suits  and we don t stay out longer than need be .  the filtration procedures of the dome have been improved  too .  since i instituted those measures  we ve only had two cases  both rather light .     but what causes it  siever .    genarr laughed briefly but not lightly .   we don t know .  that s the worst of it .  we can t sharpen our defenses any further .  careful experiments indicate that there is nothing in either air or water that would seem to account for it .  nor in the soil  after all  we have the soil here in the dome  we can t divorce ourselves from it .  we have the air and water  too  properly filtered .  still  many people have breathed raw erythrotic air and drunk raw erythrotic water and have done so with complete impunity and no consequences .     then it must be the prokaryotes .     it can t be .  we ve all ingested them or breathed them inadvertently  and we ve used them in animal experiments .  nothing happens .  besides  if it were the prokaryotes  the plague would be expected to be contagious and  as i said  it isn t .  we ve experimented with the radiation from nemesis and that seems to do no harm .  what s more  once  only once  someone who d never been outside got it inside the dome .  it s a mystery .     you have no theories .     i .  no .  i m just content that it has virtually stopped .  still  as long as we are so ignorant of the nature and cause of the plague  we can never be sure that it won t start up again .  there was one suggestion      what was that .     a psychologist reported this suggestion to me and i passed it on to pitt .  he claimed that those who came down with the disorder were more imaginative than those who did not  more out of the ordinary  mentally speaking .  more intelligent  more creative  more unusual .  he suggested that whatever the cause  the more remarkable brains were less resistant  more easily upset .     do you think that might be so .     i don t know .  the trouble is that there is no other distinction .  both sexes were hit  roughly equally  and no clear bias as far as age  education  or gross physical characteristics could be found .  of course  the plague victims make up a relatively small sample  so the statistics aren t compelling .  pitt thought we might go along with the out of the usual bit  and in recent years  no one has come to erythro who hasn t been a pretty dull clod  not unintelligent  you understand  but a plodder .  like myself .  i m the ideal subject for immunity from the plague  an ordinary brain .  right .     come siever  you aren t      on the other hand   said genarr  not waiting for her protest   i would say that marlene s brain was remarkably out of the ordinary .     oh yes   began eugenia .   i see what you re getting at .     it s possible that when pitt discovered that marlene had this ability and that she was asking to go to erythro  he saw at once that by merely acceding to her request  he might possibly get rid of a mind he instantly recognized as dangerous .     obviously  then  we ought to leave  go back to rotor .     yes  but i m quite sure pitt can prevent that for a while .  he can insist that these measurements you wish to make are vital and must be completed and you won t be able to use the plague as an excuse .  if you even try  he will have you held for mental examination .  i would suggest that you complete those measurements as quickly as you can  and  as for marlene  we will take all possible precautions .  the plague has died down  and the suggestion that out of the ordinary brains are particularly vulnerable is just that  a suggestion  and no more .  there s no real reason to think we can t get away with it .  we can keep marlene safe and do pitt in the eye .  you ll see .    insigna stared at genarr  not quite seeing him  her stomach tying itself into a knot .       sixteen  hyperspace       .     adelia was a pleasant settlement  much more pleasant than rotor had been .   crile fisher had now been on six settlements other than rotor and all had been more pleasant than rotor .   fisher paused momentarily to go over the list of names and sighed .  there were seven  not six .  he was losing track .  perhaps it was all getting to be too much for him .    whatever the number  adelia was the most pleasant settlement crile had visited .  not perhaps physically .  rotor had been an older settlement  one that had managed to work itself into an assembly of traditions  so to speak .  there was an efficiency about it  a sense of each person knowing his place exactly  being satisfied with it  and working away at it successfully .   of course  tessa was here on adelia  tessa anita wendel .  crile had not pursued matters there yet  perhaps because tanayama s characterization of him as irresistible to women had shaken him .  however much it might have been meant as humor  or as sarcasm   it forced him  almost against his will  to go slowly .  producing a fiasco would seem doubly bad in the eyes of someone who believed him  however insincerely  to have a way with women .   it was two weeks after fisher had settled himself into the settlement before he managed to see her .  it was always a source of wonder to him that on any settlement one could always manage to arrange to get a view of anyone .  not all his experience had accustomed him to the smallness of a settlement  to the fewness of its population  to the manner in which everyone knew everyone else in his or her social circle  everyone else  and almost everyone else outside that circle  too .   when he did see her  however  tessa wendel turned out to be rather impressive .  tanayama s description of her as middle aged and as twice divorced  the quirk of his aged lips as he said so  as though he were knowingly setting fisher an unpleasant task  had built a picture in fisher s mind of a harsh woman  hard faced  with a nervous twitch  perhaps  and an attitude toward men that was either cynical or hungry .   tessa did not seem at all like this from the moderate distance at which he first saw her .  she was almost as tall as he was and brunette  with her hair sleeked down .  she looked quite alert and she smiled easily  he could tell that .  her clothes were refreshingly simple  as though she went out of her way to eschew ornament .  she had kept herself slim and her figure was still surprisingly youthful .   fisher found himself wondering why she was twice divorced .  he was ready to assume that she had tired of the men  rather than the other way around  even though common sense told him that incompatibility could strike against all odds .   it was necessary to be at some social function at which she would also be present .  his being an earthman interposed a small difficulty  but there were people on every settlement who were  to some extent or other  in earth s pay .  one of them would surely see to it that fisher would be  launched   to use the term most settlements applied to the ritual .   the time came  then  when he and wendel were facing each other and she gazed at him thoughtfully  her eyes making a slow sweep downward  then upward again  followed by the inevitable   you re from earth  aren t you  mr .  fisher .     yes  i am  dr .  wendel .  and i regret that exceedingly  if it offends you .     it doesn t offend me .  i presume you ve been decontaminated .     indeed .  to death  just about .     and why have you dared the decontamination process in order to come here .    and fisher said  without staring at her too directly  but keen to detect the effect   because i was told that adelian women were particularly beautiful .     and now  i suppose  you will go back and deny the rumor .     on the contrary  it has just been confirmed .   she said   you re a fetcher  you know that .    fisher didn t know what a  fetcher  was in adelian slang  but wendel was smiling  and fisher decided the first exchange had gone well .   was it because he was irresistible .  he suddenly remembered that he had never tried to be irresistible to eugenia .  he had merely wanted a way of being launched into the difficult rotorian society .   the adelian society was not so difficult  fisher decided  but he had better not belabor his irresistibility .  yet to himself  he smiled sadly .        .     a month later  fisher and wendel were sufficiently at ease with each other to spend some time together in a low g gym .  fisher had almost enjoyed the workout  but only almost  because he had never grown sufficiently acclimated to gymnastics at low g to avoid a certain amount of space sickness .  on rotor  there had been less attention to such things  and he had usually been excluded from them because he was not a native rotorian .   that was not legal  but custom often has a habit of being stronger than legality .    they took an elevator to a higher g level  and fisher felt his stomach settling down .  both he and wendel were wearing a minimum of clothing  and he had the feeling that she was as aware of his body as he was of hers .   after their showers  they had both robed and retired to one of the privacies  where they could order a small meal .   wendel said   you re not bad at low g for an earthman  crile .  are you enjoying yourself on adelia .     you know i am  tessa .  an earthman can never get entirely used to a small world  but your presence would overbalance a great many disadvantages .      yes .  that s exactly what a fetcher would say .  how does adelia compare to rotor .     to rotor .     or to the other settlements you ve been on .  i can name them all  crile .    fisher felt discomfited .   what did you do .  investigate me .     of course .     am i that interesting .     i find anyone interesting who is clearly going out of his way to be interested in me .  i want to know why .  excluding the possibility of sex  of course .  that s taken as a given .     why am i interested in you  then .     suppose you tell me .  why were you on rotor .  you were there long enough to get married and have a child and then you got off in a hurry before it scooted away .  were you afraid of being stuck on rotor all your life .  didn t you like it there .    fisher had gone from feeling discomfited to feeling harassed .  he said   actually  i didn t like rotor very much because they didn t like me  earthmen  that is .  and you re right .  i didn t want to be stuck there as a second class citizen all my life .  other settlements are easier on us .  adelia is .     rotor had a secret  though  that it was trying to keep from earth  didn t it .   wendel s eyes seemed to glitter with amusement .    a secret .  you mean  i suppose  hyper assistance .     yes  i suppose that is what i mean .  and i suppose that that was what you were after .     i .     yes  of course you .  did you get it .  i mean  that s why you married a rotorian scientist  wasn t it .   she rested her face on her two fists  elbows on the table  and leaned toward him .   fisher shook his head  and said guardedly   she never said a word to me about hyper assistance .  you re all wrong about me .    wendel ignored his remark  and said    and now you want to get it from me .  how do you plan to do that .  are you going to marry me .     would i get it from you if i married you .     no .     then marriage seems to be out of the question  doesn t it .     too bad   said wendel  smiling .   fisher said    are you asking me these questions because you re a hyperspatialist .     where were you told that that was what i was .  back on earth  before you came here .     you re listed in the adelian roster .      ah  you ve investigated me  too .  what a curious pair we are .  did you notice that i was listed as a theoretical physicist .     it also lists your papers  and when quite a few of the titles have the word  hyperspatial   it makes you sound like a hyperspatialist to me .     yes  but i m a theoretical physicist just the same  so i approach the whole matter of hyperspatialism in a theoretical way .  i ve never tried to put it into practice .     but rotor did .  did that bother you .  i wonder .  after all  someone on rotor got ahead of you .     why should it bother me .  the theory is interesting  but the application isn t .  if you were to read more of my papers than the titles  you would discover that i say  quite flatly  that hyper assistance isn t worth the effort .     rotorians were able to get a vessel far into space and studied the stars .     you re talking about the far probe .  that enabled rotor to get parallax measurements for a number of comparatively distant stars  but is that worth the expense they went to .  how far did the far probe go .  just a few light months .  that s not really very far .  as far as the galaxy is concerned  the far probe s extreme position and that of earth and the imaginary line that can be drawn between them all amounts to a point in space .     they did more than send out the far probe   said fisher .   the entire settlement left .     they certainly did .  that was in      so they ve been gone six years now .  and all we know is that they left .         isn t that enough .     of course not .  where did they go .  are they still alive .  can they still be alive .  human beings have never been isolated on a settlement .  they have always had earth in the vicinity  and other settlements  too .  can a few tens of thousands of human beings survive  alone in the universe  on a small settlement .  we have no idea if that is a psychological possibility .  my guess is that it isn t .     i imagine their purpose would be to find a world they could live on .  they wouldn t remain on a settlement .     come  what world will they find .  they ve been gone six years .  there are exactly two stars they could have reached by now since hyper assistance can only move them at an average speed equal to that of light .  that s alpha centauri  a three star system  four point three light years away  one of the three being a red dwarf .  then there s barnard s star  a single red dwarf  five point nine light years away .  four stars  a sun like star  a near sun like star  and two red dwarfs .  the two sun likes are part of a moderately close binary and therefore unlikely to have an earth like planet in stable orbit .  where do they go next .  they won t make it  crile .  i m sorry .  i know that your wife and child were on rotor  but they won t make it .    fisher kept calm .  he knew something she didn t .  he knew about the neighbor star  but that was a red dwarf  too .   he said   then you think that interstellar flight is impossible .     in a practical sense  yes  if hyper assistance is all there is .    fisher said   you make it sound as though hyper assistance isn t all there is  tessa .     it may be all there is .  it wasn t long ago when we thought that even that much was impossible and to go further yet  still  we can at least dream of true hyperspatial flight and true superluminal velocities .  if we could go as quickly as we wished for as long as we wished  then the galaxy  perhaps the universe  would become one large solar system  so to speak  and we could have it all .     that s a nice dream  but is it possible .     we ve had three all settlement conferences on the matter since rotor s flight .     just all settlement .  what about earth .     there were earth observers present  but earth is not a physicists  paradise these days .     what conclusions did the conferences reach .   wendel smiled .   you re not a physicist .     leave out the hard parts .  i m curious .   she merely smiled at him .   fisher clenched his fist on the table before him .   forget this theory of yours that i m some sort of secret agent after your information .  i have a child out there somewhere  tessa .  you say she s probably dead .  what if she s alive .  is there a chance     wendel s smile disappeared .   i m sorry .  i did not think of that .  but be practical .  finding a settlement somewhere in a volume of space that is represented by a sphere that  at the present time  is six light years in radius and is growing ever larger with time is an impossible task .  it took us over a century to find the tenth planet  and that was enormously larger than rotor and a much smaller volume of space had to be combed .    fisher said   hope springs eternal .  is true hyperspatial flight possible .  you can say yes or no .     most say na  if you want the truth .  there may be a few who say they can t say  but they tend to mumble .     does anyone say yes right out loud .     one person that i know of does .  i do .     you think it s possible .   said fisher with an astonishment he did not have to fake .   do you say that openly  or is it something you tell yourself in the dark of the night .     i ve published on the subject .  one of those articles you only read the title of .  no one dares agree with me  of course  and i ve been wrong before  but i think i m right now .     why do the others all think you re wrong .     that s the hard part .  it s a matter of interpretation .  hyper assistance on the rotorian model  the techniques of which are by now understood in the settlements generally  by the way  depends on the fact that the product of the ratio of ship speed to light speed  multiplied by time  is a constant  where the ratio of ship speed to light speed is greater than one .     what does that mean .     that means that when you go faster than light  the faster you go  the shorter the time you can maintain that speed  and the longer the time you must go more slowly than light before you can get a boost over it again .  the result is that  in the end  your average speed over a particular distance is no greater than the speed of light .     well .     that makes it sound as though the uncertainty principle is involved  and the uncertainty principle  all of us are convinced  can t be fooled with .  if the uncertainty principle is involved  then true hyperspatial flight would seem to be theoretically impossible  and most physicists have come down on that side of the argument  while the rest of them waffle .  my view  however  is that what s involved merely seems like the uncertainty principle but isn t  and that true hyperspatial flight is  therefore  not eliminated .     can the matter be settled .     probably not   said wendel  shaking her head .   the settlements are definitely not interested in wandering off with mere hyper assistance .  no one is going to repeat the rotorian experiment and voyage for years to probable death .  on the other hand  neither is any settlement going to invest an incredible amount of money  resources  and effort in order to try to work out a technique that the vast majority of experts in the field are convinced is theoretically impossible .    fisher leaned forward .   doesn t that bother you .     of course it bothers me .  i m a physicist and i d like to prove that my view of the universe is the correct one .  however  i ve got to accept the limits of the possible .  it will take enormous sums and the settlements will give me nothing .     but  tessa  even if the settlements are not interested  earth is  and to any amount .     really .   tessa smiled in what seemed mild amusement and she reached out to stroke fisher s hair  slowly and sensually .   i thought we d get to earth eventually .         .     fisher seized wendel s wrist and gently drew her hand away from his head .  he said   you ve been telling me the truth about your opinions of hyperspatial flight  haven t you .     completely .    he said   then earth wants you .     why .     because earth wants hyperspatial flight  and you re the one important physicist who thinks it can be done .     if you knew that  crile  why the cross examination .     i didn t know it until you told me so .  the only information i had been given was that you were the most brilliant physicist alive today .     oh  i am  i am   said wendel mockingly .   and you were sent to get me .     i was sent to persuade you .     persuade me to do what .  to come to earth .  overcrowded  filthy  impoverished  wracked by uncontrolled weather .  what an enticing thought .     listen to me  tessa .  earth is not all of a piece .  it may have all those faults  but there are parts that are beautiful and peaceful and that is all you would see .  you don t really know what earth is like .  you ve never been there  have you .     never .  i m adelian  born and bred .  i have been to other settlements  but i ve never been to earth  thank you .     then you can t know what earth is like .  you can t know what a large world is .  a real world .  you live here enclosed  in a toy box  with a few square kilometers of surface  with a handful of people .  you re living in a miniature that you ve used up long ago and that has nothing more to offer you .  earth  on the other hand  is over six hundred million square kilometers of surface .  it is eight billion human beings .  it is infinite variety  lots of it very bad  but lots of it very good .     and all of it very poor .  and you have no science .     because scientists  and with them science  have moved out to the settlements .  that s why we need you and others .  come back to earth .      i still don t see why .     because we have goals  ambitions  desires .  the settlements have only self satisfaction .     what good are all those goals and ambitions and desires .  physics is an expensive pursuit .     and earth s per capita wealth is low  i admit it .  individually  we are poor  but eight billion people  each contributing something out of poverty  can amass a vast sum .  our resources  misused as they are and have been  are still enormous  and we can find more money and more labor than all the settlements together  if it is for something we feel an absolute need .  i assure you that earth feels an absolute need for hyperspatial flight .  come to earth  tessa  and you will be treated as that rarest of resources  a brilliant brain we must have  and the one thing we can t supply on our own .    wendel said   i m not at all sure that adelia would be willing to let me go .  it may be a self satisfied settlement  but it knows the value of brains  too .     they can t object to your attending a scientific meeting on earth .     and once there  you mean  i needn t return .     you will have no complaint with regard to treatment .  you will be more comfortable there than you are here .  your every desire  your every wish  more than that  you can head the hyperspatial project and you will have an unlimited budget to devise tests of any kind  run experiments  make observations      well .  what a princely bribe you offer me .    fisher said earnestly   is there anything more you can ask for .     i wonder   said wendel .   why were you sent .  an attractive man like you .  were they expecting you to bring back an elderly female physicist  susceptible  frustrated  drawn by your body like a fish by a hook .     i don t know what was in the mind of those who sent me  tessa  but that was not in my mind .  not after one look at you .  you are not elderly  as you well know .  i don t for a minute believe that you are either susceptible or frustrated .  earth is offering you a physicist s dream .  that has nothing to do with whether you are male or female  elderly or youthful .     what a shame .  suppose i proved recalcitrant and didn t wish to go to earth .  what were you to do as a last measure of persuasion .  suppress your distaste for the process and make love to me .    wendel crossed her arms over her magnificent breasts and looked at him quizzically .   fisher said carefully  choosing his words    again  i cannot say what was in the mind of those who sent me .  making love was not part of my explicit instructions  nor was it part of my intentions  though if it had been  i assure you that i would feel no distaste at the prospect .  i felt  however  that you would see the advantages from a physicist s point of view and i would not denigrate you by supposing that you would need anything more .     how wrong you are   said wendel .   i see the advantages from a physicist s point of view  and i am anxious to accept the offer and to pursue the butterfly of hyperspatial flight down the corridors of the possible  but i do not wish to give up your best efforts at persuasion either .  i want it all .     but      in short  if you want me  you must pay me .  persuade me as though i were recalcitrant  as best as ever you can  or i won t go to earth .  come  why do you suppose we are here in a privacy .  what do you think privacies are for .  once we have exercised  showered  eaten a bit  drank a little  conversed  experienced some pleasure in all these things  there is opportunity to experience others .  i insist .  persuade me to come to earth .    and at the touch of her finger  the light within the privacy dimmed seductively .       seventeen  safe .        .     insigna felt uneasy .  it was siever genarr who had insisted that marlene be consulted in the matter .   he said   you re her mother  eugenia  and you can t help but think of her as a little girl .  it takes a while for a mother to realize she is not an absolute monarch  that her daughter is not a piece of property .    eugenia insigna avoided his mild eye .  she said   don t lecture me  siever .  you have no children of your own .  it s easy to be pompous about other people s children .     do i sound pompous .  i m sorry .  let us say  i m not as emotionally bound as you are to the memory of an infant .  i like the girl a great deal  but i have no picture of her in my mind except that of a burgeoning young woman with a very remarkable mind .  she s important  eugenia .  i have a peculiar feeling that she is much more important than either you or i .  she must be consulted      she must be kept safe    insigna countered .    i agree  but she must be consulted as to how best to keep her safe .  she is young  she is inexperienced  but she may possibly know better than we do what must be done .  let us talk among ourselves as though we were three adults .  promise me  eugenia  that you won t try to make use of maternal authority .    insigna said bitterly   how can i promise that .  but we ll talk to her .    so now the three were together in genarr s office  the room shielded  and marlene  looking quickly from one to the other  pressed her lips tightly together and said unhappily   i m not going to like this .    insigna said   i m afraid it is bad news .  here it is  bluntly .  we re considering a return to rotor .    marlene looked astonished .   but your important work  mother .  you can t abandon that .  but i see you don t intend to .  i don t understand  then .     marlene   insigna spoke slowly and with emphasis .   we re considering that you return to rotor .  only you .     at that  there were a few moments of silence  while marlene searched both of their faces .  then she said  almost in a whisper   you re serious .  i can t believe it .  i won t return to rotor .  i don t want to .  ever .  erythro is my world .  right here is where i want to be .     marlene  began insigna  her voice shrill .   genarr held up his hand in insigna s direction  shaking his head slightly .  she fell silent  and genarr said   why are you so anxious to be here  marlene .    and marlene answered flatly   because i am .  you can be hungry for some particular food sometimes  just feel like eating it .  you can t explain why .  you just want it .  i m hungry for erythro .  i don t know why  but i want it .  i don t have to explain that .    genarr said   let your mother tell you what we know .    insigna took marlene s cold and unresponsive hand in hers and said   do you remember  marlene  before we left for erythro  when you were telling me about your conversation with commissioner pitt      yes .     you told me then that when he said we could go to erythro  he left out something .  you didn t know what that something was  but you said it was rather unpleasant  sort of evil .     yes  i remember .    insigna hesitated and marlene s large penetrating eyes grew hard .  she whispered  as though she was talking to herself and wasn t entirely aware that her inner thoughts were being voiced .   optic flicker at head .  hand nearly at temple .  moves away .   the sound died  though her lips continued to move .   then  in loud outrage  she said    are you under the impression there s something wrong with my mind .     no   said insigna quickly .   quite the reverse  dear .  we know that your mind is an excellent one  and we want it to stay that way .  here s the story     marlene listened to the tale of the erythro plague with what seemed to be the deepest suspicion  and finally said   i see you believe what you are telling me  mother  but it could be that someone told you a lie .     she heard it from me   said genarr   and i tell you  of my personal experience  that it s all the truth .  now you tell me if i am telling the truth right now .    marlene clearly accepted that and moved onward .   why am i in particular danger  then .  why am i in danger more than you or mother .     as your mother said  marlene  the plague is thought to strike more readily at people who are more imaginative  more fanciful .  there is evidence that leads some to believe that unusual minds are more susceptible to the plague  and since yours is the most unusual i have ever encountered  it seems to me possible that you are dangerously susceptible .  the commissioner has sent instructions that you are to have a free hand on erythro  that we re to make it possible for you to see and experience whatever you wish  that we are even to allow you to explore outside the dome  if that is your desire .  it sounds very kind of him  but might he not want to expose you to the outside in the wish  in the hope  of increasing your chance at coming down with the plague .    marlene considered this with no sign of emotion .  insigna said   don t you see  marlene .  the commissioner doesn t want to kill you .  we re not accusing him of that .  he just wants to put your mind out of action .  it is inconvenient to him .  you can easily find out things about him and about his intentions that he doesn t want you to know  and he won t have that .  he s a man of secrets .     if commissioner pitt is trying to do me harm   said marlene at length   then why are you trying to send me back to him .    genarr raised his eyebrows .   we ve explained it .  you re in danger here .     i d be in danger there  with him .  what might he do next  if he really wants to destroy me .  if he thinks i m going to be destroyed here  then he ll forget about me .  he ll leave me alone  won t he .  at least for as long as i m here .     but the plague  marlene .  the plague .    she reached out to hug her .  marlene evaded the embrace .   i m not worried about the plague .     but we explained      it doesn t matter what you explained .  i m not in danger here .  not at all .  i know my mind .  i ve lived with it all my life .  i understand it .  it s not in danger .    genarr said   be reasonable  marlene .  however stable you feel your mind to be  it s subject to disease and deterioration .  you might get meningitis  epileptic symptoms  a brain tumor  or  eventually  senescence .  can you hold any of those things at bay just by being sure none of it will happen to you .     i m not talking about any of those things .  i m talking about the plague .  that won t happen to me .     you can t possibly be sure  dear .  we don t even know what the plague is .     whatever it is  it won t happen to me .     how can you tell  marlene .   asked genarr .   i just know .    insigna felt her patience break .  she caught marlene by both elbows .   marlene  you must do as you re told .     no  mother .  you don t understand .  on rotor  i ve felt a pull toward erythro .  it pulls me more strongly than ever  now that i m on it .  i want to stay on it .  i ll be safe here .  i don t want to go back to rotor .  i ll be less safe there .    genarr raised his hand  stopping whatever it was that insigna was about to say .   i suggest a compromise  marlene .  your mother is here to make certain astronomical observations .  it will take her some time .  promise that  while she is busy at it  you will be content to stay inside the dome and take such precautions as i think will make sense  and that you submit to periodic tests .  if we detect no change in your mental functioning  you can wait here in the dome till your mother is done and then we can discuss it again .  agreed .    marlene bent her head in thought .  then she said    all right .  but  mother  don t think of pretending to be finished when you re not finished .  i will know .  and don t think of doing a quick job instead of a good one .  i will know that  too .    insignia frowned and said   i won t play games  marlene  and don t think i will ever deliberately do bad science  even for your sake .    marlene said   i m sorry  mother .  i know that you find me irritating .    insignia sighed heavily   i don t deny that  but  irritating or not  marlene  you are my daughter .  i love you  and i want to keep you safe .  as far as that goes  am i lying .     no  mother  you are not lying  but please believe me when i say i am safe .  since i ve been on erythro  i ve been happy .  i never was happy on rotor .    genarr said   and why are you happy .     i don t know  uncle siever .  but being happy is enough  even when you don t know why  isn t it .         .      you look tired  eugenia   said genarr .    not physically  siever .  just tired inside after two months of calculations .  i don t know how it was possible for astronomers in prespatial times to do what they did with nothing more than primitive computers .  for that matter  kepler worked out the laws of planetary motion with nothing more than logarithms  and had to consider himself fortunate that they had just been invented .     pardon a nonastronomer  but i thought that these days  astronomers simply gave their instruments their directions  then went to sleep and  after a few hours  woke up and found everything printed up neatly and waiting at the desk .     i wish .  but this job was different .  do you know how precisely i had to clculate the actual velocity of nemesis and the sun relative to each other  so that i could know exactly where and when the two made their closest approach .  do you know how tiny an error would be sufficient to make it seem that nemesis would do earth no harm when it would really destroy it  and vice versa .    it would be bad enough   insignia went on intensely   if nemesis and the sun were the only two bodies in the universe  but there are nearby stars  all of them moving .  at least a dozen of them are massive enough to have a tiny effect on nemesis or the sun or both .  tiny  but large enough to mount up to an error of millions of kilometers one way or another  if ignored .  and in order to get it right  you have to know the mass of each star with considerable precision  and its position  and its velocity .    it s a fifteen body problem  siever  enormously complicated .  nemesis will go right through the solar system and have a perceptible effect on several of the planets .  a lot depends on the actual position of each planet in its orbit as nemesis passes through  of course  and by how much it will shift under the influence of nemesis  gravity  and how this shift will affect its pull on the other planets .  and  by the way  the effect of megas also has to be calculated .    genarr listened gravely .    and what s the bottom line  eugenia .     as it happens  i believe the effect will be to make earth s orbit a trifle more eccentric than it is now and the semimajor axis a bit smaller than it is now .     which means .     which means that earth will become too hot to be habitable .     and what will happen to megas and erythro .     nothing measurable .  the nemetic system is much smaller than the solar system and therefore is held together more tightly .  nothing here will budge significantly  but earth will .     when will this happen .     in five thousand and twenty four years  plus or minus fifteen  nemesis will reach the point of closest approach .  the effect will spread itself out over twenty or thirty years as nemesis and the sun approach and separate .     are there going to be any collisions or anything like that .     almost zero chance of anything significant .  no collisions between any major bodies .  of course  a solar asteroid might strike erythro  or a nemetic asteroid might strike the earth .  there would be a very small chance of that  though it would be catastrophic for earth if it happened .  there s no chance of calculating that  however  until the stars are very close to each other .     but  in any case  earth will have to be evacuated .  is that it .     oh yes .     but they ve got five thousand years to do it in .     five thousand years is none too long to arrange for the evacuation of eight billion people .  they should be warned .     won t they find out for themselves  even if they aren t warned .     who knows when .  and even if they find out soon  we should give them the technique of hyper assistance .  they will have to have it .     i m sure they will have that on their own  too  and perhaps in not too long a time .     and if they don t .     i m also sure that within a century or less  communication will be established between rotor and earth .  after all  if we have hyper assistance for transportation  we will have it for communication eventually .  or we will send a settlement back to earth and there will still be time .     you talk like pitt .    genarr chuckled .   he can t be wrong all the time  you know .     he won t want to communicate .  i know it .     he can t always have his way either .  we have a dome here on erythro  though he opposed it .  and even if we don t beat him on that  he ll be dead eventually .  really  eugenia  don t worry excessively about earth at this moment .  we have nearer concerns .  does marlene know you are about done .     how can she fail to know .  apparently  the exact state of my progress is imprinted on the way i swish my sleeve or comb my hair .     she s getting ever more perceptive  isn t she .     yes .  have you noticed that  too .     indeed i have .  just in the short time i ve known her .     i suppose part of it is due to her growing older .  she s growing perception  perhaps  the way she s growing breasts .  then  too  she spent most of her life trying to hide her ability because she didn t know what to make of it  and because it got her into trouble .  now that she s not afraid  it s out and expanding  so to speak .     or because  for some reason  as she says  she likes being on erythro and her pleasure extends her perceptions .    insigna said   i have had a thought about this  siever .  i don t wish to pester you with my follies .  i do tend to accumulate worries about marlene  about earth  about everythingdo you suppose that erythro is affecting her .  i mean  adversely .  do you suppose that a touch of the plague is taking the form of making her even more perceptive .     i don t know that that question can be answered  eugenia  but if her heightened perception is the effect of the plague  it doesn t seem to bother her mental balance at all .  and i can tell you this  none of those who suffered from the plague in all our stay here showed any symptoms remotely like eugenia s gift .    insigna heaved a sigh .   thank you .  you re comforting .  and thank you  too  for being so gentle and friendly with marlene .    genarr s mouth quirked in a small lopsided smile .   it s easy .  i m very fond of her .     you make that sound so natural .  she s not a likable girl .  i know that  even if i m her mother .     i find her likable .  i ve always preferred brains to beauty in women   unless i could get both  as in your case  eugenia      twenty years ago  maybe   said eugenia with another sigh .    my eyes have aged with your body  eugenia .  they see no change .  but it doesn t matter to me that marlene is not beautiful .  she s fearfully intelligent  even apart from her perception .     yes  there is that .  it consoles me even when she is most burdensome .     well  as to that  i m afraid marlene will continue to be a burden  eugenia .    insigna looked up sharply .   in what way .     she has made it plain to me that being in the dome is not enough .  she wants to be out there  out on the soil of the world itself just as soon as you are done with your work .  she insists .    and insigna stared at him in horror .       eighteen  superluminal       .     three years on earth had aged tessa wendel .  her complexion had coarsened a bit .  she had put on some weight .  there was the beginning of jowls and dark patches under her eyes .  her breasts had grown a shade pendulous and her waist had thickened .   crile fisher knew that tessa was in her late forties now  that she was five years older than he was .  but she did not look older than her years .  she was still a fine mature figure of a woman  as he had heard someone refer to her   but she would no longer pass for a woman in her thirties  as she might easily have done when he had first met her at adelia .   tessa was aware of it  too  and had spoken of it bitterly to him only the week before .    it s you  crile   she had said one night when they were in bed together  a time when  apparently  she was most conscious of aging  .   the fault is yours .  you sold me on earth .   magnificent   you said .   enormous   you said .   variety .  always something new .  inexhaustible .       and isn t it .   he said  knowing what she found objectionable  but willing to let her vent her feelings once again .    not where gravity is concerned .  allover this entire bloated  impossible planet  you have the same gravitational pull .  up in the air  down in a mine  here  there  everywhere  one g  one g  one g .  it should kill you all out of sheer boredom .     we know no better  tessa .     you know better .  you ve been on settlements .  there you can pick your gravitational pull to suit yourself .  you can exercise at low gravity .  you can lighten the strain on your tissues now and then .  how can you jive without that .     we exercise here on earth  too .     oh please  you do it with that pull  that eternal pull  yanking down on you .  you spend all your time fighting it instead of letting your muscles interplay .  you can t leap  you can t fly  you can t soar .  you can t let yourself drop into the greater pull or rise into the lesser one .  and that pull  pull  pull drags every bit of you down  so that you sag and wrinkle and age .  look at me .  look at me .     i look at you as often as i can   said fisher solemnly .    don t look at me  then .  if you do  you ll throw me over .  and if you do that  i ll go back to adelia .     no  you won t .  what will you do there after you ve exercised at low gravity .  your research work  your laboratories  your team are all here .     i ll start over and build a new team .     and will adelia support you in the style to which you are now accustomed .  of course not .  you ll have to admit that earth is not stinting you  that you are getting all you want .  wasn t i right .     weren t you right .  traitor .  you didn t tell me that earth had hyper assistance .  you also didn t tell me that they had discovered the neighbor star .  in fact  you let me pontificate on the uselessness of rotor s far probe and never once told me that it had discovered anything more than a few parallaxes .  you sat there and laughed at me  like the heartless wretch you are .     i would have told you  tessa  but what if you had decided not to come to earth .  it was not my secret to give you .     but after i came to earth .     as soon as you got to work  actually to work  we told you .     they told me  and left me feeling stunned and foolish .  you might have given me just a hint so that i wouldn t come off like such an idiot .  i should have killed you  but what could i do .  you re addictive .  you knew you were when you heartlessly seduced me into coming to earth .    that was a game she insisted on playing  and fisher knew his role .  he said   seduced you .  you insisted .  you wouldn t have it any other way .     you liar .  you forced yourself on me .  it was rape  impure and complex .  and you re going to do it again .  i can see it in those dreadful  lust filled eyes .    it had been months since she had played that particular game and fisher knew it came when she was satisfied with herself professionally .  he said afterward   have you made progress .     progress .  i think you can call it that .   she was panting .   i have a demonstration that i ve set up for tomorrow for your decaying and ancient earthman  tanayama .  he s been pushing for it mercilessly .     he s a merciless fellow .     he s a stupid fellow .  you d think that even if a society doesn t know science  they would know something about science  about how it works .  if they give you a million global credits in the morning  they shouldn t expect anything definite by evening the same day .  they should at least wait till the next morning and give you the whole night to work in .  do you know what he said to me last time we spoke  when i said i might have something to show him .     no  you hadn t told me .  what did he say .     you d think he d say   it s amazing that in a mere three years you ve worked out something so astonishing and new .  we must give you enormous credit and the weight of gratitude we feel toward you is immeasurable .   that s what you would think he would say .     no  not in a million years would i think that tanayama would say anything like that .  what did he say .     he said   so you have something finally  after three years .  i should hope so .  how long do you think i have to live .  do you think i have been supporting you  and paying for you and feeding you an army of assistants and workers in order to have you produce something after i m dead and can t see it .   that s what he did say  and i tell you i would like to delay the demonstration till he is dead  for my own satisfaction  but i suppose that the work comes first .     do you really have something that will satisfy him .     only superluminal flight .  true superluminal flight  not that hyper assistance nonsense .  we now have something that will open the door to the universe .         .     the site where tessa wendel s research team labored  intent on shaking the universe  had been prepared for her even before she had been recruited and come to earth .  it was inside a vast mountainous redoubt that was totally off limits to earth s teeming population  and in it a veritable city of research had been built .   and now tanayama was there  seated in a motorized chair .  only his eyes  behind their narrowed lids  seemed alive  sharp  glancing this way and that .   he was by no means the highest figure in earth s government  not even the highest figure then present  but he had been  and still was  the force behind the project and all automatically gave way to him .   only wendel seemed unintimidated .   his voice was a rustling whisper .   what will i see  doctor .  a ship .    there was no ship in view  of course .   wendel said   no ship  director .  ships are years away .  i have only a demonstration  but it is an exciting one .  you will see the first public demonstration of true superluminal flight  something that is far beyond hyper assistance .     how am i going to see that .     it was my understanding  director  that you have been briefed .   tanayama coughed wrackingly and had to pause to catch his breath .   they tried to talk to me   he said   but i want it from you .   his eyes  baleful and hard  were fixed on her .   you re in charge   he said .   it is your scheme .  explain .     i can t explain the theory .  that would take too long  director .  it would tire you .     i want no theory .  what am i going to see .     what you are going to see are two cubical glass containers .  both contain a hard vacuum .     why a vacuum .     superluminal flight can only be initiated in a vacuum  director .  otherwise the object made to move faster than light drags matter with it  increasing energy expenditures and decreasing controllability .  it must end in a vacuum  too  or else the results can be catastrophic because      never mind the  because .   if this superluminal flight of yours must begin and end in a vacuum  how do we make use of it .     it is necessary  first  to move out into outer space by ordinary flight and then move into hyperspace and stay there .  you arrive near your destination and move out into ordinary space  and then make the final move by ordinary flight .     that takes time .     even superluminal flight can t be done instantaneously  but if you can move from the solar system to a star forty light years away in forty days rather than forty years  it would be ungrateful to grumble over the time lapse .     all right  then .  you have these two cubical glass containers .  what of them .     they are holographic projections .  actually  they are three thousand kilometers apart through the body of the earth  each in a mountain fastness .  if light could travel from one to the other through unobstructed vacuum  it would take that light fully       th of a second  one millisecond  to make the passage .  we re not going to use light  of course .  suspended in the middle of the cube at the left  held in space by a powerful magnetic field  is a small sphere  which is actually a tiny hyperatomic motor .  do you see it  director .     i see something there   said tanayama .   is that all you have .     if you will watch carefully  you will see that it will disappear .  the countdown is progressing .    it was a whisper in each person s ear  and  at zero  the sphere was gone from one cube and present in the other .    remember   said wendel   those cubes are really three thousand kilometers apart .  the timing mechanism shows that the duration between the departure and the arrival was a little over ten microseconds  which means that the passage took place at almost a hundred times the speed of light .    tanayama looked up .   how can i tell .  the whole thing could be a trick designed to fool someone you believe to be a gullible old man .      director   said wendel sternly .   there are hundreds of scientists here  all with reputations  a number of them earthmen .  they will show you anything you want to see  explain how the instruments work .  you will find nothing here but honest science done well .     even if all is as you say  what does it mean .  a little ball .  a ping pong ball  traveling a few thousand kilometers .  is that what you have after three years .     what you have seen is perhaps more than anyone had a right to expect  director  with all due respect .  what you have seen may be the size of a ping pong ball  and it may have traveled no more than three thousand kilometers  but it is true superluminal flight just as much as if we had moved a starship from here to arcturus at a hundred times the speed of light .  what you have seen is the first public demonstration of true superluminal flight in human history .     but it s the starship i want to see .     for that you will have to wait .     i have no time .  i have no time   rasped tanayama in a voice that was nothing more than a hoarse whisper .  a fit of coughing shook him again .   and wendel said in a low voice that perhaps only tanayama heard   even your will cannot move the universe .         .     the three days devoted to officialdom in what was unofficially known as hyper city had passed grindingly  and now the interlopers were gone .    even so   said tessa wendel to crile fisher   it will take two or three more days to recover and get back to work with full intensity .   she looked haggard and intensely displeased as she said   what a vile old man .    fisher had no trouble divining the reference to be to tanayama .   he s a sick old man .    wendel shot an angry look at him .    are you defending him .     just stating a fact  tessa .    she lifted a finger in admonishment .   i am quite certain that that miserable relic was as irrational and unreasonable in days past when he was not sick  or  for that matter  when he was not old .  how long has he been director of the office .     he s a fixture .  over thirty years .  and before that he was chief deputy for almost as long and probably the real power behind a succession of three or four figurehead directors .  and no matter how old or sick he gets  he ll stay director till he dies  maybe for three days afterward  while people wait to make sure he doesn t rise from the dead .     i gather you think this is funny .     no  but what can you do but laugh at the spectacle of a man who  without open power  without even being known to the general public  has kept everyone in the government in fear and subjection for nearly half a century simply because he has firm control over everyone s disreputable secrets and would not hesitate to make use of them .     and they endure him .     oh yes .  there s not a person in the government who has ever been willing to sacrifice his own career with certainty  merely on the chance of bringing down tanayama .     even now when his hold on matters must be growing tenuous .     you re making a mistake .  his grip may fail with death  but until his actual death that grip of his will never be tenuous .  it will be the last that goes  sometime after his heart stops .     what drives people so .   asked wendel with distaste .   is there no desire to let go early enough to have a chance to die in peace .     not tanayama .  never .  i wouldn t say i m an intimate of his  but in fifteen years or so  i have made contact with him now and then  never without being badly bruised in the process .  i knew him when he was still vigorous  and i always knew he would never stop .  to answer your earlier question  different things drive different people  but in tanayama s case  it s hatred .     i should think so   said wendel .   it shows .  no one that hateful can fail to hate .  but who does tanayama hate .     the settlements .     oh  he does .   wendel was obviously remembering that she was a settler from adelia .   i ve never heard a settler say a kind word for earth either .  and you know my feelings for anyplace without variable gravity .     i m not talking dislike  tessa  or distaste or contempt .  i m talking blind scarlet hatred .  almost any earthman dislikes the settlements .  they have all the latest .  they re quiet  uncrowded  comfortable  middle class .  they have ample food  ample recreation  no bad weather  no poor .  they have robots that are kept smoothly out of sight .  it s only natural for people who consider themselves deprived to dislike those who seem to have everything .  but with tanayama  it s active boiling hatred .  i think he would like to see the settlements destroyed  everyone .     why  crile .     my own theory is that what gets him is none of the things i have listed .  what he can t stand is the cultural homogeneity of the settlements .  do you know what i mean .     no .     the people of the settlements select themselves .  they select people like themselves .  there s a shared culture  even  to some extent  a shared physical appearance on each settlement .  earth  on the other hand  is  and through all of history has been  a wild mixture of cultures  all enriching each other  competing with each other  suspicious of each other .  tanayama and many other earthmen  myself  for instance  consider such a mixture to be a source of strength  and feel that cultural homogeneity on the settlements weakens them and  in the long run  shortens their potential life span .     well  then  why hate the settlements for possessing something you consider a disadvantage to them .  does tanayama hate us for being better off and for being worse off .  it doesn t make sense .     it doesn t have to .  who would bother hating  if it had to be reasoned out into sensibleness first .  perhaps  just perhaps  tanayama is afraid that the settlements will succeed too well and will prove cultural homogeneity to be a good thing after all .  or perhaps he thinks that the settlements are as anxious to destroy the earth as he himself is to destroy the settlements .  the matter of the neighbor star infuriated him .     the fact that rotor discovered the neighbor star and did not inform the rest of us .     more than that .  they did not bother to warn us that it was speeding toward the solar system .     they might not have known  i suppose .     tanayama would never believe that .  i m sure that he feels that they knew and deliberately refused to warn us  hoping that we would be caught unprepared  and that earth  or at least earth s civilization  would be destroyed .     has it been decided that the neighbor star will approach closely enough to damage us .  i haven t heard that .  it s my understanding that most astronomers think it will pass at a great enough distance to leave us substantially untouched .  have you heard differently .    fisher shrugged .   no  i haven t  but i think it feeds tanayama s hatred to believe that there is danger here .  and from that  you move logically to the notion that superluminal flight is what we must have in order to locate an earth like world elsewhere .  then we can transfer as much of earth s population as possible to that other world  if the worst comes to worst .  you ll have to admit that s sensible .     it is  but you don t have to imagine destruction  crile .  it is a natural feeling that humanity ought to spread outward even if earth remains perfectly safe .  we ve moved out to the settlements and reaching for the stars is a logical next step  and for that next step  we must have superluminal travel .     yes  but tanayama would find that a cold view .  the colonization of the galaxy is something i m sure he is willing to leave to generations to come .  what he wants for himself is to find rotor and punish it for having abandoned the solar system without regard for the rest of the human community .  he wants to live to see that and that s why he keeps pushing you  tessa .     he can push all he wants  and it won t help him .  he s a dying man .     i wonder .  modern medical procedures can perform marvels and i m sure the doctors will go all out for tanayama .     even modern medicine can only go so far .  i asked the doctors .     and they answered .  i would have supposed that the question of tanayama s health was a state secret .     not to me  under the circumstances  crile .  i went to the medical team that attended the old man here and told them that i was anxious to build an actual ship capable of carrying human beings to the stars  and that i wanted to do so before tanayama died .  i asked them how much time i had .     and what did they say .     i had a year .  that s what they said .  at the most .  they urged me to hurry .     can you do it in one year .     in one year .  of course not  crile  and i m glad of it .  i find pleasure in the fact that that poisonous person won t live to see it .  what are you making faces about  crile .  does it bother you that i make so cruel a remark .     it s a petty remark  anyway  tessa .  that old man  however poisonous  has done all this .  he s made hyper city possible .     yes  but for his own purposes  not mine .  and not earth s or humanity s .  and i m allowed to have my pettiness  too .  i am sure that director tanayama never once pitied anyone he considered his enemy or lightened the pressure of his foot on that enemy s throat by a dyne .  and i imagine he doesn t expect pity or mercy from anyone else .  he would probably despise  as a weakling  anyone who offered it .    fisher still looked unhappy .   how long will it take  tessa .     how can anyone say .  it might take forever .  even if everything broke reasonably well  i don t see how it could take less than five years at the least .     but why .  you already have superluminal flight .    wendel sat up straight .   no  crile .  don t be naive .  all i have is a laboratory demonstration .  i can take a light object  a ping pong ball   in which a tiny hyperatomic motor makes up    percent of the mass  and move it superluminally .  a ship  however  with people aboard  is a totally different thing .  we ll have to be certain  and for that five years is optimistic .  i tell you that before the days of modern computers and the kind of simulations they make possible  five years would be an unrealizable dream .  even fifty years might have been .    crile fisher shook his head  and said nothing .   tessa wendel watched him thoughtfully  then said  almost testily   what s the matter with you .  are you in such a great hurry also .    fisher said soothingly   i m sure you re as anxious to get this done as anyone  but i do long for a practical hyperspatial ship .     you  more than someone else .     i  quite a bit .     why .     i d like to go to the neighbor star .    she glared at him .   why .  are you dreaming of reuniting with the wife you abandoned .    fisher had never discussed eugenia with tessa wendel in any detail  and he had no intention of being trapped into it now .   he said   i have a daughter out there .  i think you can understand that  tessa .  you have a son .    so she did .  he was in his early twenties  attending adelia university  and he occasionally wrote his mother .   wendel s face softened .   crile   she said   you mustn t allow yourself false hopes in this .  i ll grant you that since they knew about the neighbor star  that s where they went .  with merely hyper assistance  however  the trip must have taken over two years .  we can t be sure that rotor survived such a trip .  and even if they did  the chances of finding a suitable planet around a red dwarf star is just about zero .  having survived that far  they might then have traveled on in search of a suitable planet .  where .  and how would we find them .     i imagine they knew there was no hope for a suitable planet around the neighbor star .  wouldn t they have been prepared  therefore  simply to put rotor into a suitable orbit around the star .     even if they survived the flight  and even if they went into orbit around the star  it would be a sterile life  and there might be no possibility of continuing it for long in any form compatible with civilization .  crile  you ve got to steel yourself .  what if we manage to organize the expedition to the neighbor star and find nothing at all  or at most  the empty hulk of what is left of rotor .    fisher said   in that case  that would be that .  but surely there must be a chance that they survived .     and that you ll find your child .  dear crile  is it safe to build your hopes on that .  even if rotor survived and your child survived  she was only one year old when you left her and that was in     .  if she appeared before you right now as she now is  she d be ten years old  and if we went out to the neighbor star at the earliest practical moment  she would be fifteen .  she wouldn t know you .  for that matter  you wouldn t know her .     ten years old  or fifteen  or fifty .  if i saw her  tessa  i would know her   said fisher .       nineteen  remaining       .     marlene smiled hesitantly at siever genarr .  she had grown used to invading his office at will .    am i interrupting you at a busy time  uncle siever .     no  dear  this is not really a busy job .  it was devised so that pitt could get rid of me  and i took it and kept it so that i could be rid of pitt .  it s not something i would admit to everyone  but i m compelled to tell you the truth since you always spot the lie .     does that frighten you  uncle siever .  it frightened commissioner pitt  and it would have frightened aurinel  if i had ever let him see what i could do .     it doesn t frighten me  marlene  because i ve given up  you see .  i ve just made up my mind that i m made of glass as far as you re concerned .  actually  it s restful .  lying is hard work when you stop to think about it .  if people were really lazy  they d never lie .    marlene smiled again .   is that why you like me .  because i make it possible for you to be lazy .     can t you tell .     no .  i can tell you like me  but i can t tell why you like me .  the way you hold yourself shows you like me  but the reason is hidden inside your mind and all i can get about that are vague feelings sometimes .  i can t quite reach in there .   she thought for a while .   sometimes i wish i could .     be glad you can t .  minds are dirty  dank  uncomfortable places .     why do you say that  uncle siever .     experience .  i don t have your natural ability  but i ve been around people for much longer than you have .  do you like the inside of your own mind  marlene .    marlene looked surprised .   i don t know .  why shouldn t i .     do you like everything you think .  everything you imagine .  every impulse you have .  be honest  now .  even though i can t read you  be honest .     well  sometimes i think silly things  or mean things .  sometimes i get angry and think of doing things i wouldn t really do .  but not often  really .     not often .  don t forget that you re used to your own mind .  you hardly sense it .  it s like the clothes you wear .  you don t feel the touch of them because you re so used to their being there .  your hair curls down the back of your neck  but you don t notice .  if someone else s hair touched the back of your neck  it would itch and be unbearable .  someone else s mind might think thoughts no worse than yours  but they would be someone else s thoughts and you wouldn t like them .  for instance  you might not like my liking you  if you knew why i liked you .  it is much better and more peaceful to accept my liking you as something that exists  and not scour my mind for reasons .    and inevitably  marlene said   why .  what are the reasons .     well  i like you because once i was you .     what do you mean .     i don t mean i was a young lady with beautiful eyes and the gift of perception .  i mean that i was young and thought i was plain and that everyone disliked me for being plain .  and i knew i was intelligent  and i couldn t understand why everyone didn t like me for being intelligent .  it seemed unfair to be scorned for a bad property while a good property was ignored .    i was hurt and angry  marlene  and made up my mind that i would never treat others as people treated me  but i haven t had much chance to put that good resolution into practice .  then i met you  and you come close .  you re not as plain as i was by far  and you re much more intelligent than i ever was  but i don t mind your being better than me .   he smiled very broadly .   it s like giving myself a second chance  with advantages .  but come  i don t think that is what you came to talk to me about .  i may not be perceptive in your sense  but i can tell that much .     well  it s my mother .     oh .   genarr frowned with a sudden obvious and almost painful increase in interest .   what about her .     she s just about finished her project here  you know .  if she goes back to rotor  she ll want me to go back with her .  must i .     i think so .  don t you want to .     no  i don t  uncle siever .  i feel it s important that i stay here .  so what i would like you to do is to tell commissioner pitt that you would like to keep us here .  you can make up an excuse that sounds good .  and the commissioner  i m pretty sure  will be quite glad to have us stay  especially if you explain that mother has found out that nemesis will destroy earth .     has she told you that  marlene .     no  she didn t  but she didn t have to .  you can explain to the commissioner that mother will probably annoy him continually with her insistence that the solar system be warned .     has it occurred to you that pitt would not be keen on obliging me .  if he gets the idea i want to keep eugenia and you here in the erythro dome  he s liable to order you back to rotor just to annoy me .     i m quite sure   said marlene calmly   that the commissioner would much rather please himself by keeping us here  than displease you by taking us back .  besides  you want mother here because you re   you re fond of her .     very fond of her .  all my life  it seems .  but your mother s not fond of me .  you told me quite a while ago that your father still occupies her thoughts .     she likes you more and more  uncle siever .  she likes you a great deal .     liking is not loving  marlene .  i m sure you ve already discovered that .    marlene reddened .   i m talking about old people .     like me   and genarr leaned his head back and laughed .  then he said   i m sorry  marlene .  it s just that old people always think young people haven t really learned about love  and young people think that old people have forgotten about love  and  you know  they re both wrong .  and why do you think it s important to stay in the erythro dome  marlene .  surely not just because you like me .     of course i like you   said marlene seriously .   very much .  but i want to stay here because i like erythro .     i ve explained that it s a dangerous world .     not for me .     you re still certain that the plague won t affect you .     of course it won t .     but how do you know .     i just know .    i ve always known this  even when i was on rotor .  i had no reason not to .     no  you didn t .  but after you were told about the plague .     that didn t change things .  i feel completely safe here .  even more than on rotor .    genarr shook his head slowly .   i must admit that i don t understand this .   he studied her solemn face  her dark eyes half hidden by those magnificent lashes .   however  let me read your body language  marlene  if i can .  you mean to have your own way in this  at whatever cost  and to remain on erythro .     yes   said marlene flatly .   and i expect you to help me .         .     eugenia insigna blazed quietly with anger .  her voice was not loud  but it was intense .   he can t do this  siever .     of course he can  eugenia   said genarr just as quietly .   he s the commissioner .     but he s not an absolute ruler .  i have my citizen s rights  and one of them is freedom of movement .     if the commissioner wishes to establish a state of emergency  either general  or  for that matter  confined to one person  then citizen s rights are suspended .  that s more or less the gist of what the enabling act of     says .     but it makes a mockery of all the laws and traditions we have  dating back to rotor s establishment .     i agree .     and if i make an outcry over this  pitt will find himself      eugenia  please .  listen to me .  let it go .  for now  why don t you and marlene simply stay here .  you re more than welcome .     what are you saying .  this amounts to imprisonment without accusation  without trial  without judgment .  we are compelled to stay in erythro indefinitely by the arbitrary ukase      please do it without objection .  it will be better .     how better .   insigna spoke with infinite contempt .    because marlene  your daughter  is very anxious that you do so .   insigna looked blank .   marlene .     last week she came to me full of suggestions that i maneuver the commissioner into ordering the two of you to remain here on erythro .    insigna half rose from her seat  wildly indignant .    and you actually did it .    genarr shook his head vigorously .   no .  now listen to me .  all i did was to inform pitt that your work here was finished and that i was uncertain whether it was his intention to have you return to rotor with marlene or to stay here .  it was a perfectly neutral statement  eugenia .  i showed it to marlene before i sent it off and she was satisfied .  she said  and i quote   if you give him the choice  he will keep us here .   and  apparently  he s doing that .    insigna sank back .   siever  are you really following the advice of a fifteen year old girl .     i don t think of marlene as merely a fifteen year old girl .  but tell me  why are you so anxious to go back to rotor .     my work      there is none .  there will be none if pitt doesn t want you .  even assuming he allows you to return  you d find yourself replaced .  here  on the other hand  you ll find equipment you can use  that you have used .  you came here  after all  to do what could not be done on rotor .     my work doesn t matter .   cried out insigna with sweeping inconsistency .   don t you see that i want to return for the same reason that he wants me to stay .  he wants marlene destroyed .  if i had known  before i left  of this erythro plague  we d never have come .  i can t risk marlene s mind .     her mind is the last thing i d want to risk   said genarr .   i would sooner risk myself .     but it is at risk if we stay here .     marlene doesn t think so .     marlene .  marlene .  you seem to think she s a goddess .  what does she know .     listen to me  eugenia .  let s talk about this rationally .  if it really seemed that marlene was in danger  i would get you both back to rotor somehow  but listen to me first .  there s nothing megalomaniacal about marlene  is there .    insigna was trembling .  her passion had not receded .   i don t know what you mean .     is she prone to making grandiose claims that are fanciful  that are patently ridiculous .     of course not .  she s a very sensible  why do you ask these questions .  you know that she makes no claims that aren t      that aren t substantiated .  i know .  she never boasted about her perceptivity .  it was more or less forced out of her by circumstance .     yes  but what is the purpose of all this .   genarr kept on  quietly .   has she ever laid claim to having strange intuitive powers .  has she ever expressed herself as certain that something  some particular something  was sure to happen  or was sure not to happen  for no reason other than that she was certain .     no  of course not .  she clings to evidence .  she doesn t make wild claims without evidence .     yet in one respect  perhaps only in one respect  she does .  she is certain that the plague cannot touch her .  she claims that she experienced this utter confidence  this certainty that erythro cannot harm her  even on rotor  and that it grew stronger when she reached the dome .  she is quite determined  completely determined  to remain here .    insigna s eyes widened and her hand flew to her mouth .  she made an inarticulate sound and then said   in that case    and remained staring at him .    yes   genarr said in sudden alarm .   don t you see it .  isn t this the plague striking .  her personality is changing .  her mind is being affected .    genarr sat frozen at the thought for a moment  then he said   no  it can t be .  in all the cases of plague  nothing like this has been detected .  this is not the plague .     her mind is different from those of others .  it would be affected differently .      no   said genarr desperately .   i can t believe that .  i won t believe that .  i believe that if marlene says she is certain she is immune  that she is immune  and that her immunity will help us solve the puzzle of the plague .    insigna s face whitened .   is that why you want her here on erythro  siever .  to use her as a tool against the plague .     no .  i don t want her here only to use her .  nevertheless  she wants to stay and she may be a tool  quite apart from whether we want her to be one or not .     and just because she wants to remain on erythro  you are willing to allow her to do so .  just because she wants to stay out of some perverse desire she can t explain and in which you and i can see no reason or logic .  you seriously think she should be allowed to remain here merely because she wishes to .  do you dare tell me that .    genarr said with an effort    as a matter of fact  i am tempted in that direction .     it is easy for you to be tempted .  she is not your child .  she is my child .  she is the only      i know    said genarr .   she is the only thing you have left of  crile .  don t stare at me like that .  i know that you have never overcome your loss .  i understand how you feel .   he said this last softly  gently  and looked as if he wanted to reach out and touch insigna s bowed head .    just the same  eugenia  if marlene really wants to explore erythro  i think nothing will stop her from doing so in the end .  and if she is absolutely convinced that the plague will not touch her mind  perhaps that mental attitude will prevent it from doing so .  marlene s aggressive sanity and confidence may be her mental immune mechanism .    insigna snapped her head up  her eyes smoldering .   you are speaking nonsense  and you have no right to give in to this sudden streak of romanticism in a mere child .  she is a stranger to you .  you do not love her .     she is no stranger to me and i do love her .  more important  i admire her .  love would not give me that depth of confidence that would permit the risk  but admiration would .  think about it .    and they sat there  staring at each other .       twenty  proof       .     kattimoro tanayama  with his accustomed tenacity  lived out the year he had been allotted  and was well into another year before his long battle was over .  when the time came  he left the field of battle without a word or sign  so that the instruments recorded death before any onlooker could see it had come .   it made little stir on earth and none at all in the settlements  for the old man had always done his work outside the public eye and had been all the stronger for it .  it was those who dealt with him who knew his power  and those who most depended on his strength and policy who were the most relieved to see him go .   the news reached tessa wendel early  by the special channel set up between her headquarters and world city .  somehow  the fact that it had been expected for months did not ease the shock .   what would happen now .  who would succeed tanayama and what changes would be made .  she had been speculating on the matter for a long time  but it was only now that the questions seemed to have real meaning .  obviously  despite everything  wendel  and perhaps all who were involved  had not really expected the old man to die .   she turned for comfort to crile fisher .  wendel was realistic enough to know that it was not her now clearly middle aged body  in less than two months  she would be reaching an incredible fifty  that held fisher .  he was forty three now and the bloom of youth had become somewhat overblown there  too  but it wasn t as obvious in a man .  in any case  he was held  and she could still make herself feel that it was she who held him  figuratively  especially on those occasions when she held him  literally .   she said to fisher   well  now what .   fisher said   it s no surprise  tessa .  it should have happened before this .     granted  but it s happened now .  it was his blind determination that kept this project going .  now what .    fisher said   as long as he was alive  you were eager for him to die .  now you are concerned .  but i don t think you need worry .  the project will continue .  something this size has a life of its own and it can t be stopped .     have you ever tried to calculate how much this has cost  crile .  there ll be a new director of the terrestrial board of inquiry and the global congress will certainly pick someone they can control .  there ll be no new tanayama before whom they must all cower  not in the foreseeable future .  and then they ll look at their budget and  without tanayama s gnarled hand covering it  they will see it is meters deep in red ink  and they ll want to cut it back .     how can they .  they ve spent so much already .  are they to stop with nothing to show for it .  that would really be a fiasco .     they can blame it on tanayama .   he was a madman   they ll say   an egomaniac  driven by an obsession   all of which is true to a considerable extent  as we both know  and now they  who were not responsible for any of this  can return earth to sanity and abandon something the planet can t really afford .    fisher smiled .   tessa  my love  your penetration of the manner of political thinking is probably par for a first class hyperspatialist genius .  the director of the office is  in theory  and in public perception  an appointed official of narrow powers who is supposedly under the thorough control of the president general and the global congress .  these supposedly powerful officials  who are elected  cannot make it plain that tanayama ruled them all and had them cowering in corners  afraid to let their hearts beat without his permission .  they would reveal themselves to be cowards and incapable weaklings  and they would risk losing their positions at the next election .  they will have to continue the project .  they will make cosmetic cuts only .     how can you be so sure .   muttered wendel .    long experience at watching elected officialdom  tessa .  besides  if we stop short  we re just inviting all the settlements to get it before we do  to move out into deep space and leave us behind the way rotor did .     oh .  how will they do that .     given their knowledge of hyper assistance  wouldn t you say that an advance to superluminal flight is inevitable .    wendel looked at fisher sardonically .   crile  my love  your penetration of hyperspatialism is probably par for a first class wheedler of secrets .  is that what you think of my work .  that it is an inevitable consequence of hyper assistance .  haven t you grasped the fact that hyper assistance is a natural consequence of relativistic thinking .  it still doesn t allow travel faster than the speed of light .  to move on to superluminal velocities requires a true leap in both thought and practice .  it would not come naturally  and i have explained this to various people in the government .  they complained about the slowness and the expense  and i had to explain the difficulties .  they ll remember this now and they won t be afraid to stop us at this point .  i can t whip them onward by suddenly telling them that we may be outraced .    fisher shook his head .   of course you can tell them that .  and they ll believe you  too  because it will be true .  we can be easily overtaken .     haven t you listened to what i ve said .     i have  but you re leaving something out .  allow a little for common sense  especially from someone you ve just called a first class wheedler of secrets .     what are you talking about  crile .     this vast leap from hyper assistance to superluminal flight is only a vast leap if one begins at the beginning  as you did .  the settlements  however  are not beginning at the beginning .  do you really think they know nothing at all about our project  about hyper city .  do you think that i and my earthly colleagues are the only wheedlers of secrets in the solar system .  the settlers have their wheedlers  who work just as hard as we do and just as effectively .  for one thing  they ve known you were on earth almost from the day you arrived here .     what if they knew .     just this .  do you think they don t have computers that will tell them you have written and published papers in the field .  do you think they don t have access to those papers .  do you think they haven t read them painstakingly and carefully and that they haven t found out you think that superluminal speeds are theoretically possible .    wendel bit her lip and said   well      yes  think about it .  when you wrote your thoughts on superluminal velocity  you were merely speculating .  you were virtually a minority of one in thinking it might be possible .  no one took it seriously .  but now you come to earth and you stay there .  you suddenly drop from sight and do not return to adelia .  they may not know all the details of what you re doing  for security on this project has been as tight as tanayama s paranoia could make it .  still  the mere fact that you ve disappeared is suggestive and there can t be any possible doubt  in the light of what you ve published  as to what you re working on .     something like hyper city can t be kept a total secret .  the incredible sums of money being invested must leave a noticeable trace .  so every settlement is scrabbling for odds and ends they may be able to convert into bits of knowledge .  and every bit gives them hints that will enable them to progress much more quickly than you were able to .  you tell them all that  tessa  if any question arises over ending the project .  we can and will be overtaken in the race if we stop running .  that thought will keep the new people as fired up over the matter as ever tanayama was  and it all has the merit of being true .    wendel was silent for a considerable time while fisher watched her carefully .    you re right  my dear wheedler of secrets   she said at last .   i made a mistake in thoughtlessly considering you a lover rather than an adviser .     why should the two necessarily be mutually exclusive .   asked fisher .    although   said wendel   i know very well that you have your own motivations in this .     what does that matter   said fisher   even if it s true  provided mine run parallel with yours .         .     a delegation of congressmen eventually arrived  along with igor koropatsky  the new director of the terrestrial board of inquiry .  he had been in subordinate positions at the office for years  so he was not completely unknown to tessa wendel .   he was a quiet man  with smooth  thinning gray hair  a rather bulbous nose  a comfortable double chin  who looked well fed and good natured .  he was shrewd undoubtedly  but he obviously lacked tanayama s almost diseased intensity .  at a full kilometer  you could see that .   congressmen were with him  of course  as though to show that this successor was their property and under their control .  they must surely be hoping it would stay that way .  tanayama had been a long and bitter lesson .   no one suggested that the project be ended .  rather  the concern was that it be hastened  if possible .  wendel s cautious attempt to stress the possibility that the settlements might overtake earth  or be hot on its heels  was accepted without demur  almost dismissed as obvious on the face of it .   koropatsky  who was allowed to be spokesman and to take the responsibility  said   dr .  wendel  i do not ask for a long  formal tour of hyper city .  i have been here before  and it is more important that i spend some time reorganizing the office .  i mean no disrespect to my distinguished predecessor  but any shifting of an important administrative body from one person to another requires a great deal of reorganization  especially if the predecessor s tenure has been a lengthy one .  n ow i am not  by nature  a formal man .  let us  therefore  speak freely and informally  and i will ask some questions which i hope you will answer in a way that a man of my own modest attainments in science will have no trouble in understanding .    wendel nodded .   i will do my best  director .     good .  when do you expect to have a superluminal starship in operation .     you must realize  director  that this is an essentially unanswerable question .  we are at the mercy of unforeseen difficulties and accidents .     assume only reasonable difficulties and no accidents .     in that case  since we have completed the science and need only the engineering  if we are fortunate we will have a ship in three years  perhaps .     you will be ready in       in other words .     certainly not sooner .     how many persons will it carry .     five to seven  perhaps .     how far will it go .     as far as we wish  director .  that is the beauty of superluminal velocity .  because we are passing through hyperspace  where the ordinary laws of physics do not apply  not even the conservation of energy  it costs no more effort to go a thousand light years than to go one .    the director stirred uneasily .   i am not a physicist  but i find it difficult to accept an environment without constraints .  are there not things you cannot do .     there are constraints .  we need a vacuum and a gravitational intensity below a certain point if we are to make the transition into and out of hyperspace .  we will  with experience  undoubtedly find additional restraints which might have to be determined through test flights .  the results might necessitate further delays .     once you have the ship  where will the first flight take you .     it might seem prudent to allow the first trip to go no farther than the planet pluto  for instance  but that might well be considered an unbearable waste of time .  once we have the technology with which to visit the stars  the temptation to actually visit one would be overwhelming .     such as the neighbor star .     that would the logical goal .  ex director tanayama wanted that visited  but i must point out that there are other stars far more interesting .  sirius is only four times as far away and it would give us a chance to observe a white dwarf star at close range .     dr .  wendel  i think that the neighbor star must be the goal  though not necessarily for tanayama s reasons .  suppose you travel far out to some other star  any other star  and return .  how would you prove that you had indeed been in the neighborhood of another star .    wendel looked startled .   prove .  i don t understand you .     i mean  how would you counter accusations that the supposed flight was actually a fake .     a fake .   wendel rose furiously to her feet .   that is insulting .   koropatsky s voice suddenly grew dominating .   sit down  dr .   wendel .  you are being accused of nothing .  i am trying to foresee a situation and to guard against it .  humanity moved into space almost three centuries ago .  it is a not altogether forgotten episode in history and my subdivision of the globe remembers it particularly well .  when the first satellites went up in those dim days of terrestrial confinement  there were those who insisted everything presented by those satellites were fakes .  the first photographs of the far side of the moon were accused of having been faked .  even the first pictures of earth from space were called fakes by some few who believed the earth was flat .  now if earth claims to have superluminal flight  we may run into similar trouble .     why  director .  why should anyone think we would lie about a thing like that .     my dear dr .  wendel  you are naive .  for over three centuries  albert einstein has been the demigod who invented cosmology .  people  for generation after generation  have grown used to the concept of the speed of light as an absolute limit .  they will not readily give it up .  even the principle of causality  and one can t think of anything more basic than that cause must precede effect  seems violated .  that s one thing .    another  dr .  wendel  is that the settlements might find it politically useful to convince their peoples  and earthmen  too  that we are lying .  it will confuse us  involve us in polemics  waste our time  and give them more of a chance to catch up .  so i ask you  is there a simple proof that any flight you might make would be a truly legitimate one .    wendel said icily   director  we would permit scientists to inspect our ship once we return .  we will undertake to explain the techniques used      no no no .  please .  don t go any further .  that would only convince scientists as knowledgeable as yourself .     well then  when we come back we will have photographs of the sky and the nearer stars will be positioned slightly differently with respect to each other .  from the change in relative positions  it will be possible to calculate exactly where we were relative to the sun .     also just for scientists .  completely unconvincing to the average person .     we ll have close up pictures of whatever star we visit .  it will be quite different from our sun in every respect .     but this sort of thing is done in every trivial holovision program dealing with interstellar travel .  it is the small change of the science fiction epic .  it would be no more than a  captain galaxy  program .     in that case   said wendel with teeth clenching exasperation   i don t know of any way .  if people will not believe  then they will not believe .  it is a problem you must handle .  i am only a scientist .     now now  doctor .  keep your temper  please .  when columbus returned from his first trip across the ocean seven and a half centuries ago  no one accused him of fakery .  why .  because he brought back with him native people from the new shores he had visited .     very good  but the chance of finding life bearing worlds and bringing back specimens is very small .     perhaps not .  rotor  you know  is believed to have discovered the neighbor star with their far probe and to have left the solar system soon after that .  since they never returned  it is possible that they traveled to the neighbor star and remained there and  in fact  are still there .     so director tanayama believed .  however  the trip  with hyper assistance  would have taken over two years .  it may be that through accident  through scientific failure  through psychological problems  they never completed the trip .  that  too  would account for their never returning .     nevertheless   said koropatsky  quietly insistent   they may have arrived .     even if they have arrived  they are likely to have simply gone into orbit around the star  in the certain absence of any habitable world .  in isolation  the psychological strains  which didn t stop them en route  would stop them then  and it is likely there is now only a dead settlement whirling the neighbor star forever .     then you now see that it must be the goal because once you re there  you will seek out rotor  alive or dead .  either way  you must bring back something unmistakably rotorian and it would then be very easy for everyone to believe that you had indeed gone out to the stars and come back .   he smiled broadly .   even i would believe it  and that would answer my question as to how you would prove that you had made a superluminal trip .  that will be your mission  then  and for that  never fear  earth will continue to find you the money and resources and workers you will need .    and when after a dinner during which technical points were not raised  koropatsky said to wendel  in the friendliest possible tone  but with more than a hint of ice beneath   just the same  remember that you have only three years to do it in .  at the most .          .      so my clever ploy wasn t really needed   said crile fisher with a slight air of regret .    no .  they were determined to continue without the threat of being overtaken .  the only thing that bothered them  and it was something that never seemed to bother tanayama  was this matter of having to battle possible cases of fakery .  i suppose tanayama just wanted to destroy rotor .  as long as that was done  the world could yell  fake  all it wanted .     they wouldn t .  he would have had the ship bring back something to show him that rotor was destroyed .  that would prove it to the world  too .  what kind of fellow is the new director .     quite the reverse of tanayama .  he seems soft  almost apologetic  but i have a feeling that the global congress is going to find him just as hard to handle as tanayama was .  he has to settle into his job  that s all .     from what you ve told me about the conversation  he seems more sensible than tanayama .     yes  but it still steams me  that suggestion of fakery .  imagine thinking spaceflights would be faked .  it s probably the result of earthmen having no feel for space .  no feel at all .  it s you people having this endless world and  except in a microscopic fraction of cases  never leaving it .    fisher smiled .   well  i m one of the microscopic fraction that has left it .  often .  and you re a settler .  so neither one of us is planetbound .     that s right   said wendel  shooting him a sidelong glance .   sometimes i think you don t remember that i m a settler .     believe me  i never forget it .  i don t go about muttering to myself   tessa is a settler .  tessa is a settler .   but  at all times  i know you are .     does anyone else  though .   she waved her hand around as though to include an indefinite surrounding volume .   here is hyper city under unimaginably tight security and why .  against the settlers .  the whole point is to get out there with practical superluminal flight before the settlers can even get started .  and who is in complete charge of the project .  a settler .     is this the first time you ve thought of that in the five years you ve been on the project .     no  but i think of it periodically .  i just don t understand it .  aren t they afraid to trust me .    fisher laughed .   not really .  you re a scientist .     so .     so scientists are considered mercenaries without ties to anyone society .  give a scientist a fascinating problem and all the money  equipment  and help that he or she needs to tackle that problem  and that scientist wouldn t care who the source of support was .  be truthful  you care neither for earth  nor adelia  nor for the settlements as a whole  nor even for humanity as a whole .  you just want to work out the details of superluminal flight  and you have no loyalties beyond that .    wendel said haughtily   that s a stereotype  and not every scientist will fit it .  i may not fit it .     i m sure they realize that  too  so that you are probably under constant surveillance  tessa .  some of your closest associates probably have  as an important aspect of their work  the constant monitoring of your activities  and the constant reporting to the government .     you re not referring to yourself  i hope .     don t tell me you ve never thought that i might be remaining near you entirely in my role as wheedler of secrets .     as a matter of fact  the idea has occurred to me  now and then .     but it s not my job .  i suspect that i m too close to you to be trusted .  in fact  i m quite sure that i m reported on  too  and that my activity is carefully weighed .  as long as i keep you happy      you re a cold blooded person  crile .  how can you find humor in something like that .     there s no humor there .  i m trying to be realistic .  if you ever tire of me  i lose my function .  an unhappy tessa may be an unproductive tessa  so i will be suddenly gotten out of your hair and the way will be smoothed for my successor .  after all  your contentment is worth far more to them than mine is  and i recognize that it is only sensible that that be the case .  you see my realism .    whereupon wendel reached out suddenly to stroke crile s cheek .   don t worry .  i think i ve grown too used to you to tire of you now .  in the hot blood of my youth  i could grow bored with my men and discard them  but now      it s too much of an effort  eh .     if you choose to think of it that way .  i might also finally be in love  in my way .     i understand your meaning .  love in cool blood can be restful .  but i suspect this is not the proper moment to prove it .  you ll have to chew over this exchange with koropatsky first  and get that poisonous feeling about fakery out of your system .     i ll get over that someday .  but there s another thing .  i told you a little while ago about earthpeople having no feel for space .     yes  i remember .     well  here s an example .  koropatsky has no feeling  no feeling at all  for the sheer size of space .  he talked about going to the neighbor star and finding rotor .  now how is that to be done .  every once in a while  we spot an asteroid and lose it before we can calculate its orbit .  do you know how long it takes to relocate that lost asteroid  even with all our modern devices and instruments .  years sometimes .  space is large  even in the near vicinity of a star  and rotor is small .     yes  but we search for one asteroid among a hundred thousand .  rotor  on the other hand  will be the only object of its kind near the neighbor star .     who told you that .  even if the neighbor star doesn t have a planetary system in our sense  it is extremely unlikely that it won t be surrounded by debris of one sort or another .     but it would be dead debris  like our dead asteroids .  since rotor will be a functioning settlement  it will be emitting a wide range of radiation  and that should be easy to detect .     if rotor is a functioning settlement .  what if it isn t .  then it s just another asteroid and finding it may prove an enormous task .  we may not succeed at all in any reasonable period of time .    fisher could not keep his face from falling into lines of misery .  wendel made a small sound and moved closer to him  placing an arm around his unresponsive shoulder .   oh  my dear  you know the situation .  you must face it .    fisher said in a choked voice   i know .  but they may have survived .  isn t that true .     they may   said wendel with a slightly synthetic lilt to her voice   and if they have  so much the better for us .  as you pointed out  it would then be easy to locate them through their radiational output .  and more than that      yes .     koropatsky wants us to bring back something that will prove we encountered rotor  feeling that would be the best evidence that we had indeed been in deep space and returned  covering several light years in  at most  a few months .  except  what exactly could we bring back that would be convincing .  suppose we find some drifting bits of metal or concrete .  not any bit will do .  a lump of metal with nothing to identify it as rotorian would be something we might well have taken with us .  even if we manage to find a piece that is characteristic of rotor  some artifact that could only exist on a settlement  it might be considered a fake .    if  however  rotor were a working  living settlement  we might be able to persuade some rotorian to come back with us .  a rotorian can be identified as one .  fingerprints  retinal patterns  dna analysis .  there may even be people on other settlements  or on earth  who would be able to recognize the particular rotorian we bring back .  koropatsky hinted heavily that we do this .  he pointed out that columbus  returning from his first voyage  brought native americans with him .    of course   and wendel sighed heavily as she went on   there is a limit to how much we can bring back  animate or inanimate .  someday we may have stars hips as large as settlements  but our first one is going to be a small and  by later standards  a primitive thing  i m sure .  we might be able to bring back one rotorian  more than one would be more than we could handle  so we ll have to pick the right one .     my daughter  marlene   said fisher .   she might not want to come .  we can only take someone who s willing to return .  there s bound to be one among the thousands  perhaps even a large number  but if she doesn t want to come      marlene will be willing to come .  you let me talk to her .  somehow i ll win her over .      her mother might not wish it .     somehow i ll talk her into it   said fisher stubbornly .   somehow i ll manage .    wendel sighed again .   i can t let you live with that thought  crile .   don t you see that we can t take your daughter back  even if she is willing to come .     why not .  why not .     she was one year old when she left .  she has no memories of the solar system .  no one in the solar system could identify her .  there are very unlikely to have been any records that could be checked independently elsewhere in the system .  no  we would have to have some middle aged person at the least  and one who has visited other settlements or  better yet  earth .    she paused and then said tightly   your wife might be suitable .  didn t you once tell me that she took part of her education on earth .  there would be records and she would be identifiable .  though  to be honest  i would much rather take someone else .    fisher was silent .  wendel said  almost timidly   i m sorry  crile .  it s not as i would wish it .    and fisher said bitterly   just let my marlene be alive .  we ll see what can be done .        twenty one  brainscan       .      i m sorry   said siever genarr  looking down his long nose at mother and daughter with an expression that seemed to beg their pardon even without his words .   i had told marlene that this job was not a very busy one and then almost immediately thereafter we had a kind of mini crisis with our power supply and i found i had to delay this conference of ours .  the crisis is over  however  and wasn t much to begin with  now that we can view it in hindsight .  am i forgiven .     of course  siever   said eugenia insigna .  she was clearly restless .   i won t say it s been an easy three days  though .  i feel that every hour we stay here increases marlene s danger .    marlene said   i don t fear erythro at all  uncle siever .   insigna said    and i don t think pitt can do anything against us on rotor .  he knows that  or he wouldn t have sent us here .    genarr said    and i will try to play the honest broker and satisfy you both .  whatever pitt can or cannot do openly  there is a great deal he can do indirectly  so it s dangerous  eugenia  for you to let your fear of erythro lead you to underestimate pitt s resolve and ingenuity .  to begin with  if you return to rotor  you will be doing so against his emergency ruling and he can imprison you or send you into exile on new rotor or even send you back here .    as for erythro  we don t dare underestimate the danger of the plague either  even though it seems to have died out in its virulent early form .  i am as reluctant to risk marlene as you are  eugenia .    and marlene whispered in exasperation   there s no risk .    insigna said   siever  i don t think we should carryon this discussion of marlene in her presence .     you re wrong .  i want to do it in her presence .  i suspect that she knows better than either of us what she ought to do .  she is the caretaker of that mind of hers and it is our job to interfere with her as little as possible .    insigna made an inarticulate sound in her throat  but genarr went on  a quality of remorselessness entering his voice   i want her in this discussion because i want her input .  i want her opinion .    insigna said   but you know her opinion .  she wants to go out there  and you re saying that we must let her do what she wants to do because she is somehow magical .     no one said a word about magical  or about simply letting her go out .  i would like to suggest we experiment  with all due precautions .     in what way .     to begin with  i would like a brain scan .   he turned to marlene .   do you understand  marlene  that that s necessary .  do you have any objections .    marlene frowned slightly .   i ve had brain scans .  everyone has had brain scans .  they don t let you start school without a brain scan .  any time you have a complete medical examination      i know   said genarr gently .   i haven t completely wasted these last three days .  i have here   and his hand came to rest on a stack of computer strips at the left end of his desk   the computerization of every single brain scan you ve ever had .     but you re not telling everything  uncle siever   said marlene calmly .    ah   said insigna with a touch of triumph .   what is he hiding  marlene .     he s a little nervous about me .  he doesn t entirely believe my feeling that i m safe .  he s uncertain .    genarr said   how can that be  marlene .  i feel quite certain about your safety .    but marlene said with a glow of sudden enlightenment   i think that s why you waited three days  uncle siever .  you argued yourself into being certain so that i wouldn t see your uncertainty .  but it didn t work .  i can still see it .    genarr said   if that shows  marlene  then it s only because i value you so highly that i find even the slightest risk unpleasant .    insigna said angrily   if you find even the slightest risk unpleasant  how do you suppose i feel  as a mother .  so in your uncertainty  you obtain brain scans  violating marlene s medical privacy .     i had to find out .  and i did .  they re insufficient .         insufficient in what way .     in the early days of the dome  when the plague struck again and again  one of our concerns was to devise a more detailed brain scanner and a more efficiently programmed computer to interpret the data .  this has never been transferred to rotor .  pitt s exaggerated desire to hide the plague led him to resist the sudden appearance of an improved brain scanner on rotor .  it might have given rise to inconvenient questions and rumors .  ridiculous  to my way of thinking  but in this  as in many other things  pitt had his way .  therefore  marlene  you have never been properly brain scanned and i want you to have one on our device .    marlene shrank back   no .   a look of hope crossed insigna s face .   why not  marlene .     because when uncle siever said that  he was suddenly much more uncertain .    genarr said   no  that s not    he stopped himself  lifted his arms  and let them drop helplessly .   why do i bother .  marlene  dear  if i seemed suddenly concerned  it s because we need as detailed a brain scan as possible to serve as a standard of mental normality .  then  if you are exposed to erythro and suffer even the slightest mental distortion as a result  it can be detected by brain scan even when no one can tell by simply looking at you or talking to you .  well  as soon as i mention a detailed brain scan  i think of the possibility of detecting an otherwise indetectable mental change  and the thought itself sparks an automatic concern .  that s what you detect .  come  marlene  how much uncertainty do you detect .  be quantitative .    but marlene said   not much  but it s there .  the trouble is  i can only tell you re uncertain .  i can t tell why .  maybe this special brain scan is dangerous .     how can it be .  it has been used so  marlene  you know erythro won t hurt you .  don t you also know that the brain scan won t hurt you .     no  i don t .     do you know that it wilt hurt you .   a pause and then marlene said reluctantly   no .     but how can you be sure about erythro and not sure about the brain scan .     i don t know .  i just know that erythro won t hurt me  but i don t know that the brain scan won t .  or will .    a smile crossed genarr s face .  it did not take unusual abilities to see that he was enormously relieved .   marlene said   why does that make you feel good  uncle siever .   genarr said   because if you were making up your intuitional feelings  out of a desire to be important  or out of general romanticism  or out of some sort of self delusion  you would apply it to everything .  but you don t .  you pick and choose .  some things you know and some things you don t know .  that makes me far more inclined to believe you when you claim to be sure erythro won t hurt you and i no longer in the least fear that the brain scan will reveal anything disturbing .    marlene turned to her mother .   he s right  mother .  he feels much better and so i feel much better .  it s so obvious .  can t you see it  too .     it doesn t matter what i see   said insigna .   i don t feel better .     oh  mother   murmured marlene .  then  more loudly to genarr   i ll take the scan .         .      this is not surprising   murmured siever genarr .  he was watching the computer graphics in their intricate  almost floral patterns  as they moved slowly in and out in false color .  eugenia insigna  at his side  stared at it keenly  but understood nothing .    what is not surprising  siever .   she asked .   i can t tell you properly because i don t have their jargon down pat .  and if ranay d  aubisson  who s our local guru on this  were to explain it  neither you nor i would understand her .  however  she did point this out to me      it looks like a snail shell .     the color makes it stand out .  it s a measure of complexity rather than a direct indication of physical form  ranay says .  this part is atypical .  we don t find it in brains generally .    insigna s lip trembled .   you mean she s already affected .     no  of course not .  i said atypical  not abnormal .  surely i don t have to explain that to an experienced scientific observer .  you ll have to admit that marlene is different .  in a way  i m glad that the snail shell is there .  if her brain were completely typical  we d have to wonder why she seems to be what she is  where the perceptivity is coming from .  is she cleverly faking it  or are we fools .     but how do you know it isn t something  something      diseased .  how can that be .  we have all of the brain scans collected over her lifetime from infancy .  that atypicality was always there .     it was never reported to me .  no one ever remarked on it .     of course not .  those early brain scans were the usual fairly primitive type and it wouldn t show  at least not so that it would hit you in the face .  but  once we have this proper brain scan and can see the detail clearly  we can go back to the early ones and make it out .  ranay has already done so .  i tell you  eugenia  this advanced brain scanning technique ought to be standard on rotor .  pitt s suppression of it is one of his most foolish moves .  it s expensive  of course .     i ll pay   murmured insigna .    don t be silly .  i m putting this one on the dome budget .  after all  this may be helpful in solving the plague mystery .  at least  that s what i ll claim if it s ever questioned  well  there you are .  marlene s brain is recorded in greater complexity than ever before .  if she should be even slightly affected  it will show on the screen .     you have no idea how frightening this is   said insigna .    i don t blame you  you know .  but she is so confident that i can t help going along with her .  i m convinced that this solid sense of security has meaning behind it .     how can it .    genarr pointed to the snail shell .   you don t have that  and i don t have it  so neither of us is in a position to tell where and how she gets her sense of security .  but she has it  so we must let her out on the surface .      why must we risk her .  can you possibly explain to me why we must risk her .     two reasons .  first  she does seem determined  and i have the feeling that she ll get whatever she s determined to get  sooner or later .  in that case  we might as well be cheerful about it and send her off  since we won t be able to stop her for very long .  secondly  it s possible we ll learn something about the plague as a result .  what that might be  i can t say  but anything  however small  that will yield additional information concerning the plague is worth a great deal .     not my daughter s mind .     it won t come to that .  for one thing  even though i have faith in marlene and believe there s no risk  i will do what i can to minimize it for your sake .  in the first place  we ll not let her out onto the surface itself for a while .  i may take her out on a flight over erythro  for instance .  she ll see lakes and plains  hills  canyons .  we might even go as far as the edge of the sea .  it all has a stark beauty  i saw it once   but it is barren .  there is no life anywhere that she can see  only the prokaryotes in the water  which are invisible  of course .  it s possible that the uniform barrenness may repel her and she may lose interest in the outside altogether .    if  however  she is still keen on going out  on feeling the soil of erythro under her feet  we will see to it that she wears an e suit .     what is an e suit .     an erythro suit .  it s a straightforward affair  like a spacesuit  except that it doesn t have to hold in air pressure against a vacuum .  it s an impermeable combination of plastic and textile that s very light and doesn t impede motion .  the helmet with its infrared shielding is somewhat more substantial and there is an artificial air supply and ventilation .  what it amounts to is that the person in an e suit is not subjected to the erythro environment .  and on top of that  there ll be someone with her .     who .  i would trust no one with her but myself .   genarr smiled .   i couldn t imagine a less suitable companion .  you know nothing about erythro  really  and you re frightened of it .  i wouldn t dare let you out there .  look  the only person we can trust is not you  but me .     you .   insigna stared at him  open mouthed .   why not .  no one here knows erythro better than i do  and if marlene is immune to the plague  so am i .  in ten years on erythro  i haven t been affected in the slightest .  what s more  i can fly an aircraft  which means we won t need a pilot .  and then  too  if i go out with marlene  i can watch her closely .  if she does anything abnormal  no matter how slightly  i ll have her back in the dome and under the brain scan faster than light .     by which time  of course  it will be too late .     no .  not necessarily .  you mustn t look upon the plague as an all or nothing matter .  there have been light cases  even very light cases  and people who are lightly affected can live reasonably normal lives .  nothing will happen to her .  i m sure of it .    insigna sat in her chair  silent  seeming somehow small and defenseless .   genarr impulsively placed his arm around her .   come  eugenia  forget this for a week .  i promise she ll not go out for at least a week  longer than that if i can weaken her resolve by showing her erythro from the air .  and during the flight she will be enclosed in the aircraft and will be as safe there as she is here .  as for right now  i ll tell you what  you re an astronomer  aren t you .    she looked at him and said  wanly   you know i am .     then that means that you never look at the stars .  astronomers never do .  they only look at their instruments .  it s night over the dome now  so let s go up to the observation deck and observe .  the night is absolutely clear  and there is nothing like just looking at the stars to make one feel quiet and at peace .  trust me .         .     it was true .  astronomers did not look at the stars .  there was no need .  one gave instructions to the telescopes  the cameras  and the spectroscope by way of the computer  which received instructions in the way of programming .   the instruments did the work  the analyses  the graphic simulations .  the astronomer merely asked the questions  then studied the answers .  for that  one didn t have to look at the stars .   but then  she thought  how does one look at stars idly .  can one when one is an astronomer .  the mere sight should make one uneasy .  there was work to be done  questions to be asked  mysteries to be solved  and  after a while  surely one would return to one s workshop and set some instruments in motion while one distracted one s mind by reading a novel or watching a holovision spectacle .   she muttered this to siever genarr  as he went about his office  checking loose ends before leaving .   he was a confirmed loose end checker  insigna remembered from the ancient days when they were all young .  it had irritated her then  but perhaps she ought to have admired it .  siever had so many virtues  she thought  and crile  on the other hand     she dragged at her thoughts mercilessly and pointed them another way .   genarr was saying    actually  i don t use the observation deck myself very often .  there always seems to be something else to do .  and when i do go  i almost always find myself alone up there .  it will be pleasant to have company .  come .    he led the way to a small elevator .  it was the first time insigna had been in an elevator in the dome  and  for a fleeting moment  it was as though she were back on rotor  except that she felt no change in pseudo gravitation pull and did not feel herself pressed gently against one of the walls through a coriolis effect  as she would have been on rotor .    here we are   said genarr  and motioned to insigna to step out .  she did so  curiously  into the empty chamber  and  almost at once  shrank back .  she said    are we exposed .     exposed .   genarr asked  bewildered .   oh  you mean  are we open to erythro s atmosphere .  no no .  have no fears about that .  we are enclosed in a hemisphere of diamond coated glass which nothing scratches .  a meteorite would smash it  of course  but the skies of erythro are virtually meteor free .  we have such glass on rotor  you know  but   and his voice took on a tone of pride   not quite this quality  and not quite this size .     they treat you well down here   said insigna  reaching out gently to touch the glass again and assure herself of its existence .    they must  to get people to come here .   then  reverting to the bubble   it rains  of course  on occasion  but it s cloudy then anyway .  and once the skies clear  it dries up quickly .  a residue is left behind  and during the day  a special detergent mixture cleans the bubble .  sit down  eugenia .    insigna sat in a chair that was soft and comfortable and that reclined almost of its own accord  so that she found herself looking upward .  she could hear another chair sigh softly as genarr s weight pushed it backward .  and then  the small night lights  which had cast a glow sufficient to point out the presence and location of chairs and small tables in the room  went out .  in the darkness of an uninhabited world  the sky  cloudless  and as dark as black velvet  burned with sparks .   insigna gasped .  she knew what the sky was like in theory .  she had seen it on charts and maps  in simulations and photographs  in every shape and way except reality .  she found herself not picking out the interesting objects  the puzzling items  the mysteries that demanded she get to work .  she didn t look at anyone object  but at the patterns they made .   in dim prehistory  she thought  it was the study of the patterns  and not of the stars themselves  that gave the ancients the constellations and the beginning of astronomy .   genarr was right .  peace  like a fine  unfelt cobweb  settled down over her .   after a while  she said  almost sleepily   thank you  genarr .     for what .     for offering to go out with marlene .  for risking your mind for my daughter .     i m not risking my mind .  nothing will happen to either of us .  besides  i have a  a fatherly feeling toward her .  after all  eugenia  we go a long way back together  you and i  and i think  have always thought  highly of you .     i know   said insigna  feeling the stirrings of guilt .  she had always known how genarr had felt  he could never obscure it .  it had inspired her with resignation before she met crile  and with annoyance afterward .   she said   if i ve ever hurt your feelings  siever  i am truly sorry .     no need   said genarr softly  and there was a long silence while peace deepened  and insigna found herself earnestly hoping that no one would enter and break the strange spell of serenity that held her fast .   and then genarr said   i have a theory as to why people don t come up to the observation deck here .  or on rotor .  did you ever notice that the observation deck isn t used much on rotor either .     marlene liked to go there on occasion   said insigna .   she told me she was usually alone up there .  in the last year or so  she would tell me that she liked to watch erythro .  i should have listened more closely paid attention      marlene is unusual .  i think what gets most people and keeps them from coming up here is that .     what .   asked insigna .   that   said genarr .  he was pointing to some spot in the sky  but in the darkness she could not see his arm .   that very bright star  the brightest in the sky .     you mean the sun  our sun  the sun of the solar system .     yes  i do .  it s an interloper .  except for that bright star  the sky would be just about the same as the one we see from earth .  alpha centauri is rather out of place and sirius is shifted slightly  but we wouldn t notice that .  barring such things  the sky you see is what the sumerians saw five thousand years ago .  all except for the sun .     and you think the sun keeps people away from the observation deck .     yes  perhaps not consciously  but i think the sight of it makes them uneasy .  the tendency is to think of the sun as far  far away  unreachable  part of an altogether different universe .  yet there it is in the sky  bright  demanding our attention  stirring up our guilt for having run away from it .     but then why don t the teenagers and children go to the observation deck .  they know little or nothing of the sun and the solar system .     the rest of us set a negative example .  when we re all gone  when there s no one on rotor to whom the solar system is anything but a phrase  i think the sky will seem to belong to rotor again  and this place will be crowded  if it still exists .     do you think it won t still exist .     we can t foresee the future  eugenia .     we seem to be flourishing and growing so far .     yes  we are  but it s that bright star  the interloper  that i m worried about .     our old sun .  what can it do .  it can t reach us .     sure it can .   genarr was staring at the bright star in the western sky .   the people we ve left behind on earth and on the settlements are bound to discover nemesis eventually .  maybe they already have .  and maybe they ve worked out hyper assistance .  i m of the opinion they must have developed hyper assistance soon after we left .  our disappearance must have stimulated them greatly .     we left fourteen years ago .  why aren t they already here .     perhaps they quail at the thought of a two year flight .  they know that rotor attempted it  but they don t know that we succeeded at it .  they may think that our wreckage is strewn through space all the way from the sun to nemesis .     we didn t lack the courage to attempt it .     sure we did .  do you think that rotor would have made the attempt if we hadn t had pitt .  it was pitt who drove the rest of us  and i doubt that there s another pitt anywhere in the settlements  or on earth for that matter .  you know i don t like pitt .  i disapprove of his methods  of his morals  or the lack of them  of his deviousness  of his cold blooded ability to send a girl like marlene to what he clearly hopes will be her destruction  and yet if we go by results  he may go down in history as a great man .     as a great leader   said insigna .   you are a great man  siever .  there s a clear difference .    there was silence again  till genarr said softly   i keep waiting for them to come here after us .  that s my biggest fear  and it seems to strengthen when the interloper shines down upon me .  it s fourteen years now since we left the solar system .  what have they been doing in these fourteen years .  have you ever wondered about that  eugenia .     never   said insigna  half asleep .   my worries are more immediate .        twenty two  asteroid       .     august          .  it meant something to crile fisher  for it was tessa wendel s birthday .  to be precise  it was her fifty third birthday .  she made no reference to the day  or to its significance  perhaps because she had been so proud of her youthful appearance on adelia  or perhaps because she was over conscious of fisher s five years  advantage .   but their relative age difference didn t matter to crile .  even if fisher had not been attracted to her intelligence and to her sexual vigor  tessa held the key to rotor and he knew it .   there were fine wrinkles around her eyes now  and a distinct flabbiness to her upper arms  but her unmentioned birthday was one of triumph for her  and she came swinging into the apartment  which had grown steadily more lavish with the years  and threw herself into her sturdy field bottomed armchair with a smile of satisfaction on her face .    it went as smoothly as interstellar space .  absolute perfection .     i wish i had been there   said crile .   i wish you had  too  crile  but we re on a strictly need to know basis  and i get you involved in more things than i should  as it is .    the goal had been hypermnestra  an otherwise undistinguished asteroid that was in a convenient position  not too close to other asteroids at the moment  and  what was more important  not too close to jupiter .  it was also unclaimed by any settlement  and unvisited by any .  and  to top it off  there were the first two syllables of the name  which  however trivial  seemed to represent a proper target for a superluminal flight through hyperspace .    i take it you got the ship there safely .     within ten thousand kilometers .  we could easily have placed it closer  but we didn t want to risk an intensification of its gravitational field  feeble though it was .  and back  of course  to the prearranged spot .  it s being shepherded in by two ordinary vessels .     i suppose the settlements were on the lookout .     of course  but it s one thing to see that the ship vanishes instantaneously  and quite another to tell where it went  whether it went at or near light speed  or many multiples of it  and  most of all  how it was done .  so what they do see means nothing .     they had nothing in the neighborhood of hypermnestra  did they .     they had no way of knowing what the destination was  barring a breakdown of security  and that apparently didn t happen .  if they had known  or guessed  that alone still would not have helped them .  all in all  crile  very satisfactory .      obviously a giant step .     with additional giant steps still facing us .  it was the first ship  capable of carrying a human being  to attain superluminal velocity  but  as you know  it was staffed  if that s the word  by one robot .     did the robot operate successfully .     completely  but that s not very significant  except that it shows we can transfer a fairly large mass there and back in one piece  at least in one piece on the macro scale .  it will take several weeks of inspection to make sure that no dangerous damage was done on the micro scale .  and  of course  that still leaves us the task of building larger ships  of making sure that life support systems are incorporated and functioning well  and of multiplying safety provisions .  a robot can take stresses that human beings cannot .     and is the schedule holding up .     so far .  so far .  another year or year and a half  if there are no disasters or unexpected accidents  and we ought to be able to surprise the rotorians  assuming them to exist .    fisher winced  and wendel said  looking hangdog   i m sorry .  i keep promising myself not to say things like that  but it does slip out once in a while .     never mind   said fisher .   is it definitely settled that i ll be going on the first trip to rotor .     if anything can be definitely settled for something that won t take place for a year or more .  there s no way of guarding against sudden shifts of needs .     but so far .     apparently  tanayama had left behind a note to the effect that you were promised a berth  more decent of him than i would have expected .  koropatsky was kind enough to tell me about the note today  after the successful flight  when it seemed to me that it might be a good time to advance the possibility .     good .  tanayama promised it to me by word of mouth once .  i am glad he put it on the record .     do you mind telling me why he made that promise .  tanayama always struck me as someone who gave nothing for nothing .     you re right .  i got the trip on condition that i brought you back to earth to work on superluminal velocities .  i think you ll recall i carried out that task triumphantly .    wendel snorted .   i doubt that it was that alone that shook and moved your government .  koropatsky said that he would not consider himself bound by tanayama s promises  ordinarily  but that you had lived on rotor for some years and that your special knowledge might come in handy .  my own feeling is that your special knowledge  after thirteen years  might have dimmed  but i didn t say that  because i was feeling good after the trial  and decided that  for the moment  i loved you .    fisher smiled .   i feel relieved  tessa .  i hope you ll be on the first flight  too .  did you get that straightened out .    wendel pulled her head back an inch or two as though to get fisher into better focus .   that was a lot harder  my boy .  they were perfectly willing to send you into danger  but as for me  they said that i couldn t be spared .   who could carryon the project if anything happens to you .   they said .  so i said   only anyone of about twenty of my subordinates who are as well up on superluminal flight as i am  and whose minds are younger and nimbler .   a lie  of course  since there s no one quite like me  but it impressed them .     there s something to what they say  you know .  should you take the risk .     yes   said wendel .   for one thing i want the credit of being captain of the first superluminal flight .  for another i am curious to see another star  and resent that these rotorians got there first  if    she caught herself and said    and finally  and most important  i believe  i want to get off earth .   she said that with a virtual snarl .   afterward  as they lay in bed together  she said    and when the time comes  and we finally get there  what a marvelous feeling it will be .    fisher did not answer .  he was thinking of a child with strange large eyes  and of his sister  and the two seemed to fuse as drowsiness closed down over him .       twenty three  airflight       .     long distance travel through a planetary atmosphere was not something that settlers accepted as part of their society .  on a settlement  distances were small enough so that elevators  legs  and an occasional electric cart were all that was necessary .  as for inter settlement travel  that was by rocket .   many settlers  at least  back in the solar system  had been in space so many times that progress through it was almost as common to them as walking .  it was a rare settler  however  who had traveled to earth  where alone atmospheric travel existed  and which had made use of airflight .   settlers who could face the vacuum as though it were a friend and brother felt unfathomable terror if expected to sense  somehow  the whistle of air past a vehicle without ground support below .   yet air travel  on occasion  was an obvious necessity on erythro .  like earth it was a large world  and like earth it had a fairly dense  and breathable  atmosphere .  there were reference books on airflight available on rotor  and even several earth immigrants with aeronautical experience .   so the dome owned two small aircraft  somewhat clumsy  somewhat primitive  ungiven to large bursts of speed  or to headlong maneuverability  but serviceable .   in fact  rotor s very ignorance of aeronautical engineering helped in one respect .  the dome s aircraft were far more computerized than any corresponding vessel on earth .  in fact  siever genarr liked to think of the vessels as intricate robots that happened to be built in the shape of aircraft .  erythro s weather was much milder than earth s could possibly be  since the low intensity of the radiation from nemesis was insufficient to power large and violent storms  so that an aircraft robot was less likely to have to face an emergency .  far less likely .   as a result  virtually anyone could fly the raw and unpolished aircraft of the dome .  you simply told the plane what you wanted it to do and it was done .  if the message was unclear  or seemed dangerous to the robotic brain of the vessel  it asked for clarification .   genarr watched marlene climb into the cabin of the plane with a certain natural concern  if not with the lip biting terror of eugenia insigna  who stood well away from the scene .    don t come any closer   he had ordered insigna sternly   especially if you re going to look as though you were witnessing the sure beginning of calamity .  you ll panic the girl .     it seemed to insigna that there were grounds for panic .  marlene was too young to remember a world where airflight was common .  she had taken a rocket calmly enough to come to erythro  but how would she react to this unheard of flight through air .   and yet marlene climbed into the cabin and took her seat with a look of utter calm on her face .   was it possible she did not grasp the situation .  genarr said   marlene  dear  you do know what we re going to be doing  don t you .     yes  uncle siever .  you re going to show me erythro .     from the air  you know .  you ll be flying through the air .     yes .  you said so before .     does the thought of it bother you .     no  uncle siever  but it s bothering you a lot .     only on your behalf  dear .     i ll be perfectly all right .   she turned her calm face toward him as he climbed in after her and took his seat .  she said   i can understand mother being concerned  but you re more concerned than she is .  you re managing to show it less in any big way  but if you could see yourself licking your lips  you would be embarrassed .  you feel that if something bad happens  it will be your fault  and you just can t stand the thought .  just the same  nothing s going to happen .     are you sure of that  marlene .     absolutely sure .  nothing will harm me on erythro .     you said that about the plague  but we re not talking about that now .     it doesn t matter what we re talking about .  nothing will harm me on erythro .    genarr shook his head slightly in disbelief and uncertainty  and then wished he hadn t  for he knew she read that as easily as though it were appearing in the largest block letters on the computer screen .  but what was the difference .  if he had repressed it all and had acted as if he were made of cast bronze  she would still have seen it .   he said   we ll go into an airlock and stay there just a while  so that i can check the responsiveness of the vessel s brain .  then we will go through another door and the plane will then move up in the air .  there ll be an acceleration effect  and you ll be pressed backward  and we ll be moving in the air  with nothing beneath us .  you understand that  i hope .     i am not afraid   said marlene quietly .        .     the aircraft remained on its steady course across a barren landscape of rolling hills .   genarr knew that erythro was geologically alive and knew also that what geological studies had been made of the world indicated that there had been periods in its history when it had been mountainous .  and there were still mountains here and there on the cis megan hemisphere  the hemisphere in which the bloated circle of the planet megas  around which erythro orbited  hung almost motionless in the sky .   here on the trans megan side  however  plains and hills were the chief feature of the two large continents .   to marlene  who had never seen a mountain in her life  even the low hills were exciting .   there were rivulets on rotor  of course  and from the height at which they were viewing erythro  these rivers looked no different .   genarr thought  marlene will be surprised when she sees them at a closer view .   marlene look curiously at nemesis  which had passed its noon mark and had declined toward the west .  she said   it s not moving  is it  uncle siever .     it s moving   said genarr .   or  at least erythro is turning relative to nemesis  but it turns only once a day  while rotor turns once every two minutes .  in comparison  nemesis  as seen from here on erythro  is moving less than      th as fast as it seems to be moving as seen from rotor .  it seems to be standing still here  by comparison  but it isn t standing entirely still .    then  casting a quick glance at nemesis  he said   you ve never seen earth s sun  the sun of the solar system  you know  or  if you have  you don t remember it  having been a baby at the time .  the sun was much smaller as seen from rotor s position in the solar system .     smaller .   said marlene in surprise .   the computer told me that it was nemesis that was smaller .     in reality  yes .  still  rotor is so much closer to nemesis than it ever was to the sun in the old days that nemesis seems larger .     we re four million kilometers from nemesis  aren t we .     but we were a hundred fifty million kilometers from the sun .  if we were that far from nemesis  we d get less than   percent of the light and warmth we get now .  if we were as close to the sun as we are to nemesis  we d be vaporized .  the sun is much larger  brighter  and hotter than nemesis .    marlene wasn t looking at genarr  but apparently his tone of voice was sufficient .   from the way you talk  uncle siever  i think you wish you were back near the sun .     i was born there  so i get homesick sometimes .     but the sun is so hot and bright .  it must be dangerous .     we didn t look at it .  and you shouldn t look at nemesis too long either .  look away  dear .    genarr cast another quick glance at nemesis  however .  it hung in the western sky  red and vast  its apparent diameter at four degrees of arc  or eight times that of the sun as seen from rotor s old position .  it was a quiet red circle of light  but genarr knew that  on comparatively rare occasions  it would flare and  for a few minutes  there would be a white spot on that serene face that would be painful to look at .  mild sunspots  in darker red  were more common  but not as noticeable .   he murmured an order to the plane  which veered sufficiently to put nemesis farther to the rear  out of direct view .   marlene took a last  thoughtful glance at nemsis  then turned her eyes to erythro s vista stretched out below .   she said   you get used to the pink color of everything .  it doesn t look so pink after a while .    genarr had noticed that himself .  his eyes caught differences in tint and shade so that the world began to seem less monochromatic .  the rivers and small lakes were ruddier and darker than the land surface  and the sky was dark .  little of the red light of nemesis was scattered by erythro s atmosphere .   the most hopeless thing about erythro  however  was the barrenness of the land .  rotor  even on its tiny scale  had green fields  yellow grain  varicolored fruit  noise making animals  all the color and sound of human habitation and structures .   here there was only silence and inanimation .  marlene frowned .   there is life on erythro  uncle siever .   genarr couldn t tell whether marlene was making a statement  asking a question  or answering his thought as revealed by his body language .  was she insisting on something or seeking reassurance .   he said   certainly .  lots of life .  it s all pervasive .  it s not only in the water either .  there are prokaryotes living in the water films about the soil particles  too .    after a while  the ocean made its appearance on the horizon ahead  first as simply a dark line  then a thickening band as the air vehicle approached it .   genarr cast careful sidelong glances at marlene  watching her reaction .  she had read about earth s oceans  of course  and must have seen images on holovision  but nothing can prepare anyone for the actual experience .  genarr  who had been on earth once  once .   as a tourist  had seen the edge of an ocean .  he had never been over one  out of sight of land  however  and he wasn t sure of his own reactions .   it rolled back below them and now the dry land shrank behind into a lighter line and  eventually  it was gone .  genarr looked down with a queer feeling in the pit of his stomach .  he remembered a phrase from an archaic epic   the wine dark sea .   below them the ocean certainly did look like a vast rolling mass of red wine  with pink froth here and there .   there were no markings to identify in that vast body of water  and there was no place to land .  the very essence of  location  was gone .  yet he knew that when he wanted to return  he need do no more than direct the plane to take them back to land .  the plane s computer kept track of position in accurate reckoning of speed and direction and would know where land was  even where the dome was .   they passed under a thick cloud deck and the ocean turned black .  a word from genarr  and the plane lifted through and above the clouds .  nemesis shone again  and the ocean could no longer be seen beneath them .  there was  instead  a sea of pink water droplets  billowing and rising here and there  so that bits of fog moved  occasionally  past the window .   then the clouds seemed to part and between their edges  glimpses of the wine dark sea could again be seen .   marlene watched  her mouth partly open  her breath shallow .  she said in a whisper   that s all water  isn t it  uncle siever .     thousands of kilometers in every direction  marlene  and ten kilometers deep in spots .     if you fall into it  i suppose you drown .     you needn t worry about that .  this vehicle won t fall into the ocean .      i know it won t   said marlene matter of factly .   there was another sight  genarr thought  to which marlene could well be introduced .   marlene broke in on his thought .   you re getting nervous again  uncle siever .    genarr felt amused at the manner in which he was learning to take marlene s penetration for granted .  he said   you ve never seen megas  and i was wondering if i ought to show it to you .  you see  only one side of erythro faces megas  and the dome was built on the side of erythro that doesn t face it  so that megas is never in our sky .  if we continue to fly in this direction  however  we ll enter the cis megas hemisphere and we ll see it rise above the horizon .     i would like to see that .     you will  then  but be prepared .  it s large .  really large .  nearly twice as wide as nemesis and it looks almost like it s about to fall on us .  some people simply can t endure the sight .  it won t fall  though .  it can t .  try to remember that .    they moved along at a higher altitude and a heightened speed .  the ocean lay below in wrinkled sameness  occasionally obscured by clouds .   eventually  genarr said   if you ll look ahead and a little to the right  you ll see megas beginning to show at the horizon .  we ll turn toward it .    it looked like a small patch of light along the horizon at first  but grew like a slow upward swell .  then the widening arc of a deep red circle lifted itself above the horizon .  it was distinctly deeper than nemesis  which could still be seen to the right and in back of the plane  and somewhat lower in the sky .   as megas loomed larger  it soon became apparent that what was being revealed was not a full circle of light  a bit more than a semicircle .   marlene said with interest   now that s what they mean by  phases   isn t that right .     exactly right .  we only see the part that s lit by nemesis .  as erythro goes around megas  nemesis seem to move closer to megas and we see less and less of the lit half of the planet .  then when nemesis skims just above or below megas  we just see a thin curve of light at megas  boundary  that s all we see of its lighted hemisphere .  sometimes nemesis actually moves behind megas .  nemesis is then eclipsed  and all the dim stars of night come out  not just the bright ones that show even when nemesis is in the sky .  during the eclipse  you can see a large circle of darkness with no stars in it at all  and that show you where megas is .  when nemesis reappears on the other side  you began to see a thin curve of light again .     how marvelous   said marlene .   it s like a show in the sky .  and look at megas  all those moving stripes .    they stretched across the lighted portion of the globe  thick and reddish brown  interspersed with orange  and slowly writhing .    they re storm bands   said genarr   with terrific winds that blow this way and that .  if you watch closely  you ll see spots form and expand  drift along  then spread out and vanish .     it is like a holovision show   said marlene raptly .   why don t people watch it all the time .     astronomers do .  they watch it through computerized instruments located on this hemisphere .  i ve seen it myself in our observatory .  you know  we had a planet like this back in the solar system .  it s called jupiter  and it s even larger than megas .    by now  the planet had lifted entirely above the horizon  looking like a bloated balloon that had  somehow  partially collapsed along its left half .   marlene said   it s lovely .  if the dome were built on this side of erythro  everyone could watch it .     actually not  marlene .  it doesn t seem to work that way .  most people don t like megas .  i told you that some people get the impression that megas is falling and it frightens them .    marlene said impatiently   only a few people would have such a silly notion .     only a few to begin with  but silly notions can be contagious .  fears spread  and some people who wouldn t be afraid if left to themselves  become afraid because their neighbor is .  haven t you ever noticed that sort of thing .     yes  i have   she said with a touch of bitterness .   if one boy thinks a bimbo is pretty  they all do .  they start competing    she paused  as if in embarrassment .    the contagious fear is one reason we built the dome on the other hemisphere .  another is that with megas always in the sky  astronomic observations are more difficult to make in this hemisphere .  but i think it s time we begin our return .  you know your mother .  she ll be in a panic .     call her and tell her we re all right .     i don t have to .  this ship is sending out signals continuously .  she knows we re all right  physically .  but that s not what she s worried about   he said  tapping his temple significantly .   marlene slumped in her chair and a look of deep discontent crossed her face .   what a pain .  i know everyone will say   it s just because she loves you   but it s such a bother .  why can t she just take my word for it that i ll be all right .     because she loves you   said genarr  as he quietly instructed the aircraft to return home   just as you love erythro .    marlene s face brightened at once .   oh  i do .     yes yes .  it s quite visible in your every reaction to the world .   and genarr wondered how eugenia insigna would react to that .        .     she reacted in fury .   what do you mean  she loves erythro .  how can she love a dead world .  is it possible you brainwashed her .  is there some reason you ve talked her into loving it .     eugenia  be reasonable .  do you really believe it is possible to brainwash marlene into anything .  have you ever succeeded in doing so .     then what happened .     actually  i tried to subject her to situations that would displease or frighten her .  if anything  i tried to  brainwash  her into disliking erythro .  i know from experience that rotorians  brought up in the tight little world of a settlement  hate the endlessness of erythro  they don t like the redness of the light  they don t like that enormous puddle of an ocean  they don t like darkening clouds  they don t like nemesis  and  most of all  they don t like megas .  all these things tend to depress and frighten them .  and i showed all these things to marlene .  i took her out over the ocean and then  far enough out to show her megas entirely above the horizon .     and .     and nothing bothered her .  she said she got used to the red light  and it stopped looking so terribly red .  the ocean didn t in the least frighten her  and  most of all  she found megas interesting and amusing .     i can t believe it .     you must .  it s true .    insigna sank into thought  then said reluctantly   maybe it s a sign that she s already infected with the  the      with the plague .  i arranged for another brain scan as soon as we got back .  we still haven t got the complete analysis  but the preliminary inspection shows no change .  the mind pattern changes markedly and noticeably even in a light case of the plague .  marlene simply doesn t have it .  however  an interesting thought just occurred to me .  we know that marlene is perceptive  that she can note all sorts of little things .  feelings flow from others to her .  but have you ever detected anything that might seem the reverse .  do feelings flow from her to others .     i don t understand what you re getting at .     she knows when i m uncertain and a little anxious  no matter how i try to hide the fact  or that i m calm and unafraid .  is there any way  though  that she can force me or encourage me to become uncertain and a little anxious  or calm and unafraid .  if she detects  can she also impose .    insigna stared at him .   i think that s crazy .   she said  her voice choked in disbelief .    perhaps .  but have you ever noticed that sort of effect with marlene .  think about it .     i don t have to think .  i ve never noticed any such thing .     no   muttered genarr   i suppose you haven t .  she would certainly love to make you feel less nervous about herself  and she certainly fails to bring that about .  however  it is true  though  if we just cling to marlene s perceptive ability  that it has strengthened since she has arrived on erythro .  agreed .     yes .  agreed .     but it s more than that .  she s now strongly intuitive .  she knows that she is immune to the plague .  she is certain that nothing on erythro will harm her .  she stared down at the ocean in convinced knowledge that the aircraft wouldn t drop into it and drown her .  has she had this kind of attitude back on rotor .  hasn t she felt uncertain and insecure on rotor when there was reason to feel so  just as any other youngster might .     yes .  certainly .     but here she s a new girl .  totally sure of herself .  why .     i don t know why .     is erythro affecting her .  no no  i mean nothing like the plague .  is there some other effect .  something completely different .  i ll tell you why i ask .  i felt it myself .     felt what yourself .     a certain optimism about erythro .  i didn t mind the desolation  or anything else .  it s not that i was desperately put off by it before  that erythro made me seriously uneasy  but i never liked the planet .  on this trip with marlene  however  i came nearer to liking it than ever before in my ten years of residence here .  it was possible  i thought  that marlene s delight was contagious  or that she might somehow be forcing it on me .  or else whatever it is about erythro that is affecting her may be affecting me  too  in her presence .    insigna said sarcastically   i think  siever  that you had better have a brain scan yourself .    genarr raised his eyebrows .   do you think i haven t .  i ve undergone a check periodically ever since i ve been here .  there ve been no changes except those inseparable from the aging process .      but have you checked your mind pattern since getting back from the plane trip .     of course .  first thing .  i m no fool .  the complete analysis isn t back yet  but the preliminary work shows no change .     then what are you going to do next .     the logical thing .  marlene and i are going out of the dome  and out upon erythro s surface .     no .     we ll take precautions .  i ve been out there before .     you  perhaps   said insigna stubbornly .   not she .  never she .   genarr sighed .  he whirled in his chair  looking at the false window in the wall of his office as though he were trying to penetrate it and look out upon the redness beyond .  then he looked back at insigna .    out there is a huge brand new world   he said   one that belongs to no one and nothing except ourselves .  we can take that world and develop it with all the lessons we ve learned from our foolish mismanagement of our original world .  we can build a good world this time  a clean world  a decent world .  we can get used to the redness .  we can bring it to life with our own plants and animals .  we can make sea and land flourish and start the planet on its own course of evolution .     and the plague .  what of that .     we might eliminate the plague  and make erythro ideal for us .     if we eliminate the heat and the gravity  and alter the chemical composition  we can make megas ideal for us  too .     yes  eugenia  but you must admit that the plague is in a different category from heat  gravity  and global chemistry .     but the plague is just as deadly in its own way .     eugenia  i think i ve told you that marlene is the most important person we have .     she certainly is to me .     to you  she s important simply because she is your daughter .  to the rest of us  she is important for what she can do .     what can she do .  interpret our body language .  play tricks .     she is convinced she is immune to the plague .  if she is  that might teach us      if she is .  it s childish fantasy and you know it .  don t grasp at cobwebs .     there s a world out there  and i want it .     you sound like pitt after all .  for that world  will you risk my daughter .     in human history  much more has been risked for much less .     more shame to human history .  and in any case  it s up to me to decide .  she s my daughter .    and genarr said in a low voice that seemed to contain infinite sorrow   i love you  eugenia  but i lost you once .  i have had this feeble dream of perhaps trying to undo that loss .  but now i m afraid i must lose you again  and permanently .  because  you see  i m going to tell you that it s not up to you to decide .  it is not even up to me to decide .  it is up to marlene .  whatever she decides  she will do  somehow .  and because she may well have the ability to win humanity a world  i am going to help her do what she wants to do  despite you .  please  you must accept that  eugenia .        twenty four  detector       .     crile fisher studied the superluminal with a frozen expression .  it was the first time he had seen it  and a quick glance at tessa wendel made it quite plain that she was smiling with what he could only think of as proprietary pride .   it sat there in a huge cavern  inside a triple web of security barriers .  there were human beings present  but most of the work force consisted of carefully computerized  nonhumanoid  robots .   fisher had seen many spaceships in his time  and of a multiplicity of models used for a multiplicity of purposes  but he had never seen one like the superluminal  never seen one as repulsive in appearance .   had he seen it without knowing what it was  he might not have guessed  even  that it was a spaceship .  what did he say then .  on the one hand  he did not want to anger wendel .  on the other hand  she was clearly waiting for his opinion  and she just as clearly expected praise .   and so he said in a somewhat subdued voice   it has an eerie kind of grace  rather wasplike .    she had smiled at the phrase  eerie kind of grace   and fisher felt he had chosen well .  but then she said   what do you mean  wasplike   crile .     it s an insect i m referring to   said crile .   i know you re not aware of insects much on adelia .     we know about insects   said wendel .   we may not have earth s chaotic profusion      you probably don t have wasps .  stinging insects  shaped rather like    he pointed to the superluminal .   they  too  have a large bulge in front  another bulge in back  and a narrow connecting unit .     really .   she looked at the superluminal with a sudden sparking of new interest .   find me a picture of a wasp when you can .  i might understand the ship design better in the light of the insect  or vice versa  for that matter .    fisher said   why the shape  then  if it wasn t inspired by the wasp .     we had to find a geometry that would maximize the chance of the entire ship moving as a unit .  the hyperfield has a tendency to extend outward cylindrically to infinity  actually  and you let it have its way  to some extent .  on the other hand  you don t want to give in entirely .  you can t  in fact  so you have to seal it off in the bulges .  the field is just within the hull  maintained and enclosed by an intense and alternating electromagnetic field  and  you don t really want to hear all this  do you .     not any more  i think   said fisher  smiling slightly .   i ve heard enough .  but since i m finally allowed to see this      now don t be hurt   said wendel  putting her arm around his waist .   it was all strictly on a need to know basis .  there were times when they hated having me around .  they kept muttering  i imagine  about this suspicious settler who was entirely too nosy  and wishing that i hadn t been the one who had designed the hyperfield  so they could kick me out .  now  however  things have lightened to the point where i could arrange to have you come and see it .  you ll be on it eventually  after all  and i wanted you to admire it .   she hesitated  then added   and me .    he looked across at her and said   you know that i admire you  tessa  without any need for anything like this .   and he put his arm around her shoulder .    i m continuing to get older  crile   she said .   the process simply won t stop .  and i m also dismayingly satisfied with you .  i ve been with you seven years now  going on eight  and i haven t felt the old urge to see what other men might be like .    fisher said   is that a tragedy .  perhaps it s just the fact that you ve been so absorbed in the project .  now that the ship is completed  you ll probably have a feeling of release  and enough time to begin hunting again .     no .  i haven t the urge .  i just haven t .  but how about you .  i know i neglect you at times .     it s all right .  when you neglect me for your work  that suits me .  i want the ship as much as you do  dear  and one nightmare is that by the time it is finally ready  you and i will be too old to be allowed on .   he smiled again  this time with distinct ruefulness .   in your awareness of oncoming age  tessa  don t forget that i  too  am no longer a lad .  in less than two years  i ll be fifty .  but i have a question i m reluctant to ask for fear of disappointment  but i m going to  anyway .     ask away .     you arranged to have me see the ship  to be allowed into this holy of holies .  somehow i don t think that koropatsky would have allowed this if the project weren t near completion .  he s almost as diseased on security as tanayama was .     yes  as far as the hyperfield is concerned  the ship is ready .     has it flown .     not yet .  there are still things to do  but they don t involve the hyperfield itself .     there have to be test flights  i suppose .     with a crew aboard  of course .  there s no way of doing it crew less and still feel that the life support systems will work .  even animals won t give us the necessary assurance .     who will go on the first trip .     volunteers chosen from among those on the project who qualify .     how about you .     i m the only one who won t be a volunteer .  i must go .  i could trust no one else to make decisions in an emergency .     then i go  too .   said crile .   no  not you .    fisher s face instantly grew dark with anger .   the arrangement was      not on the test flights  crile .     when will they be over  then .     it s hard to say .  it depends on what troubles may develop .  if all goes as smoothly as possible  then two or three flights might suffice .  a matter of months .     when will the first test flight be .     that i don t know  crile .  we re still working on the ship .     you said it was ready to go .     yes  as far as the hyperfield is concerned .  but we re installing the neuronic detectors .     what are those .  i never heard you mention them .    wendel did not answer directly .  she looked around  quietly and thoughtfully  then said   we re attracting attention  crile  and i suspect that there are people here who feel nervous about your presence .  let s go home .    fisher did not move .   i take it you refuse to discuss this with me .  even though it happens to be vital to me .     we ll discuss it  at home .         .     crile fisher was restless  his fury increasing .  he refused to sit down and towered over tessa wendel  who had shrugged and taken a seat on the white modular couch and was now looking up at him  frowning .    why are you angry  crile .   fisher s lips were trembling .  he pressed them together and waited before answering  as though forcing himself to remain calm by sheer muscular effort .   he said finally   once a crew is made up without me  it will be a precedent .  i won t ever get on .  it must be understood from the beginning that i am on the ship every time until we reach the neighbor star  and rotor .  i don t want to be left out .    wendel said   why do you jump at conclusions .  you won t be omitted at the crucial time .  the ship isn t even ready to go yet .    fisher said   you said the ship was ready .  what are these neuronic detectors you re suddenly speaking of .  it s a device to keep me quiet  to keep me distracted  and then sneak the ship away before i realize i m left out .  that s what they re doing .  and you re playing along with it .     crile  you re mad .  the neuronic detector is my idea  my insistence  my desire .   she stared at him  unblinking  daring him to do something about it .    your idea .   he exploded .   but .  .  .   she held out her hand as if to silence him .   it s something we ve been working on concurrently with the ship .  it s not something that falls within my expertise  but i have driven the neurophysicists onward rather mercilessly to have it .  and the reason .  precisely because i want you on the ship when it leaves for the neighbor star .  don t you see .    he shook his head .   figure it out  crile .  you would if you weren t blind with rage for no sane reason .  it s perfectly straightforward .  it s a  neuronic detector .   it detects nerve activity at a distance .  complex nerve activity .  in short  it detects the presence of intelligence .    fisher stared at her .   you mean what doctors use in hospitals .     of course .  it s a routine tool in medicine and in psychology to detect mental disorders early on  but at meter distances .  i need it at astronomical distances .  it s not something new .  it s something old with a vastly increased range .  crile  if marlene s alive  she ll be on the settlement  on rotor .  rotor will be there  somewhere  circling the star .  i told you that it would not be easy to spot .  if we don t find it quickly  can we be sure that it s not there  and not that we just somehow missed it  like missing an island in the ocean or an asteroid in space .  do we just continue searching for months  or years  to make sure that we haven t just missed it  that it s really not there .     and the neuronic detector      will find rotor for us .     won t it be just as hard to detect      no  it won t .  the universe is overrun with light and radio waves and all kinds of radiation  and we ll have to distinguish one source from a thousand others  or from a million others .  it can be done  but it s not easy  and it may take time .  however  to get the precise electromagnetic radiation associated with neurons in complex relationship is quite unique .  we are not likely to have more than one source exactly like that  or if we do  it s because rotor has built another settlement .  there you have it .  i am as intent on finding your daughter for you as you are for finding her for yourself .  and why would i do that if i weren t intent on having you on the flight with us .  you ll be there .    fisher looked overwhelmed .    and you forced the entire project to do this .     i have considerable power over them  crile .  and there s more to it as well .  this is highly confidential  that s why i couldn t tell you at the ship .     oh .  and what might that be .   wendel said  and there was a softness in her voice   crile  i spend more time thinking of you than you think .  you don t know how strongly i want to spare you disappointment .  what if we find nothing at the neighbor star .  what if a sweep of the skies tells us definitely that there are no living intelligent life forms anywhere in its vicinity .  do we go straight home and report that we found no sign of rotor .  now  crile  don t go into one of your moods .  i m not saying that failure to find intelligence at the neighbor star will necessarily imply that rotor and its people have not survived .     what else can it imply .     they might have been so dissatisfied with the neighbor star that they decided to move on elsewhere .  perhaps they stopped long enough to mine some asteroids for new materials they would need for construction and for refurbishing the micro fusion motors .  then on they would go .     and if that were so  how can we know where they would be .     they ve been gone almost fourteen years .  with hyper assistance  they can travel only at the speed of light .  if they have reached any star and settled in its neighborhood  it would have to be at a star within fourteen light years distance of us .  there are not very many of those .  at superluminal velocity  we can visit each of those .  with neuronic detectors  we can quickly decide whether rotor is in the neighborhood of any of them .     they might be wandering through space between stars at this very moment .  how would we detect them then .     we wouldn t  but at least we increase our own chances just a bit if we investigate a dozen stars in six months with our neuronic detector  instead of spending that much time investigating one star in a futile search .  and if we fail  and we have to face the fact that we might fail  then at least we will return with considerable data on a dozen different stars  a white dwarf  a blue white hot star  a solar look alike  a close binary  and so on .  we re not likely to make more than one trip in our lifetime  so why not make it a good one  and go down in history with a huge bang  eh  crile .    crile said thoughtfully   i suppose you re right  tessa .  to comb a dozen stars and find nothing will be bad enough  but to search a single star vicinity and return thinking that rotor might have been somewhere else that was reachable but that we lacked the time to explore would be much worse .     exactly .     i ll try to remember that   said crile sadly .    another thing   said wendel .   the neuronic detector might detect intelligence not of earthly origin .  we wouldn t want to miss it .    fisher looked startled .   but that s not likely  is it .     not at all likely  but if it happens  all the more reason not to miss it .  especially if it is within fourteen light years of earth .  nothing in the universe can be as interesting as another intelligent life form  or as dangerous .  we d want to know about it .    fisher said   what are the chances of detecting it at all if it is not of earthly origin .  the neuronic detectors are geared for human intelligence only .  it seems to me that we wouldn t even recognize a really odd life form as being alive  let alone as being intelligent .    wendel said   we may not be able to recognize life  but we can t possibly fail to recognize intelligence  in my view  and it s not life but intelligence that we re after .  whatever intelligence might be  however strange  however unrecognizable  it has to involve a complex structure  a very complex structure  at least as complex as the human brain .  what s more  it s bound to involve the electromagnetic interaction .  gravitational attraction is too weak  the strong and weak nuclear interactions are too short range .  and as for this new hyperfield we re working with in superluminal flight  it doesn t exist in nature as far as any of us knows  but exists only when it is devised by intelligence .    the neuronic detector can detect an elaborately complex electromagnetic field that will signify intelligence no matter the form or chemistry into which that intelligence may be molded .  and we will be ready to either learn or run .  as for unintelligent life  that is not at all likely to be dangerous to a technological civilization such as ourselves  though any form of alien life  even at the virus stage  would be interesting .     and why must all this be kept secret .     because i suspect  in fact  i know  that the global congress will want us back very quickly so that they can be sure the project is successful and so that they can learn to build better models of superluminal vessels based on our experience with this prototype .  i  on the other hand  if things go well  would certainly want to see the universe and let them wait .  i don t say i ll definitely do it  but i want the option held open .  if they knew i was planning that  even thinking it   i suspect they would try to crew the ship with others whom they would consider more amenable to orders .    fisher smiled weakly .  wendel said   what s wrong  crile .  suppose there s no sign of rotor or its people .  would you then just want to go back to earth in disappointment .  the universe at your fingertips  but given up .     no .  i m just wondering how long will it take to put in the detectors and all the other things you might dream up .  in a little over two years  i ll be fifty .  at fifty  agents working for the office are routinely taken off field duty .  they get desk jobs on earth and are no longer allowed to take spaceflights .     well .     in a little over two years  i will no longer qualify for the flight .  they ll tell me i m too old  and the universe won t be at my fingertips after all .     nonsense .  they re going to let me go and i m over fifty right now .     you re a special case .  it s your ship .     you re a special case  too  since i will insist on you .  besides  they won t find it so easy to get qualified people to go on the superluminal .  it will be all we can do to persuade anyone to volunteer .  and they ll have to volunteer  we can t risk placing the trip into the hands of unwilling and frightened draftees .     why wouldn t they volunteer .     because they re earthmen  my good crile  and to almost all earthmen  space is a horror .  hyperspace is a greater horror still and they re going to hang back .  there is going to be you and me  and we re going to need three more volunteers and i tell you we ll have trouble getting them .  i ve sounded out many  and i have two good people with a halfway promise  chao li wu and henry jarlow .  i haven t got my third yet .  and even if  against all likelihood  there are as many as a dozen volunteers  they re not going to cut you out in favor of anyone else  for i will insist on your going with me as my ambassador to the rotorians  if that becomes necessary .  and if even that is not enough  i promise you that the ship will take off before you re fifty .    and now fisher smiled with honest relief and said   tessa  i love you .  you know  i really do .     no   said wendel   i don t know that you really do  especially when you say it in that tone of voice  as though the admission has caught you by surprise .  it s very odd  crile  but in the almost eight years we ve known each other  and lived together  and made love to each other  you ve never once said that .     haven t i .     believe me  i ve listened .  do you know what else is odd .  i ve never said that i loved you  and yet  i love you .  it didn t start that way .  what do you suppose happened .    fisher said in a low voice   it may be that we ve fallen in love with each other so gradually that we never noticed .  that may happen sometimes  don t you think .    and they smiled at each other shyly  as though wondering what they ought to do about it .       twenty five  surface       .     eugenia insigna was apprehensive .  more than that .    i tell you  siever  i haven t had a good night s sleep since you took her out in the aircraft .   her voice degenerated into what  in a woman of less firm character  might almost have been described as a whine .   wasn t the flight through air  off to the ocean and back  and coming back after nightfall  too  wasn t that enough for her .  why don t you stop her .     why don t i stop her .   said siever genarr slowly  as though he were tasting the question .   why don t i stop her .  eugenia  we have gotten past the stage of being able to stop marlene .     that s ridiculous  siever .  it s almost cowardly .  you re hiding behind her  pretending she s all powerful .      isn t she .  you re her mother .  order her to stay in the dome .   insigna s lips compressed .   she s fifteen .  i don t like to be tyrannical .     on the contrary .  you would love to be tyrannical .  but if you try  she ll look at you out of those clear extraordinary eyes of hers and say something like   mother  you feel guilty of having deprived me of my father  so you feel that the universe is conspiring to deprive you of me as punishment  and that s a silly superstition .    insigna frowned .   siever  that is the stupidest thing i ve ever heard .  i don t feel any such thing  and couldn t possibly .     of course you don t .  i was just making something up .  but marlene won t be .  she ll know  from the twitching of your thumb or the movement of your shoulder blade or something  just what is bothering you  and she ll tell you  and it will be so true  and so shameful  i suppose  that you will be too busy looking for ways to defend yourself  and you ll give in to her rather than have her keep peeling away the outer layers of your psyche .     don t tell me that s what s happened to you .     not much because she s fond of me  and i ve tried to be very diplomatic with her .  but if i cross her  i shudder to think what a shambles she ll make of me .  look  i ve managed to delay her .  give me credit for that .  she wanted to go out immediately after the plane trip .  and i held her off to the end of the month .     how did you do that .     pure sophistry  i assure you .  it s december .  i told her that  in three weeks  the new year would begin  at least if we go by earth standard time  and how best to celebrate the beginning of       i asked her  than to begin the new era of the exploration and settlement of erythro .  you know  she views her own penetration of the planet in that light  as the beginning of a new age .  which makes it worse .     why worse .     because she doesn t view it as a personal caprice  but as something of vital importance to rotor  or even to humanity  perhaps .  there s nothing like satisfying your personal pleasure and calling it a noble contribution to the general welfare .  it excuses everything .  i ve done it myself  so have you  so has everyone .  pitt  more than anyone else whom i know  does it .  he has probably convinced himself that he breathes only to contribute carbon dioxide to the plant life of rotor .     so  by playing on her megalomania  you had her wait .     yes  and it still gives us one more week to see if anything will stop her .  i might say  though  that my plea didn t fool her .  she agreed to wait  but she said   you think that if you delay me  you will win your way at least a little bit into the affections of my mother  don t you  uncle siever .  there s nothing about you that indicates you consider the coming of the new year of the slightest importance .       how unbearably rude  siever .     merely unbearably correct  eugenia .  same thing  perhaps .   insigna looked away .   my affections .  what can i say     genarr said quickly   why say anything .  i ve told you i loved you in the past  and i find that getting old  or getting older  hasn t much changed it .  but that s my problem .  you ve never treated me unfairly .  you never gave me reason to hope .  and if i m fool enough not to be able to take no for an answer  what concern is that of yours .     it concerns me that you re unhappy for any reason .     that counts for a lot right there .   genarr managed a smile .   it s infinitely better than nothing .    insigna looked away and  with obvious deliberation  returned to the topic of marlene .   but  siever  if marlene saw your motivation  why did she agree to the delay .     you won t like this  but i d better tell you the truth .  marlene said   i ll wait till the new year  uncle siever  because perhaps that will please mother  and i m on your side .       she said that .     please don t hold it against her .  i have obviously fascinated her with my wit and charm and she thinks she s doing you a favor .     she s a matchmaker   said insigna  obviously caught between annoyance and amusement .    it did occur to me that if you could bring yourself to show an interest in me  we could use that to persuade her into all sorts of things that she would think would further encourage the interest  except that it would have to be real or she would see through it .  and if it were real  she wouldn t feel it necessary to make sacrifices to bring about what was already so .  do you understand .     i understand   said insigna   that if it weren t for marlene s perceptiveness  you would be positively machiavellian in your approach to me .     you ve got me dead to rights  eugenia .     well  why not do the obvious thing .  lock her up and  eventually  carry her onto the rocket back to rotor .     bound hand and foot  i suppose .  aside from not thinking we could do such a thing  i ve managed to catch marlene s vision .  i m beginning to think of colonizing erythro  a whole world for the taking .     and breathing their alien bacteria  getting them into our food and water .   insigna s face curled into a grimace .    what of it .  we breathe  drink  and eat them  to an extent  right here .  we can t keep them out of the dome altogether .  for that matter  there are bacteria on rotor that we breathe  drink  and eat  too .     yes  but we re adapted to rotor s life .  these are alien bits of life .     all the safer .  if we re not adapted to them  neither are they to us .  there are no signs they can possibly parasitize us .  they would simply be so many innocuous dust particles .     and the plague .     that s the real difficulty  of course  even in the case of something as simple as letting marlene go outside the dome .  we will  of course  take precautions .     what kind of precautions .     she would wear a protective suit  for one thing .  for another  i ll go out with her .  i ll serve as her canary .     what do you mean   canary  .     it was a device they had on earth some centuries back .  miners carried canaries  you know  little yellow birds  into mines .  if the air went bad  the canary died before the men were affected  but the men  knowing there was a problem  would get out of the mine .  in other words  if i begin to act queerly  we ll both be brought in at once .     but what if it affects her before it affects you .     i don t think it will .  marlene feels immune .  she s said that so many times that i have begun to believe her .         .     eugenia insigna had never before watched the new year approaching with such a painful concentration on the calendar .  there had never been reason before .  for that matter  the calendar was a vestigial hangover  twice removed .   on earth  the year had begun by marking the seasons  and the holidays that related to the seasons  midsummer  midwinter  sowing  harvest  by whatever names they were called .   crile  insigna remembered  had explained the intricacies of the calendar to her  and had reveled in them in his dark and solemn way  as he did in everything that reminded him of earth .  she had listened to him with a mixture of ardor and apprehension  ardently because she wished to share his interest  as that might draw them closer together  apprehensively because she feared his interest in earth might drive him away from her  as eventually it did .   strange that she still felt the pang  but was it dimmer now .  it seemed to her that she could not actually remember crile s face  that she remembered only the remembering now .  was it only the memory of a memory that stood between her and siever genarr now .   and yet it was the memory of a memory that held rotor to the calendar now .  rotor had never had seasons .  it had the year  of course  for it  and all the settlements in the earth moon system  which left out only those few that circled mars or that were being built in the asteroid belt  accompanied earth on its path around the sun .  still  without seasons  the year was meaningless .  yet it was kept together with months and weeks .   rotor had the day  too  fixed artificially at twenty four hours during which sunlight was allowed to enter for half the time and blocked off for the other half .  it could have been fixed for any length of time  but it was fixed at the length of an earth day and divided into twentyfour hours of sixty minutes each  with each minute consisting of sixty seconds .   the days and nights were at least uniformly twelve hours long .    there had been occasional movements among the settlements to adopt a system of merely numbering days and grouping them into tens and multiples of tens  into dekadays  hectodays  kilodays  and  in the other direction  decidays  centidays  millidays  but that was really impossible .   the settlements could not set up each their own system for that would have reduced trade and communications to chaos .  n or was any unified system possible save that of earth  where    percent of the human population still lived  and to which ties of tradition still held the remaining   percent .  memory held rotor and all the settlements to a calendar that was intrinsically meaningless for them .   but now rotor had left the solar system and was a world that was isolated and alone .  no day  or month  or year in the earthly sense existed .  it was not even sunlight that marked day from night  for rotor gleamed with artificial daylight and darkened to a light whisper twelve hours on and twelve hours off .  the harsh precision was not even broken by the gradual dimming and brightening at the boundaries that might simulate twilight and dawn .  there seemed to be no need .  and within this all settlement division  individual homes kept their illumination on and off to suit their whims or needs  but counted the days by settlement time  which was earth time .   even here at the erythro dome  where there was a natural day and night that was casually used as such by those in occupation  it was the not quite matching settlement day length  still tied to that of earth  the memory of a memory  that was used in official calculations .   the movement was now stronger to leave the day as the only basic measure of time .  insigna knew for a fact that pitt favored the decimalization of time measure  and yet even he hesitated to suggest it officially  for fear of rousing wild opposition .   but perhaps not forever .  the traditional disorderly units of weeks and months seemed less important .  the traditional holidays were more frequently ignored .  insigna  in her astronomical work  used days as the only significant units .  someday the old calendar would die  and  in the far unseen future  new methods of agreed upon time marking would surely arise  a galactic standard calendar  perhaps .   but now she found herself marking off the time to a new year that began arbitrarily .  on earth  at least  the new year began at the time of a solstice  winter in the northern hemisphere  summer in the southern .  it had a relationship to earth s orbit around the sun that only the astronomers on rotor remembered clearly .   but now  even though insigna was an astronomer  the new year had to do only with marlene s venture onto the surface of erythro  a time chosen by siever genarr only because it involved a plausible delay  and accepted by insigna only because she was officiously concerning herself with a teenager s notion of romance .   insigna came out of her roaming through the depths of thought to find marlene regarding her solemnly .   when had she entered the room so silently  or was insigna so tied into an inner knot as to be unaware of footsteps .    insigna said in half a whisper   hello  marlene .    marlene said solemnly   you re not happy  mother .     you don t have to be superperceptive to see that  marlene .  are you still determined to step out on erythro .     yes .  entirely .  completely .     why  marlene  why .  can you explain it so i can understand .     no  because you don t want to understand .  it s calling me .     what s calling you .     erythro is .  it wants me out there .   marlene s ordinarily glum face seemed suffused with a furtive happiness .   insigna snapped   when you talk like that  marlene  you simply give me the impression that you are already infected by the  the      the plague .  i m not .  uncle siever has just had another brain scan taken of me .  i told him he didn t have to  but he said we had to have it for the record before we left .  i m perfectly normal .     brain scans can t tell you everything   said insigna  frowning .  marlene said   neither can a mother s fears .   then  more softly   mother  please  i know you want to delay this  but i won t accept a delay .  uncle siever has promised .  even if it rains  even if it s bad weather  i m going out .  at this time of the year  there are never real storms or temperature extremes .  there are almost never at any time of the year .  it s a wonderful world .     but it s barren  dead .  except for germs    insigna said spitefully .   but someday we ll put life of our own upon it .   marlene looked away  her eyes lost in dreaming .   i m sure of it   she said .        .      the e suit is a simple suit   said siever genarr .   it doesn t have to withstand pressure .  it s not a diving suit or a spacesuit .  it has a helmet  and it has a compressed air supply that can be regenerated  and a small heat exchange unit that keeps the temperature comfortable .  and it s airtight  obviously .     will it fit me .   asked marlene  looking at the display of thickish pseudo textile material with distaste .    not fashionably so   said genarr  his eyes twinkling .   it isn t made for beauty  but for use .    marlene said in a slightly exasperated tone   i m not interested in looking beautiful  uncle siever  but i don t want to be slopping around in it .  if it makes walking hard  it won t be worth it .    eugenia insigna interrupted .  she had been watching  a little white faced and pinch lipped .   the suit is necessary to protect you  marlene .  i don t care how sloppy it is .     but it doesn t have to be uncomfortable  mother  does it .  if it happens to fit  it would protect me just the same .     this will fit fairly well  actually   said genarr .   it s the best we could find .  after all  we only have them in adult sizes .   he turned his head toward insigna .   we don t use them much these days .  there was a time after the plague died down that we did some exploring  but by now we know the immediate surroundings quite well  and on the rare occasions we do go out  we tend to use enclosed e cars .     i wish you d use an enclosed e car now .     no   said marlene  obviously pained at the suggestion .  i ve been out in a vehicle .  i want to walk .  i want to  feel the ground .     you re mad   said insigna discontentedly .   marlene fired back   will you stop implying      where s your perceptivity .  i wasn t referring to the plague .  i mean just plain mad  just mad in the ordinary sense .  i mean  please  marlene  you re driving me mad  as well .    she then said   siever  if these are old e suits  how do you know they don t leak .     because we ve tested them  eugenia .  i assure you they re in good working order .  remember  i m going out with her  and also in a suit .    insigna was clearly seeking objections .    and suppose you suddenly have to    she waved her hand meaninglessly .    urinate .  is that what you mean .  that can be taken care of  though it s not comfortable .  still  it won t arise .  we ve emptied our bladders and we re good for several hours  or should be .  and we re not venturing far off  so in case of emergency  we can come back to the dome .  we ought to leave now  eugenia .  conditions are good outside and we should take advantage of that .  here  marlene  let me help you with your suit .    insigna said sharply   don t sound so happy .     why not .  to tell you the truth  i would like to step out myself .  the dome can easily start to feel like a prison  you know .  maybe if we all stepped out more  our people could endure longer shifts in the dome .  there you are  marlene  we only have to fit on the helmet  now .    marlene hesitated .   just a minute  uncle siever .   she walked toward insigna  holding out her arm  suited and bulky .   insigna gazed at her mournfully .    mother   said marlene .   once again  please be calm .  i love you and i wouldn t do this and cause you such anxiety just to please myself .  i do it only because i know i will be fine and that you need not be anxious .  and i bet you want to get into an e suit also  so you can come out and never lose sight of me  but you mustn t .     why mustn t i  marlene .  how will i forgive myself if something happens to you and i m not there to help you .     but nothing will happen to me .  and even if something does  which it won t  what could you do about it .  besides  you re so afraid of erythro that your mind is probably open to all kinds of abnormal effects .  what if the plague should strike you rather than me .  how would you expect me to live with that .     she s right  eugenia   said genarr .   i ll be out there with her  and the best thing you can do is stay here and remain calm .  all e suits are equipped with radios .  marlene and i will be able to hear each other  and we will be in communication with the dome .  i promise you  if she behaves queerly in any way at all  if there is even the suspicion of oddness  i ll have her inside the dome at once .  and if i feel in any way not quite my own normal self  i will come back at once  bringing marlene with me .    insigna shook her head and did not look comforted as she watched the helmet being fitted first over marlene s head  and then over genarr s .   they were near the dome s main airlock and insigna watched its manipulation .  she knew the lock procedure perfectly well  one could scarcely be a settler otherwise .   there was the delicate control of air pressure to make sure that there would be a gentle transfer of air from the dome outward  never from erythro inward .  there were computerized checks at every moment to make sure there were no leaks .   and then the inner door opened .  genarr stepped into the airlock and beckoned marlene inward .  she followed  and the door closed .  the two were lost to immediate sight .  insigna distinctly felt her heart miss a beat .   she watched the controls and knew exactly when the outer door slid open and  then  when it closed again .  the holoscreen sprang to life and she could see the two suited figures on it  standing on the barren soil of erythro .   one of the engineers handed a small earplug to insigna  who inserted it into her right ear .  an equally small microphone was fitted over her head .   a voice in her ear said   radio contact   and at once  the familiar voice of marlene sounded .   can you hear me  mother .     yes  dear   said insigna .  her voice sounded dry and abnormal in her own ear .    we re out here and it s wonderful .  it couldn t be nicer .     yes  dear    insigna repeated  feeling hollow and lost and wondering whether she would ever see her daughter in her right mind again .        .     siever genarr felt almost lighthearted as he stepped out upon the surface of erythro .  the sloping wall of the dome  behind him  reached upward  but he kept his back to it  for a sight so un erythronian would have spoiled the savor of the world .   savor .  it was a queer word to use for erythro  for at the moment it had no meaning .  he lived behind the protection of his helmet  breathing the air of the dome  or at least the air that had been purified and conditioned within the dome .  he could not smell the planet  or taste it  within that shelter .   and yet there was a feel to it that made him oddly happy .  his boots crunched slightly upon the ground .  although erythro s surface was not rocky  it was rather gravelly and  between the bits of gravel  there was what he could only describe as soil .  there was  of course  ample water and air to break up the primordial surface rock and  perhaps  the ubiquitous prokaryotes had  in their countless trillions  added their own work patiently over the billions of years .   the soil felt soft .  it had rained the day before  the soft and steady misty rain of erythro  or at least of this portion of erythro .  the soil still felt slightly damp as a result  and genarr imagined the bits of soil  the tiny scraps of sand and loam and clay  each with its coat of water film that had been refreshed and renewed .  in that film  prokaryotic cells lived happily  basking in the energy of nemesis  building complex proteins out of simple ones  while other prokaryotes  indifferent to solar energy  made use  instead of the energy content of the remnants of those prokaryotes that  in their countless trillions  died during each moment of time .   marlene was at his side .  she was looking upward  and genarr said gently   don t stare at nemesis  marlene .    marlene s voice sounded naturally in his ear .  it contained no tension or apprehension .  rather  her voice was filled with quiet joy .  she said   i m looking at the clouds  uncle siever .    genarr looked up into the dark sky where  by squinting for a while  one could detect a faint greenish yellow gleam .  against it were the feathery fair weather clouds that caught nemesis  light and reflected it in orange splendor .   there was an eerie quiet about erythro .  there was nothing to make a sound .  no form of life sang  roared  growled  bellowed  twittered  stridulated  or creaked .  there were no leaves to rustle  no insects to hum .  in the rare storms  there might be the rumble of thunder  or the wind might sigh against the occasional boulder  if it blew hard enough .  on a peaceful  calm day  however  as this one was  it was silent .   genarr spoke just to make sure that it was quiet and that he had not suddenly been struck deaf .   he couldn t have been  to be sure  for he heard the faint rasp of his own breath .     are you all right  marlene .     i feel wonderful .  there s a brook up there .   and she hastened her steps into an almost shambling run  hampered as she was by her e suit .   he said   watch out  marlene .  you ll slip .     i ll be careful .   her voice was not dimmed by increasing distance  of course  since it was a radio beam that carried it .   eugenia insigna s voice sounded suddenly in genarr s ear .   why is marlene running  siever .   then  almost at once  she added   why are you running  marlene .    marlene did not bother to answer  but genarr said   she just wants to look at some creek or other up ahead  eugenia .     is she all right .     of course she is .  it s weirdly beautiful out here .  after a while  it doesn t even seem barren  more like an abstract painting .     never mind the art criticism  siever .  don t let her get away from you .     don t worry .  i m in constant contact with her .  right now  she hears what you and i are saying  and if she doesn t answer  it s because she doesn t want to be bothered by irrelevancies .  eugenia  relax .  marlene is enjoying herself .  don t spoil it .    genarr was indeed convinced that marlene was enjoying herself .  somehow he was  too .   marlene was running upstream along the brook s edge .  genarr felt no great urgency to follow her .  let her enjoy herself  he thought .   the dome itself was built on a rocky outcropping  but the region in this direction was interlaced with small gently flowing brooks that all combined into a rather large river some thirty kilometers away that  in turn  flowed into the sea .   the brooks were welcome  of course .  they supplied the dome with its natural water supply  once the prokaryote content was removed  actually   killed  was the better word  .  there had been some biologists  in the early days of the dome  who had objected to the killing of the prokaryotes  but that was ridiculous .  the tiny specks of life were so incredibly numerous on the planet  and could proliferate so rapidly to replace any shrinkage of their numbers  that no amount of ordinary killing in the process of ensuring a water supply could hurt them in any significant way .  then  once the plague began  a vague but strong hostility to erythro rose up  and  after that  no one cared what one did to the prokaryotes .   of course  now that the plague did not seem to be much of  a threat any longer  humanitarian feelings  genarr privately felt that  biotarian  was the better word  might rise again .  genarr sympathized with those feelings  but then what would the dome do for a water supply .   lost in thought  he was no longer looking at marlene  and the shriek sounded deafeningly in his ear .   marlene .  marlene .  siever  what is she doing .    now he looked up  and was about to answer with automatic reassurance that nothing was wrong  that all was well  when he caught sight of marlene .   for a moment  he could not tell what she was doing .  he just stared at her in the pink light of nemesis .   then he made it out .  she was unhitching her helmet and was taking it off .  now she was working at removing the rest of her e suit .   he had to stop this .   genarr tried to call out to her  but in the horror of the emergency  he couldn t find his voice .  he tried to run to her  but his legs felt leaden  and barely responded to the urgency of his feelings .   it was as though he found himself in a nightmare where dreadful things were happening  and he could do nothing to prevent them .  or  perhaps  his mind  under the stress of events  was dissociating from his body .   is this the plague  striking at me .  genarr wondered in panic .  and  if so  what will happen to marlene now  as she is baring herself to the light of n emesis and the air of erythro .       twenty six  planet       .     crile fisher had seen igor koropatsky only twice in the three years since he had assumed the post formerly held by tanayama  and had become the actual  if not the titular  head of the project .   he had no trouble recognizing him  however  when the photoentry had signaled his image .  koropatsky was still his portly  outwardly genial self .  he was dressed well  with a large and fluffy cravat in the latest style .   as for fisher  he had been relaxing through the morning and was scarcely presentable  but one did not refuse to receive koropatsky  even when he came without warning .   fisher signaled the tactful  hold  image  the cartoon figure of a welcoming host  or hostess  for the sex was made conventionally ambiguous  with a hand upraised delicately in a gesture that was universally understood to mean  just a minute  without the crassness of actually saying so .   fisher had a few moments to comb his hair and adjust his clothes .  he might have shaved  but he felt that koropatsky would consider any further delay insulting .   the door slid aside and koropatsky walked in .  he smiled pleasantly and said   good morning  fisher .  i intrude upon you  i know .     no intrusion  director   said fisher  making an effort to sound sincere   but if you wish to see dr .  wendel  she is  i m afraid  at the ship .    koropatsky grunted .   you know  i rather thought she might be .  i have no choice  then  but to talk to you .  may i sit down .     yes  of course  director   said fisher  chagrined at not having offered koropatsky a seat before the request was made .   would you care for refreshment .     no .   koropatsky patted his abdomen .   i weigh myself every morning and that alone is sufficient to cost me my appetite  almost .  fisher  i have never had a chance to talk to you  man to man .  i have wanted to .     it is my pleasure  director   mumbled fisher  beginning to grow uneasy .  what was this all about .    our planet is in debt to you .     if you say so  director   said fisher .   you were on rotor before it left .     that was fourteen years ago  director .     i know it was .  you were married on rotor and had a child .     yes  director   said fisher in a low voice .    but you returned to earth just before rotor left the solar system .     yes  director .     it was from something that was said to you  and that you repeated here  plus another suggestion you made that led to earth s discovery of the neighbor star .     yes  director .     and it was you who brought dr .  tessa wendel from adelia to earth .     yes  director .     and you have made it possible for her to work here for over eight years  and kept her happy  eh .    he chuckled deeply and fisher felt that had koropatsky been closer he would have dug his elbow into fisher s side in a man to man fashion .   fisher said cautiously   we get along well  director .     but you have never married .     i am already married  director .     and separated fourteen years .  a divorce could be quickly arranged .     i also have a daughter .     who would remain your daughter  even if you married again .     it would be a meaningless formality  surely .     well  perhaps .   koropatsky nodded .    and perhaps it even works better this way .  you know the superluminal ship is ready to move .  we hope to launch it at the beginning of      .     so i have been told by dr .  wendel  director .     the neuronic detectors are installed and work well .     i have been told that  too  director .    koropatsky held one hand in the other in his lap and nodded his large head ponderously .  then he looked up quickly at fisher and said   do you know how it works .    fisher shook his head .   no  sir .  i know nothing about the actual workings of the ship .    koropatsky nodded his head again .   nor i .  we have to accept the word of dr .  wendel and our engineers .  one thing is still lacking  though .     oh .    cold anxiety swept over fisher .  more delay .    what is lacking  director .     communications .  i would think that if there is a device that can make a ship move much faster than light  there should also be a device that would send waves  or some other form of message carrying device  faster than light  too .  it seems to me it would be easier to send a superluminal message than drive a superluminal ship .     i can t say  director .     yet dr .  wendel assures me that the reverse is true  that  as yet  there is no method of efficient superluminal communication .  eventually  there will be  she says  but not now  and she doesn t want to wait for such communication  which  she says  may take a long time .     i don t want to wait either  director .     yes  i m anxious for progress and success .  we ve been waiting years already  and i am eager to see the ship leave and return .  but it does mean that once the ship leaves  we will be out of contact .    he nodded thoughtfully  and fisher maintained a discreet silence .   what was all this about .  what was the old bear getting at .        koropatsky looked up at fisher .   you know that the neighbor star is heading in our direction .     yes  director  i ve heard of that  but it seems to be the common feeling that it will pass us at a great enough distance to leave us unaffected .     that s the feeling we want people to have .  now the truth is  fisher  that the neighbor star will pass closely enough to disturb earth s orbital motion substantially .    fisher paused for a moment in shock .    and destroy the planet .     not physically .  the climate will be sufficiently changed  however  so that earth will no longer be habitable .     is that certain .   said fisher  reluctant to believe it .   i don t know that scientists are ever really certain .  but they seem sufficiently close to certain to make it necessary for us to begin to take measures .  we have five thousand years  and we are developing superluminal flight  assuming the ship works .     if dr .  wendel says it will work  director  i m convinced it will .     let s hope your confidence is not misplaced .  nevertheless  even five thousand years with superluminal flight leaves us in a bad spot .  we would have to build a hundred and thirty thousand settlements like rotor to carry off earth s eight billion people plus enough plants and animals to set up viable worlds .  that s twenty six noah s arks a year  starting right now .  that s assuming there s no increase in population over the next five thousand years .     perhaps   said fisher cautiously   we can handle an average of twenty six a year .  our experience and expertise should increase with the centuries  and our population control has worked for decades .     very well .  now tell me this  if we do lift earth s population into space in one hundred and thirty thousand settlements  making use of earth s full resources  plus those of the moon  mars  and the asteroids  and abandon the solar system to the gravitational mercies of the neighbor star  where do all these settlements go .     i don t know  director   said fisher .   we will have to find planets sufficiently earth like to accept our vast population without prohibitive requirements for terraforming .  we must think of that  too  and we must think of it now  not five thousand years from now .     even if we don t find suitable planets  we can put the settlements into orbit about suitable stars .   inevitably  fisher made circular movements with his finger .    my dear man  that wouldn t work .     with all respect  director  it does work right here in the solar system .     not at all .  there s a planet here in the solar system that even today  despite all the settlements  contains    percent of the human species .  we are still humanity  and the settlements are just a kind of fluff that surrounds us .  could the fluff exist by itself .  we have no proof that they can  and i think not .     you may be right  director   said fisher .   may be .  there s no doubt about it   said koropatsky heatedly .  the settlers affect to despise us  but we fill their thoughts .  we re their history .  we re their model .  we re the teeming source to which they return again and again for re invigoration .  left to themselves  they would wither .     you may be right  director  but the experiment has never been tried .  we have never had a situation in which settlements tried to exist without a planet      but we have had such a situation  at least in analogy .  in earth s early history  human beings settled islands and were isolated from the mainstream .  the irish settled iceland  the norse settled greenland  the mutineers settled pitcairn island  the polynesians settled easter island .  result .  the colonists withered  sometimes disappeared entirely .  always stagnation .  no civilization ever developed except in a continental area  or in islands in close proximity to a continental area .  humanity needs space  size  variety  a horizon  a frontier .  you see .    fisher said   yes  director .    past a certain point  why argue .    so that   and koropatsky put his right forefinger on his left palm  didactically   we must find a planet  at least one planet to begin with .  which brings us to rotor .    fisher raised his eyebrows in surprise .   to rotor  director .     yes .  in the fourteen years since they ve left  what s happened to them .     dr .  wendel is of the opinion that they may not have survived .    he felt a pang saying it .  he always felt a pang when he thought about it .     i know she does .  i ve talked to her  and i ve accepted what she has said without discussion .  but i d like your opinion .     i don t have one  director .  i have only the earnest hope that they have survived .  i have a daughter on rotor .     perhaps you still have .  think .  what was there to have destroyed them .  a malfunctioning part .  rotor is not a ship  but a settlement that for fifty years had had no serious malfunction .  it traveled through empty space between here and the neighbor star and what can be more harmless than empty space .     a mini black hole  an undetected asteroidal body      what evidence .  those are just guesses and of almost zero probability  the astronomers tell me .  is it something about the inherent properties of hyperspace that may have destroyed rotor .  we ve been experimenting with hyperspace for years now and there is nothing inherently dangerous in it that we can find .  so we can suppose that rotor reached the neighbor star safely  if that s where they went  and all seem to agree that it makes no sense to suppose they went anywhere else .     i would like to think that they arrived safely .     but then the question arises  if rotor is safe at the neighbor star  what is it doing there .     existing .    it was halfway between a statement and a question .    but how .  circling the neighbor star .  a single settlement on an endless  lonely journey about a red dwarf star .  i don t think so .  they would wither  and it would not take them long to realize that .  i am sure they would wither fast .     and die .  is that your conclusion  director .     no .  they would give up and come home .  they would acknowledge defeat and come back to safety .  however  they have not done so  and do you know what i ve been thinking .  i ve been thinking they ve found a habitable planet at the neighbor star .     but there can t be a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star  director .  there s a shortage of energy  unless you get so close that there s too much tidal effect .   he paused and muttered  shamefaced   dr .  wendel explained that to me .     yes  astronomers have explained it to me  too .  but   he shook his head   experience has taught me that no matter how sure scientists think they are  nature has a way of surprising them .  anyway  do you understand why we are letting you go on this voyage .     yes  director .  your predecessor promised i would go in return for services rendered .     i have a better reason than that .  my predecessor  who was a great man  an admirable man  was also a sick old man at the end .  his enemies thought that he had become paranoid .  he believed rotor knew of earth s danger and had left without warning us because they wanted earth destroyed  and that rotor must therefore be punished .  however  he is gone  and i am here .  i am not old  or sick  or paranoid .  assuming rotor is safe and is at the neighbor star  it is not our intention to harm them .     i m glad of that  but isn t this something you ought to discuss with dr .  wendel  director .  she is to be the captain of the ship .     dr .  wendel is a settler .  you are a loyal earthman .     dr .  wendel has worked loyally for years on the superluminal project .     that she has been loyal to the project is beyond question .  but is she loyal to earth .  can we count on her to carry out the letter and the spirit of earth s intentions toward rotor .     may i ask  director  just what earth s intentions are toward rotor .  i take it that there is no longer the intention of punishing the settlement for its failure to warn us .     that is correct .  what we want now is association  human brotherhood  only the kindliest of feelings .  with friendship established  there must be a quick return with as much information as possible about rotor and its planet .     surely if dr .  wendel is told this  if she has this explained to her  she will carry it out .    koropatsky chuckled .   one would think so  but you know how it is .  she is a woman who is not in the first bloom of youth .  a fine woman  i have no fault to find  but she is in her fifties .     what of that .    fisher found himself offended .     she must know that when she comes back  with the vital experience of a successful superluminal flight  she will be more valuable to us than ever  that she will be needed to design newer  better  more advanced superluminal vessels  that she will have to train young people as superluminal pilots .  she will be quite sure that she will never be allowed to venture out through hyperspace again  for she will simply be too valuable to risk .  therefore  before coming back  she may be tempted to explore further .  she may not wish to abandon the thrill of seeing new stars and penetrating new horizons .  but we cannot have her take one risk more than she must take to reach rotor  gain the information  and return .  we cannot afford the time lost either .  do you understand .   his voice had become hard .   fisher swallowed .   surely you have no real reason      i have every reason .  dr .  wendel has always been in a delicate position here  as a settler .  you understand  i hope .  of all the people on earth  she is the one we depend on most  and she is a settler .  she has had to be the subject of a detailed psychological profile .  she has been extensively studied  with and without her knowledge  and we are quite certain that  given the chance  she will go off exploring .  and she will be out of communication with us .  we won t know where she is  what she is doing .  we won t even know if she is alive .     and why are you telling me all this  director .     because we know you have great influence over her .  she can be guided by you  if you are firm .     i think  perhaps  you overestimate my influence  director .     i am sure we don t .  you  too  have been much studied  and we know exactly how bound the good doctor is to you  perhaps more than you yourself realize .  we know  also  that you are a loyal son of earth .  you might have left with rotor  stayed with your wife and daughter  but you returned to earth at the cost of losing them .  you did that  moreover  knowing that my predecessor  director tanayama  would consider you a failure for failing to bring information back concerning hyper assistance  and that your career might well be ruined .  that satisfies me that i can count on you to see to it that dr .  wendel is kept under firm control and is brought back to us quickly and that you will  this time  this time  bring back the information we need .     i ll try  director   said fisher .   you say that dubiously   said koropatsky .   please understand the importance of what i am asking you to do .  we must know just what they re doing  how strong they are  and what the planet is like .  once we know all that  we will know what we must do  and how strong we must be  and for what kind of a life we must be prepared .  because  fisher  we must have a planet  and we must have it now .  and we have no choice but to take rotor s planet .     if it exists   said fisher hoarsely .   it had better exist   said koropatsky .   earth s survival depends upon it .        twenty seven  life       .     siever genarr opened his eyes slowly and blinked at the light .  he had a little trouble focusing at first and couldn t quite make out whatever filled his vision .   the image sharpened slowly and soon genarr recognized ranay d  aubisson  chief neurophysicist of the dome .   genarr said in a weak voice   marlene .    d  aubisson looked grim .   she seems well .  it s you i m concerned about right now .    a pang of apprehension made its way through genarr s vitals and he tried to drown it with his sense of black humor .  he said   i must be worse off than i thought if the angel of the plague is here .    then  as d  aubisson said nothing  genarr asked sharply    am i .   she seemed to come to life .  tall and angular  she bent over him  the fine wrinkles about her piercing blue eyes becoming more prominent as she squinted at him .    how do you feel .   she asked  answering no questions .    tired .  very tired .  all right  otherwise .  i think .   the rising inflection serve to repeat his earlier question .   she said   you ve been sleeping for five hours .   she was still not answering .   genarr groaned .   i m tired anyway .  and i have to go to the bathroom .   he began to struggle into a sitting position .   at d  aubisson s signal a young man approached rapidly .  respectfully  he placed his hand under genarr s elbow and was indignantly shaken off .   d  aubisson said   please let yourself be helped .  we have made no diagnosis yet .    when genarr was back in bed ten minutes later  he said ruefully   no diagnosis .  have you made a brain scan .     yes  of course .  instantly .     well .    she shrugged .   we found nothing of importance  but you were asleep .  we will take another when you re awake .  and you must be observed in other ways .     why .  isn t the brain scan enough .    her gray eyebrows rose .   do you think it is .     no games .  what are you getting at .  say it straight out .  i m not a child .    d  aubisson sighed .   the cases of the plague we have had showed interesting features on brain scan  but we were never able to compare it with the pre plague standard because none of the sufferers had been scanned prior to onset .  by the time we set up a routine and universal brain scanning program for all people in the dome  there were no longer any unmistakable cases of the plague .  did you know this .     don t lay traps for me   said genarr pettishly .   of course i knew of it .  do you think my memory is gone .  i deduce  then  i can still deduce  too  you know  that although you have my scan of earlier days and can compare it with the scan you just took  you found nothing of significance .  is that it .     you obviously do not have anything remarkably wrong  but we might have something we would consider a subclinical situation .     if you find nothing .     we might not notice a subtle change if we re not specifically looking for it .  after all  you collapsed and you are not ordinarily given to collapsing  commander .     take another scan now that i m awake  then  and if it s something so subtle it escapes you  then i ll live with it .  but tell me about marlene .  are you sure she s well .     i said she seems well  commander .  unlike you  she showed no abormality of behavior .  she did not collapse .     and is she safely inside the dome .     yes  she brought you in herself  just before you fell unconscious .  don t you remember .    genarr flushed  and mumbled something .   d  aubisson s look grew sardonic .   suppose you tell us exactly what you do remember  commander .  tell us everything .  any of it may be important .    genarr s discomfort increased as he tried to remember .  it seemed a long time ago and the edges were blurred  very much as though it were a dream he was trying to recall .    marlene was taking off her e suit .   then  weakly   wasn t she .     quite .  she came in without it and we had to send someone out there to retrieve it .     well  i tried to stop her  of course  when i noticed what she was doing .  dr .  insigna called out  i remember  and that alerted me .  marlene was a distance away from me  by the stream .  i tried to call out  but  in the shock of the situation i couldn t manage to make a sound just at first .  i tried to get to her quickly  to  to      run to her   put in d  aubisson .   yes  but  but      but you found you couldn t run .  you were almost in a state of paralysis .  am i correct .    genarr nodded .   yes .  rather .  i tried to run  but  did you ever have one of those nightmares where you are pursued and somehow you can t manage to make yourself run .     yes .  we all have those .  it usually comes when we have managed to tangle our arms or legs in the bedclothes .     it felt like a dream .  i managed to get my voice  at last  and shouted at her  but without the e suit  she couldn t hear me  i m sure .     did you feel faint .     not really .  just helpless and confused .  at though it were not even any use in trying to run .  then marlene saw me and ran toward me .  she must somehow have recognized i was in trouble .     she didn t seem to have any trouble running .  is that right .     i wasn t aware that she was .  she seemed to reach me .  then we ll be honest  ranay .  i don t remember after that .     you came into the dome together   said d  aubisson calmly .   she was helping you  holding you up .  and once in the dome  you collapsed and now  here you are .     and you think i have the plague .     i think you experienced something abnormal  but i can find nothing in your brain scan  and i am puzzled .  there you have it .     it was the shock of seeing marlene in danger .  why should she be taking off her e suit if she weren t    he stopped abruptly .    if she weren t succumbing to the plague .  is that it .     the thought crossed my mind .     but she seems fine .  would you like to sleep some more .     no .  i m awake .  take another brain scan and see to it that it comes out negative because i feel much better now that i have the story off my chest .  and then i m going about my business  you harpy .     even if the brain scan is apparently normal  commander  you ll stay in bed for at least twenty four hours .  for observation  you understand .    genarr groaned theatrically .   you can t do that .  i can t lie here and stare at the ceiling for twenty four hours .     you won t have to .  we can set up a viewing stand for you  so that you can read a book or enjoy holovision .  you can even have a visitor or two .     i suppose the visitors will be observing me  too .     it s conceivable they may be questioned on the matter .  and now we ll set up the brain scan equipment again .   she turned away  then turned back with a smile that softened slightly at the edges .   it s very possible you re all right  commander .  your reactions seem normal to me .  but we must be sure  mustn t we .    genarr grunted  and when d  aubisson turned again and walked away  he made a face at her straight back .  that  he decided  was a normal reaction  too .        .     when genarr opened his eyes again  it was to see eugenia insigna gazing at him sadly .   he looked surprised and began to sit up .   eugenia .    she smiled at him  but that did not make her face look less sad .  she said   they said i could come in  siever .  they said you were all right .    genarr felt a wave of relief .  he knew he was all right  but it was nice to hear that his opinion was confirmed .   he said with bravado   of course i am .  brain scan normal  asleep .  brain scan normal  awake .  brain scan normal  forever .  but how s marlene .     her brain scan is perfectly normal  too .   even that did not lighten her mood .    as you see   said genarr   i was marlene s canary  as i had promised .  i was affected by whatever it was before she was .   and then his mood changed .  it was no time for banter .   he said   eugenia  how can i excuse myself to you .  i wasn t watching marlene to begin with  and i was too paralyzed with horror to do anything afterward .  i failed completely  and did so after my telling you with such confidence that i would take care of her .  honestly  i have no excuse .    insigna was shaking her head .   no  siever .  it was in no way your fault .  i m so glad she brought you in .     not my fault .   genarr felt dumbfounded .  of course it was his fault .    not at all .  there s something much worse than marlene foolishly removing her suit  or you being unable to act quickly .  much worse .  i m sure of it .    genarr felt himself turning cold .  what s much worse .  he thought .   what are you trying to tell me .    he swung himself out of bed and suddenly became aware of his bare legs and of the totally inadequate gown he was wearing .  he hastily draped the light blanket around himself .   he said   please sit down and tell me .  is marlene all right .  are you hiding something about her .    insigna sat down and looked solemnly at genarr .   they say she s all right .  the brain scan is entirely normal .  those who know about the plague say she shows no symptoms .     well then  why are you sitting there as though it s the end of the world .     i think it is  siever .  of this one .     what does that mean .     i can t explain .  i can t reason it out .  you have to talk to marlene to understand .  she s going her own way  siever .  she s not upset over what she did .  she insists that she cannot properly explore erythro  experience erythro is the phrase she uses  with the e suit on and she has no intention of wearing one any longer .     in that case  she won t go out .     oh  but marlene says she will .  quite confidently .  whenever she wishes  she says .  and alone .  she blames herself for having let you come with her .  she s not callous over what happened to you  you see .  over that  she is upset .  and she was glad she reached you in time .  really  there were tears in her eyes when she talked about what might have happened if she hadn t walked you into the dome in time .     doesn t that make her feel insecure .     no .  that s the oddest part of it .  she s now sure that you were in danger  that anyone would have been in danger .  but not she .  she is so positive  siever  i could    she shook her head  then muttered   i don t know what to do .     she s a positive girl by nature  eugenia .  you must know that better than i do .     not this positive .  it s as though she knows we can t stop her .     perhaps we can .  i ll talk to her and if she pulls any of this  you can t stop me   when she talks to me  i ll just send her back to rotor  and at once .  i was on her side  but after what happened to me outside the dome  i m afraid i m going to have to be tough .     but you won t .     why not .  because of pitt .     no .  i mean you just won t .    genarr stared at her  then laughed uneasily .   oh come  i m not that much under her spell .  i may feel like a kindly uncle  eugenia  but i m not so kindly i ll let her walk into danger .  there are limits  and you ll find that i know how to set them .   he paused  and said ruefully   we seem to have changed sides  you and i .  before today it was you who insisted on stopping her and i who said it couldn t be done .  now it s the other way around .     that s because the incident outside has frightened you  and the experience since then has frightened me .     what experience since then  eugenia .     i tried to set the limits  after she was back in the dome .  i said to her   young lady  don t you dare speak to me like that or  far from not being able to leave the dome  you won t be able to leave your room .  you ll be locked in  tied up if necessary  and back to rotor we ll go on the first rocket .   you see  i was wild enough to threaten her all the way .     well  what did she do .  i m willing to bet a large sum she didn t burst into tears .  i suspect she gritted her teeth and defied you .  right .     no .  i hadn t even gotten half the words out when my teeth started chattering and i couldn t speak .  a wave of nausea swept over me .    genarr said  frowning    are you about to tell me that you think marlene has some strange hypnotic power that can prevent us from opposing her .  surely that s impossible .  have you ever noticed anything like that in her before this .     no  of course i haven t .  i don t even see this in her now .  she has nothing to do with it .  i must have looked quite ill at the moment i was threatening her and that clearly frightened her .  she was very concerned .  she couldn t possibly have caused it and then reacted so .  and when you two were outside the dome and she was taking off her e suit  she wasn t even looking at you .  she had her back to you .  i was watching and i know that .  yet you found you couldn t do anything to interfere with her and when she realized you were in trouble  she flew to your assistance .  she couldn t have deliberately done that to you and reacted in that fashion .     but then      i m not through .  after i had threatened her  or  rather  after i had failed to threaten her  i scarcely dared say anything to her that wasn t perfectly superficial  but you can be sure i kept my eye on her and tried not to let her see i was doing that .  at one point  she talked to one of your guards  you have them all over the place .     in theory   muttered genarr   the dome is a military post .  the guards merely maintain order  help out when needed      yes  i dare say   said insigna with a touch of contempt .   that s janus pitt making sure he has a way of keeping you all under observation and under control  but never mind .  marlene and the guard talked for quite a while  seemed to be arguing .  i went to the guard afterward  after marlene was gone  and asked him what marlene had talked to him about .  he was reluctant to say  but i squeezed it out of him .  he said she wanted to arrange some sort of pass that would allow her to leave and re enter the dome freely .    i said to him   what did you tell her .     he said   i told her that would have to be arranged at the commander s office  but that i would try to help her .     i was indignant .   what do you mean you would help her .   i said .   how could you offer to do that .     he said   i had to do something  ma am .  every time i tried to tell her it couldn t be done  i felt sick .      genarr listened to all of this stonily .   are you telling me that this is something marlene does unconsciously  that anyone who dares contradict her is made ill  and that she doesn t even know that she is responsible for it .     no  of course not .  i don t see how she can be doing anything at all .  if this were an unconscious ability of hers  it would have made its appearance on rotor  and it never happened there .  and it isn t just any contradiction .  she tried for a second helping of dessert at dinner last night  and quite forgetting that i didn t dare cross her  i said sharply   no  marlene .   she looked terribly rebellious  but subsided  and i felt in perfect health  i can tell you .  no  i think it s only in connection with erythro that one can t contradict her .     but why do you suppose that should be  eugenia .  you seem to have some notion or other about this .  if i were marlene  i would read you like a book and tell you what that notion is  but since i am not  you must tell me .     i don t think it s marlene at all who s doing this .  it s  it s the planet itself .     the planet .     yes  erythro .  the planet .  it s controlling marlene .  why else should she be so confident that she is immune to the plague  and that she will come to no harm .  it controls the rest of us  too .  you came to harm when you tried to stop her .  i did .  the guard did .  many people came to harm in the early days of the dome because the planet felt it was being invaded  so it produced the plague .  then  when it seemed you were all content to remain within the dome  it let go  and the plague stopped .  see how it all fits in .     do you think  then  that the planet wants marlene out upon its surface .     apparently .     but why .     i don t know .  i don t pretend to understand it .  i m just telling you how it must be .    genarr s voice softened .   eugenia  surely you know that the planet can t do anything .  it s a lump of rock and metal .  you re being mystical .     i am not .  siever  don t slip into this trick of pretending that i m a silly woman .  i m a first class scientist and there s nothing mystical about my thinking .  when i say the planet  i don t mean the rock and metal .  i mean that there s some powerful permeating life form upon the planet .     it would have to be invisible  then .  this is a barren world with no sign of life above the prokaryote  let alone intelligence .     what do you know about this barren world  as you call it .  has it been properly explored .  has it been searched through and through .    slowly  genarr shook his head .  he said with a pleading note in his voice   eugenia  you re drifting off into hysteria .     am i  siever .  think it out yourself and tell me if you can find an alternate explanation .  i tell you the life on the planet  whatever it is   will not have us .  we re doomed .  and what it wants with marlene    her voice quavered   i can t imagine .        twenty eight  takeoff       .     officially  it had a very elaborate name  but it was spoken of as station four by those few earthpeople who had occasion to mention it .  from the name it was at once apparent there had been three such objects earlier  none of which were any longer in use  having been cannibalized  in point of fact .  there was also a station five that had never been finished and had become derelict .   it is doubtful if the vast majority of earth s population ever thought of the existence of station four  which drifted slowly around earth in an orbit well beyond that of the moon .   the early stations had been earth s launching pads for the construction of the first settlements  and then  when the settlers themselves took over the job of building settlements  station four was used for earth s flights to mars .   one such martian flight was all that took place  however  for it turned out that the settlers were far better suited  psychologically  to long flights  living  as they did in worlds that were large enclosed spaceships   and earth left it to them with a sigh of relief .   station four was now rarely used for any purpose and was maintained only as earth s foothold in space  as a symbol that the settlers were not the sole owners of the vastness beyond earth s atmosphere .   but now station four had a use .  a large cargo ship had lumbered out in its direction  carrying with it the rumor  among the settlements  that another attempt  the first in the twenty third century  would be made to place an earth team on mars .  some said it was merely for exploration  some for the establishment of an earth colony on mars in order to bypass the few settlements in orbit around the planet  and some for the purpose  eventually  of establishing an outpost on some sizable asteroid that no settlement had yet claimed .   what the ship actually carried in its cargo hold was the superluminal and the crew that was to propel her to the stars .   tessa wendel  even though she had been planet bound for eight years  took the space experience calmly  as any settler by birth would naturally do .  spaceships were far more like settlements in principle than they were like the planet earth .  and because of that  crile fisher  though he had been on many a spaceflight before  was a bit uneasy .   this time something more than the unnaturalness of space contributed to the tension on board the cargo ship .  fisher said   i can t endure the waiting  tessa .  it s taken us years to reach this point and the superluminal is ready and we still wait .    wendel regarded him thoughtfully .  she had never intended to get this involved with him .  she had wanted moments of relaxation to rest a mind overcome with the complexity of the project  so that it might return to work refreshed and keener .  that was what she had intended  what she had ended up with was something much more .   now she found herself helplessly tied to him  so that his problems had become hers .  the years of his waiting would surely come to nothing  and she worried about the despair that would follow his inevitable disappointment .  she had tried to dash cold water on his dreams judiciously  tried to cool down his overheated anticipation of a reunion with his daughter  but she had not succeeded .  if anything  over this past year  he had grown more optimistic about the possibility for no obvious reason  at least  none he would explain to her .   tessa was finally satisfied  and relieved  that it was not his wife crile was looking for  but only his daughter .  to be sure  she had never understood this longing for a daughter he had last seen as an infant  but he had volunteered no explanation and she had not wanted to probe the matter .  what was the use .  she was certain that his daughter was not alive  that nothing on rotor was alive .  if rotor was there near the neighbor star  it was a giant tomb drifting in space  wandering forever  and undetectable except by incredible coincidence .  crile fisher would have to be kept steady and functioning once that inevitable prospect became clearly apparent reality .   tessa said cajolingly   there s only a two month wait left  at most .  since we ve waited for years  another two months won t hurt .     it s the waiting for years that makes even two months more unbearable   muttered fisher .    tell yourself otherwise  crile   said wendel .   learn to bow to necessity .  the global congress simply won t allow us to go any sooner .  the settlements have their eyes on us  and there s no way of being sure that they all accept the notion that we re heading for mars .  it would be strange if they did  considering earth s poor record in space .  if we do nothing for two months  they will assume we re having trouble  something they would readily believe  and find satisfaction in  and withdraw their attention .    fisher shook his head angrily .   who cares if they know what we re doing .  we ll be off and gone and they won t duplicate superluminal flight for years  and by that time we ll have a fleet of superluminal vessels and be moving rapidly forward toward opening up the galaxy .     don t take that for granted .  it s easier to imitate and overtake than it is to originate .  and earth s government  considering its dismal record in space after the settlements reached maturity  is obviously anxious to establish unmistakable priority for psychological reasons .   she shrugged .   besides  we need the time to carry out more tests on the superluminal under low gravity conditions .     there s never any end to tests  is there .     don t be impatient .  this is so new and untried a technique  and so unlike anything humanity has ever had  that it is all too easy to think of new tests  especially since we are a little uncertain as to the manner in which moving into and out of hyperspace is affected by the level of intensity of a gravitational field .  seriously  crile  you can t blame us for being cautious .  after all  as recently as a decade ago  superluminal flight was considered theoretically impossible .     even caution can be overdone .     possibly .  eventually  i will decide that we ve done all we can reasonably be expected to do  and then we ll take off .  i promise you  crile  we won t wait unreasonably .  i won t overdo caution .     i hope not .   wendel looked at him doubtfully .  she had to ask .  she said   you know  crile  you re not yourself lately .  for the last two months you ve seemed to be burning up with impatience .  for a while there you had cooled down  and then you suddenly gained excitement again .  has something happened that i don t know about .    fisher calmed suddenly .   nothing s happened .  what can possibly have happened .    to wendel  it seemed he had calmed down too quickly  had wrenched himself into a most suspicious affectation of normality .  she said   i m asking you what can possibly have happened .  i ve tried to warn you  crile  that we are not likely to find rotor a functioning world  or find it at all .  we will not find your  we are not likely to find any of its inhabitants alive .   she waited through his stubborn silence then said   haven t i warned you of that  possibility .     often   said fisher     yet you sound  now  as though you can hardly wait for what is sure to be a happy reunion .  it is dangerous to have hopes that are not likely to be fulfilled  to pin everything upon them .  what has suddenly produced this new attitude .  have you been talking to someone who was unjustifiably optimistic .    fisher flushed .   why do i have to have been talking to someone .  why couldn t i have come to an independent conclusion concerning this  or any other matter .  just because i don t understand the theoretical physics that you do understand doesn t mean i m subnormal or brainless .    wendel said   no  crile .  i never thought anything of the sort about you  nor did i mean to imply it .  tell me what you think about rotor .     nothing terribly deep or subtle .  it just seemed to me that there was nothing in empty space that is very likely to have destroyed rotor .  it s easy to say that there might only be the dead hulk of a settlement at rotor  if it reached the neighbor star at all  but what is it that would have destroyed them either on the way or once they were there .  i defy you to give me a specific scenario of destruction  collisions  alien intelligences  whatever .    wendel said earnestly   crile  i can t .  i have no mystical visions of something having happened .  it s just hyper assistance itself .  it s a tricky technique  crile .  take my word for it .  it doesn t use either space or hyperspace in a steady way  but skids along at the interface  wobbling to one side or another for short periods  and moving from space to hyperspace and then from hyperspace back to space several times a minute  perhaps .  the passage from one to the other may therefore have taken place a million times or more in the course of the trip from here to the neighbor star .     and so .     and so  it happens that the transition is far more dangerous than is level flight in either space or hyperspace .  i don t know how thoroughly the rotorians had established hyperspatial theory  but the chances are that they had done so in only a rudimentary fashion  or they would have surely developed true superluminal flight .  in our project  which has worked out hyperspatial theory in great detail  we ve managed to establish the effect on material objects of passing from space to hyperspace and vice versa .    if an object is a point  there is no strain on it during the transition .  if an object is not a point  however  if it is an extended bit of matter  as any ship would be  then there is always a finite period of time during which part of it is in space and part is in hyperspace .  this creates a strain  the amount of strain depending on the size of the object  its physical makeup  its speed of transition  and so on .  even for an object the size of rotor  the danger involved in a single transition  or a dozen  for that matter  is so small that it can reasonably be ignored .    when the superluminal will travel  superluminously  to the neighbor star  we are liable to make a dozen transitions  or possibly only as few as two .  the flight will be a safe one .  in a flight with hyper assistance only  on the other hand  there may be a million transitions in the course of the same trip  you see  and the chances of fatal strain mount up .    fisher looked appalled .   is the chance of fatal strain certain .     no  nothing is certain .  it s a statistical matter .  a ship might undergo a million transitions  or a billion  with nothing happening .  it might be destroyed  on the other hand  on the very first transition .  the chances  however  increase rapidly with the number of transitions .    i suspect  then  that rotor embarked on its trip understanding very little about the dangers of transition .  had they known more  they would never have left .  there is a very good chance  then  that they experienced some sort of strain that might have been weak enough to allow them to  limp  to the neighbor star or one that was strong enough to blow them completely out of existence .  therefore  we might find a hulk  or we might find nothing at all .     or we might find a settlement that has survived   said fisher rebelliously .    admitted   said wendel .   or we might ourselves be strained against the odds  be destroyed  and  for that reason  find nothing .  i ask you not to be prepared for certainties but for probabilities .  and remember that those who think about the matter  without some accurate knowledge of hyperspatial theory  are not likely to come to reasonable conclusions .    fisher fell into a profound and clearly depressed silence  while wendel watched him uneasily .        .     tessa wendel found station four a weird environment .  it was as though someone had built a small settlement  but fitted it out to be a combination of nothing more than a laboratory  an observatory  and a launching platform .  it had no farms  no homes  none of the appurtenances of a settlement  however small .  it was not even equipped with a spin that would set up an adequate pseudo gravitational field .   it was  in fact  nothing but a spaceship with acromegaly .  it was clear that  although it could be permanently occupied  provided there was a continuous drizzle of food  air  and water supplies  there was some recycling  but it wasn t efficient   no single individual could remain there for very long .   crile fisher made the wry comment that station four was like an old fashioned space station from the early days of the space age that had unaccountably survived into the twenty third century .   in one respect  though  it was unique .  it presented a panoramic view of the earth moon system .  from the settlements that orbited earth  the two bodies could rarely be seen in their true relationship .  from station four  however  earth and moon were never more than fifteen degrees apart  and as station four revolved around the center of gravity of that system  roughly equivalent to revolving about the earth   the changing pattern of the two worlds  both in position and phase  and the changing size of the moon  depending on whether it was on the station s own side of earth  or on the opposite side  was a never ending wonder .   the sun was blocked out automatically by the artec device  wendel had to ask to find out that that stood for   artificial eclipse  device  and only when the sun moved too near either earth or moon in the station s sky was the view spoiled .   wendel s settlement background showed up now  for she enjoyed watching the earth moon interplay  mostly  she explained  because it made it clear she was no longer on earth .   she said as much to fisher  who smiled dourly .  he had noticed her quick glance to right and left as she said it .   he said   i see you don t mind telling me that  even though i m an earthman and might resent it .  but  never fear  i won t pass it along .     i d trust you with anything  crile .   she smiled at him happily .  he had changed considerably since that crucial conversation when they had first reached station four .  he was somber  yes  but sooner that than the feverish expectation of what could not be .   he said   do you really think they resent your being a settler at this stage of the game .     of course they do .  they never forget .  they re as narrow minded as i am  and i never forget they re earthpeople .     you obviously forget i m an earthman .     that s because you re crile  and fall into no category other than crile .  and i m tessa .  and that ends it .    fisher said thoughtfully   does it ever bother you  tessa  that you have worked out superluminal flight for earth  rather than for your own settlement  adelia .     but i haven t done it for earth  and i wouldn t have done it for adelia in other circumstances .  in both cases  i m doing it for myself .  i had a problem to solve  and i completed the job successfully .  now i m going down in history as the inventor of superluminal flight and that s what i ve done for myself .  and it may sound pretentious  but i m doing it for humanity  too .  it doesn t matter on which world the discovery is made  you know .  some person or persons on rotor invented hyper assistance  but we have it now and so do all the settlements .  in the end  the settlements will all have superluminal flight  too .  wherever an advance takes place  ultimately all humanity is helped .     earth needs it more than the settlements do  though .     you mean because of the approach of the neighbor star  which the settlements can easily evade by leaving  if necessary  but which earth can t .  well  i ll leave that as a problem for earth s leaders .  i ve supplied the tool and they can work out methods for using it to their best advantage .    crile said   i understand we re taking off tomorrow .     yes  finally .  they ll be taking holographic recordings and give us the full treatment .  there s no way of telling  though  when they ll be able to release them to the general public and the settlements .     it can t be till after our return   said fisher .   there d be no sense in putting them on display if they can t be certain we ll ever come back .  it s going to be an agonizing wait for them  too  since they ll have no contact with us at all .  when the astronauts first landed on the moon  they were in touch with the earth all the way .     true   said wendel   but when columbus sailed off into the atlantic  the spanish monarchs never heard from him again till he returned seven months later .    fisher said   earth  now  has far more at stake than spain had seven and a half centuries ago .  it is really a great pity we can t have superluminal communication  since we have superluminal flight .     i think so  too .  as does koropatsky  who has been hammering at me to work out telecommunication .  but  as i told him  i am not a marvelous supernatural force who can crank out everything anyone needs .  it is one thing to push mass through hyperspace and quite another to push some sort of radiation through hyperspace .  they follow different rules even in ordinary space so that maxwell didn t work out his electromagnetic equations until two centuries after newton worked out his gravitational equation .  well  mass and radiation follow different rules in hyperspace  too  and the rules for radiation still defeat us .  someday we ll work out superluminal communication  but we haven t yet .     it s too bad   said fisher thoughtfully .   it s possible that without superluminal communication  superluminal flight won t be practical .     why not .     the lack of superluminal communication cuts the umbilical cord .  could settlements live far from earth  far from the rest of humanity   and survive .    wendel frowned .   what s this new line of philosophy you ve begun to track down .     just a thought .  being a settler  tessa  and being accustomed to it  it may not occur to you that living on a settlement is not truly natural to human beings .     really .  it never seemed unnatural to me .     that s because you weren t really living on one .  you were living in a whole system of settlements among which one was a large planet with billions of people on it .  might not the rotorians  once they reach the neighbor star  find that living on an isolated settlement was unsatisfactory .  in that case  they would surely return to earth  but they haven t .  might that not be because they have found a planet to live on .     a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star .  most unlikely .     nature has a way of fooling us and upsetting supposed certainties .   suppose there is a habitable planet there .  shouldn t it be carefully studied .    wendel said   ah  i m beginning to get what you re driving at .  you feel that the ship may come to the neighbor star  and find that there is some sort of planet there .  we would then make a note of it  decide from a distance that it is uninhabited  and go on about our task of further exploration .  you would want us to land and make a much more thorough search  so that we can at least try to find your daughter .  but what if our neuronic detector finds no trace of intelligence anywhere within any planetary system the neighbor star may have .  must we still search the individual planets .    fisher hesitated .   yes .  if they show any signs of being habitable  we must study them  it seems to me .  we must know all we can about any such planet .  we may have to begin evacuating earth soon  and we must know where to take our people .  it s all very well for you to overlook that  since settlements can just drift off without the necessity of evacua      crile .  don t start treating me as the enemy .  don t start suddenly thinking of me as a settler .  i m tessa .  if there is a planet  we ll investigate it as much as we can  i promise you .  but if there is and if the rotorians are occupying it  then  well  you spent some years on rotor  crile .  you must know janus pitt .     i know of him .  i never met him  but my wi  my ex wife worked with him .  according to her  he was a very capable man  very intelligent  very forceful .     very forceful .  we knew of him on other settlements  too .  and we were not generally fond of him .  if it was his plan to find a place for rotor that was hidden from the rest of humanity  he could do no better than to go to the neighbor star  since it was so close and since its existence was not known by anyone outside rotor at the time .  and if  for any reason  he wanted a system all to himself  he would  being janus pitt  fear the possibility of being followed and having his monopoly upset .  if he happened to find a useful planet that could be used by rotor  he would be even more resentful of intrusion .     what are you getting at .   asked fisher  who looked perturbed  as though he knew what she was getting at .    why  tomorrow we take off  and in not too long a time  we ll be at the neighbor star .  and if it does have a planet  as you seem to think it might  and if we find the rotorians are occupying it  it s not going to be a matter of just going down to the surface and saying   hello .  surprise .   i m afraid that at the first sight of us  he would give us his version of a  hello  and blast us into oblivion .        twenty nine  enemy       .     ranay d  aubisson  like all the inhabitants of the erythro dome during their period of habitation  visited rotor periodically .  it was necessary  a touch of home  a return to the roots  a gathering of renewed strength .   this time  however  d  aubisson  had  moved upward   the usual phrase for passing from erythro to rotor  a bit earlier than her schedule had called for .  she had  indeed  been summoned by commissioner pitt .   she sat in janus pitt s office  noting with her skilled eyes the small signs of aging that had accumulated since she had last seen him several years before .  she did not  in the ordinary course of her work  have frequent occasions to see him  of course .   his voice  however  was as strong as ever  his eyes as sharp  and she noted no decline in mental vigor .   pitt said   i have received your report on the incident outside the dome  and i recognize the caution with which you approached your diagnosis of the situation .  but now  off the record and unofficially  exactly what happened to genarr .  this room is shielded and you can talk freely .    d  aubisson said dryly   i m afraid that my report  cautious as it was  happens to be truthful and complete .  we don t really know what happened to commander genarr .  the brain scan showed changes  but these were extraordinarily small and did not correspond to anything in our past experience .  and they were reversible  since they did  in fact  quickly reverse .     but something did happen to him .     oh yes  but that s the point .  we can t say anything more than  something .       some form of the plague  perhaps .     none of the symptoms that have been detected in the past were found in this case .     but in the old days of the plague  brain scanning was still comparatively primitive .  you would not have detected the symptoms you have detected now in the past  so it might still be a mild form of the plague  might it not .     we could say so  but we could not present real evidence to that effect  and  in any case  genarr is now normal .     he seems normal  i suppose  but we don t really know if there might not be a relapse .     neither is there any reason to suppose there might be .    a fleeting look of impatience crossed the commissioner s face .   you re sparring with me  d  aubisson .  you know perfectly well that genarr s position is one of considerable importance .  the situation in the dome is always precarious  since we never know if and when the plague will strike again .  genarr s value was that he seemed immune to it  but we can scarcely consider him immune now .  something happened  and we must be prepared to replace him .     that is your decision to make  commissioner .  i am not suggesting replacement as a medical necessity .     but you ll keep him under close observation  and you ll keep the possibility of such a necessity in mind  i hope .     i would consider that part of my medical duties .     good .  especially since if there is to be a replacement  i have been considering you .     considering me .   a small flash of excitement crossed her face before she could suppress it .    yes  why not .  it s well known that i ve never been enthusiastic about the project of colonizing erythro .  i have always felt it necessary to retain the mobility of humanity and not to allow ourselves to be trapped into slavery to a large planet again .  nevertheless  it would be wise if we could colonize the planet not as a place intended primarily for population but as a vast resource  rather as we treated the moon in the old solar system .  but we can t do that if the plague hangs over our heads  can we .     no  we can t  commissioner .     so our real task  to begin with  is to solve that problem .  we never have .  the plague just died down and we have accepted that  but this latest incident shows us that the danger is not yet gone .  whether genarr suffered a touch of the plague or not  he certainly suffered something  and i want the matter now given top priority .  you would be the natural person to head that project .     i d be glad to accept the responsibility .  it would mean doing what i am  in any case  trying to do  but with greater authority .  i hesitate at supposing that i ought to be the erythro dome commander .     as you said  that s for me to decide .  i take it you would not refuse the post if it were offered to you .     no  commissioner .  i would be greatly honored .     yes  i m sure   said pitt dryly .    and what happened to the girl .   for a moment  d  aubisson seemed taken aback by the sudden change in subject .  she all but stammered as she repeated   the girl .     yes  the girl who was outside the dome with genarr  the one who removed her protective suit .     marlene fisher .     yes  that s her name .  what happened to her .    d  aubisson hesitated .   why  nothing  commissioner .     so it says in the report .  but i m asking you now .  nothing .     nothing detectable by brain scan or in any other way .     you mean that at the same time that genarr  wearing an e suit  was struck down  the girl  this marlene fisher  without an e suit  suffered nothing .    d  aubisson shrugged .   nothing at all  as far as we could tell .     don t you consider that strange .     she s a strange young woman .  her brain scan      i know about her brain scan .  i know also that she has peculiar abilities .  have you noted that .     oh yes .  i have indeed .     and how do her abilities strike you .  mind reading  by any chance .     no  commissioner .  that s impossible .  the concept of telepathy is a mere fantasy .  i wish it were mind reading  in fact  since that would not be so dangerous .  thoughts can be placed under control .     what is it about her that is more dangerous .     apparently  she reads body language and we can t control that .  every motion speaks .   she said it with a touch of bitterness that pitt did not fail to note .   he said   did you have a personal experience of that .     certainly .   d  aubisson looked grim .   it is impossible to be near the young woman without experiencing some of the inconvenience of her habit of perception .     yes  but what happened .     nothing of tremendous importance  but it was annoying .   d  aubisson flushed and  for a moment  her lips pressed together as though she were thinking of defying her interrogator .  but that moment passed .  she said  almost in a whisper    after i had examined dome commander genarr  marlene asked me how he was .  i told her that he was not seriously harmed and that there was every hope that he would recover completely .    she said   why does that disappoint you .     i was taken aback and said   i m not disappointed .  i m pleased .    she said   but you are disappointed .  that is quite clear .  you re impatient .     it was the first time i had encountered that sort of thing directly  though i had heard about it from others  and i couldn t think of anything to do but challenge her .   why should i be impatient .  for what .     she looked at me solemnly with her large  dark  and unsettling eyes .  then she said   it seems to be about uncle siever       pitt interrupted .   uncle siever .  is there a relationship .     no .  i think it s only a term of affection .  she said   it seems to be about uncle siever and i wonder if you want to replace him as dome commander .     at that  i just turned and walked away .    pitt said   how did you feel when she told you this .     i was furious .  naturally .     because she had maligned you .  or because she was correct .     well  in a way      no no .  don t hedge  doctor .  was she wrong or was she right .  were you sufficiently disappointed at genarr s recovery for the girl to notice  or was the whole thing a stroke of her peculiar imagination .    the words seemed to force themselves out of d  aubisson s lips .   she sensed something that was really there .   she stared at pitt defiantly .   i m only human  and i have my impulses .  and you yourself have now indicated that i might be offered the post  which would seem to mean you consider me qualified for it .     i m sure you are maligned in spirit  if not in fact   said pitt  without any sign of humor .   but now consider  you have this young woman  who is peculiar  who is very strange  both as shown by the brain scan and by her behavior  and  in addition  she seems unaffected by the plague .  clearly  there may be a connection between her neuronic pattern and her plague resistance .  might she not be a useful tool for studying the plague .     i can t say .  i suppose it s conceivable .     shouldn t it be tested .     perhaps  but how .   pitt said quietly   let her be exposed to the influence of erythro as much as possible .    d  aubisson said thoughtfully   that is what she wants to do  as it happens  and commander genarr seems to be willing to let her .     good .  then you will supply the medical backing .     i understand .  and if the young woman gets the plague .     we must remember that the solution of the problem is more important than the welfare of a single individual .  we have a world to win  and for that we might have to pay a sad but necessary price .     and if marlene is destroyed and that does not help us understand or counteract the plague .    pitt said   that risk must be faced .  after all  it might also be that she will remain untouched and that that untouchability  carefully studied  may give us the means of a breakthrough in understanding the plague .  in that case  we win without loss .    it was only afterward  when d  aubisson had left for her rotorian apartment  that pitt s iron resolution permitted him to think of himself as marlene fisher s confirmed enemy .  true victory would be to have marlene destroyed and the plague remain unsolved .  at a stroke he would be rid of an inconvenient girl who might otherwise  someday  produce young like herself  and of an inconvenient world that might otherwise  someday  produce a population as undesirable  as dependent  and as immobile as earth s population had been .        .     the three of them sat together in the erythro dome  siever genarr watchful  eugenia insigna deeply concerned  and marlene fisher clearly impatient .   insigna said   now  remember  marlene  do not stare at nemesis .  i know you ve been warned about the infrared  but it s also a fact that nemesis is a mild flare star .  every once in a while there s an explosion on its surface and a burst of white light .  it just lasts a minute or two  but that will be enough to shock your retinas  and you can t tell when it s going to happen .    genarr said   can astronomers tell when it s going to happen .     not so far .  it s one of the many chaotic aspects of nature .  we have not yet worked out the rules underlying stellar turbulence and there are some among us who think the rules can never be worked out entirely .  they are simply too complex .     interesting   said genarr .    it s not that we re not grateful to the flares .  three percent of the energy reaching erythro from nemesis is the result of those flares .     that doesn t sound like much .     it is  though .  without the flares  erythro would be an icy world and much less easy to live on .  the flares do make problems for rotor  which has to adjust its use of sunlight quickly whenever there s a flare  and strengthen its particle absorption field .    marlene was looking from one to the other as they spoke  and she finally broke in with a small note of exasperation   how long are you two going to keep this up .  it s just to keep me sitting here .  i can tell that very easily .    insigna said hastily   where will you go when you re out there .     just around .  to the little river  or creek  or whatever it is .     why .     because it s interesting .  just flowing water in the open  and you can t see the ends  and you know it s not being pumped back to the beginning .     but it is   said insigna   by the heat of nemesis .     that doesn t count .  i mean human beings aren t doing it .  besides  i just want to stand there and watch it .     don t drink from it   said insigna severely .    i don t intend to .  i can last an hour without drinking .  if i get hungry  or thirsty  or anything else  i ll come back .  you re making such a fuss over nothing .    genarr smiled .   i suppose you want to recycle everything right here in the dome .     yes  of course .  wouldn t anyone .    genarr s smile broadened .  he said   you know  eugenia  i m quite certain that living in settlements has changed humanity permanently .  the necessity of cycling is now ingrained in us .  on earth  you just threw things away  assuming it would recycle naturally  and  of course  sometimes it didn t .     genarr   said insigna   you re a dreamer .  it may be possible for human beings to learn good habits under pressure  but relieve the pressure and the bad habits are back at once .  downhill is easier than uphill .  it s called the second law of thermodynamics  and if we ever do colonize erythro  i predict that we will litter it from end to end in no time at all .     no  we won t   said marlene .   genarr said in a tone of polite inquiry   why not  dear .    and marlene said with impatient force   because we won t .  now can i go out .    genarr looked at insigna and said   we might as well let her go  eugenia .  we can t hold her back forever .  besides  for what it s worth  ranay d  aubisson  who just got back from rotor  went over all the records from the start and told me yesterday that marlene s brain scan seems so stable that she is convinced that marlene will come to no harm on erythro .    marlene  who had turned toward the door  as though ready to walk to the airlock  now turned back .   wait  uncle siever  i almost forgot .  you must be careful of dr .  d  aubisson .     why .  she s an excellent neurophysicist .     that s not what i mean .  she was pleased when you were in trouble after your trip outside and pretty disappointed when you got better .    insigna looked surprised and said automatically   what makes you say that .     because i know .      but i don t understand that .  siever  don t you get along with d  aubisson .     certainly  i do .  we get along very well .  never a cross word .  but if marlene says      mightn t marlene be wrong .   marlene said at once   but i m not .   genarr said   i m sure you re right  marlene .   then  to insigna   d  aubisson is an ambitious woman .  if anything happens to me  she s the logical choice as my successor .  she s had a great deal of experience down here and she s surely the best person to deal with the plague if it lifts its head again .  what s more  she s older than i am and may not feel there s much time to waste .  i couldn t blame her if she was anxious to succeed me  and if her heart lifted a bit when i was ill .  the chances are she s not even consciously aware of these feelings .     yes  she is   said marlene ominously .   she knows all about it .  you watch out  uncle siever .     well  i will .  are you ready now .     of course i m ready .     then let me walk you to the airlock .  you come with us  eugenia  and try not to look so tragic .    and so it was that marlene stepped out onto the surface of erythro  alone and unprotected  for the first time .  it was  by earth standard time       p . m .   january          .  by erythro time  it was midmorning .       thirty  transition       .     crile fisher tried to suppress his excitement  tried to maintain the same calm expressions that the others were wearing .   he didn t know where tessa wendel was at the moment .  she couldn t be far  since the superluminal was reasonably small  though broken up so that someone in one bay might well be out of sight to someone in another .   the other three crew members were just pairs of hands to fisher .  they each had something to do and they were doing it .  only fisher himself had nothing specific to do  except perhaps to be careful to stay out of the way of the others .   he looked at the other three  two men and one woman  almost furtively .  he knew them to talk to  and had talked to them frequently .  they were all young .  the oldest was chao li wu  who was thirty eight and a hyperspacialist .  then there was henry jarlow  who was thirty five  and merry blankowitz  the baby of the team  twenty seven years old and with the ink still damp on her doctor s diploma .   wendel  at fifty five  was ancient by comparison  but she was the inventor  the designer  the demigoddess of the flight .   it was fisher who was odd man out .  he would be fifty on his next birthday  which was not so far off  and he had no specialized training .  he had no right to be on the ship if either youth or knowledge were considered .   but he had been on rotor once .  that counted .  and wendel wanted him with her  and that counted even more .  so did tanayama and koropatsky  which counted most of all .   the ship was making its way  lumbering through space .  fisher could tell that  even though there was no physical indication that this was so .  he could feel it with the tendrils of his intestines  if they had any .  he thought fiercely  i ve been in space far longer than all the others put together  far more times on far more ships .  i can tell there is nothing sleek about this ship just by the feel of it .  they can t .   the superluminal had to lack sleekness .  the normal power sources that kept ordinary spaceships moving through the vacuum were cramped and cut down in the superluminal .  they had to be  for most of the ship was given over to the hyperspatial motors .   it was like a seabird that waddled clumsily on land because it was designed for the water .   wendel suddenly appeared .  her hair was somewhat disheveled and she was perspiring a bit .   fisher said   is everything all right  tessa .     oh yes  perfectly .   she rested her rear end against one of the convenient wall depressions  very useful  considering the light pseudo grav maintained on the ship  .   no problems .     when do we make the move into hyperspace .     in a few hours .  we want to get into the proper coordinates with all appropriate gravitational sources twisting space precisely as calculated .     so we can allow for it exactly .     that s right .    fisher said   that doesn t make hyperspatial flight sound very practical .  what if you don t know where everything is .  what if you re in a hurry and can t wait to calculate every gravitational twitch .    wendel looked up at fisher with a sudden smile .   you ve never asked anything like this before .  why do you ask it now .     i ve never actually been on a hyperspatial flight before .  the question presents itself to me with greater urgency under these conditions  you see .     this and many other such questions have presented themselves to me with the greatest possible urgency for years .  welcome to the club .     but answer me .     gladly .  in the first place  there are devices that measure overall gravitational intensity  in both scalar and tensor aspects  at any point in space  whether you know the neighborhood or not .  the result is not quite as accurate as it would be if you painstakingly measured each gravitational source and added them together  but it is close enough  if time is precious .  and if time is still more precious and you have to push the hyperspatial button  so to speak  and trust to good fortune that gravitation is not very significant and should happen to be slightly wrong  then the transition would be accompanied by something roughly equivalent to a jar like crossing a threshold and catching the toe of your shoe on the sill .  if we can avoid that  fine  but if we don t it s not necessarily fatal .  naturally  in the first transition point  we would like it to be as smooth as possible for our psychological peace of mind  if nothing else .     what if you re in a hurry  feel that gravitation is negligible  and it isn t .     you have to hope that that doesn t happen .     you talked about strains during transition .  that means our very first transition might be fatal  even if gravity is allowed for .     might be  but the odds against a fatal accident at any given transmission are enormous .      even if it isn t fatal  might it not be unpleasant .     that s harder to say because it requires a subjective judgment .  understand that there s no acceleration involved .  in hyper assistance  a ship has to work its way up to light speed  and even a little beyond at intervals  by use of a low energy hyperspatial field .  efficiency is low  speeds are high  risks are great  and  frankly  i don t know what the discomforts may  or may not  be .    in our kind of superluminal flight  using a high energy hyperspatial field  we make the transition at normal speeds .  we may be at a speed of a thousand kilometers per second at one instant  and at the next we are going a thousand million kilometers per second without acceleration .  and since there is no acceleration  we don t feel it .     how can there be no acceleration when you increase the speed a million fold in an instant .     because the transition is the mathematical equivalent of acceleration .  however  whereas your body responds to acceleration  it does not to transition .     but how can you tell .     by sending animals through hyperspace from one point to another .  they are in hyperspace for only a brief fraction of a microsecond  but it s the transition between space and hyperspace that we worry about  and there is one in either direction in even the briefest possible passage through hyperspace .     and animals were sent .     of course .  once they had reached the reception point  they couldn t very well tell us how things were  but there they were  totally unhurt and calm .  it was clear they hadn t been harmed in any way .  we tried it on dozens of animals of all kinds .  we even tried it on monkeys  all of which survived perfectly  except in one case .     ah .  and what happened in that one case .     the animal was dead  grotesquely mutilated  but that was caused by a mistake in the programming .  it wasn t the transition at all .  and something like that can happen to us .  it s not likely  but it can .  it would be equivalent to stepping over a threshold  catching the toe of your shoe on the sill  tripping  falling forward  and breaking your neck .  such things have  indeed  happened  but we don t expect it to happen every time we cross a threshold .  all right .     i guess i don t have a choice   said fisher grimly .    all right .   two hours and twenty seven minutes later  the ship crossed safely into hyperspace  with no sensation whatever for anyone on board  and the first superluminal flight at speeds far beyond that of light took place .   the transition  by earth standard time  was at      p . m .   january         .       thirty one  name       .     silence .   marlene reveled in it  all the more so because she could break it if she wished .  she stooped to pick up a pebble and tossed it against a rock .  it made a small thunk  then fell to the ground and was still .   having left the dome with no more clothes than she would have worn on rotor  she felt perfectly free .   she had walked straight away from the dome toward the creek  without even watching to check the landmarks .   her mother s last words had been a rather weak plea .   please  marlene  remember you said you would stay in sight of the dome .    she had smiled briefly  but had paid no attention .  she might stay in sight  but perhaps not .  she did not intend to be hemmed in  regardless of what promises she had been forced to make to keep the peace .  after all  she was carrying a wave emitter .  at any time  she could be located .  she herself could use the receiving end of it to sense the direction of the dome s emitter .   if she had an accident of some sort  if she fell or was somehow hurt  they could come get her .   if a meteor struck her  well  she d be dead .  there would be nothing anyone could do about that  even if she were in sight of the dome .  even allowing for the disturbing thought of meteors  it was all so peaceful and wonderful on erythro .  on rotor it was always noisy .  wherever you went  the air quivered and shook and battered your tired ears with sound waves .  it must be even worse on earth  with its eight billion people  and trillions of animals  and its thunderstorms and wild surges of water from the sea and sky .  she had once tried to listen to a recording entitled  noises of earth   had winced at it  and had quickly had enough .   but here on erythro  there was a wonderful silence .  marlene came to the creek  and the water moved past her with a soft bubbly sound .  she picked up a jagged pebble and tossed it into the water and there was a small splash .  sounds were not forbidden on erythro  they were merely doled out as occasional adornments that served to make the surrounding silence more precious .   she stamped her foot on the soft clay at the creek s edge .  she heard a small dull thump  and there was the vague impression of a footprint .  she bent down  cupped some water in her hand  and tossed it over the soil in front of her .  it moistened and darkened in spots  crimson showing against pink .  she added more water and finally placed her right shoe on the dark spot  pressing down .  when she lifted her shoe  there was a deeper footprint there .   there were occasional rocks in the creek bed and she used them as stepping stones to cross the water .   marlene kept on  walking vigorously  swinging her arms  taking in deep breaths of air .  she knew very well that the oxygen percentage was somewhat lower than it was on rotor .  if she ran  she would quickly grow tired  but she lacked the impulse to run .  if she ran  she would use up her world more rapidly .   she wanted to look at everything .  she looked back and the mound of the dome was visible  especially the bubble that housed the astronomical instruments .  that irritated her .  she wanted to be far enough away so that she could turn around and see the horizon as a perfect  if irregular  circle  with no intrusion of any sign of humanity  except herself  anywhere .    should she call the dome .  should she tell her mother she would be out of sight for a little while .  no  they would just argue .  they could receive her carrier wave .  they would be able to tell that she was alive  well  and moving around .  if they called her  she decided  she would ignore them .  really .  they must leave her to herself .    her eyes were adjusting to the pinkness of nemesis and of the land around her in every direction .  it was not merely pink  it was all in darks and lights  in purples and oranges  almost yellows in some places .  it time  it would become a whole new palette of colors to her heightened senses  as variegated as rotor  but more soothing .   what would happen if someday people settled on erythro  introduced life  built cities .  would they spoil it .  or would they have learned from earth and would they go about it in a different way  taking this new untouched world and making it into something close to their heart s desire .   whose heart s desire .  that was the problem .  different people would have different ideas  and they would quarrel with each other and pursue irreconcilable ends .  would it be better to leave erythro empty .   would that be right when people might enjoy it so .  marlene knew well that she didn t want to leave it .  it warmed her  being on this world .  she didn t know quite why  but it felt more like home than rotor ever had .   was it some dim atavistic memory of earth .  was there a feeling for a huge endless world in her genes  a longing that a small  artificial  turning city in space could not fulfill .  how could that be .  earth was surely different from erythro in every possible way but the similarity of size .  and if earth were in her genes  why wouldn t it be in the genes of every human being .   but there must be some explanation .  marlene shook her head as though to clear it and whirled around and around as if she were in the midst of endless space .  strange that erythro didn t seem barren .  on rotor  you could see acres of grain and orchards of fruit trees  and a haze of green and amber  and the straight line irregularity of human structures .  here on erythro  however  you saw only the rolling ground  interspersed with rocks of all sizes  as though strewn carelessly by some giant hand strange  brooding silent shapes  with rivulets of water  here and there  flowing around and among them .  and no life at all if you didn t count the myriads of tiny germ like cells that kept the atmosphere full of oxygen  thanks to the energy supply of nemesis  red light .   and nemesis  like any red dwarf  would continue to pour out its careful supply of energy for a couple of hundred billion years  hoarding its energy and seeing to it that erythro and its tiny prokaryotes were warm and comfortable through all that time .  long after earth s sun had died and other bright stars  born still later  had also died  n emesis would shine on unchanged  and erythro would roll about megas unchanged  and the prokaryotes would live and die  also essentially unchanged .   surely human beings would have no right to come to this unchanging world and change it .  yet if she were alone on erythro  she would need food  and companionship .   she might return to the dome now and then for supplies  or to refresh a need to see other people  but she could still spend most of her time alone with erythro .  but would not others follow .  how could she prevent them .  and with others  no matter how few  would not eden inevitably be ruined .  wasn t it being ruined because she herself had entered eden  only she .    no .   she shouted it .  she shouted it loudly in a sudden eager experiment to see if she could make the alien atmosphere tremble and force it to carry words to her ears .   she heard her own voice  but in the flat terrain there were no echoes .  her shout was gone as soon as it sounded .   she whirled again .  the dome was just a thin shadow on the horizon .  it could almost be ignored  but not quite .  she wished it was not visible at all .  she wanted nothing in view but herself and erythro .   she heard the faint sigh of the wind  and knew it had picked up speed .  it was not strong enough to feel  and the temperature hadn t dropped  nor was it unpleasant .  it was just a faint   ah h h h .   she imitated it cheerfully    ah h h h h .   marlene stared up at the sky curiously .  the weather forecasters had said it would be clear that day .  was it possible for storms to blow up suddenly and unpredictably on erythro .  would the wind rise and become uncomfortable .  would clouds whip across the sky and rain begin to fall before she could get back to the dome .   that was silly  as silly as the meteors .  of course it rained on erythro  but right now there were only a few wispy pink clouds above .  they moved lazily against the dark and unobstructed sky .  there didn t seem to be any sign of a storm .    ah h h h h   whispered the wind .   ah h h h h ay y y y .    it was a double sound  and marlene frowned .  what could be making that sound .  surely the wind could not make the sound by itself .  it would have to pass some obstruction and whistle as it did so .  but there was nothing of the sort within sight .    ah h h h h ay y y y y uh h h h h .    it was a triple sound now  with the stress on the second sound .  marlene looked around  wondering .  she couldn t tell where it was coming from .  to make the sound  something had to be vibrating  but she saw nothing  felt nothing .   erythro looked empty and silent .  it could make no sound .    ah h h h ay y y y uh h h h .    again .  clearer than before .  it was as though it were in her own head  and  at that thought  her heart seemed to contract and she shivered .  she felt the gooseflesh rise on her arms  she didn t have to look .   nothing could be wrong with her head .  nothing .   she was waiting to hear it again  and it came .  louder .  still clearer .  suddenly there was a ring of authority to it  as though it were practicing and growing better .   practicing .  practicing what .   and unwillingly  entirely unwillingly  she thought  it s as though someone who can t sound consonants is trying to say my name .   as though that were a signal  or her thought had released another spasm of power  or had perhaps sharpened her imagination  she heard   mah h h lay y y nuh h h .    automatically  without knowing she was doing it  she lifted her hands and covered her ears .   marlene  she thought  soundlessly .   and then came the sound  mimicking   mahr lay nuh .    it came again  almost easily  almost naturally .   marlene .    she shuddered  and recognized the voice .  it was aurinel  aurinel of rotor  whom she hadn t seen since the day on rotor when she told him that the earth would be destroyed .  she had thought of him hardly at all since then  but always achingly  when she did .   why was she hearing his voice where he was not  or hearing any voice where all was not .    marlene .    and she gave up .  it was the erythro plague that she had been so certain would not touch her .   she was running blindly  blindly  toward the dome  not pausing to tell where it was .   she did not know that she was screaming .        .     they had brought her in .  they had sensed her sudden approach  at a run .  two guards in e suits and helmets had moved out at once and they had heard her screaming .   but the screaming had stopped before they had reached her .  the running had slowed and stopped  too  and that was before she seemed aware of their approach .   when they reached her  she looked at them quietly and amazed them by asking   what s wrong .    no one had answered .  a hand reached out for her elbow and she whipped away .    don t touch me   she said .   i ll go to the dome  if that s what you want  but i can walk .    and she had walked quietly back with them .  she was quite self possessed .        .     eugenia insigna  lips dry and pale  was trying not to seem distraught .   what happened out there  marlene .    marlene said  her dark eyes wide and unfathomable   nothing .  nothing at all .     don t say that .  you were running and screaming .     i may have been for a little while  but just for a little while .  you see  it was quiet  so quiet  that after a while i felt as though i must be deaf .  just silence  you know .  so i stamped my feet and ran just to hear the noise  and i screamed      just to hear the noise of it .   asked insigna  frowning .   yes  mother .     do you expect me to believe that  marlene .  because i don t .  we picked up the screams and those were not the screams of making noise .  those were screams of terror .  something had frightened you .     i told you .  the silence .  the possibility of deafness .    insigna turned to d  aubisson .   isn t it possible  doctor  that if you don t hear anything  anything at all  and if you re used to hearing things all the time  then your ears might just imagine they re hearing something so they can feel useful .    d  aubisson forced a thin smile .   that s a colorful way of putting it  but it is true that sensory deprivation can produce hallucinations .     that disturbed me  i suppose .  but after i heard my own voice and my own footsteps  i quieted down .  ask the two guards who came to get me .  i was perfectly calm when they arrived  and i followed them into the dome with no trouble .  ask them  uncle siever .    genarr nodded .   they ve told me this .  and we watched it happen  besides .  very well  then .  that s it .     that s not it at all   said insigna  her face still white  from fright or anger or both .   she s not going out any more .  the experiment is finished .     no  mother   said marlene  outraged .   d  aubisson raised her voice  as though to forestall any angry clash of wills between mother and daughter .  she said   the experiment is not finished  dr .  insigna .  whether she goes out again or not is beside the point .  we still have to deal with the consequences of what has happened .     what do you mean .   demanded insigna .    i mean  it s all very well to talk about imagining voices because the ear is not accustomed to silence  but surely another possible reason for imagined voices is the onset of a certain mental instability .    insigna looked stricken .   marlene said loudly   do you mean the erythro plague .     i don t mean that particularly  marlene   said d  aubisson .   we don t have any evidence  only a possibility .  so we need another brain scan .  it s for your own good .     no   said marlene .    don t say no   said d  aubisson .   it s a must .  we have no choice .  it s something we ll have to do .    marlene looked at d  aubisson out of her dark and brooding eyes .  she said   you re hoping i have the plague .  you want me to have the plague .    d  aubisson stiffened  and her voice cracked .   that s ridiculous .  how dare you say such a thing .    but it was genarr  now  who was staring at d  aubisson .  he said   ranay  we ve discussed this little point about marlene  and if she says you want her to have the plague  you must have given yourself away in some way .  that is  if marlene is serious and isn t just saying it out of fright or anger .     i m serious   said marlene .   she was just bubbling with hopeful excitement .     well  ranay    said genarr a little more coldly .    are you .     i see what the girl means   said d  aubisson  frowning .   i have not studied a fresh case of advanced plague in years .  and in the days when i did  when the dome was primitive and had just been established  i had had virtually no appropriate devices with which to study it .  professionally  i would greatly welcome a chance to make a thorough study of a case of the plague with modern techniques and instrumentation  to find out  perhaps  the true cause  the true cure  the true prevention .  it s a reason for excitement  yes .  it is a professional excitement that this young woman  unable to read minds  and without experience in such things  interprets as simple joy .  it isn t simple .     it may not be simple   said marlene   but it s malevolent .  i m not mistaken in that .     you are mistaken .  the brain scan must and will take place .     it will not    said marlene  practically shouting .   you ll have to force me or sedate me  and then it won t be valid .    insigna said  her voice shaking   i don t want anything done against her will .     this is something that goes beyond what she wills or does not will    began d  aubisson  and then staggered back with her hand to her abdomen .   genarr said automatically   what s the matter .    then  without waiting for an answer  leaving it to insigna to lead d  aubisson to the nearest sofa and to persuade her to lie down  he turned to marlene and said hurriedly   marlene  agree to the test .     i don t want to .  she ll say i have the plague .     she won t .  i guarantee that .  not unless you really do .     i don t .     i m sure you don t  and the brain scan will prove it .  trust me  marlene .  please .    marlene looked from genarr to d  aubisson and back again .    and i can go back out on erythro again .     of course .  as often as you wish .  if you re normal  and you re sure you re normal  aren t you .     sure as anything .     then the brain scan will prove it .      yes  but she ll say i can t go out again .     your mother .     and the doctor .     no  they won t dare stop you .  now  just say you ll allow the brain scan .     all right .  she can have it .    ranay d  aubisson struggled to her feet .        .     d  aubisson studied the computerized analysis of the brain scan carefully while siever genarr watched .    a curious scan   muttered d  aubisson .    we knew that to begin with   said genarr .   she s a strange young woman .  the point is there s no change .     none   said d  aubisson .   you sound disappointed .     don t start that again  commander .  there s a certain professional disappointment .  i would like to study the condition .     how do you feel .     i just told you .     i mean  physically .  that was a strange collapse you had yesterday .     it wasn t a collapse .  it was nervous tension .  i m not often accused of wanting someone to be seriously ill  and of having it apparently believed .      what happened .  an attack of indigestion .     could be .  abdominal pains  in any case .  and dizziness .     does that often happen to you  ranay .     no  it doesn t   she said sharply .   neither am i accused of unprofessional behavior often .     just an excitable young woman .  why did you take it so seriously .     do you mind if we change the subject .  she does not have any signs of brain scan change .  if she was normal before  then she is still normal .     in that case  is it your professional opinion that she may continue to explore erythro .     since she has not been affected  apparently  i have no grounds on which to forbid her .     are you willing to go beyond that and send her out .    d  aubisson s attitude grew hostile .   you know that i ve been to see commissioner pitt .   it did not sound like a question .    yes  i know   said genarr quietly .    he has asked me to head a new project designed to study the erythro plague  and there will be a generous appropriation toward that study .     i think that is a good idea and that you are a thoroughly good choice to head the study .     thank you .  however  he did not appoint me commander in your place .  therefore  it is up to you  commander  to decide whether marlene fisher can be allowed to go out on erythro .  i will confine myself to giving her a brain scan if signs of abnormality show up .     i intend to give marlene permission to explore erythro freely whenever she wishes .  may i have your concurrence in that .     since you have my medical opinion that she does not have the plague  i will make no attempt to stop you  but the order to do so will have to be yours alone .  if anything must be put into writing  you will have to sign it yourself .     but you won t try to stop me .     i have no reason to .         .     dinner was over and soft music played in the background .  siever genarr  who had carefully talked of other things to an uneasy eugenia insigna  finally said   the words are the words of ranay d  aubisson  but the force behind them is that of janus pitt .    insigna s look of uneasiness deepened .   do you really think that .     yes  i do  and you should .  you know janus better than i do  i think .  it s too bad .  ranay is a competent doctor  has a profound mind  and is a good person  but she s ambitious  as we all are  one way or another  and she can therefore be corrupted .  she really wants to go down in history as the one who defeated the erythro plague .    and she would be willing to risk marlene to do it .     not willing in the sense that she wants to  or is eager to  but willing in the sense of  well  if there s no other way .     but there must be other ways .  to send marlene into danger  as an experimental device  is monstrous .     not from her standpoint  and certainly not from pitt s .  one mind is well lost if it rescues a world and makes it a fit human habitation for millions .  it s a hard hearted way of looking at it  but future generations might make a heroine out of ranay for being hard hearted  and agree with her that one mind was well lost  or a thousand  if that s what it would take .     yes  if it s not their minds .         of course .  all through history  human beings have been ready to make sacrifices at the expense of other people .  certainly  pitt would .  or don t you agree .     about pitt .  yes  i do   said insigna energetically .   to think that i worked with him all those years .     then you know that he would view this in a very moralistic sense .   the greatest good for the greatest number   he would say .  ranay admits that she talked to him on her recent visit to rotor  and i m as positive that that s what he said to her  in one form of words or another  as that i am sitting in this chair .     and what would he say   said insigna bitterly   if marlene were exposed  and destroyed  and the plague remained untouched .  what would he say if my daughter s life were uselessly reduced to vacuity .  and what would dr .  d  aubisson say .     the doctor would feel unhappy .  i m sure of that .     because she wouldn t gain the credit for the cure .     of course  but she would also feel unhappy about marlene  and  i dare say  guilty .  she s not a monster .  as for pitt      he is a monster .     i wouldn t even say that  but he has tunnel vision .  he sees only his plan for the future of rotor .  if anything goes wrong  from our standpoint  he will undoubtedly tell himself that marlene would  in any case  have interfered with his plans  and he will consider all to have happened for the good of rotor .  it will not hang heavily on his conscience .    insigna shook her head slightly .   i wish we were making a mistake  that pitt and d  aubisson were not guilty of such things .     i  too  wish that  but i am willing to trust marlene and her body language insights .  she said that ranay was happy at the possibility that she would have a chance to study the plague .  i accept marlene s judgment in this .     d  aubisson said she was happy for professional reasons   insigna said .    actually  i can believe that  in a way .  after all  i m a scientist  too .     of course you are   said genarr  his homely face crinkling into a smile .   you were willing to leave the solar system and go on an untried trip across the light years to gain astronomical knowledge  even though you knew it might mean the death of every person on rotor .     a very small chance  it seemed to me .     small enough to risk your one year old child .  you might have left her with your stay at home husband and made sure of her safety  even though it would have meant you would never see her again .  instead  you risked her life  not even for the greater good of rotor  but for the greater good of yourself .    insigna said   stop it  siever .  that s so cruel .     i m just trying to show you that almost everything can be looked at from two opposing sets of views  given sufficient ingenuity .  yes  d  aubisson calls it professional pleasure at being able to study the disease  but marlene said the doctor was being malevolent  and again i trust marlene s choice of words .     then i suppose   said insigna  the corners of her mouth curving downward   that she is anxious to have marlene go out on erythro again .     i suspect she does  but she is cautious enough to insist that i give the order and even suggests i put it in writing .  she wants to make sure that it is i  not she  who gets the blame if something goes wrong .  she s beginning to think like pitt .  our friend janus is contagious .     in that case  siever  you mustn t send marlene out .  why play into pitt s hands .     on the contrary  eugenia .  it s not simple at all .  we must send her out .     what .     there s no choice  eugenia .  and no danger to her .  you see  i now believe you were right when you suggested there was some permeating life form on the planet that could exert some sort of power over us .  you pointed out that i was deleteriously affected  and you were  and the guard was  and always when marlene was in any way opposed .  and i just saw precisely that happen to ranay .  when ranay tried to force a brain scan on marlene  she doubled up .  when i persuaded marlene to accept the brain scan  ranay immediately improved .     well  there you are  then  siever .  if there s a malevolent life form on the planet      now  wait  eugenia .  i didn t say it was malevolent .  even if this life form  whatever it might be  caused the plague as you suggested it did  that stopped .  you said it was because we seemed to be content to remain in the dome  but if the life form were truly malevolent  it would have wiped us out and it would not have settled for what seems to me to have been a civilized compromise .     i don t think it s safe to try to consider the actions of a totally alien life form and deduce from that its emotions or intentions .  what it think might well be totally beyond our understanding .     i agree  eugenia  but it s not harming marlene .  everything it has done has served to protect marlene  to shield her from interference .     if that s so   said insigna   then why was she frightened  why did she begin to run to dome  screaming .  not for one moment do i believe her tale that the silence made her nervous and she was just trying to make some noise to break that silence .     that is hard to believe .  the point is  though  that the panic subsided quickly .  by the time her would be rescuers reached her  she seem perfectly normal .  i would guess that something the life form had done had frightened marlene  i would imagine it was as unlikely to understand our emotions  as we are to understand its  but  seeing what it had done  it proceeded to soothe her quickly .  that would explain what happened and would demonstrate  once again  the humane nature of the life form .    insigna was frowning .   the trouble with you  siever  is that you have this terrible compulsion to think good of everyone  and everything .  i can t trust your interpretation .     trust or not  you will find we can in no way oppose marlene .  whatever she wants to do  she will do  and the opposition will be left behind  gasping in pain or flat out unconscious .    insigna said   but what is this life form .     i don t know  eugenia .     and what frightens me more than anything  now  is  what does it want with marlene .    genarr shook his head .   i don t know  eugenia .   and they stared at each other helplessly .       thirty two  lost       .     crile fisher watched the bright star thoughtfully .  at first  it had been too bright to watch in the ordinary sense .  he had glanced at it every once in a while and would see a bright afterimage .  tessa wendel  who was in a state of despair over developments  had scolded and spoken of retinal damage  so he had opacified the viewport and had brought the brightness of the star down to just bearable levels .  that dimmed the other stars to a downcast  tarnished glitter .   the bright star was the sun  of course .  it was farther away than any human being had ever seen it  except for the people of rotor on their journey away from the solar system  .  it was twice as far away as one would see it from pluto at its farthest  so that it showed no orb and shone with the appearance of a star .  nevertheless  it was still a hundred times the brightness of the full moon as seen from earth  and that hundredfold brightness was condensed and compacted into one brilliant point .  no wonder one still couldn t bear to turn a direct and unflinching gaze upon it through an un opacified glass .   it made things different .  the sun  ordinarily  was nothing to wonder at .  it was too bright to look at  too unrivaled in its position .  the minor portion of its light that was scattered into blueness by the atmosphere was sufficient to blank out the other stars altogether  and even where the stars were not blanked out  as on the moon  for instance  they were so overridden by the sun that there was no thought of comparison .   here  so far out in space  the sun had dimmed at least to the point where comparison was possible .  wendel had said that from this vantage point  the sun was one hundred and sixty thousand times as bright as sirius  which was the next brightest object in the sky .  it was perhaps twenty million times as bright as the dimmest stars he could see by eye .  it made the sun seem more marvelous by comparison than when it shone  uncompared  in earth s sky .   nor did he have much more to do than watch the sky  for the superluminal was merely drifting .  it had been doing that for two days   two days of drifting through space at mere rocket velocities .   at this speed it would take thirty five thousand years to reach the neighbor star  if they had been heading in the right direction .  and they weren t .   it was this that had turned wendel  two days earlier  into a picture of white faced despair .   until then  there had been no trouble .  when they were due to enter hyperspace  fisher had tensed himself  fearing the possible pain  the piercing flash of agony  the sudden surge of eternal darkness .   none of that had happened .  it had all been too fast to experience .  they had entered into and emerged from hyperspace in the same instant .  the stars had simply blinked into a different pattern with no perceptible moment in which they had lost their first pattern  yet not gained their second .   it was relief in a double sense .  not only was he still alive  but he realized that if something had gone wrong and he had died  then death would have come in such a no time way that he could not possibly have experienced death .  he would simply have been dead .   the relief was so keen that he was scarcely aware that tessa had let out a gasp of disturbance and pain  and dashed out to the engine room with an outcry .   she came back looking disheveled  not a hair out of place  but looking internally disheveled .  her eyes were wild and she stared at fisher as though she did not really recognize him .   she said   the pattern should not have changed .     shouldn t it .     we haven t moved far enough .  or shouldn t have .  only one and a third milli light years .  that would not have been enough to alter the star pattern to the unaided eye .  however   she drew a deep  shuddering breath   it s not as bad as it might have been .  i thought we had slipped and moved out thousands of light years .     would that have been possible  tessa .     of course it would have been possible .  if our passage through hyperspace weren t tightly controlled  a thousand light years is as easy as one .     in that case  we can as easily just go     wendel anticipated the conclusion .   no  we couldn t just go back .  if our controls were that slipshod  every pass we would make would be uncontrolled travel  ending at some random point  and we d never find our way back .    fisher frowned .  the euphoria of having passed through hyperspace and back  and stayed alive  began to leak away .   but when you sent out test objects  you brought them back safely .     they were far less massive and were sent out through far shorter distance .  but  as i said  it s not too bad .  it turns out we went the correct distance .  the stars are in the correct pattern .     but they changed .  i saw them change .     because we re oriented differently .  the long axis of the ship has veered through an angle of better than twenty eight degrees .  in short  we followed a curved path rather than a straight one for some reason .    the stars  as seen through the viewport  were moving now  slowly  steadily .   wendel said   we re turning to face the neighbor star again  just for the psychological value of facing in the right direction  but then we must find out why we curved in passage .    the bright star  the beacon star  the star of brilliance entered the viewport and moved across it .  fisher blinked .    that s the sun   said wendel  answering fisher s look of astonishment .   fisher said    are there any reasonable explanations why the ship curved in passage .  if rotor also curved  who knows where they ended .     or where we will end either .  because i don t have any reasonable explanation .  not right now .   she looked at him  clearly troubled .   if our assumptions were correct  then we should have changed position but not direction .  we should have moved in a straight line  a euclidean straight line  despite the relativistic curve of space time  because we weren t in space time  you see .  there may be a mistake in the programming of the computer  or a mistake in our assumptions .  i hope the former .  that can be corrected easily .    five hours passed .  wendel came in  rubbing her eyes .  fisher looked up uncomfortably .  he had been viewing a film  but had lost interest .  he had then watched the stars  allowing the patterns to hypnotize him  like anesthesia .   he said   well  tessa .     nothing wrong with the programming  crile .     then the assumptions must be wrong .     yes  but in what way .  there are an infinite number of assumptions we might make .  which are correct .  we can t try them one after another .  we d never finish  and we d be hopelessly lost .    silence fell between them for a while and then wendel said   if it had been the programming  it would have been a stupid mistake .  we would have corrected it  without learning anything  but we d have been safe .  but now  if we must go back to fundamentals  we have a chance of discovering something really important  but if we fail  we may never find our way back .    she snatched at fisher s hand .   do you understand  crile .  something is wrong and if we don t find out what  there s no way  except sheer incredible accident  that will allow us to find our way home .  no matter how we try  we may continue to end up in the wrong place  and find ourselves steadily wronger and wronger .  which means death eventually  when our cycling fails  or our power supply peters out  or deep despair drains away our ability to live .  and it s i who ve done this to you .  but the real tragedy would be the loss of a dream .  if we don t come back  they ll never know if the ship was successful at all .  they might conclude the transition was fatal and they might never try again .     but they must if they expect to escape from earth .     they may give up  they may sit cowering  waiting for the neighbor star to complete its approach and pass on  and dying bit by bit .   she looked up  her eyes blinking rapidly  her face looking terribly tired .    and it would be the end of your dream  too  crile .    crile s lips tightened  and he said nothing .   almost timidly  wendel said   but for years now  crile  you ve had me .  if your daughter  your dream  is gone  was i enough .     i might ask  if superluminal flight is gone  was i enough .    there seemed no easy answer on either side  but then wendel said   you re second best  crile  but it has been a good second best .  thank you .    fisher stirred .   you speak for me  too  tessa  something i wouldn t have believed at the start .  if i had never had a daughter  there would have only been you .  i almost wish      don t wish that .  second best is enough .    and they held hands .  quietly .  and gazed out at the stars .   until merry blankowitz poked her face through the doorway .   captain wendel  wu has an idea .  he said he had it all along  but was reluctant to mention it .    wendel started to her feet .   why was he reluctant .     he said he once suggested the possibility to you  and you told him not to be a fool .     did i .  and what has convinced him that i m never wrong .  i ll listen to it now and if it s a good idea  i ll break his neck for not forcing it on me earlier .    and she hurried out .        .     fisher could only wait during the day and a half that followed .  they all ate together as they always did  but silently .  fisher did not know if any of them slept .  he slept only in snatches  and woke to renewed despair .   how long can we go on like this .  he thought on the second day  as he looked at the beauty of that unattainable bright dot in the sky that  so brief a time ago  had warmed him and lighted his way on earth .   sooner or later  they would die .  modern space technology would prolong life .  recycling was quite efficient .  even food would last a long time if they were willing to accept the tasteless algae cake they would end up with .  the micro fusion motors would dribble out energy for a long time  too .  but surely no one would want to prolong life through the full time that the ship would make possible .   with a lingering  dragging  hopeless  lonely death finally certain  the rational way out would be to use the adjustable de metabolizers .   that was the preferred method for suicide on earth  why should it not be on board ship as well .  you could  if you wished  adjust the dose for a full day of reasonably normal life  live it out as joyously as you could  a known last day .  at the end of the day  you would grow naturally sleepy .  you would yawn and release your hold on wakefulness  passing into a peaceful sleep of restful dreams .  the sleep would slowly deepen  the dreams would slowly fade  and you would not wake up .  no kinder death had ever been invented .   and then  tessa  just before   p . m .   ship time  on the second day after the transition that had curved instead of being straight  burst into the room .  her eyes were wild and she was breathing hard .  her dark hair  which  in the last year had become liberally salted with gray  was mussed .   fisher rose in consternation .   bad .     no  good .   she said  throwing herself into a chair rather than sitting down .   fisher wasn t sure he had heard correctly  wasn t sure that perhaps she might only have been speaking ironically .  he stared at her and watched her as she visibly gathered herself together .    good   she repeated .   very good .  extraordinary .  crile  you re looking at an idiot .  i don t suppose i ll ever recover from this .     well  what happened .     chao li wu had the answer .  he had it all along .  he told me .  i remember him telling me .  months ago .  maybe a year ago .  i dismissed it .  i didn t even listen  really .   she paused to catch her breath .  her excitement had completely disoriented the natural rhythm of her speech .   she said   the trouble was that i thought of myself as the world authority on superluminal flight  and was convinced that no one could possibly tell me anything i didn t know or hadn t thought of .  and if someone did suggest something that seemed strange to me  the idea was simply wrong  and  presumably  idiotic .  do you know what i mean .    fisher said grimly   i ve met people like that .     everyone s like that  now and then   said wendel   given certain conditions .  i suppose aging scientists are particularly like that .  that s why the daring young revolutionaries of science become old fossils after a few decades .  their imaginations harden with encrusted self love and that s their end .  it is now my end .  .  .  . but enough of that .  it took us over a day to really work it out  to adjust the equations  to program the computer and set up the necessary simulations  to go down blind alleys and catch ourselves .  it should have taken a week  but we were all driving each other like maniacs .    wendel paused here  as if to catch her breath .  fisher waited for her to continue  nodding encouragement as he reached out to grasp her hand .    this is complex   she continued .   let me try to explain .  look  we go from one point in space through hyperspace to another point in space in zero time .  but there s a path we take to do that  and it s a different path each time  depending on the starting and ending points .  we don t observe the path  we don t experience it  we don t actually follow it in space time fashion .  it exists in a rather incomprehensible way .  it s what we call a  virtual path .   i worked out that concept myself .     if you don t observe it  and don t experience it  how do you know it s there .     because it can be calculated by the equations we use to describe the motion through hyperspace .  the equations give us the path .     how can you possibly know that the equations are describing anything that has actual reality .  if could be just  mathematics .     it could be .  i thought it was .  i ignored it .  it was wu who suggested it might have significance  maybe a year ago  and like a full grown idiot  i dismissed it .  a virtual path  i said  had merely virtual existence .  if it couldn t be measured  it was outside the realm of science .  i was so shortsighted .  i can t endure myself when i think of it .     all right .  suppose the virtual path has some sort of existence .  what then .     in that case  if the virtual path is drawn near a sizable body  the ship experiences gravitational effects .  that was the first breathtakingly true and useful new concept  that gravitation can make itself felt along the virtual path .   wendel shook her fist angrily .   i saw that myself  in a way  but i reasoned that since a ship would be moving at many times the speed of light  gravitation would have insufficient time to make itself felt to any measurable extent .  travel would therefore be  by my assumption  in a euclidean straight line .     but it wasn t .     obviously not .  and wu explained it .  imagine that the speed of light is a zero point .  all speeds less than that of light would have negative magnitude  and all speeds greater than that of light would have positive magnitude .  in the ordinary universe we live in  therefore  all speeds would be negative  by that mathematical convention  and  in fact  must be negative .    now  the universe is built on principles of symmetry .  if something as fundamental as speed of movement is always negative  then something else  just as fundamental  ought to be always positive  and wu suggested that that something else was gravitation .  in the ordinary universe  it is always an attraction .  every object with mass attracts every other object with mass .    however  if something goes at a superluminal speed  that is  faster than light  then its speed is positive and the other something that was positive has to become negative .  at superluminal speed  in other words  gravitation is a repulsive force .  every object with mass repels every other object with mass .  wu suggested that to me a long time ago and i wouldn t listen .  his words just bounced off my eardrums .    crile said   but what s the difference  tessa .  when we re going at enormous superluminal speeds  and gravitational attraction doesn t have time to affect our motion  neither would gravitational repulsion .     ah  that s not so  crile .  that s the beauty of it .  that reverses  too .  in the ordinary universe of negative speeds  the faster the speed relative to an attractive body  the less gravitational attraction affects the direction of movement .  in the universe of positive speeds  hyperspace  the faster we go relative to a repulsive body  the more gravitational repulsion affects the direction of movement .  that makes no sense to us  since we re used to the situation as it exists in the ordinary universe  but once you are forced to change signs from plus to minus and vice versa  you find these things falling into place .     mathematically .  but how much can you trust the equations .     you match your calculations against the facts .  gravitational attraction is the weakest of all the forces and so is the gravitational repulsion along the virtual paths .  within the ship and within us  every particle repels all other particles while we are in hyperspace  but that repulsion can do nothing against the other forces that hold it together and have not changed signs .  however  our virtual path from  station four to here carried us close to jupiter .  its repulsion along the virtual hyperspatial path was just as intense as its attraction would have been along a nonvirtual spatial path .    we calculated how jupiter s gravitational repulsion would affect our path through hyperspace  and that path curved exactly as it had been observed to do .  in other words  wu s modification of my equations not only simplifies them  but it makes them work .     fisher said   and did you break wu s neck  tessa  as you promised you would .    wendel laughed  remembering her threat .   no  i didn t .  actually  i kissed him .     i don t blame you .     of course  it s more important now than ever that we get back safely  crile .  this advance in superluminal flight must be reported  and wu must be properly honored .  he built on my work  i admit  but he went on to do what i might never have thought to do .  i mean  consider the consequences .     i can see them   said fisher .    no  you can t   said wendel sharply .   now  listen to me .  rotor had no problems with gravitation because they merely skimmed the speed of light  a little below it at some times  a little above it at others  so that gravitational effects  whether positive or negative  attractive or repulsive  had immeasurably small effects on them .  it was our own true superluminal flights at many times the speed of light that makes it imperative to take gravitational repulsion into account .  my own equations are useless .  they will get ships through hyperspace  but not in the right direction .  and that s not all .    i have always thought that there was a certain unavoidable danger in emerging from hyperspace  the second half of the transition .  what if you merge into an already existing object .  there would be a fantastic explosion that would destroy the ship and everything in it in a trillionth of a trillionth of a second .    naturally  we re not going to end up inside a star because we know where the stars are located and can avoid them .  in time  we might even know where a star s planets are and avoid them  too .  but there are asteroids by the tens of thousands and comets by the tens of billions in the neighborhood of every star .  if we end up overlapping one of those  that would still be deadly .    the only thing that would save us  in the situation as i had thought it to be before today  is the laws of chance .  space is so huge that the chance of striking any object larger than an atom or  at most  a grain of dust is extraordinarily small .  still  given enough trips through hyperspace  the overlapping of matter is a catastrophe just waiting to happen .    but under conditions as we now know them to be  the chances are zero .  our ship and any sizable object would repel each other and tend to move apart .  we are not likely to run afoul of anything deadly .  they would all automatically move out of our path .    fisher scratched at his forehead .   wouldn t we move out of our path  too .  won t that upset our course unexpectedly .     yes  but the small objects we are likely to encounter will alter our path in very limited fashion and we could easily make it up  a small price to pay for safety .    wendel took a deep breath and stretched luxuriantly .   i feel great .  what a sensation all this will make when we get back to earth .    fisher chuckled .   you know  tessa  before you came in  i was building a morbid picture in my head of our being irretrievably lost  of our ship wandering forever  with five dead bodies aboard  of its being found someday by intelligent beings who would mourn the obvious space tragedy      well  it won t happen  you can count on that  my dear   said wendel  smiling  and they embraced .       thirty three  mind       .     eugenia insigna looked woebegone .   have you really decided to go out again  marlene .     mother   said marlene with weary patience   you make it sound as though i ve come to this decision five minutes ago after a long period of uncertainty .  i ve been sure for a very long time that out there on erythro is where i intend to be .  i haven t changed my mind  and i won t change it .     i know you re convinced that you re safe and i admit that nothing has happened to you so far  but     marlene said   i feel safe on erythro .  i m drawn to it .  uncle siever understands .    eugenia looked at her daughter  as if to object once again  but shook her head instead .  marlene s mind was made up  and she was not to be stopped .        .     it s warmer on erythro this time  marlene thought  just warm enough to make the breeze welcome .  the grayish clouds were scudding across the sky a bit more rapidly  and they seemed thicker .   rain was predicted for the next day  and marlene thought it might be nice to be out in the rain and watch what happened .  it should splash in the little creek and make the rocks wet and turn any soil muddy and mushy .   she had come up to a flat rock near the creek .  she brushed it with her hand  and sat down on it carefully  staring at the flowing water curling around the rocks that studded it  and thinking that the rain would feel like taking a shower .   it would be like a shower coming down from the whole sky  so that you couldn t step out of it .  a thought occurred to her  will there be trouble breathing .   no  that couldn t be .  it rained on earth all time  frequently  anyway  and she didn t hear that people drowned in it .  no  it would be like a shower .  you could breathe in a shower .   the rain wouldn t be hot  though  and she liked hot showers .  she thought about it lazily .  it was very quiet out here  and very peaceful  and she could rest and there was no one to see her  to watch her  no one whom she had to interpret .  it was great not to have to interpret .   what temperature would it be .  the rain  that is .  why shouldn t it be the same comfortable temperature as nemesis itself .  of course  she would get wet  and it was always cold when you stepped out of a shower all wet .  and the rain would wet her clothes  too .   but it would be silly to wear clothes in the rain .  you didn t wear clothes in the shower .  if it rained  you would take off your clothes .  that would be the only thing that made sense .   only  where did you put the clothes .  when you showered  you put your clothes i  the cleaner .  here on erythro  maybe you could put them under a rock  or have a little house built  in which you could leave your clothes on a rainy day .  after all  why wear clothes at all if it were raining .   or if it were sunny .   you d want to wear them if it were cold  of course .  but on warm days  but then  why did people wear clothes on rotor  where it was always warm and clean .  they didn t at swimming pools  which reminded marlene that the young people with slim bodies and good shapes were the first ones off with their clothes  and the last ones to put them on again .   and people like marlene just didn t take their clothes off in public .  maybe that s why people wore clothes .  to hide their bodies .   why didn t minds have shapes you could show off .  except that they did  and then people didn t like it .  people liked to look at shapely bodies and turned up their noses at shapely minds .  why .   but here in erythro with no people  she could take her clothes off whenever it was mild and be free of them .  there d be no one to point fingers or laugh at her .   in fact  she could do whatever she wanted because she had a whole comfortable world  an empty world  an all alone world  to surround her and envelop her like a huge soft blanket enclosing her and  just silence .   she could feel herself letting go .  just silence .  her mind whispered it  so that even that would interfere as little as possible .   silence .   and she sat upright .  silence .   but she had come out to hear the voice again .  and not scream this time .  not be afraid .  where was the voice .   as though she had called it  as though she had whistled it up  marlene .    her heart gave a little jump .   she held herself firm .  she mustn t make any sign of fright or disturbance .  she simply looked around  and then said  very calmly   where are you  please .     it is not  necery necessary to vi vibrate the air talk .    the voice was aurinel s  but it didn t speak like aurinel at all .  it sounded as though talking were difficult  but as though it would get better .    it will get better   said the voice .   marlene had not said anything .  she did not say anything now .  she merely thought the words  i don t have to talk .  i only need to think .     you only need to adjust the pattern .  you re doing it .     but i hear you talk .     i am adjusting your pattern .  it is as though you hear me .    marlene licked her lips gently .  she must not allow herself to be frightened  to be anything but calm .    there is nothing of which  whom  what to be frightened   said the voice that was not quite aurinel s voice .   she thought   you hear everything  don t you .     does that bother you .     yes  it does .     why .     i don t want you to know everything .  i want some thoughts to myself .    she tried not to think that that was how others might react to her  and want to keep their feelings private  but the thought  marlene knew  would leak out  the moment she made the effort not to think it .     but your pattern is unlike the others .     my pattern .     the pattern of your mind .  others are  tangled  snarled .  yours is  splendid .    marlene licked her lips again and smiled .  when her mind was sensed  it could be seen to be splendid .  she felt triumphant and thought with contempt of the girls who had only  outsides .   the voice in her mind said   is that thought private .   marlene almost spoke aloud .   yes  it is .     i can detect a distinction .  i will not respond to your private thoughts .    marlene felt herself hungering for praise .   have you seen many patterns .     i have sensed many  since you hu mans things came .    it wasn t sure of the word  marlene thought .  the voice made no response and marlene was surprised .  the surprise had been a private sensation  now that she came to think of it  but she hadn t openly marked it to herself as private .  private was private whether she thought of it or not  perhaps .  the mind had said it could detect the distinction  and it clearly could .  it showed in the pattern .   the voice didn t respond to that either .  she would have to ask specifically  to show that it was not a private thought .    please  does it show in the pattern .   she didn t have to specify .  the voice would know what she was talking about .    it shows in the pattern .  everything shows in your pattern because it is so well designed .    marlene virtually purred .  she had her praise .  it would only be right to return the compliment .   but your own must be well designed  too .     it is different .  my pattern stretches out .  it is simple in every spot and is only complex when taken together .  yours is complex to start with .  there is no simplicity in it .  and yours is different from the others of your kind .  the others are  snarled .  it is not possible to cross reach with them  to communicate .  a rearrangement is damaging  for the pattern is fragile .  i didn t know .  my pattern is not fragile .     is my pattern fragile .     no .  it adjusts itself .     you tried to communicate with others  didn t you .     yes .    the erythro plague .   there was no response .  the thought was private .    she closed her eyes  reaching out intently with her mind  trying to locate the source of the outside mind reaching her .  she was doing it in some way she did not understand  perhaps doing it all wrong  perhaps not doing it at all .  the mind might laugh at her clumsiness  if it did such a thing as laugh .   there was no response .   marlene thought   think something .    inevitably  the thought came back   what shall i think .    it did not come from anywhere .  it did not come from here or there or elsewhere .  it came from inside her mind .   she thought  angered at her own insufficiency    when did you sense my mind pattern .     on the new container of human beings .     on rotor .     on rotor .    she was suddenly enlightened .   you wanted me .  you called me .     yes .    of course .  why else had she so wanted to go to erythro .  why else had she been looking at erythro so longingly that day when aurinel came to her to say her mother was looking for her .   she clenched her teeth .  she must continue asking   where are you .     everywhere .     are you the planet .     no .     show yourself .     here .   and suddenly the voice had a direction .  she was staring at the creek  and she suddenly realized that while she had been communicating with the voice in her mind  the creek had been the only thing she had been sensing .  she had not been aware of anything else around her .  it was as though her mind had enclosed itself  in order to make it more sensitive to the one thing that had filled it .   and now the veil lifted .  the water was moving along the rocks  bubbling over them  swirling in a small eddy in a space marked off by several of those bubbles .  the small bubbles turned and broke  even as new ones formed  setting up a pattern that  in essence  didn t change  and in fine detail was never repeated .   then  one by one  the bubbles broke noiselessly and the water was flat and featureless  but still turned .  how could she see it turn if it were featureless .   because it glistened very slightly in the pink light of nemesis .  it turned and she could see it turn because the shimmers formed arcs that spiraled as they turned and coalesced .  her eyes were caught in it  slowly following the turns as they collected into the caricature of a face  two dark holes for eyes  a slash for a mouth .   it grew sharper  as she watched  fascinated .  and it took on definition and became a face  staring up at her with empty eyes  yet real enough to recognize .   it was the face of aurinel pampas .        .     siever genarr said  thoughtfully and slowly  making an effort to treat the matter calmly    and so you left at that time .    marlene nodded .   the time before i left when i heard aurinel s voice .  this time i left when i saw aurinel s face .     i don t blame you      you re humoring me  uncle siever .     what should i do .  kick you .  let me humor you  if it pleases me .  the mind  as you call it  picked up aurinel s voice and his face from your mind  obviously .  those things must have been very clear in your mind .  how close were you to aurinel .    she looked at him suspiciously .   what do you mean .  how close .     i don t mean anything terrible .  were you friendly .     yes .  of course .     did you have a crush on him .    marlene paused and her lips pressed together .  then she said   i suppose i did .     you use the past tense .  don t you any more .     well  what s the use .  he just thinks of me as  a little girl .  a kid sister  maybe .     not entirely an unnatural thought  under the circumstances .  but you still think of him  which is why you ve conjured up his voice  and then his face .     what do you mean  conjured up  .  it was a real voice and a real face .     are you sure .     of course i am .     have you told your mother any of this .     no .  not a word .     why not .     oh  uncle siever .  you know her .  i couldn t stand all that  nervousness .  i know .  you re going to tell me it s all out of love  but that doesn t make it easier .     you re willing to tell it to me  marlene  and i m certainly very fond of you .     i know that  uncle siever  but you re not the excitable type .  you just look at things logically .     shall i take that as a compliment .     i mean it as one .     in that case  let s look at what you have found out  and do it logically .      all right  uncle siever .     good .  to begin with  there is something alive on this planet .     yes .     and it s not the planet itself .     no  definitely not .  he denied that .     but it s one living thing  apparently .     i get the impression that he s one living thing .  the trouble is  uncle siever  that what i get is not like telepathy is supposed to be .  it s not like reading a mind and just getting talk .  it s also impressions that come over you all at once  like looking at a whole picture instead of at the little bits of light and darkness that make it up .     and the impression is of one living thing .     yes .     and intelligent .     very intelligent .     but not technological .  there is nothing technological that we ve ever found on the planet .  this living thing that is not visible  not apparent  merely broods over the planet  thinks  reasons  but doesn t do anything .  is that it .    marlene hesitated .   i can t quite tell  but maybe you re right .     and then we came .  when do you suppose that it became aware that we had come .    marlene shook her head .   i couldn t say .     well  dear  it was aware of you while you were still on rotor .  it must have become aware of intelligence invading the nemesian system when we were still quite a way off .  did you get that impression .     i don t think so  uncle siever .  i think he didn t know about us until we landed on erythro .  that attracted his attention and then he looked around and found rotor .     perhaps you re right .  then it experimented with these new minds that it sensed on erythro .  they were the first minds not its own that it may have ever sensed .  how long has it lived  marlene .  any idea .     not really  uncle siever  but the impression i got is that he has lived a long time  maybe nearly as long as the planet .     maybe .  in any case  however long it has lived  this was the first time it ever found itself immersed in many other minds  far different from its own .  does that sound right to you  marlene .     yes .     so it experimented with these new minds and because it knew so little about them  it damaged them .  that was the erythro plague .     yes   said marlene with sudden animation .   he didn t say anything about the plague directly  but the impression was strong .  that original experimentation was the cause .     and when it realized that it was causing damage  it stopped .     yes  that s why we don t have erythro plague now .     .   and from that it would seem that this mind is benevolent  that it has a sense of ethics we can approve of  that it doesn t wish to harm other minds .     yes .   said marlene with delight .   i m sure of that .     but what is this life form .  is it a spirit .  something immaterial .  something beyond our senses .     i can t say  uncle siever   sighed marlene .   genarr said   well  let me repeat what it told you .  stop me if i m wrong .  it said its pattern  stretches out   that it is  simple in every spot and is complex only taken together   that it is  not fragile .   am i right .     yes  you are .     and the only life we have ever found on erythro are the prokaryotes  the tiny bacteria like cells .  if i don t want something that s spiritual and immaterial  i m stuck with those prokaryotes .  is it possible that those little cells  which seem separate  are actually part of one world girdling organism .  the mind pattern would then be stretched out .  it would be simple in every spot and would be complex only when taken together .  and it would not be fragile  for even if large sections of it were killed  the world organism would scarcely be touched as a whole .    marlene stared at genarr .   you mean i ve been talking to germs .     i can t say certainly  marlene .  it s only a hypothesis  but it fits beautifully and i can t think of anything else that would explain it as well .  besides  marlene  if we looked at the hundred billion cells that make up your brain  each one of them  taken by itself  isn t really very much .  you are an organism in which all the brain cells are clumped together .  if you talk to another in which all the brain cells are separate and linked  let us say  by tiny radio waves  is that so very different .     i don t know   said marlene  obviously disturbed .    but let s ask another question  one that is very important .  what does this life form  whatever it is  want with you .    marlene looked startled .   he can talk to me  uncle siever .  he can transfer ideas to me .     your suggestion  then  is that it just wants someone to talk to .  do you suppose that once we humans came  it realized for the first time that it was lonely .     i don t know .     no impressions to that effect .     no .     it could destroy us .   genarr was talking to himself now .   it could destroy us without trouble if it grew tired of you  or bored with you .     no  uncle siever .    genarr said   but it definitely hurt me when i wished to get in the way of your connection with the mind of the planet .  it hurt dr .  d  aubisson  your mother  and a guard .     yes  but he hurt you all with only just enough force to stop you from interfering with me .  he did no further damage .     it goes to all these lengths to have you outside on the surface just so that it can talk to you  and have companionship .  somehow that doesn t seem to be enough of a reason .    marlene said   perhaps the reason is something we can t understand .  perhaps he has so different a mind that he couldn t explain his reason  or  if he did  that it would make no sense to us .     but its mind is not so different that it can t converse with you .  it does receive ideas from you and transmit other ideas to you  doesn t it .  you two do communicate .     yes .     and it understands you well enough to try to make itself seem pleasant to you by taking on aurinel s voice and face .    marlene s head bent and she fixed her eyes on the floor in front of her .   genarr said softly   so since it understands us  we may be able to understand it  and  if so  you must find out why it wants you so .  it could be very important to find that out  for who knows what it is planning .  we have no way of finding out except through you  marlene .    marlene was trembling .   i don t know how to do that  uncle siever .     just do as you have been doing .  the mind seems friendly to you  and it may explain .    marlene looked up and studied genarr .  she said   you re afraid  uncle siever .     of course .  we re dealing with a mind far more powerful than ours .  it may  if it decides it doesn t want us  do away with us all .     i don t mean that  uncle siever .  you re afraid for me .    genarr hesitated .   are you still sure that you re safe on erythro  marlene .  are you safe talking to this mind .    marlene rose to her feet and said  almost haughtily   of course i am .  there is no risk .  he will not hurt me .    she sounded supremely confident  but genarr s heart sank .  what she thought scarcely counted  for her mind had been adjusted by the mind of erythro .  could he trust her now .  he wondered .   after all  why should this mind built up of prokaryotes in their trillion trillion not have an agenda of its own  as  for instance  pitt had .  and why shouldn t this mind  in its anxiety to fulfill that agenda  show all the duplicity of pitt .   in short  what if the mind were lying to marlene for reasons of its own .   was he right to send marlene out to that mind under such conditions .   but did it matter whether he was right or not .  had he a choice .       thirty four  close       .      perfect   said tessa wendel .   perfect  perfect  perfect .   she made a gesture as though she were nailing something to the wall  firmly and hard .   perfect .    crile fisher knew what she was talking about .  twice  in two different directions  they had passed through hyperspace .  twice crile had watched the pattern of stars change somewhat .  twice he had searched out the sun  finding it a bit dimmer the first time  a bit brighter the second .  he was beginning to feel like an old hyperspatial knockabout .   he said   the sun isn t bothering us  i take it .     oh  it is  but in a perfectly calculable way  so that the physical interference is a psychological pleasure  if you know what i mean .    fisher said  playing the devil s advocate   the sun s pretty far away  you know .  the gravitational effect must be pretty close to zero .     certainly   said wendel   but pretty close to zero isn t zero .  the effect is measurable .  twice we passed through hyperspace  with the virtual path first approaching the sun obliquely and then receding at another angle .  wu did the calculations beforehand  and the path we took fit those calculations to all the decimal points we could reasonably ask .  the man s a genius .  he weaves shortcuts into the computer program in a fashion you wouldn t believe .     i m sure   murmured fisher .    so there s no question now  crile .  we can be at the neighbor star by tomorrow .  by today  if we re really in a hurry .  not very close  of course .  we may have to coast inward toward the star for a reasonable period of time  as a precautionary measure .  besides  we don t know the mass of the neighbor star with sufficient precision to take too many chances on a really close approach .  we don t want to be hurled off unexpectedly and have to work our way back .   she shook her head admiringly   that wu .  i m so pleased with him  i can t begin to describe it .    fisher said cautiously    are you sure you don t feel a little annoyed .     annoyed .  why .   she stared at fisher in surprise  then said   do you think i ought to be jealous .     well  i don t know .  is there a chance that chao li wu will get the credit for working out superluminal flight  i mean  the true details of it  and that you ll be forgotten  or remembered only as a forerunner .     no  not at all  crile .  it s nice of you to worry on my behalf  but matters are secure .  my work is recorded in full detail .  the basic mathematics of superluminal flight are mine .  the engineering details i have also contributed to  although others will get the major credit for designing the ship  and should .  what wu has done has been to add a correction factor to the basic equations .  highly important  of course  and we can now see that superluminal flight wouldn t be practical without it  but it s just the icing on the cake .  the cake is still mine .     fine .  if you re sure of that  i m happy .     as a matter of fact  crile  i m hoping wu will now take the lead in developing superluminal flight .  the fact is  i m past my best years  scientifically  that is .  only scientifically  crile .    fisher grinned .   i know that .     but scientifically  i am over the hill .  the work i ve done has been the mining of the concepts i had when i was a graduate student .  it s been a matter of about twenty five years of drawing conclusions  and i ve gone about as far as i can go .  what s needed are brand new concepts  entirely new thoughts  a branching off into uncharted territory .  i can t do that any more .     come  tessa  don t underrate yourself .     that s never been one of my faults  crile .  new thoughts are what we need youth for .  it s not just young brains that young people have  it s new brains .  wu has a genome that has never appeared in humanity before .  he s had experiences that are crucially his  no one else s .  he can have new thoughts .  of course  he bases them on what i have done before him  and he owes a great deal to my teaching .  he s a student of mine  crile  a child of my intellect .  all that he does well reflects well on me .  jealous of him .  i glory in him .  what s the matter  crile .  you don t look happy .     i m happy if you are  tessa  no matter how i look .  the trouble is that i have the feeling you re feeding me the theory of scientific advance .  weren t their cases in the history of science  as in everything else  where jealousy existed  and where teachers detested their students for surpassing them .     certainly .  i could quote you half a dozen notorious cases right off the top of my head  but those are rare exceptions and the fact is that i don t feel that way right now .  i don t say that it isn t conceivable that i may at some time lose patience with wu and the universe  but it isn t happening at the moment  and i intend to savor this moment while it  oh  now what .    she pushed the  receive  contact and merry blankowitz s young face appeared trimensionally in the transmitter .    captain   she said hesitantly .   we re having a discussion out here and i wonder if we can consult you .     is something wrong with the flight .     no  captain .  it s just a discussion over strategy .     i see .  well  you needn t file in here .  i ll come out to the engine room .    wendel blanked out the face .   fisher muttered   blankowitz doesn t usually sound that serious .  what s bugging them  do you suppose .     i m not going to speculate .  i ll go out there and find out .   and she motioned fisher to follow .        .     there were the three of them  sitting in the engine room  all of them with seats carefully on the floor  despite the fact that they were under zero gravity at the moment .  they might just as well have been sitting each on a different wall  but that would have detracted from the seriousness of the situation  and it would have shown disrespect for the office of captain  besides .  there was a complex system of etiquette that had long been developed for zero gravity .   wendel did not like zero gravity and if she had wanted to push her captain s privileges  she could have insisted on the ship being in rotation at all times to produce a centrifugal effect that would have produced some feeling of gravity .  she knew perfectly well that computing a flight path was easier when the ship was at rest  both translationally and rotationally  with respect to the universe as a whole  but calculating it under constant rotational velocity didn t raise the difficulty to too high a level .   nevertheless  to insist on such motion would have been disrespectful to the person at the computer .  etiquette again .   tessa wendel took her seat  and crile fisher could not help but notice  with a secret  ingrown smile  that she lurched slightly .  for all her settlement background  she had clearly never gotten her space legs .  he himself  and there was another secret smile  of satisfaction  this time   for all that he was an earthman  could move about in zero gravity as though he were born to it .   chao li wu took a deep breath .  he had a broad face  the type that looked like it belonged with a short body  but he was taller than average  when he stood up .  his hair was dark and perfectly straight and his eyes were markedly narrow .   he said softly   captain .   wendel said   what is it  chao li .  if you tell me some problem has developed in the programming  i may be tempted to choke you .     no problem  captain .  no problem at all .  in fact  there is such an absence of problems that it strikes me that we re through and should go back to earth .  i would like to suggest that .     back to earth .   wendel had paused before she said that  had taken the time to look a little stupefied .   why .  we haven t accomplished our task yet .     i think we have  captain   said wu  his face growing expressionless .   we just didn t know what our task was  to begin with .  we have worked out a practical system of superluminal flight  and we didn t have that when we left earth .     i know that  but what of it .     and we don t have any means of communication with earth .  if we go on now to the neighbor star and if something happens to us  if something goes wrong  earth will not have practical superluminal flight and there is no telling when they will .  this could have a serious affect on earth s evacuation as the neighbor star approaches .  i feel that it is important that we go back and explain what we ve learned .    wendel had listened gravely .   i see .  and you  jarlow  what are your views on this .    henry jarlow was tall and blond and dour .  there was a settled melancholy on his face that gave a totally wrong impression of his character  and his long fingers  which had nothing apparently delicate about them  were magic when they worked with the interior of computers or with almost any instrument on board .   he said   i think wu makes sense  frankly .  if we had superluminal communication  we d get the information back to earth that way and go on .  what would happen to us after that would be of no importance except to us .  as it is  we can t sit on the gravitational correction .     and you  blankowitz .   asked wendel quietly .  merry blankowitz stirred uneasily .  she was a small young woman and her long dark hair was cut straight across  just over her eyebrows .  between that and the delicacy of her bone structure and her quick  nervous movements  she looked like a miniature cleopatra .   she said   i don t really know .  i don t have very definite feelings about this  but the men seem to have talked me into it .  don t you think it s important to get the information to earth .  we ve worked out crucial effects on this trip and we need more and better ships  with computers designed to take the gravitational correction into account .  we ll be able to make a single transition between the solar system and the neighbor star and do it under stronger gravitational intensities so that we can start closer to the sun and end closer to the neighbor star and not have to spend weeks of coasting at both ends .  it seems to me that earth has to know about this .    wendel said   i see .  the whole point seems to me to be whether it wouldn t be wise to get the information of the gravitational correction back to earth right now .  wu  is that really as essential as you make it appear .  you didn t get the idea for the correction here on the ship .  it seems to me that you discussed it with me months ago .   she thought a moment .    almost a year ago .     we didn t really discuss it  captain .  you were impatient with me  as i recall  and wouldn t really listen .     yes  i ve admitted i was mistaken .  but you did write it down .  i told you to make up a formal report and that i would go over it when i had time .   she held up a hand .   i know i never had time to go over it  and i don t even recall if i received it  but i imagine  wu  that you   being you  would have prepared the report in some detail  and with all the reasoning and mathematics anyone could want .  didn t you do that  wu  and isn t that report in the records .    wu s lips seemed to tighten  but his tone of voice did not alter in any way .   yes  i prepared the report  but it was just speculation  and i don t suppose anyone else will pay any attention to it  any more than you did  captain .     why not .  not everyone is as stupid as i am  wu .     even if they paid attention  it would still be nothing more than speculation .  when we go back  we will be able to present proof .     once the speculation exists  someone will get the proof .  you know how science works .    wu said in a slow and significant tone   someone .     now we have the nature of your concern  wu .  you re not worried that earth won t obtain a practical method of superluminal flight .  you are worried that they will  but that the credit will not be yours .  isn t that right .     captain  there s nothing wrong with that .  a scientist has every right to be concerned over matters of priority .    wendel positively smoldered .   have you forgotten that i am the captain of this ship and make the decisions .     i haven t forgotten that   said wu   but this is not a sailing vessel of the eighteenth century .  we are all scientists  primarily  and we must make decisions in some sort of democratic fashion .  if the majority wishes to return      wait   said fisher sharply   before this continues  do you mind if i say something .  i m the only one who hasn t spoken and if we re going to be democratic  i would like to take my turn on the floor .  may i  captain .     go ahead   said wendel  her right hand clenching and unclenching as though it just longed to grab someone by the throat .   fisher said   just about seven and a half centuries ago  christopher columbus sailed westward from spain and  eventually  discovered america  though he himself never knew that that was what he had done .  en route  he made the discovery that the deviation of the magnetic compass from the true north  the so called  magnetic declination   changed with longitude .  this was an important finding and was  in fact  the first purely scientific discovery made in the course of a sea voyage .    now  how many know that columbus discovered the variation of magnetic declination .  virtually no one .  how many know that columbus discovered america .  virtually everyone .  so suppose that columbus  on discovering the variation  decided  midway  to go home and make the glad announcement to king ferdinand and queen isabella  preserving his priority as the discoverer of the phenomenon .  that discovery might conceivably have been greeted with interest and the monarchs might eventually have sent out another expedition headed  let us say  by amerigo vespucci  who would then have reached america .  in that case  who would remember that columbus had made some sort of discovery about the compass .  virtually no one .  who would remember that vespucci had discovered america .  virtually everyone .    so do you really want to go back .  the discovery of the gravitational correction will  i assure you  be remembered by a few as a small side effect of superluminal travel .  but the crew of the next expedition that will actually reach the neighbor star  will be hailed as the first to reach a star by superluminal flight .  you three  even you  wu  will scarcely be worth a footnote .    you might think that  as a reward for this great discovery that wu has made  it will be you that will be sent out on a second expedition  but i m afraid not .  you see  igor koropatsky  who is the director of the terrestrial board of inquiry and who is waiting for us back on earth  is particularly interested in information on the neighbor star and its planetary system .  he will explode like krakatoa when he finds out that we were within reach of it and turned back .  and of course  captain wendel will be forced to explain that you three had mutinied  which is an extremely serious offense  even if we are not an eighteenth century sailing vessel .  far from going out on the next expedition  you will never see the inside of a laboratory again .  count on it .  what you may see  despite your scientific eminence  is the inside of a jail .  don t underestimate koropatsky s fury .    so think about it  you three .  on to the neighbor star .  or back home .    there was a silence .  for a while  no one said anything .    well   said wendel harshly   i think that fisher has explained the situation very clearly .  doesn t anyone have anything to say .    blankowitz said in a low voice    actually  i never thought it through .  i think we ought to go on .    jarlow grunted .   i think so  too .    wendel said   what about you  chao li wu .    wu shrugged .   i wouldn t stand against the rest .     i m glad to hear that .  this incident is forgotten as far as the earth authorities will be concerned  but there had better be no repetition  no further action of any kind that could be considered mutinous .         .     back in their own quarters  fisher said   you don t mind  i hope  that i interfered .  i was afraid you would explode to no effect .     no  it was good .  i wouldn t have thought of the columbus analogy  which was perfect .  thank you  crile .   she took his hand and squeezed it .   he smiled briefly .   i had to justify my presence on board ship somehow .     you more than justified it .  and you have no idea how disgusted i was  to have wu act as he did when i had just finished telling you how happy i was over his findings  and over the credit he would get .  i was feeling noble over my willingness to share credit  over the ethics of scientific research that gives to each his fair due  and then he puts his private pride ahead of the project .     we re all human  tessa .     i know .  and seeing that the man s interior has its ethical dark spots doesn t alter the fact that he has a scientific mind that is fearfully sharp .     i m afraid i d have to admit that my own arguments were based on private desires rather than the public good  so to speak .  i want to go to the neighbor star for reasons that have nothing to do with the project .     i understand that .  i am still grateful .   it embarrassed fisher that there were tears in her eyes and that she had to blink them away .   he kissed her .        .     it was just a star  too faint yet to stand out in any way .  in fact  crile fisher would have lost it were it not for the fact that he had punched in the network that zeroed in on it in concentric circles and radii .    it looks disappointingly like a star  doesn t it .   said fisher  his face taking on the moroseness it seemed to have when he let it fall into its natural lines .   merry blankowitz  who was the only one with him at the observation panel  said   that s all it is  crile .  a star .     i mean it looks like a faint star  and we re so close .     close in a manner of speaking .  we re still a tenth of a light year away  which is not really close .  it s just that the captain s cautious .  i d have dragged the superluminal in a lot closer .  i wish we were a lot closer right now .  i can hardly wait .     before this last transition  you were set to go home  merry .     not really .  they just talked me into it .  once you made your little speech  i felt like a complete jackass .  i took it for granted that if we returned  we d all go back a second time  but  of course  you really clarified the situation .  oh  but i want to use the nd so badly .    fisher knew what the nd was .  it was the neuronic detector .  he felt the stirring himself .  to detect intelligence would be to know they had come upon something that was infinitely more important than all metals  rocks  ices  and vapors they could otherwise discover .   he said hesitantly   can you tell at this distance .    she shook her head .   no .  we d have to be a lot closer .  and we can t just coast in from this distance .  it would take us about a year .  once the captain is satisfied with what we can find out about the neighbor star from here  we ll make another transition .  what i expect is that in two days at the most  we ll be within a couple of astronomic units of the neighbor star  and then i can start making observations and be useful .  it s a drag feeling like a deadweight .     yes   said fisher dryly   i know .    a look of concern crossed blankowitz s face .   i m sorry  crile .  i wasn t referring to you .     you might as well have been .  i might not be of any use no matter how close we come to the neighbor star .     you will be useful if we detect intelligence .  you ll be able to talk to them .  you re a rotorian  and we ll need that .    fisher smiled grimly .   a rotorian for just a few years .     that s enough isn t it .     we ll see .   he changed the subject deliberately .   are you sure the neuronic detector will work .     absolutely sure .  we could follow any settlement in orbit just by its radiation of plexons .     what are plexons  merry .     just a name i made up  for the photon complex characteristic of mammalian brains .  we could detect horses  you know  if we re not too far away  but we can detect human brains in masses at astronomic distances .     why plexons .     from  complexity .   someday  you ll see  someday they re going to be working on plexons not just to detect life but to study the intimate functioning of the brain .  i ve made up a name for that  too   plexophysiology .   or maybe  plexoneuronics .      fisher said   do you consider names important .     yes  indeed .  it gives you a way of speaking concisely .  you don t have to say   that field of science that involves the relationship of this and that .   you just say  plexoneuronics   yes  that sounds better .  it s a shortcut .  it saves your thinking time for more important subjects .  besides    she hesitated .    besides .  yes .   the words came in a rush .   if i make up a name and it sticks  that alone would get me a footnote in the history of science .  you know   the word  plexon  was first introduced by merrilee augina blankowitz in      on the occasion of the pioneer faster than light flight of the superluminal .    i m not likely to be mentioned anywhere else  or for any other reason  and i ll settle for that .    fisher said   what if you detect your plexons  merry  and there are no human beings present .     you mean alien life .  that would be even more exciting than detecting people .  but there s not much chance  really .  we ve been disappointed over and over again .  we thought there might be at least primitive forms of life on the moon  on mars  on callisto  on titan .  it never came to anything .  people have speculated on all kinds of weird life living galaxies  living dust clouds  life on the surface of a neutron star  all sorts of things .  there s no evidence for any of it .  no  if i detect anything  it will be human life .  i m convinced of that .     wouldn t you be detecting the plexons emitted by the five people on the ship .  wouldn t we drown out anything we can spot at millions of kilometers of distance .     that is a complication  crile .  we have to balance the nd so that we five are canceled out and it has to be delicately done .  even a little leakage would wipe out anything we could detect elsewhere .  someday  crile  automated nds will be sent through hyperspace to all sorts of places to detect plexons .  there ll be no human beings in their vicinity and that alone would make them at least a couple of orders of magnitude more sensitive than anything we can do now  with ourselves hanging around and having to be allowed for .  we ll find out where intelligence exists long before we approach anyplace ourselves .    chao li wu made his appearance .  he looked at fisher with a touch of distaste and said indifferently   how s the neighbor star .    blankowitz said   nothing much at this distance .     well  we ll probably be making another transition tomorrow or the next day  and then we ll see .    blankowitz said   it will be exciting  won t it .    wu said   it will be  if we find the rotorians .   he glanced at fisher .   but will we .    if that were a question directed to fisher  he did not respond to it .  he merely stared at wu expressionlessly .   will we .  fisher thought .   the long wait would be over soon .       thirty five converging       .     as noted before  janus pitt did not often allow himself the luxury of self pity .  in anyone else  he would consider such a thing a despicable sign of weakness and self indulgence .  there were  however  times when he sadly rebelled at the fact that the people of rotor were only too willing to leave all of the unpleasant decisions to him .   there was a council  yes  duly elected  and meticulously involved in passing laws and in making decisions  all but the important ones  the ones that dealt with the future of rotor .   that was left to him .  it was not even consciously left to him .  the matters of importance were simply ignored  simply rendered nonexistent by mutual unspoken agreement .   here they were in an empty system  leisurely building new settlements  absently convinced that time stretched infinitely before them .  everywhere was the calm assumption that once they had filled this new asteroid belt  generations from now  and a matter of no immediate concern to anyone presently alive  the hyper assistance technique would have improved to the point where it would be comparatively easy to seek out and occupy new planets .   time existed in plenty .  time blended into eternity .   only to pitt himself was it left to consider the fact that time was short  that at any given moment  without warning  time might come to an end .   when would nemesis be discovered back in the solar system .  when would some settlement decide to follow rotor s lead .   it had to come someday .  with nemesis inexorably moving in the direction of the sun  it would eventually reach that point  still far distant  of course  but close enough  at which the people of the solar system would have to be blind not to see it .   pitt s computer  with the aid of a programmer who was convinced he was working out a problem of academic interest only  had estimated that by the end of a thousand years  the discovery of nemesis would be inevitable  and that the settlements would begin to disperse .   pitt had then put the question  would the settlements come to nemesis .   the answer was no .  by that time  hyper assistance would be far more efficient  far cheaper .  the settlements would know more about the nearer stars  which of them had planets  and what kind .  they would not bother with a red dwarf star  but would head out for the sun like stars .   and that would leave earth itself  which would be desperate .  afraid of space  clearly degenerate already  and sinking farther into slime and misery as a thousand years passed and the doom of nemesis became apparent  what would they do .  they could not undertake long trips .  they were earthpeople .  surfacebound .  they would have to wait for nemesis to get reasonably close .  they could not hope to go anywhere else .   pitt had the vision of a ramshackle world trying to find security in the more tightly held system of nemesis  trying to find refuge in a star with a system built tightly enough together to hold in place while it was destroying that of the sun it passed .   it was a terrible scenario  and yet inevitable .   why could not nemesis have been receding from the sun .  how everything would be changed .  the discovery of nemesis would have become somewhat less likely with time and  if the discovery came to pass  nemesis would become ever less desirable  and less possible  as a place of refuge .  if it were receding  earth would not even need a refuge .   but that was not the way it was .  the earthmen would come  ragtag degenerating earthmen of every variety of makeshift and abnormal culture  flooding in .  what could the rotorians do but destroy them while they were still in space .  but would they have a janus pitt to show them that there was no choice but that .  would they have janus pitts  between now and then  to make sure that rotor had the weapons and the resolution to prepare for this and to do it when the time came .   but the computer s analysis was  after all  a deceitfully optimistic one .  the discovery of n emesis by the solar system must come about within a thousand years  said the computer .  but how much within .  what if the discovery came tomorrow .  what if it had come three years ago .  might some settlement  groping for the nearest star  knowing nothing useful about farther ones  be following in rotor s trail now .   each day  pitt woke up wondering  is this the day .  why was this misery reserved for him .  why did everyone else sleep quietly in the lap of eternity  while only he himself was left to deal each day with the possibility of a kind of doom .   he had done something about it  of course .  he had set up a scanning service throughout the asteroid belt  a body whose function it was to supervise the automated receptors that constantly swept the sky  and to detect at as great a distance as possible the copious wasteenergy disposal of an approaching settlement .   it had taken some time to set it all up properly  but for a dozen years now  every scrap of dubious information had been followed up  and  every once in a while  something seemed sufficiently questionable to be referred to pitt .  and every time it happened  it set off the clanging of an alarm bell in pitt s head .   it turned out always to be nothing  so far  and the initial relief was always followed by a kind of rage against the scanners .  if anything was uncertain  they washed their hands of it  let it go  turned it over to pitt .  let him deal with it  let him suffer  let him make the hard decisions .   it was at this point that pitt s self pity became lachrymose  and he would begin to stir uneasily at the possibility that he might be showing weakness .   there was this one  for instance .  pitt fingered the report that his computer had uncoded  and that had inspired this mental self pitying survey of his own continuous  unbearable  and under appreciated service to the rotorian people .   this was the first report that had been referred to him in four months  and it seemed to him that it was of minimal importance .  a suspicious energy source was approaching  but allowing for its probable distance  it was an unusually small source  a smaller source by some four orders of magnitude than one would expect of a settlement .  it was a source so small that it was all but inseparable from noise .   they might have spared him this .  the report that it was of a peculiar wavelength pattern that seemed to make it of human origin was ridiculous .  how could they tell anything about a source so weak  except that it was not a settlement  and therefore could not be of human origin  whatever the wavelength pattern .   those idiot scanners must not annoy me in this fashion  thought pitt .   he tossed the report aside petulantly  and picked up the latest report from ranay d  aubisson .  that girl marlene did not have the plague  even yet .  she madly persisted in putting herself in danger in more and more elaborate ways  and yet remained unharmed .   pitt sighed .  perhaps it didn t matter .  the girl seemed to want to remain on erythro  and if she remained  that might be as good as having her come down with the plague .  in fact  it would force eugenia insigna to stay on erythro  too  and he would be rid of both of them .  to be sure  he would feel safer if d  aubisson  rather than genarr  were in charge of the dome and could oversee both mother and daughter .  that would have to be arranged in the near future in some way that would not make genarr a martyr .   would it be safe to make him commissioner of new rotor .  that would certainly rate as a promotion and he would be unlikely to refuse the position  especially since  in theory  it would place him on an even rank with pitt himself .  or would that give genarr a bit too much of the reality of power in addition to the appearance .  was there an alternative .   he would have to think of it .   ridiculous .  how much easier it would all have been if that girl marlene had only done something as simple as getting the plague .   in a spasm of irritation at marlene s refusal to do so  he picked up the report on the energy source again .   look at that .  a little puff of energy and they bothered him with it .  he wasn t going to stand for it .  he punched a memo into the computer for instant transmission .  he was not to be bothered by minutiae .  keep an eye out for a settlement .        .     onboard the superluminal  the discoveries came like a series of hammer blows  one after the other .   they were still at a great distance from the neighbor star when it became apparent that it possessed a planet .    a planet .   said crile fisher with tense triumph .   i knew    no   said tessa wendel hastily   it s not what you think .  get it through your head  crile  that there are planets and planets .  virtually every star has some sort of planetary system or other .  after all  more than half the stars in the galaxy are multiple star systems  and planets are just stars that are too small to be stars  you see .  this planet we see isn t habitable .  if it were habitable  we wouldn t see it at this distance  especially in the dim light of the neighbor star .     you mean  it s a gas giant .     of course it is .  i would have been more surprised if there hadn t been one than at finding out that one exists .     but if there s a large planet  there may be small planets  too .     maybe   conceded wendel   but scarcely habitable ones .  they ll either be too cold for life  or their rotation will be locked and they ll be showing only one side to the star  which would make it too warm on one side and too cold on the other .  all that rotor could do  if it were here  would be to place itself in orbit around the star  or possibly around the gas giant .     that might be exactly what they ve done .     for all these years .   wendel shrugged .   it s conceivable  i suppose  but you can t count on it  crile .         .     the next blows were more startling ones .    a satellite .   said tessa wendel .   well  why not .  jupiter has four sizable ones .  why should it be surprising that this gas giant has one .     it s not a satellite like any that exists in the solar system  captain   said henry jarlow .   it s roughly the size of earth  from the measurements i ve been able to make .     well   said wendel  maintaining her indifference   what follows from that .     nothing  necessarily   said jarlow   but the satellite shows peculiar characteristics .  i wish i were an astronomer .     at the moment   said wendel   i wish someone on the ship was  but please go on .  you re not completely ignorant of astronomy .     the point is that since it revolves around the gas giant  it shows one face only to the gas giant  which means that all sides of it face the neighbor star in the course of its revolution around the gas giant .  and the nature of the orbit is such that  as near as i can tell  the temperature of the world is in the liquid water stage .  and it has an atmosphere .  now i don t have all the subtleties at my fingertips .  as i said  i m not an astronomer .  still  it seems to me that there s a good chance that the satellite is a habitable world .    crile fisher received the news with a wide smile .  he said   i m not surprised .  igor koropatsky predicted the existence of a habitable planet .  he did it without any data on the subject .  it was just a matter of deduction .     did koropatsky do that .  and when did he talk to you  i wonder .     sometime before we left .  he reasoned that nothing was likely to have happened to rotor on the way to the neighbor star and  since they didn t return  that they must have found a planet to colonize .  and there it is .     and just why did he tell you this  crile .    crile paused and considered  then said   he was interested in making certain that the planet would be explored for possible future use by earth  when the time came for our old planet to be evacuated .     and why do you suppose he didn t tell me this .  do you have any idea .    i suppose  tessa   said crile carefully   that he thought i would be the more impressionable of the two of us  more eager to urge that the planet be explored      because of your daughter .     he knew of the situation  tessa .     and why didn t you tell me this .     i wasn t sure there was anything to tell .  i felt that i might as well wait and see if koropatsky was right .  since he was  i am now telling you .  the planet must be habitable by his reasoning .     it s a satellite   said wendel  obviously in a temper .    a distinction without a difference .    wendel said   look  crile .  no one seems to be considering my position in all this .  koropatsky fills you full of nonsense in order to have us explore this system and then  presumably  return to earth with the news .  wu was anxious to have us return with news even before we reached this system .  you are anxious for a reunion with your family  regardless of any wider considerations .  in all this  there seems to be very little thought given to the fact that i m the captain and that i will make the decisions .    fisher s voice grew cajoling .   be reasonable  tessa .  what decisions are there to make .  what are your choices .  you say koropatsky filled me with nonsense  but he didn t .  there s the planet .  or the satellite  if you prefer .  it must be explored .  its existence may mean life for earth .  this may be humanity s future home .  in fact  some of humanity may be there already .     you be reasonable  crile .  a world can be the right size and temperature and still be uninhabitable for any of a variety of reasons .  after all  suppose it has a poisonous atmosphere  or is incredibly volcanic  or has a high level of radioactivity .  it has only a red dwarf star to light and warm it  and it is in the immediate neighborhood of a large gas giant .  that is not a normal environment for an earth type world  and how will such an abnormal environment affect it .     it must still be explored  even if only to find out  certainly  that it is uninhabitable .     for that it may not be necessary to land   said wendel grimly .   we ll get closer and judge better .  try  crile  please try not to outrun the data .  i couldn t bear your disappointment .    fisher nodded .   i ll try  yet koropatsky deduced a habitable planet when everyone else told me it was totally impossible .  you did  too  tessa .  over and over .  but there it is and it may be habitable .  so let me hope while i can .  perhaps the people of rotor are now on that world  and perhaps my daughter is  too .         .     chao li wu said rather indifferently   the captain is really furious .  the last thing she wanted was to find a planet here  a world  i mean  since she won t allow us to call it a planet  that may be habitable .  it means it will have to be explored and we ll just have to go back and report .  you know that s not what she wants .  this is her one and only chance to be out in deep space .  once this is over  she s through for life .  others will work on superluminal techniques  others will explore space .  she ll be retired to an advisory position only .  she ll hate it .     how about you  chao li .  would you go out in space again  given a chance .   blankowitz asked .   wu didn t hesitate .   i m not sure that i want to go wandering around in space .  i don t have the exploring bug .  but you know  last night  i got the queer notion i might just like to settle down here  if it s habitable .  how about you .     settle down here .  of course not .  i don t say i d like to be earthbound forever  but i d like to be back there for a while  anyway  before striking out again .     i ve been thinking about it .  this satellite is one in  what .  ten thousand .  who would figure on a habitable world in a red dwarf system .  it should be explored .  i m even willing to spend time on it and have someone else go back to earth and take care of my priority on the gravitational effect .  you d protect my interests  wouldn t you  merry .     of course i would  chao li .  and so would captain wendel .  she has all the data  signed and witnessed .     so there you are .  and i think the captain is wrong to want to explore the galaxy .  she could visit a hundred stars and not see one world as unusual as this one .  why bother with quantity when you ve got quality right in hand .     personally    said blankowitz .   i think that what bothers her is fisher s kid .  what if he finds her .     so what .  he can take her back to earth with him .  what would that be to the captain .     there s a wife involved  too  you know .     do you ever hear him mention her .     that wouldn t mean he     her mouth closed suddenly at the sound outside  and crile fisher walked in and nodded at the two .   blankowitz said quickly  as though to wipe out the previous conversation   has henry finished with the spectroscopy .    fisher shook his head .   i can t tell .  the poor fellow is nervous .  he s afraid of misinterpreting the thing  i suppose .    wu said   come on .  it s the computer that does the interpretation .  he can hide behind that .     no  he can t .   said blankowitz with fervor .   i like that .  you theoreticians think that all we observers do is just tend a computer  give it a stroke or two  and say   nice doggie   then read off the results .  it s not so .  what the computer says depends on what you put into it  and i never heard a theoretician face an observation he didn t like without blaming the observer .  never once did i hear him say   there must be something wrong with the compu        hold on   said wu .   let s not flood this place with recrimination .  have you ever heard me blaming observers .     if you didn t like henry s observations      i d take them anyway .  i don t have any theories about this world .     and that s why you d take whatever he gives you .    at this point henry jarlow walked in with tessa wendel close behind .  he looked like a cloud making up its mind to rain .   wendel said   very well  jarlow  we re all here .  now  tell us .  what does it look like .     the trouble is   said jarlow   there isn t enough ultraviolet in the light of this weakling star to raise a sunburn on an albino .  i have to work with micro waves and that tells me  at once  that there s water vapor in the world s atmosphere .    wendel shrugged it off with an impatient lift of her shoulders .   we don t need you to tell us that .  a world the size of earth in a liquid water range of temperature would surely have water and  therefore  water vapor .  that moves it one more notch toward habitability  but only one more thoroughly expected notch .     oh no   said jarlow uneasily .   it s habitable .  no question .     because of the water vapor .     no .  i have something better than that .     what .    jarlow looked around him at the other four rather grimly  and said   would you say a world was habitable if  in actual fact  it was inhabited .     yes  i think i could bring myself to say that   said wu calmly .    are you telling me that you can see that it s inhabited at this distance .   asked wendel sharply .    yes  that s exactly what i m saying  captain .  there s free oxygen in the atmosphere  and in quantity .  can you tell me how that can be without photosynthesis .  and can you tell me how you can have photosynthesis without the presence of life .  and can you tell me how a planet can be uninhabitable if it has oxygen producing life on it .    there was dead silence for a moment  then wendel said   that is so unlikely  jarlow .  are you sure you didn t mess up the programming .    and blankowitz quietly raised her eyebrows at wu in an unspoken   see e e e e .    jarlow said stiffly   i have never messed up  as you call it  a programming in my life  but  of course  i m willing to stand corrected if anyone here feels he is more knowledgeable about atmospheric infrared analysis than i am .  it s not my field of expertise  but i did make careful use of blanc and nkrumah on the subject .    crile fisher  who had gained considerable self confidence since the incident involving wu s bid to return home  did not hesitate to insert his views .    look   he said   this will either be confirmed or denied as we get closer  but why don t we assume that dr .  jarlow s analysis is correct and see where that takes us .  if there is oxygen in the atmosphere of this world  might we not assume that it s been terraformed .    all eyes turned to look at him .    terraformed .   said jarlow blankly .    yes  terraformed .  why not .  you have this world that is suitable for life  except that it has the carbon dioxide and nitrogen atmosphere that worlds without life have  like mars and venus  and you dump algae into the ocean and pretty soon it s  good bye  carbon dioxide   and  hello  oxygen .   or maybe you do something else .  i m no expert .    they were still looking at him .   fisher went on .   the reason i m suggesting this is that i remember there was talk about terraforming on the farms on rotor .  i worked there .  there were even some seminars on terraforming that i attended because i felt it might have something to do with the hyper assistance program .  it didn t  but at least i heard about terraforming .    finally jarlow said   in all you heard about terraforming  fisher  do you by any chance recall anyone saying how long it would take .    fisher spread his arms .   you tell me  dr .  jarlow .  it will save time  i m sure .     all right .  it took rotor two years to get here  if it got here .  that means it s been here thirteen years .  if all of rotor were solid algae and it was all dumped into the ocean and lived and grew and produced oxygen  then to get to the present level  where i estimate the oxygen content is    percent and carbon dioxide is present only in traces  i would imagine it would take some thousands of years .  perhaps hundreds of years  if conditions were enormously favorable .  it certainly would take more than thirteen years .  and  frankly  earth algae are adapted to earth conditions quite precisely .  on another world  the algae might not grow  or might do so very slowly  till it adapted itself .  thirteen years wouldn t change a thing .    fisher seemed unperturbed .    ah  but there is lots of oxygen there and no carbon dioxide  so if it s not the result of rotorian action  what is it the result of .  doesn t it strike you that we must assume there s non earthly life on this world .     it s what i did assume   said jarlow .  wendel said   it s what we have to assume immediately .  native vegetation is photosynthesizing .  it doesn t mean  for one moment  that rotorians are on the world  or that they ever even reached this system .    fisher looked annoyed .   well  captain   he said with pointed formality   i have to say that neither does it mean that rotorians aren t on the world  or that they haven t reach the system .  if the planet has vegetation of its own  it just means that no terra forming was required and the rotorians could move right in .     i don t know   said blankowitz .   i should think there would be no reasonable chance at all that vegetation evolving on a strange planet would be nourishing to human beings .  i doubt that human beings could digest it  or that they could assimilate even if they could digest it .  i would certainly offer high odds that it would be poisonous .  and if there s plant life  there s bound to be animal life  and we don t know what that would entail .         even in that case   said fisher   it s still possible that the rotorians would fence off a tract of land  kill the native life within it  and seed plants of their own .  i imagine this alien planting  if you want to call it that  would expand with the years .     supposition on supposition   muttered wendel .    in any case   said fisher   it s completely useless to sit here and make up scenarios  when the logical thing is to explore the world as best we can  and from as close a view as possible .  even from its surface  if that seems feasible .    and wu said with surprising force   i completely agree .   blankowitz said   i m a biophysicist  and if there s life on the planet  then whatever else it may have or may not have  we must explore it .    wendel looked from one to the other and  reddening slightly  said   i suppose we must .         .      the closer we get   said tessa wendel   and the more information we gather  the more confusing it all is .  is there any question that this is apparently a dead world .  there is no illumination on the night hemisphere  there are no signs of vegetation or of any form of life .     no gross signs   said wu coolly   but something must be happening to keep oxygen in the air .  not being a chemist  i can t think of any chemical process that would do the trick .  can anyone .    he scarcely waited for an answer .   in fact   he went on   i seriously question whether a chemist could come up with a chemical explanation .  if the oxygen is there  it must be a biological process that produces it .  we just don t know of anything else .    wendel said   if we say that  then we re judging from our experience with exactly one oxygen containing atmosphere  earth s .  someday we may be laughed at .  it may turn out that the galaxy is littered with oxygen atmospheres that have no connection with life  and we ll be on record as having been stymied entirely because of our experience with the one planet that is a freak and has a biological source of the oxygen .     no   said jarlow angrily .   you can t get out of it that way  captain .  you can picture all sorts of scenarios  but you can t expect the laws of nature to change for your convenience .  if you want to have a nonbiological source of an oxygen containing atmosphere  you have to suggest a mechanism .     but   said wendel   there s no sign of chlorophyll in the light reflected from the world .     why should there be .   said jarlow .   the chances are that a somewhat different molecule has been evolved under the selective pressure of light from a red dwarf star .  may i make a suggestion .     please do   said wendel bitterly .   it seems to me you do nothing else .     very well .  all we can actually tell is that the land areas of the world seem to be completely denuded of life .  that means nothing .  until four hundred million years ago  earth s land areas were similarly sterile  but the planet had an oxygen atmosphere and abundant life .     sea life .     yes  captain .  there s nothing wrong with sea life .  and that would include algae or the equivalent  microscopic plants that would do perfectly well as oxygen factories .  the algae in earth s seas produce    percent of the oxygen that pours into the atmosphere each year .  doesn t this explain everything .  it explains the oxygen atmosphere and it also explains the apparent lack of land life .  it also means we can safely explore the planet by landing on the sterile land surface of the world and studying the sea with what instruments we have  leaving it for a later expedition  suitably equipped  to do the detailed work .     yes  but human beings are land animals .  if rotor had reached this system  they would surely have attempted to colonize the land areas and of such colonization there is no hint .  is it really necessary to investigate the world further .   the captain asked .    oh yes   said wu quickly .   we can t go back with deductions only .  we need some facts .  there may be surprises .     do you expect any .   asked wendel with a touch of anger .    it doesn t matter whether i do or not .  can we go back to earth and tell them that  without looking  we were sure there would be no surprises .  that would not be very sensible .     it seems to me   said wendel   that you ve changed your mind rather drastically .  you were ready to return without even approaching the neighbor star .     as i recall   said wu   i had my mind changed for me .  in any case  under the circumstances  we must explore .  i know  captain  that there is a certain temptation to seize the opportunity to visit a few other star systems  but now that there is an apparently habitable world in view  we must come back to earth with maximum information on something that may be far more important to our planet in a very practical sense than any amount of catalogue type information concerning the nearer stars .  besides   and he pointed at the viewport with what was almost surprise on his face    i want to take a closer look at that world .  i have this feeling it will be completely safe .     this feeling .   said wendel sardonically .   i m allowed my intuitions  captain .    merry blankowitz said in a rather husky voice   i have my intuitions  too  captain  and i m worried .    wendel looked at the young woman with sudden surprise .  she said   are you weeping  blankowitz .     no  not really  captain .  i m just very upset .     why .     i ve been using the no .     the neuronic detector .  on that empty world .  why .    blankowitz said   because i came here to use it .  because that s my function .     and the results are negative   said wendel .   i m sorry  blankowitz  but if we visit other star systems  you ll have other chances .     but that just it  captain .  the results are not negative .  i detect intelligence on the world and that s why i m upset .  it s a ridiculous result  and i don t know what s wrong .    jarlow said   perhaps the device isn t working .  it s so new that it wouldn t be surprising if it weren t reliable .     but why isn t it working .  is the neuronic detector detecting us here on the ship .  or is it simply giving a false positive .  i ve checked it .  the shielding is in perfect order  and if i had a false positive  i ought to have it elsewhere .  there are no signs of any positive responses from the gas giant  for instance  or from the neighbor star  or from random points in space  but every time i allow it to sweep the satellite  i get a response .     you mean   said wendel   that on this world  where we can detect no life  you detect intelligence .     it s a very minimal response .  i can just barely pick it up .    crile fisher said    actually  captain  what about jarlow s point .  if there s life in the world s ocean and we don t detect it because the water s opaque  there might still be intelligent life  and perhaps or .  blankowitz detects that .     wu said   fisher has a good point .  after all  life in the sea  however intelligent  is not likely to have a technology .  you can t have fire in the sea .  non technological life does not make itself very evident  but it may still be intelligent .  and a species  however intelligent  is not to be feared without technology  especially if it can t leave the sea  and if we remain on land .  it just makes things more interesting and makes it more necessary for us to investigate .    blankowitz said in annoyance   you all talk so quickly and so endlessly that i don t get a chance to say anything .  you re all wrong .  if it were intelligent sea life  i would get a positive response only from the oceans .  i get it everywhere  just about evenly .  land as well as sea .  i don t understand it at all .     on land as well .   said wendel  clearly incredulous .   then there must be something wrong .     but i can t find anything wrong   said blankowitz .   that s what s so upsetting .  i just don t understand this .   then  as though in extenuation  she added   it s very feeble  of course  but it s there .    fisher said   i think i can explain it .   all eyes turned to him  and he grew immediately defensive .   maybe i m not a scientist   he said   but that doesn t mean i can t see something that s pretty plain .  there s intelligence in the sea  but we can t see it because the water hides it .  all right  that makes sense .  but there s intelligence on land  too .  well  that s hidden also .  it s underground .     underground .   said jarlow explosively .   why should it be underground .  there s nothing wrong with the air or with the temperature or with anything we can detect .  what s here to hide from .     from the light  for one thing   said fisher forcefully .   i m talking about the rotorians .  suppose they did colonize the planet .  why would they want to remain under the red light of the neighbor star  light in which their rotorian plant life would not flourish  and under which they themselves would grow despondent .  underground  they could have artificial lighting and both they and their plants would be better off .  besides     he paused and wendel said   go on .  what else .     well  you have to understand the rotorians .  they live on the inside of a world .  it s what they re used to and what they consider normal .  they wouldn t find it comfortable to cling to the outside skin of a world .  they would dig underneath  as a matter of course .    wendel said   then you re suggesting that blankowitz s neuronic detector is detecting the presence of human beings under the surface of the planet .     yes .  why not .  it s the thickness of the soil between their caverns and the surface that weakens the response the neuronic detector is measuring .    wendel said   but blankowitz gets more or less the same response over both land and sea .     over the entire planet .  it s very even   said blankowitz .    all right   said fisher .   native intelligence in the sea  rotorians underground on land .  why not .     wait   said jarlow .   you get a response everywhere  blankowitz .  right .     everywhere .  i ve detected some slight ups and downs  but the response is so shallow i can t really be sure .  certainly  there seems to be some intelligence everywhere on the planet .    jarlow said   i suppose that s possible in the sea  but how is it possible on land .  do you suppose that rotorians  in thirteen years  in thirteen years  have dug a network of tunnels under all the land surface of this world .  if you got one area of response  or even two  small ones  taking up a tiny fraction of the world s surface  i d consider the possibility of rotorian burrowing .  but the entire surface .  please .  tell that to my aunt tillie .    wu said   am i to take it  henry  that you are suggesting that there is an alien intelligence underground everywhere on the land surface .    jarlow said   i don t see what other conclusion we can come to unless we want to conclude that blankowitz s device is completely meaningless .     in that case   said wendel   i wonder if it s safe to go down and investigate .  an alien intelligence is not necessarily a friendly intelligence  and the superluminal is not equipped to make war .    wu said   i don t think we can give up .  we must find out what kind of intelligent life is present  and how it might interfere  if at all  with any plans we may make to evacuate earth and come here .    blankowitz said   there is one place where the response is a tiny bit more intense than it is anywhere else .  not much .  shall i try to find it again .    wendel said   go ahead .  try .  we can examine the surroundings there carefully and then decide whether to descend or not .    wu smiled blandly .   i m sure it will be entirely safe to do so .   wendel merely scowled unhappily .        .     the peculiar thing about saltade leverett  in the opinion of janus pitt  was that he liked it out in the asteroid belt .  apparently  there were some people who truly enjoyed emptiness  who loved inanimacy .    i don t dislike people   leverett would explain .   i can get all i want of them on holovision  talk to them  listen to them  laugh with them .  i can do everything but feel them and smell them  and who wants to do that .  besides we re building five settlements in the asteroid belt and i can visit anyone of them and get my fill of people and smell them  too  for what good that does me .    and then  when he did come to rotor  the  metropolis   as he insisted on calling it  he would keep looking from one side to the other as though he expected people to crowd in on him .   he even looked at chairs suspiciously  and sat down on them with a sidewise slide as though hoping to wipe off the aura that the previous backside had left upon it .   janus pitt had always thought he was the ideal acting commissioner for the asteroid project .  that position had  in effect  given him a free hand in everything that had to do with the outer rim of the nemesian system .  that included not only the settlements in progress  but with the scanning service itself .   they had finished their lunch in the privacy of pitt s quarters  for saltade would sooner go hungry than eat in a dining room to which the general public  meaning even a third person who was unknown to him  would be admitted .  pitt  in fact  felt a certain surprise that leverett had agreed to eat with him .   pitt studied him casually .  leverett was so lean and leathery  and gave such an appearance of whipcord and gristle that he didn t look as if he had ever been young or would ever be old .  his eyes were faded blue  his hair faded yellow .   pitt said   when was the last time you were on rotor  saltade .     nearly two years ago  and i take it unkindly of you to put me through this  janus .     why  what have i done .  i certainly haven t summoned you here  though since you are here  old friend  you re welcome .     you might as well have summoned me .  what s this message you sent out to the effect that you were not to be bothered with little things .  are you getting to the point where you re so big you want only big things .    pitt s smile grew a trifle strained .   i don t know what you re talking about  saltade .     they had a report for you .  they detected a small bit of radiation coming in from outside .  they sent it to you and you sent back one of your special memos about how you couldn t be bothered .     oh  that .    pitt remembered .  it had been that moment of self pity and irritation .  surely he was allowed to be irritated at times .    well  your people are watching for settlements .  they shouldn t bother me with minor matters .     if that s your attitude  fine .  but it so happens they ve found something that s not a settlement and they don t want to report it to you .  they ve reported it to me  and they ve requested me to pass it on to you despite your order that you are not to be bothered with minutiae .  they figure it s my job to handle you  but i d rather not  janus .  are you becoming a cantankerous fellow in your powerful old age .     don t rattle on  saltade .  what is it they ve reported .   said pitt  with more than a touch of cantankerousness about him .    they spotted a vessel .     what do you mean  a vessel .  not a settlement .    leverett held up a gnarled paw .   not a settlement .  i said a vessel .     i don t understand .     what s to understand .  do you need a computer .  if so  yours is right there .  a vessel is a ship making its way through space  with a crew on board .      how large .     it could carry half a dozen people  i suppose .     then it must be one of ours .      it isn t .  everyone of ours is accounted for .  this one is simply not of rotorian manufacture .  the scanning service may have been reluctant to talk to you about it  but they did some work on their own .  no computer anywhere in the system has been involved with the construction of any ship like that vessel  and no one could have built a vessel like that without computer involvement at some stage .     then you conclude .     that it s not a rotorian vessel .  it comes from elsewhere .  as long as there was the slightest chance that it might have been produced by us  my boys kept quiet and didn t disturb you  per your instructions .  when it appeared  definitely  not to be one of our own  they passed it on to me and said you should be told  but that they wouldn t do it .  you know  janus  past a certain point  trampling on people is counterproductive .     shut up   said pitt peevishly .   how could it be non rotorian .  where would it come from .     i suppose it had to come from the solar system .     impossible .  a vessel of the size you describe  with half a dozen people onboard couldn t possibly have made the trip from the solar system .  even if they discovered hyper assistance  and it is certainly conceivable they did  a half dozen people at close quarters for over two years could not complete the trip alive .  maybe there are some exemplary crews  well trained and unusually suited to the task  who could make the trip and end up at least partly sane  but nobody in the solar system would risk it .  nothing less than a complete settlement  a self contained world occupied by people accustomed to it from birth  could possibly make an interstellar trip and do well .     nevertheless   said leverett   we have here a small vessel of non rotorian manufacture .  that s a fact  and you have no choice but to accept that  i promise you .  where do you say it came from .  the nearest star is the sun  that s a fact  too .  if it didn t come from the solar system  then it came from some other star system and the journey was a good deal longer than two years and a bit .  if two years and a bit is impossible  everything else is certainly impossible .    pitt said   suppose it s not human at all .  suppose these are other forms of life  with other psychologies  that can endure long trips at close quarters .     or suppose they are people this big   and leverett held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch apart   and that the vessel is a settlement for them .  well  it s not so .  they re not aliens .  they re not teeny weenies .  that vessel isn t rotorian  but it is human .  we d expect aliens to look completely different from human beings  and they ought to build ships completely different from those of human beings .  that vessel is a human vessel right down to the serial code along its side  which is in the terrestrial alphabet .     you didn t say that .     i didn t think it needed saying .   pitt said   it could be a human ship  but it could be automated .  it could have robots onboard .     it could   said leverett .   in that case  should we blow it out of the sky .  if there are no human beings onboard  there are no ethical problems involved .  you destroy property but  after all  they re trespassing .    pitt said   i m considering it .    leverett smiled broadly .   don t .  that vessel has not spent more than two years traveling through space .     what do you mean .     have you forgotten the condition rotor was in when we arrived here .  we did spend over two years in passage  and half of that time we were in normal space going at just under the speed of light .  at that speed  the surface was abraded by collision with atoms  molecules  and dust particles .  it took polishing and repairs  as i recall .  don t you remember .     and this ship .   said pitt  without bothering to say whether he remembered .    as shiny as though it had traveled no more than a few million kilometers at ordinary speeds .     that s impossible .  don t bother me with these games .     it s not impossible .  a few million kilometers at ordinary speeds is all they passed through .  the rest of the way  hyperspace .     what are you talking about .   pitt s patience was wearing thin .   superluminal flight .  they ve got it .     that s theoretically impossible .     is it .  well  if you can think of any other way of explaining all this  go to it .    pitt stared at him  open mouthed .   but      i know .  the physicists say it s impossible  but they have it  anyway .  now let me tell you this .  if they have superluminal flight  they must have superluminal communication .  then the solar system knows they re here and it knows what s happening .  if we blow the ship out of the sky  the solar system will know that  too  and  after a while  a fleet of such vessels will come out of space  and they ll come shooting at us .     what would you do  then .   pitt found himself temporarily unable to think .    what else is there to do but to greet them in friendly fashion  find out what they are  who they are  what they re doing  and what they want .  now it s my idea that they plan to land on erythro .  we ll have to land there  too  and talk to them .     on erythro .     if they re on erythro  janus  where do you want us to be .  we ve got to confront them there .  we ve got to take that chance .    pitt felt his mind beginning to tick over again .  he said   since this seems to you to be necessary  would you be willing to do it .  with a ship and a crew  of course .     you mean you won t .     as commissioner .  i can t come down to greet some unknown ship .     beneath the official dignity .  i see .  so i m to face the aliens  or the teeny weenies  or the robots  or whatever  without you .     i ll be in constant contact  of course  saltade .  voice and image .     at a distance .     yes  but a successful mission on your part would be suitably rewarded  after all .     is that so .  in that case    leverett looked at pitt  speculatively .  pitt waited  then said    are you going to name a price .     i am going to suggest a price .  if you want me to meet this vessel on erythro  then i want erythro .     what do you mean .     i want erythro as my home .  i m tired of the asteroids .  i m tired of scanning .  i m tired of people .  i ve had enough .  i want a whole empty world .  i want to build nice living quarters  get food and necessaries from the dome  have my own farm and my own animals if i can coax them to do well .     how long have you wanted this .     i don t know .  it s been growing on me .  and since i came here and have gotten a good look at rotor with its crowds and noise  erythro looks better than ever to me .    pitt frowned .   that makes two of you .  you re just like that mad girl .     what mad girl .     eugenia insigna s daughter .  you know insigna  i suppose .     the astronomer .  of course .  i haven t met her daughter .     completely mad .  she wants to stay on erythro .     i don t consider that mad .  i consider that very sensible .  in fact  if she wants to say on erythro  i could endure a woman     pitt held up a finger .   i said  girl .       how old is she .     fifteen .     oh .  well  she ll get older .  unfortunately  so will i .     she s not one of your raving beauties .     if you ll take a good look  janus   said leverett   neither am i .  you have my terms .     you want it officially recorded in the computer .     just as a formality  eh  janus .    pitt did not smile .   very well .  we ll try to watch where that vessel lands  and we ll make you ready for erythro .        thirty six  meeting       .     eugenia insigna said in a tone that seemed to place her halfway between puzzlement and discontent   marlene was singing this morning .  some song about   home  home in the stars  where the worlds are all swinging and free .       i know the song   said siever genarr  nodding .   i d sing it for you  but i can t carry a tune .    they had just finished lunch .  they had lunch together every day now  something genarr looked forward to with quiet satisfaction  even though the subject of conversation was invariably marlene and although genarr felt that insigna might be turning to him only out of desperation  since to whom else could she talk freely on the subject .   he didn t care .  whatever the excuse   i never heard her sing before   said insigna .   i always thought she couldn t .  actually  she has a pleasant contralto .     it must be a sign that she s happy now  or excited  or contented  or something good  eugenia .  my own feeling is that she s found her place in the universe  found her unique reason for living .  it s not given to all of us to find that .  most of us  eugenia  drag onward  searching for life s personal meaning  not finding it  and ending with anything from roaring desperation to quiet resignation .  i m the quietly resigned type myself .    insigna managed to smile .   i suspect you don t think that of me .     you re not roaringly desperate  eugenia  but you do tend to continue to fight lost battles .   her eyes dropped .   do you mean crile .   genarr said   if you think i do  then i do .  but actually  i was thinking of marlene .  she s been out a dozen times .  she loves it .  it makes her happy  and yet you sit here fighting off terror .  what is it  eugenia  that bothers you about it .    insigna ruminated  pushing her fork around on her plate .  then she said   it s the sense of loss .  the unfairness of it .  crile made a choice and i lost him .  marlene has made a choice and i m losing her  if not to the plague  then to erythro .     i know .   he reached for her hand  and she placed it  rather absently  in his .   she said   marlene is more and more eager to be out there in that absolute wilderness and less and less interested in being with us .  eventually  she will find a way of living out there and return at lengthening intervals  then be gone .     you re probably right  but all of life is a symphony of successive losses .  you lose your youth  your parents  your loves  your friends  your comforts  your health  and finally your life .  to deny loss is to lose it all anyway and to lose  in addition  your self possession and your peace of mind .     she was never a happy child  siever .     do you blame yourself for that .     i might have been more understanding .     it s never too late to start .  marlene wanted a whole world and she has it .  she wanted to convert what has always been a burdensome ability of hers into a method for communicating directly with another mind  and she has it .  would you force her to give that up .  would you avoid your own loss of her more or less continuous presence by inflicting on her a greater loss than you or i can conceive  the true use of her unusual brain .    insigna actually laughed a little  though her eyes were swimming with tears .   you could talk a rabbit out of its hole  siever .     could i .  my speech was never as effective as crile s silences .   insigna said   there were other influences .   she frowned .   it doesn t matter .  you re here now  siever  and you re a great comfort to me .    genarr said ruefully   it s the surest sign that i have reached my present age  that i am actually comforted at being a comfort to you .  the fires burn low when we ask not for this or that  but for comfort .     there s nothing wrong with that  surely .     nothing wrong in the world .  i suspect there are many couples who have gone through the wilds of passion and the rites of ecstasy without ever finding comfort in each other and  in the end  they might have been willing to exchange it all for comfort .  i don t know .  the quiet victories are so quiet .  essential  but overlooked .     like you  my poor siever .     now  eugenia  i ve spent all my life trying to avoid the trap of self pity and you mustn t tempt me into it just to watch me writhe .     oh  siever  i don t want to watch you writhe .     there  i just wanted to hear you say that .  see how clever i am .  but  you know  if you want a substitute for marlene s presence  i am willing to hang around when you need comfort .  even a whole world to myself wouldn t tempt me from your side  if you didn t want me to go .    she squeezed his hand .   i don t deserve you  siever .     don t use that as an excuse not to have me  eugenia .  i m willing to waste myself on you  and you shouldn t stop me from making a supreme sacrifice .     have you found no one worthier .     i haven t looked .  nor have i sensed among the women of rotor any great demand for me .  besides  what would i do with a worthier object .  how dull it would be to offer myself as a duly deserved gift .  how much more romantic to be an undeserved gift  to be bounty from the skies .     to be godlike in your condescension to the unworthy .   genarr nodded vigorously .   i like that .  yes .  yes .  that s exactly the picture that appeals to me .    insigna laughed again  and more freely .   you re crazy  too .  you know  i never noticed that somehow .     i have hidden depths .  as you get to know me still better  taking your time  of course     he was interrupted by the sharp buzz of the message receiver .   he frowned .   there you are  eugenia .  i get you to the point  i don t even remember how i did it  where you are ready to melt into my arms  and we re interrupted .  uh oh .   his voice suddenly changed completely .   it s from saltade leverett .     who s he .     you don t know him .  hardly anyone does .  he s the nearest thing to a hermit i ve ever met .  he works in the asteroid belt because he likes it there .  i haven t seen the old bum in years .  i don t know why i say  old   though  because he s my age .   it s sealed  too .  sealed to my thumbprints  i see .  that makes it secret enough for me to ask you to leave before i open it .    insigna rose at once  but genarr motioned her down .   don t be silly  eugenia .  secrecy is just the disease of officialdom .  i pay no attention to it .    he pressed his thumb down on the sheet  then the other thumb in its appropriate place  and letters began to appear .  genarr said   i often thought that if a person lacked thumbs    and then he fell silent .   still silent  he passed her the message .   am i allowed to read this .    genarr shook his head   of course not  but who cares .  read it .   she did so  almost at a glance  then looked up .   an alien ship .   about to land here .    genarr nodded .    at least that s what it says .    insigna said wildly   but what about marlene .  she s out there .     erythro will protect her .     how do you know .  this may be a ship of aliens .  real aliens .  nonhumans .  the thing on erythro may have no power over them .     we re aliens to erythro  yet it can easily control us .     i must go out there .     what good      i must be with her .  come with me .  help me .  we ll bring her back into the dome .     if these are all powerful and malevolent invaders  we won t be safe inside      oh  siever  is this a time for logic .  please .  i must be with my daughter .         .     they had taken photographs and now they were studying them .  tessa wendel shook her head .   unbelievable .  the whole world is absolutely desolate .  except this .     intelligence everywhere   said merry blankowitz  her brow furrowed .   no question about it now when we ve been so close .  desolate or not  intelligence is there .     but most intensely at that dome .  right .     most intensely  captain .  most easily noticeable .  and most familiar .  outside the dome  there are slight differences  and i m not sure what it signifies .    wu said   we ve never tested any high intelligence other than human  so  of course     wendel turned to him .   is it your opinion the intelligence outside the dome isn t human .     since we agree that human beings couldn t have burrowed everywhere underground in thirteen years  what other conclusion is it possible to come to .     and the dome .  is that human .    wu said   that s a different thing entirely  and doesn t depend on blankowitz s plexons .  there are astronomical instruments to be seen .  the dome  or part of it  is an astronomical observatory .     couldn t alien intelligences be astronomers as well .   asked jarlow  a bit sardonically .    of course   said wu   but with instruments of their own .  when i see what looks to me like an infrared computerized scanner of exactly the type i would see on earth  well  let s put it this way .  forget the nature of the intelligence .  i see instruments that were either manufactured in the solar system  or built from designs prepared in the solar system .  there is no question about that .  i cannot conceive that alien intelligences  without contact with human beings  could have built such instruments .     very well   said wendel .   i agree with you  wu .  whatever there is on this world  there are  or were  human beings under that dome .    crile fisher said sharply   don t just say  human beings   captain .  there are rotorians .  there can be no other human beings on this world  excluding ourselves .    wu said    and that s unanswerable  too .    blankowitz said   it s such a small dome .  rotor must have had tens of thousands of people on it .     sixty thousand   murmured fisher .   they can t all fit into that dome .     for one thing   said fisher   there may be other domes .  we could sweep around the world a thousand times and yet miss objects of all sorts .     there s only this one place where there seemed to be a change in the plexon type .  if there were other domes like that  i would have spotted a few more of them  i m sure   blankowitz said .    or   said fisher   another possibility is that what we see is a tiny bit of an entire structure which  for all we know  may spread out for miles below the surface .    wu said   the rotorians came in a settlement .  the settlement may still exist .  there may be many .  this dome may be a mere outpost .     we haven t seen a settlement   said jarlow .    we haven t looked   said wu .   we ve concentrated entirely on this world .     i haven t spotted intelligence anywhere but on this world   said blankowitz .    you haven t looked  either   said wu .   we d really have to scan the heavens to spot a settlement or two  but once you detected plexons from this world  you looked nowhere else .     i will if you think it s necessary .    wendel held up her hand .   if there are settlements  why haven t they spotted us .  we ve made no attempt to shield our energy emissions .  after all  we were pretty confident that this star system was empty .    wu said   they may have had the same overconfidence  captain .  they haven t been looking for us  either  and so we ve slipped past them .  of  if they have detected us  they may be uncertain as to who  or what  we are  and they re hesitating as to what action to take  just as we are .  what i say  though  is that we do know one spot on the surface of this large satellite where there must be human beings  and i think we must go down and make contact with them .     do you think it would be safe to do so .   asked blankowitz .    my guess   said wu firmly   is that it would be .  they can t shoot us out of hand .  after all  they d want to know more about us before they do so .  besides  if all we dare do is stay here in uncertainty  then we will accomplish absolutely nothing and we ought to go back home and tell them what we have discovered .  earth will send out a whole fleet of superluminal vessels  but they won t be thankful to us if we come back with only minimal information .  we ll go down in history as the expedition that flinched .   he smiled blandly .   you see  captain  i ve learned a few lessons from fisher .    wendel said   then you think we should now go down and make contact .     absolutely   said wu .    and you  blankowitz .     i m curious .  not about the dome  but about the possible alien life .  i d want to find out about them  too .     jarlow .     i wish we had adequate weapons  or hypercommunication .  if we re wiped out  earth will have found out nothing  absolutely nothing  as the result of our trip .  then it might be that someone else will come here as unprepared as we and just as unsure .  still  if we survive the contact  we ll be going back with important knowledge .  i suppose we should chance it .    fisher said quietly   are you going to ask me for my opinion  captain .     i assume that you wish to land to see the rotorians .     exactly  so may i suggest  let s land as quietly as we can  and as unobtrusively  and i ll leave the ship to reconnoiter .  if anything goes wrong  then take off and return to earth  leaving me behind .  i am dispensable  but the ship must return .    wendel said at once  her face seeming to tighten   why you .   fisher said   because i know the rotorians  at least  and because i wish to go .       i  too   said wu .   i must be with you .     why risk two .   asked fisher .    because two are safer than one .  because  in case of trouble  one might escape while the other holds off the threat .  and most of all  because  as you say  you know the rotorians .  your judgment may be warped .    wendell said   we will land  then .  fisher and wu will leave the ship .  if  at any time  fisher and wu disagree on procedure  wu will be the decision maker .     why .   demanded fisher indignantly .    wu has said you know the rotorians and your decisions may be warped   said wendel  looking at fisher firmly   and i agree with him .         .     marlene was happy .  she felt as if she were wrapped in gentle arms  protected  shielded .  she could see the reddish light of nemesis and feel the wind against her cheeks .  she could watch the clouds obscure part or all of nemesis  large globe  now and then  so that the light would dim and turn grayish .   but she could see as easily in the gray as in the red  and she could see in shades and tints that made fascinating patterns .  and though the wind grew cooler when nemesis  light was hidden  it never chilled her .  it was as though erythro were somehow enhancing her sight  somehow warming the air around her body when necessary  somehow caring for her in every way .   and she could talk to erythro .  she had made up her mind to think of the cells that made up the life on erythro as erythro .  as the planet .  why not .  what else .  individually  the cells were only cells  as primitive  much more primitive  in fact  than the individual cells of her own body .  it was only all of the prokaryote cells together that made up an organism that encircled the planet in a billion trillion tiny interconnected pieces  that so filled and permeated and grasped the planet  that it might as well be thought of as the planet .   how odd  thought marlene .  this giant life form must never  before the coming of rotor  have known that anything live existed other than itself .   her questions and sensations did not have to exist entirely in her mind .  erythro would rise before her sometimes  like thin gray smoke  consolidating into a wraithlike human figure wavering at the edges .  there was always  about it  a flowing feeling .  she could not actually see that  but she sensed  beyond doubt  that millions of invisible cells were leaving each second and immediately being replaced by others .  no one prokaryote cell could exist for long out of its water film  so that each was only evanescently part of the figure  but the figure itself was as permanent as it wished to be  and never lost its identity .   erythro did not take aurinel s form again .  it had gathered  without being told  that that was disturbing .  its appearance was neutral now  changing slightly with the vagaries of marlene s own thought .  erythro could follow the delicate changes of her mind pattern far better  she decided  than she herself could  and the figure adjusted to that  looking more like some figure in her mind s eye at one moment  and then as she tried to focus on it and identify it  it would shift gently into something else .  occasionally  she could catch glimpses  the curve of her mother s cheek  uncle siever s strong nose  bits of the girls and boys she had met at school .   it was an interactive symphony .  it was not so much a conversation between them as a mental ballet she could not describe  something that was infinitely soothing  infinite in variety  partly changing appearance  partly changing voice  partly changing thought .   it was a conversation in so many dimensions that the possibility of going back to communication that consisted only of speech left her feeling flat  lifeless .  her gift of sensing by body language flowered into something she had never imagined earlier .  thoughts could be exchanged far more swiftly  and deeply  than by the coarse crudeness of speech .   erythro explained  filled her  rather  with the shock of encountering other minds .  minds .  plural .  one more might have been grasped easily .  another world .  another mind .  but to encounter many minds  crowding on each other  each different  overlapping in small space .  unthinkable .   the thoughts that permeated marlene s mind as erythro expressed itself could be expressed only distantly and unsatisfactorily in words .  behind those words  overflowing and drowning them  were the emotions  the feelings  the neuronic vibrations that shattered erythro into a rearrangement of concepts .   it had experimented with the minds  felt them .  not felt as human beings would mean  felt   but something else entirely that could be approached very distantly by that human word and concept .  and some of the minds crumpled  decayed  became unpleasant .  erythro ceased to feel minds at random  but sought out minds that would withstand the contact .    and you found me .   said marlene .   i found you .     but why .  why did you look for me .   she asked eagerly .  the figure wavered and turned smokier .   just to find you .   it was no answer .   why do you want me to be with you .   the figure started to fade and the thought was a fugitive one .   just to be with me .    and it was gone .   only its image was gone .  marlene felt its protection still  its warm enclosure .  but why had it disappeared .  had she displeased it with her questions .   she heard a sound .  on an empty world it is possible to catalogue the sounds briefly  for there aren t many .  there is the noise of flowing water  and the more delicate moan of blowing air .  there are the predictable noises you make yourself  whether the falling of a footstep  the rustle of clothing  or the whistle of breath .   marlene heard something that was none of these  and turned in the direction of it .  over the rocky outcropping on her left  there appeared the head of a man .   her first thought  of course  was that it was someone from the dome who had come to get her  and she felt a surge of anger .  why would they still be searching for her .  she would refuse to wear a wave emitter from now on  and they would then have no way of locating her except by blind search .   but she did not recognize the face and surely she had met everyone in the dome by now .  she might not know the individual names or anything about them  but she would know  when she saw anyone from the dome  that she had seen that face before .   she had not seen this new face anywhere in the dome .  those eyes were staring at her .  the mouth was a little open  as if the person were panting .  and then whoever it was was topping the rise and running to her .   she faced him .  the protection she felt around her was strong .  she was not afraid .   he stopped ten feet away  staring  leaning forward as though he had reached a barrier he could not penetrate  one that deprived him of the ability to advance farther .   finally  he said in a strangled voice   roseanne .         .     marlene stared at him  observing carefully .  his micro movements  were eager and radiated a sense of ownership  possession  closeness  .  .  .   mine  mine  mine .   she took a step backward .  how was that possible .  why should he    a dim memory of a holoimage she had once seen when she was a little girl  and finally  she could deny it no more .  however impossible it sounded  however unimaginable  she huddled within the protective blanket and said   father .    he rushed at her as though he wanted to seize her in his arms and she stepped away again .  he paused  swaying  then put one hand to his forehead as though fighting dizziness .   he said   marlene .  i meant to say marlene .    he pronounced it incorrectly  marlene noticed .  two syllables .  but that was right for him .  how would he know .   a second man came up and stood next to him .  he had straight black hair  a wide face  narrow eyes  a sallow complexion .  marlene had never seen a man who quite looked like him .  she gaped a little and had to make an effort to close her mouth .   the second man said to the first in a soft incredulous voice .   is this your daughter  fisher .    marlene s eyes widened .  fisher .  it was her father .   her father didn t look at the other man .  only at her .   yes .    the other said  even more softly   first deal of the cards  fisher .  you come here and the first person you meet is your daughter .    fisher seemed to make an effort to turn his eyes from his daughter  but he failed .   i think that s it  wu .  marlene  your last name is fisher  isn t it .  your mother is eugenia insigna .  am i right .  my name is crile fisher and i m your father .    he held out his arms to her .   marlene was well aware that the look of yearning on her father s face was completely real  but she stepped back yet again and said coldly   how is it you re here .     i came from earth to find you .  to find you .  after all these years .     why did you want to find me .  you left me when i was a baby .     i had to then  but it was always with the intention of coming back for you .    and another voice  harsh  steely  broke in  and said   so you came back for marlene .  for nothing else .    eugenia insigna was standing there  face pale  lips almost colorless  hands trembling .  behind her was siever genarr  looking astonished  but remaining in the background .  neither one was wearing protective clothing .   insigna said  voice hurried  semi  hysterical   i thought there would be people from some settlement  people from the solar system .  i thought there might be some alien life form .  i went through every possibility i could think of  and in all the thoughts that crowded in on me after i was told a strange ship was landing  i never once thought it might be crile fisher coming back .  and for marlene .     i came with others on an important mission .  this is chao li wu  a shipmate .  and  and      and we meet .  did it ever occur to you that you might encounter me .  or were your thoughts entirely on marlene .  what was your important mission .  to find marlene .     no .  that was not the mission .  just my desire .     and i .    fisher s eyes fell .   i came for marlene .     you came for her .  to take her away .     i thought    began fisher  and his words stuck .   wu watched him wonderingly .  genarr frowned in thoughtful anger .   insigna whirled toward her daughter .   marlene  would you go anywhere with this man .     i m not going anywhere with anyone  mother   said marlene quietly .   insigna said   there s your answer  crile .  you can t leave me with my child of a year  and come back fifteen years later with a  by the way  i ll take her over now .   and not a thought of me .  she s your daughter biologically  but nothing more .  she s mine by the right of fifteen years of loving and caring .    marlene said   there is no point in quarreling over me  mother .   chao li wu stepped forward .   pardon me .  i have been introduced  but no one has been introduced to me .  you are  madam .     eugenia insigna fisher   she pointed at fisher .   his wife  once .      and this is your daughter  madam .     yes .  this is marlene fisher .    wu bowed slightly .   and this other gentleman .    genarr said   i m siever genarr  commander of the dome that you see behind me on the horizon .     ah good .  commander  i would like to speak to you .  i regret that there seems to be a family argument here  but it has nothing to do with our mission .     and just what is your mission .   growled another new voice .  coming toward them was a white haired figure  his mouth turned down  with something that looked very much like a weapon in his hand .    hello  siever   he said as he passed genarr .   genarr looked startled .   saltade .  why are you here .     i am representing commissioner janus pitt of rotor .  i repeat my question to you  sir .  what is your mission .  and what is your name .     my name  at least   said wu   is easily given .  it is dr .  chao li wu .  and you  sir .     saltade leverett .     greetings .  we come in peace   said wu  eyeing the weapon .    i hope so   said leverett grimly .   i have six ships with me and they ve got your ship in their sights .     indeed .   said wu .   this small dome .  with a fleet .     this small dome is only a tiny outpost   said leverett .   i have the fleet .  do not count on a bluff .     i will take your word for it   said wu .   but our one small ship comes from earth .  it got here because it has the capacity for superluminal flight .  do you know what i mean .  faster than light travel .     i know what you mean .    genarr said suddenly   is dr .  wu telling the truth  marlene .     yes  he is  uncle siever   said marlene .   interesting   murmured genarr .   wu said calmly   i am delighted to have my word confirmed by this young lady .  am i to suppose she is rotor s expert on superluminal flight .     you need not suppose anything   said leverett impatiently .   why are you here .  you have not been invited .     no  we haven t .  we didn t know that anyone was here to object to us .  but i urge you not to give in  unnecessarily  to any bad temper .  at any false move from you  our ship will just disappear into hyperspace .    marlene said quickly   he s not certain about that .    wu frowned .   i m certain enough .  and even if you manage to destroy the ship  our home base on earth knows where we are and is getting constant reports .  if anything happens to us  the next expedition will be one of fifty superluminal battle cruisers .  don t risk it  sir .    marlene said   that is not so .    genarr said   what is not so  marlene .     when he said that the home base on earth knows where he is  that was not so  and he knew that was not so .    genarr said   that s good enough for me .  saltade  these people do not have hyper communication .    wu s expression did not change .   are you relying on the speculation of a teenage girl .     it s not speculation .  it s a certainty .  saltade  i ll explain later .  take my word for it .    marlene said suddenly   ask my father .  he ll tell you .   she didn t quite understand how her father would know about her gift  she had surely not had it  or at least had not displayed it  when she was one year old  but his understanding was clear .  it shouted itself at her  for all that others could not see it .   fisher said   it s no use  wu .  marlene can see right through us .   for the first time  wu s coolness seemed to desert him .  he frowned   and said tartly   how would you know anything at all about this girl  even if she s your daughter .  you haven t seen her since she was an infant .     i had a younger sister once   said fisher in a low voice .   genarr said with sudden enlightenment   it runs in the family  then .  interesting .  well  dr .  wu  you see we have a tool here that allows no bluffing .  let us  then  be open with each other .  why have you come to this world .     to save the solar system .  ask the young lady  since she is your absolute authority  if i am telling the truth this time .    marlene said   of course you re telling the truth  dr .  wu .  we know about the danger .  my mother discovered it .    wu said    and we discovered it  too  little lady  without any help from your mother .    saltade leverett looked from one to another and said   may i ask what you re all talking about .    genarr said   believe me  saltade  janus pitt knows all about it .  i m sorry he hasn t told you  but if you get in touch with him now  he will .  tell him we are dealing with people who know how to travel faster than light and that we might be able to make a deal .         .     the four of them sat in siever genarr s private quarters in the dome  and genarr tried to keep his sense of history from overwhelming him .  this was the first example in human history of an interstellar negotiation .  if each of the four were famous for nothing else  their names would ring down the corridors of galactic history for this alone .   two and two .   there  on the side of the solar system  earth  really  and who would have thought that decadent earth would be representing the solar system  that they should have developed superluminal flight rather than one of the up to date  live wire settlements  were chao li wu and crile fisher .   wu was talkative and insinuating  a mathematician  but one who was clearly possessed of practical acumen .  fisher  on the other hand  and genarr still could not accustom himself to the notion that he was actually seeing him again   sat there quietly  lost in thought and contributing little .   on his own side was saltade leverett  suspicious and uneasy at being in such close contact with three at once  but firm  lacking the wordy flow of wu  yet having no trouble in making himself clear .   as for genarr  he was as quiet as fisher  but he was waiting for them to settle the matter  since he knew something the other three did not .   night had fallen by now  and hours had passed .  first lunch  then dinner had been served .  there had been breaks to snap the tension and during one of them  genarr had gone out to see eugenia insigna and marlene .    it s not going badly   said genarr .   both sides have a great deal to gain .     what about crile .   asked insigna nervously .   has he brought up the matter of marlene .     honestly  eugenia  that is not the subject of discussion and he has not brought her up .  i do think he is very unhappy about it .     he should be   said insigna bitterly .   genarr hesitated .   what do you think  marlene .    marlene looked at him with her dark unfathomable eyes .   i ve gotten beyond that  uncle siever .      a little hard hearted   muttered genarr .   but insigna snapped at him .   why shouldn t she be .  deserted in infancy .     i m not hard hearted   said marlene thoughtfully .   if i can arrange to have his mind eased  i will .  but i don t belong with him  you see .  or with you  either  mother .  i m sorry  but i belong with erythro .  uncle siever  you will tell me what s decided  won t you .     i promised i would .     it s important .     i know .     i should be there to represent erythro .     i imagine that erythro is there  but you will be part of it before it s over .  even if i didn t assure you of that  marlene  which i do  i think that erythro would see to it .    and then he returned to continue the discussion .  chao li wu was leaning back in his seat now  his astute face showing no signs of weariness .    let me summarize   he said .   in the absence of superluminal flight  this neighbor star  i shall call it nemesis  as you do  is the nearest star to the solar system  so that any ship making its way to the stars would be bound to stop here first .  once all humanity has true superluminal flight  however  distance is no longer a factor and human beings will not search out the nearest star  but the most comfortable star .  the search will be on for sun like stars that happen to be circled by at least one earth like planet .  nemesis will be put to one side .    rotor  which has  till now  apparently made a fetish of secrecy  to keep others away and to reserve this stellar system for itself  need do so no more .  not only will this system be unwanted by other settlements  but rotor itself may no longer want it .  it may choose  if it so desires  to search out sun like stars for itself .  there are billions of such stars in the spiral arms of the galaxy .    in order for rotor to have superluminal flight  it might occur to you that you could point a weapon at me and demand all i know .  i am a mathematician  a highly theoretical one  and my information is limited .  even if you were to capture our ship itself  you would learn very little from it .  what you must do is to send a deputation of scientists and engineers to earth  where we could train you adequately .    in return  we ask for this world  which you call erythro .  it is my understanding that you do not occupy it in any way except for the presence of this dome  which is used for astronomical and other kinds of research .  you are living in settlements .    whereas the settlements of the solar system can wander off in search of sun like planets  the people of earth cannot .  there are eight billion of us who must be evacuated in a few thousand years and  as nemesis approaches more and more closely to the solar system  erythro will more and more easily serve as a way station on which to place earthpeople until such time as we can find earth like worlds to transfer them to .    we will return to earth with a rotorian of your choosing as proof that we were really here .  more ships will be built and they will return  you can be sure we will return  for we must have erythro .  we will then take back your scientists  who will learn the technique of superluminal flight  a technique we will also grant to the other settlements .  does all this adequately summarize what we have decided .    leverett said   it s not all quite that easy .  erythro will have to be terraformed if it is to support any sizable number of earthpeople .     yes  i have left out details   said wu .   these will have to be dealt with  too  but not by us .     true  commissioner pitt and the council will have to decide on rotor s behalf .     and the global congress on earth s behalf  but with so much at stake  i don t foresee failure .     there will have to be safeguards .  how far can we trust earth .     about as far as earth can trust rotor  i imagine .  it may take a year to work out safeguards .  or five years .  or ten years .  it will take years  in any case  to build an adequate supply of ships with which to begin  but we have a program that should last several thousand years  one that will end with the necessary abandonment of earth and the beginning of the colonization of the galaxy .     assuming there are no competing intelligences to be taken into account   growled leverett .    an assumption we can make until we are forced to abandon it .  that is for the future .  will you consult your commissioner now .  will you choose your rotorian to accompany us and allow us to leave for earth as soon as possible .    now fisher leaned forward .   may i suggest that my daughter  marlene  be the one     but genarr did not allow the sentence to be completed .   i m sorry  crile .  i ve consulted her .  she will not leave this world .     if her mother goes with her  then      no  crile .  her mother has nothing to do with it .  even if you wanted eugenia back  and eugenia were to decide to go with you  marlene would still remain on erythro .  and if you decided to stay here to be with her  that would do you no good either .  she is lost to you  and to her mother as well .    fisher said angrily   she s only a child .  she can t make these decisions .     unfortunately for you  and for eugenia  and for all of us here  and perhaps for all of humanity  she can make these decisions .  in fact  i have promised that when we are through here  as i think we now are  that we will acquaint her with our decisions .    wu said   surely that is not necessary .    leverett said   come  siever  we don t have to go to a little girl for permission .    genarr said   please listen to me .  it is necessary  and we do have to go to her .  allow me to try an experiment .  i am suggesting that marlene be brought in here so that we can tell her what we have decided .  if one of you thinks that is not desirable  let him leave .  let him stand up and leave .    leverett said   i think you ve taken leave of your senses  siever .  i have no intention of playing games with a teenager .  i m going to speak to pitt .  where do you keep your transmitter .    he stood up and  almost at once  staggered and fell .  wu half rose in alarm   mr .  leverett     leverett rolled over and held up his arm .   help me up  somebody .   genarr helped him to his feet and back into the chair .   what happened .   he asked .    i m not sure   said leverett .   i had this blinding headache for just a moment .     so you were not able to leave the room .   genarr turned to wu .   since you don t think seeing marlene is necessary  would you care to leave the room .    very carefully  eyes fixed on genarr  wu rose slowly from his chair  winced  and sat down again .   he said politely   perhaps we had better see the young woman .   genarr said   we must .  on this world  at least  what that young woman wishes is the law .         .      no .   said marlene so forcibly that it amounted almost to a shriek .   you can t do it .     can t do what .   said leverett  his white eyebrows drawing close to the furrowed line between .    use erythro for a way station  or for anything .    leverett stared at her angrily  and his lips drew back as if to speak  but wu intervened .   why not  young woman .  it is an empty  unused world .     it is not empty .  it is not unused .  uncle siever  tell them .    genarr said   what marlene wants to say is that erythro is occupied by innumerable prokaryote cells capable of photosynthesis .  that is why there is oxygen in erythro s atmosphere .     very well   said wu .   what difference does that make .    genarr cleared his throat .   individually  the cells are as primitive as life can be above the virus level  but  apparently  they cannot be treated individually .  taken all together  they form an organism of enormous complexity .  it is world girdling .     an organism .   wu remained polite .    a single organism  and marlene calls it by the name of the planet  since they are so intimately related .    wu said    are you serious .  how do you know about this organism .     chiefly through marlene .     through the young woman   said wu   who may be  a hysteric .   genarr lifted a finger .   do not say anything seriously against her .   i m not sure that erythro  the organism  has a sense of humor .  we know chiefly through marlene  not entirely .  when saltade leverett stood up to leave  he was knocked down .  when you half rose a while ago  perhaps also to leave  you were clearly uncomfortable .  those are the reactions of erythro .  it protects marlene by acting directly on our minds .  in the early days of our existence on this world  it inadvertently caused a small epidemic of mental disease that we called the erythro plague .  i m afraid that  if it wishes  it can produce irrecoverable mental damage  and  if it wishes  it can kill .  please do not test this .    fisher said   you mean it is not marlene who      no  crile .  marlene has certain abilities  but they don t extend to the point of doing harm .  it is erythro that is dangerous .     how do we stop it from being dangerous .   asked fisher .    by listening politely to marlene  to begin with .  then  too  let me be the one to talk with her .  erythro  at least  knows me .  and believe me when i say that i want to save earth .  i have no desire to bring about the death of billions .    he turned to marlene .   you understand  marlene  don t you  that earth is in danger .  your mother showed you that the close approach of nemesis might destroy earth .     i know that  uncle siever   said marlene in an agonized voice   but erythro belongs to itself .     it might want to share  marlene .  it allows the dome to remain here on the planet .  we don t seem to disturb it .     but there are less than a thousand people in the dome and they stay in the dome .  erythro doesn t mind the dome because that means it can study human minds .     it can study human minds all the more when earthmen come here .     eight billion of them .     no  not all eight billion .  they ll come here to settle down temporarily and then go off somewhere .  at anyone time  there ll only be a fraction of the population here .     it will be millions .  i m sure it will be .  you can t squeeze them all into a dome and supply them with food and water and all they ll need .  you ll have to spread them out on erythro and terraform it .  erythro couldn t survive it .  it would have to protect itself .     are you sure of that .     it would have to .  wouldn t you .     it would mean the death of billions .     i can t help that .   she pressed her lips together  then said   there s a different way .    leverett said gruffly   what s the girl talking about .  what different way .    marlene glanced briefly in leverett s direction  then turned to genarr .   i don t know .  erythro knows .  at least  at least it says that the knowledge is here  but it can t explain .    genarr held up both arms to stop what might have been a flurry of questions .   let me talk .    then he said very quietly   marlene  be calm .  if you re worried about erythro  that is useless .  you know it can protect itself against anything .  tell me what you mean when you say erythro can t explain .    marlene was breathless and gasping .   erythro knows the knowledge is here  but it doesn t have human experience  human science  human ways of thinking .  it doesn t understand .     the knowledge is in the minds present here .     yes  uncle siever .     can t it probe the minds .     it would hurt them .  it can probe my mind without hurting it .     i should hope so   said genarr   but do you have the knowledge .     no  of course not .  but it can use my mind as a probe for the others here .  yours .  my father s .  all .     is that safe .     erythro thinks it is  but  oh  uncle siever  i m afraid .     surely this is madness   whispered wu  and genarr quickly put a finger to his lips .   fisher was on his feet .   marlene  you mustn t     genarr waved him back furiously .   there s nothing you can do  crile .  there are billions of human beings at risk  we keep on saying it over and over again  and the organism must be allowed to do what it can .  marlene .    marlene s eyes had turned upward .  she seemed to be in a trance .   uncle siever   she whispered .   hold me .    half stumbling  half falling  she moved toward genarr  who seized her and held her tightly .   marlene  relax  it will be all right    he sat down carefully in his chair  still holding her rigid body .        .     it was like a silent explosion of light that obliterated the world .  nothing existed beyond itself .   genarr was not even conscious of being genarr .  the self did not exist either .  only a luminous interconnecting fog of great complexity existed  one that was expanding and separating into threads that took on the same great complexity even as they separated .   a whirling and a receding and then an expansion as it approached again .  on and on  hypnotically  like something that had always existed and would always exist  without end .   falling endlessly into an opening that widened as it approached without ever getting wider .  continuing change without alteration .  little puffs unfolding into new complexity .   on and on .  no sound .  no sensation .  not even vision .  a consciousness of something that had the properties of light without being light .  it was the mind becoming aware of itself .   and then  painfully  if there had been such a thing as pain in the universe  and with a sob  if there had been such a thing as a sound in the universe  it began to dim and turn and spin  faster and faster  into a point of light that flashed and was gone .        .     the universe was obtrusive in its existence .   wu stretched and said   did anyone else experience that .   fisher nodded .   leverett said   well  i m a believer .  if it s madness  we re all mad together .    but genarr was still holding marlene  bending over her painfully .  she was breathing raggedly .    marlene .  marlene .    fisher had struggled to his feet .   is she all right .     i can t say   muttered genarr .   she s alive  but that s not enough .    her eyes opened .  she was staring at genarr  her eyes empty  unfocused .    marlene   whispered genarr in despair .    uncle siever   whispered marlene in return .   genarr let himself breathe .  at least she had recognized him .   don t move   he said .   wait till it s over .     it is over .  i m so glad it s over .     but are you all right .    she paused  then said   yes  i feel all right .  erythro says i m all right .    wu said   did you find this hidden knowledge we re supposed to have .     yes  dr .  wu .  i did .   she passed a hand over her damp brow .   it was you  actually  who had it .     i .   said wu vehemently .   what was it .     i don t understand it   said marlene .   you will  maybe  if i describe it .     describe what .     something that s gravity pushing things away instead of pulling them toward .     gravitational repulsion  yes   said wu .   it s part of superluminal flight .   he drew a deep breath and his body straightened .   it s a discovery i made .     well then   said marlene   if you pass close by nemesis in superluminal flight  there s gravitational repulsion .  the faster you move  the more the repulsion .     yes  the ship would be pushed away .     wouldn t nemesis be pushed in the opposite direction .     yes  in inverse ratio of mass  but nemesis  move would be immeasurably small .     but what if it were repeated over and over for hundreds of years .     nemesis  movement would still be very small .     but its path would be slightly changed and over the light years the distance would mount up and nemesis might pass earth just far enough away so that earth would be spared .    wu said   well     leverett said   could something of the sort be worked out .     we could try .  an asteroid  passing by at ordinary speeds  shifting into hyperspace for a trillionth of a second and back at ordinary speed a million miles out .  asteroids in orbit around nemesis always moving into hyperspace on the same side .   for a moment  he was lost in thought .  then  defensively   i would surely have thought of this on my own  given a little time .    genarr said   you may still have the credit .  marlene took it from your mind  after all .    he looked about at the other three and said   well  gentlemen  unless something goes terribly wrong  let s forget about using erythro as a way station  which it wouldn t allow anyway .  we needn t concern ourselves with evacuating earth  if we can learn to make full and proper use of gravitational repulsion .  i think the situation has been much improved because we brought in marlene .     uncle siever   said marlene .   yes  dear .     i m so sleepy .         .     tessa wendel looked at crile fisher gravely .   i keep saying to myself   you re back .   somehow i didn t think you d be back  once it was clear you had found the rotorians .     marlene was the first person  the very first person i found .    he was staring at nothingness  and wendel let him .  he would have to think it through .  they had enough to think about in other directions .   they were taking a rotorian back with them  ranay d aubisson  a neurophysicist .  twenty years before  she had worked in a hospital on earth .  there would be records that would serve to identify her .  and she would be the living proof of what they had done .   wu was a changed person  too .  he was full of plans for making use of gravitational repulsion to nudge the movement of the neighbor star .   he called it nemesis now  but if he could formulate a plan to move it ever so slightly  it might not be earth s nemesis at all .    and wu had grown modest .  he didn t want the credit for the discovery  which to wendel seemed completely unbelievable .  he said the project had been worked out in conference and he would say no more .   what s more  he was definitely planning to return to the nemesian system  and not just to run the project .  he wanted to be there .   if i have to walk   he said .   wendel became aware that fisher was looking at her  frowning slightly .   why didn t you think i d be back  tessa .    she decided to be matter of fact .   your wife is younger than i am  crile  and she would hold on to your daughter .  i was sure of that .  and  desperate as you were to have your daughter  i thought      that i would stay with eugenia because that was the only way .     something like that .    fisher shook his head .   it wouldn t have worked out that way  no matter what .  i thought she was roseanne at first  my sister .  the eyes  mostly  but there was a roseanne look about her in other ways  too .  but she was far more than roseanne .  tessa  she wasn t human  isn t human .  i ll explain later .  i    he shook his head .    never mind  crile   said wendel .   explain whenever you please .     it hasn t been a total loss .  i ve seen her .  she s alive .  she s well .  and in the end  i guess i didn t want more .  somehow  after my  experience  marlene became  just marlene .  for the rest of my life  tessa  you are all i want .     making the best of it  crile .     a very good best it is  tessa .  i ll be formally divorced .  we ll be formally married .  i will leave rotor and nemesis to wu  and you and i can stay on earth  or on any settlement you wish .  we ll each have good pensions  and we can leave the galaxy and its problems to others .  we ve done enough  tessa .  that is  if that s what you wish  too .     i can hardly wait  crile .    an hour later  they were still holding each other .        .     eugenia insigna said   i m so glad i wasn t there .  i keep thinking about it .  poor marlene .  she must have been so afraid .     yes  she was .  but she did it  made it possible to save earth .  even pitt can do nothing about it now .  in a sense  his whole life work has been made useless .  not only is there no purpose to his whole project of secretly building up a new civilization  but he has to help supervise the project for the salvation of the earth .  he has to .  rotor is no longer hidden .  it can be reached at any time  and every bit of humanity  on and off earth  will turn against us if we don t rejoin the human race .  it couldn t have happened without marlene .    insigna wasn t thinking of the greater significances .  she said   but when she was frightened  really frightened  it was to you she turned  not to crile .     yes .     and you held her  not crile .     yes  but eugenia  don t make anything mystical out of it .  she knew me  but she didn t know crile .     you re bound to explain it very sensibly  siever .  that s you .  but i m glad it was you she turned to .  he didn t deserve her .     fair enough .  he didn t deserve her .  but  now  please  eugenia  let go .  crile is leaving .  he ll never be back .  he s seen his daughter .  he s watched her provide a way to save earth .  i don t begrudge him that  and you shouldn t either .  so  if you don t mind  i am changing the subject .  do you know that ranay d  aubisson is leaving with them .     yes .  everyone is talking about it .  i won t miss her somehow .  i never thought she was very sympathetic to marlene .     neither were you at times  eugenia .  it s a great thing for ranay .  once she realized the so called erythro plague was not a useful field of study  her work here was shattered  but on earth  she can introduce modern brain scanning and have a great professional life .     all right .  good for her .     but wu will be back .  very bright man .  it was his brain that yielded the proper finding .  you know  i m sure that when he comes back to work on the repulsion effect  his real desire will be to remain on erythro .  the erythro organism has picked him as it had picked marlene .  and what s funnier still  i think it s picked leverett  as well .     what system do you suppose it uses  siever .     do you mean why does it take wu and not crile .  why does it take leverett and not me .     well  i can see that wu must be a far more brilliant man than crile  but  siever  you are much better than leverett .  not that i would have wanted to lose you .     thank you .  i presume the erythro organism has a criterion of its own .  i even think i have a dim idea of what it might be .     really .     yes .  when my mind was being probed  it meant that through marlene  the erythro organism itself was entering us .  i caught a glimpse of its thoughts  i imagine .  not consciously  of course  but when it was over i seemed to know things i didn t know before .  marlene has the strange talent that makes it possible for her to communicate with the organism and makes it also possible for it to use her brain as a probe for other brains  but i think that s just a practical advantage .  it chose her for something far more unusual .     what would that be .     imagine you re a piece of string  eugenia .  how would you feel if you suddenly and unexpectedly became aware of a piece of lace .  imagine you re a circle .  how would you feel if you came across a patterned sphere .  erythro had knowledge of only one kind of mindits own .  its mind is immensely huge  but so pedestrian .  it is what it is only because it is made up of trillions of trillions of cellular units  all very loosely connected .    then it came across human minds  in which the cellular units were comparatively few  but in which there were incredible numbers of interconnections  incredible complexity .  lace instead of string .  it must have been overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of it .  it must have found marlene s mind to be the most beautiful of all .  that was why it seized upon her .  wouldn t you  if you had a chance to acquire a real rembrandt or a van gogh .  that was why it protected her so avidly .  wouldn t you protect a great work of art .  yet it risked her for the sake of humanity .  it was rough on marlene  but rather noble of the organism .    anyway  that is what i consider the erythro organism to be .  i consider it an art connoisseur  a collector of beautiful minds .    insigna laughed .   by that token  wu and leverett must have very beautiful minds .     they probably do to erythro .  and it will continue collecting when scientists from earth arrive .  you know it will end by collecting a group of human beings different from the common run .  the erythro group .  it may help them find new homes in space and  in the end  perhaps the galaxy will have two kinds of worlds  worlds of earthmen and worlds of more efficient pioneers  the true spacers .  i wonder how that would work out .  surely it would mean the future would lie with them .  i regret that somehow .     don t think of that   said insigna urgently .   let people of the future deal with the future as it comes .  right now  you and i are human beings judging each other by human standards .    genarr smiled joyously  his pleasantly homely face lighting up .   i m glad of that  because i find your mind beautiful  and perhaps you find mine equally beautiful .     oh  siever  i always did .  always .   genarr s smile faded somewhat .   but there are other kinds of beauty  i know .     not for me any longer .  you have all the kinds of beauty .  siever  we lost the morning  you and i .  but there s still the afternoon .     in that case  what more can i possibly want  eugenia .  the morning is well lost  if we can share the afternoon .    their hands touched .       epilogue    again  janus pitt sat there alone  enclosed .   the red dwarf star was no longer an engine of death .  it was just a red dwarf star to be pushed to one side by an ever more arrogant humanity  growing yet further in power .   but nemesis still existed  though it was no longer the star .   for billions of years  life on earth had been isolated  performing its separate experiment  rising and sinking  flourishing and undergoing vast extinctions .  perhaps there were other worlds on which life existed  each one isolated for billions of years .   all experiments  all  or almost all  failures in the long run .  one or perhaps two that were successes and worth all the rest .   but that was only if the universe were large enough to isolate all the experiments .  if rotor  their ark  had been isolated as earth and the solar system had been  it might have been the one to work .   but now he clenched his fists in fury  and desperation .  for he knew that humanity would run from star to star as easily as it had run from continent to continent and before that from region to region .  there would be no isolation  no self contained experiments .  his grand experiment had been discovered  and doomed .   the same anarchy  the same degeneration  the same thoughtless short term thinking  all the same cultural and social disparities would continue to prevail  galaxy wide .   what would there be now .  galactic empires .  all the sins and follies graduated from one world to millions .  every woe and every difficulty horribly magnified .   who would be able to make sense out of a galaxy  when no one had ever made sense out of a single world .  who would learn to read the trends and foresee the future in a whole galaxy teeming with humanity .   nemesis had indeed come .       about the author
