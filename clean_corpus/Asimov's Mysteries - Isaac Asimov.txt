asimov s mysteries      book jacket         isaac asimov  mysteries  introduction  there is a tendency for many people who don t know any better to classify science fiction as just one more member of the group of specialized literatures that include mysteries  westerns  adventures  sports stories  love stories  and so on .   this has always seemed odd to those who know science fiction well  for s . f .  is a literary response to scientific change  and that response can run the entire gamut of the human experience .  science fiction  in other words  includes everything .   how does one differentiate between a science fiction story and an adventure story  for instance  when so much s . f .  is so intensely adventurous as to leave the ordinary stories of the type rather pale  .  surely a trip to the moon is first of all an adventure of the most thrilling kind  whatever else it is .   i have seen excellent science fiction stories that fall into unusual classifications and bring great enrichment to what it had touched .  arthur c .  clarke wrote a delightful  western     but it took place under the sea  and it had dolphins in place of cattle .  its name was  home on the range   however  and it fitted .   clifford d .  simak wrote  rule     which is a pure sports story  but one that involved time travel  so that the coach of earth s team could collect all time greats with whom to win the annual game with mars .   in  the lovers   philip jose farmer struck a telling variation on ordinary romance by writing a sober and moving tale of love that crossed the boundary line  not of religion or color  but of species .   oddly enough  it was the mystery form that seemed most difficult to amalgamate with science fiction .  surely this is unexpected .  one would think that science fiction would blend easily with the mystery .  science itself is so nearly a mystery and the research scientist so nearly a sherlock holmes .   and if we want to reverse things  are there not mysteries that make use of the  scientific mind   .  r .  austin freeman s dr .  thorndyke is an example of a well known and successful  fictional  scientist detective .   and yet science fiction writers seemed to be inhibited in the face of the science fiction mystery .   back in the late       this was finally explained to me .  i was told that  by its very nature  science fiction would not play fair with the reader .  in a science fiction story  the detective could say   but as you know  watson  ever since       when all spaniards learned to speak french  spanish has been a dead language .  how came juan lopez  then  to speak those significant words in spanish .   or else  he could have his detective whip out an odd device and say   as you know  watson  my pocket frannistan is perfectly capable of detecting the hidden jewel in a trice .    such arguments did not impress me .  it seemed to me that ordinary mystery writers  non science fiction variety  could be just as unfair to the readers .  they could deliberately hide a necessary clue .  they could introduce an additional character from nowhere .  they could simply forget about something over which they had been making a great deal of fuss  and mention it no more .  they could do anything .  the point was  though  that they didn t do anything .  they stuck to the rule of being fair to the reader .  clues might be obscured  but not omitted .  essential lines of thought might be thrown out casually  but they were thrown out .  the leader was remorselessly misdirected  misled  and mystified  but he was not cheated .   it seemed  then  a matter to be taken obviously for granted that the same would apply to a science fiction mystery .  you don t spring new devices on the reader and solve the mystery with them .  you don t take advantage of future history to introduce ad hoc phenomena .  in fact  you carefully explain all facets of the future background well in advance so the reader may have a decent chance to see the solution .  the fictional detective can make use only of facts known to the reader in the present or of  facts  of the fictional future  which will be carefully explained beforehand .  even some of the real facts of our present ought to be mentioned if they are to be used   just to make sure the reader is aware of the world now about him .   once all this is accepted  not only does it become obvious that the science fiction mystery is a thoroughly acceptable literary form  but it also becomes obvious that it is a lot more fun to write and read  since it often has a background that is fascinating in itself quite apart from the mystery .   but talk is cheap  so i put my typewriter where my mouth was  and in      wrote a science fiction mystery novel called the caves of steel  published        .  it was accepted by the critics as a good science fiction novel and a good mystery and after it appeared i never heard anyone say that science fiction mysteries were impossible to write .  i even wrote a sequel called the naked sun  published        just to show that the first book wasn t an accident .   between and after these novels  moreover  i also wrote several short stories intended to prove that science fiction mysteriescould be written in all lengths .   these shorter science fiction mysteries  including some boarderline cases  are included in this volume in order of publication .  judge for yourself .       the singing bell  louis peyton never discussed publicly the methods by which he had bested the police of earth in a dozen duels of wits and bluff  with the psychoprobe always waiting and always foiled .  he would have been foolish to do so  of course  but in his more complacent moments  he fondled the notion of leaving a testament to be opened only after his death  one in which his unbroken success could clearly be seen to be due to ability and not to luck .   in such a testament he would say   no false pattern can be created to cover a crime without bearing upon it some trace of its creator .  it is better  then  to seek in events some pattern that already exists and then adjust your actions to it .    it was with that principle in mind that peyton planned the murder of albert cornwell .   cornwell  that small time retailer of stolen things  first approached peyton at the latter s usual table for one at grinnell s .  cornwell s blue suit seemed to have a special shine  his lined face a special grin  and his faded mustache a special bristle .    mr .  peyton   he said  greeting his future murderer with no fourth dimensional qualm   it is so nice to see you .  i d almost given up  sir  almost given up .    peyton  who disliked being approached over his newspaper and dessert at grinnell s  said   if you have business with me  cornwell  you know where you can reach me .   peyton was past forty and his hair was past its earlier blackness  but his back was rigid  his bearing youthful  his eyes dark  and his voice could cut the more sharply for long practice .    not for this  mr .  peyton   said cornwell   not for this .  i know of a cache  sir  a cache of  .  .  .  you know  sir .   the forefinger of his right hand moved gently  as though it were a clapper striking invisible substance  and his left hand momentarily cupped his ear .   peyton turned a page of the paper  still somewhat damp from its tele dispenser  folded it flat and said   singing bells  .     oh  hush  mr .  peyton   said cornwell in whispered agony  peyton said .   come with me .    they walked through the park .  it was another peyton axiom that to be reasonably secret there was nothing like a low voiced discussion out of doors .   cornwell whispered   a cache of singing bells  an accumulated cache of singing bells .  unpolished  but such beauties  mr .  peyton .     have you seen them .     no  sir  but i have spoken with one who has .  he had proofs enough to convince me .  there is enough there to enable you and me to retire in affluence .  in absolute affluence  sir .     who was this other man  .    a look of cunning lit cornwell s face like a smoking torch  obscuring more than it showed and lending it a repulsive oiliness .  the man was a lunar grubstaker who had a method for locating the bells in the crater sides .  i don t knowhis method  he never told me that .  but he has gathered dozens  hidden them on the moon  and come to earth to arrange the disposing of them .     he died  i suppose .     yes .  a most shocking accident  mr .  peyton .  a fall from a height .  very sad .  of course  his activities on the moon were quite illegal .  the dominion is very strict about unauthorized bell mining .  so perhaps it was a judgment upon him after all .  .  .  in any case  i have his map .    peyton said  a look of calm indifference on his face   i don t want any of the details of your little transaction .  what i want to know is why you ve come to me .    cornwell said   well  now  there s enough for both of us  mr .  peyton  and we can both do our bit .  for my part  i know where the cache is located and i can get a spaceship .  you  yes .     you can pilot a spaceship  and you have such excellent contacts for disposing of the bells .  it is a very fair division of labor  mr .  peyton .  wouldn t you say so  now .    cornwell considered the pattern of his life   the pattern that already existed   and matters seemed to fit .   he said   we will leave for the moon on august the tenth .    cornwell stopped walking and said   mr .  peyton .  it s only april now .    peyton maintained an even gait and cornwell had to hurry to catch up .   do you hear me  mr .  peyton  .    peyton said   august the tenth .  i will get in touch with you at the proper time  tell you where to bring your ship .  make no attempt to see me personally till then .  good bye  cornwell .    cornwell said   fifty fifty .     quite   said peyton .   good bye .    peyton continued his walk alone and considered the pattern of his life again .  at the age of twenty seven  he had bought a tract of land in the rockies on which some past owner had built a house designed as refuge against the threatened atomic wars of two centuries back  the ones that had never come to pass after all .  the house remained  however  a monument to a frightened drive for self sufficiency .   it was of steel and concrete in as isolated a spot as could well be found on earth  set high above sea level and protected on nearly all sides by mountain peaks that reached higher still .  it had its self contained power unit  its water supply fed by mountain streams  its freezers in which ten sides of beef could hang comfortably  its cellar outfitted like a fortress with an arsenal of weapons designed to stave off hungry  panicked hordes that never came .  it had its air conditioning unit that could scrub and scrub the air until anything but radioactivity  alas for human frailty  could be scrubbed out of it .   in that house of survival  peyton passed the month of august every subsequent year of his perennially bachelor life .  he took out the communicators  the television  the newspaper tele dispenser .  he built a force field fence about his property and left a short distance signal mechanism to the house from the point where the fence crossed the one trail winding through the mountains .   for one month each year  he could be thoroughly alone .  no one saw him  no one could reach him .  in absolute solitude  he could have the only vacation he valued after eleven months of contact with a humanity for which he could feel only a cold contempt .   even the police   and peyton smiled   knew of his rigid regard for august .  he had once jumped bail and risked the psychoprobe rather than forgo his august .   peyton considered another aphorism for possible inclusion in his testament  there is nothing so conducive to an appearance of innocence as the triumphant lack of an alibi .   on july     as on july    of every year  louis peyton took the   .    a . m .  non grav stratojet at new york and arrived in denver at    .    p . m .  there he lunched and took the   .    p . m .  semi grav bus to hump s point  from which sam leibman took him by ancient ground car   full grav .     up the trail to the boundaries of his property .  sam leibman gravely accepted the ten dollar tip that he always received  touched his hat as he had done on july    for fifteen years .   on july     as on july    of every year  louis peyton returned to hump s point in his non grav aeroflitter and placed an order through the hump s point general store for such supplies as he needed for the coming month .  there was nothing unusual about the order .  it was virtually the duplicate of previous such orders .   macintyre  manager of the store  checked gravely over the list  put it through to central warehouse  mountain district  in denver  and the whole of it came pushing over the mass transference beam within the hour .  peyton loaded the supplies onto his aeroflitter with maclntyre s help  left his usual ten dollar tip and returned to his house .   on august    at    .    a . m .   the force field that surrounded his property was set to full power and peyton was isolated .   and now the pattern changed .  deliberately he had left himself eight days .  in that time he slowly and meticulously destroyed just enough of his supplies to account for all of august .  he used the dusting chambers which served the house as a garbage disposal unit .  they were of an advanced model capable of reducing all matter up to and including metals and silicates to an impalpable and undetectable molecular dust .  the excess energy formed in the process was carried away by the mountain stream that ran through his property .  it ran five degrees warmer than normal for a week .   on august   his aeroflitter carried him to a spot in wyoming where albert cornwell and a spaceship waited .   the spaceship  itself  was a weak point  of course  since there were men who had sold it  men who had transported ft and helped prepare it for flight .  all those men  however  led only as far as cornwell  and cornwell  peyton thought    with the trace of a smile on his cold lips   would be a dead end .  a very dead end .   on august    the spaceship  with peyton at the controls and cornwell   and his map   as passenger  left the surface of earth .  its non grav field was excellent .  at full power  the ship s weight was reduced to less than an ounce .  the micro piles fed energy efficiently and noiselessly  and without flame or sound the ship rose through the atmosphere  shrank to a point  and was gone .   it was very unlikely that there would be witnesses to the flight  or that in these weak  piping times of peace there would be a radar watch as in days of yore .  in point of fact  there was none .   two days in space  now two weeks on the moon .  almost instinctively peyton had allowed for those two weeks from the first .  he was under no illusions as to the value of homemade maps by non cartographers .  useful they might be to the designer himself  who had the help of memory .  to a stranger  they could be nothing more than a cryptogram .   cornwell showed peyton the map for the first time only after takeoff .  he smiled obsequiously .   after all  sir  this was my only trump .     have you checked this against the lunar charts  .     i would scarcely know how  mr .  peyton .  i depend upon you .    peyton stared at him coldly as he returned the map .  the one certain thing upon it was tycho crater  the site of the buried luna city .   in one respect  at least  astronomy was on their side .  tycho was on the daylight side of the moon at the moment .  it meant that patrol ships were less likely to be out  they themselves less likely to be observed .   peyton brought the ship down in a riskily quick non grav landing within the safe  cold darkness of the inner shadow of a crater .  the sun was past zenith and the shadow would grow no shorter .   cornwall drew a long face .   dear  dear  mr .  peyton .  we can scarcely go prospecting in the lunar day .    the lunar day doesn t last forever   said peyton shortly .  there are about a hundred hours of sun left .  we can use that time for acclimating ourselves and for working out the map .    the answer came quickly  but it was plural .  peyton studied the lunar charts over and over  taking meticulous measurements  and trying to find the pattern of craters shown on the homemade scrawl that was the key to    what .   finally peyton said .  the crater we want could be any one of three  gc    gc    or mt    .     what do we do  mr .  peyton .   asked cornwell anxiously .    we try them all   said peyton   beginning with the nearest .    the terminator passed and they were in the night shadow .  after that  they spent increasing periods on the lunar surface  getting used to the eternal silence and blackness  the harsh points of the stars and the crack of light that was the earth peeping over the rim of the crater above .  they left hollow  featureless footprints in the dry dust that did not stir or change .  peyton noted them first when they climbed out of the crater into the full light of the gibbous earth .  that was on the eighth day after their arrival on the moon .   the lunar cold put a limit to how long they could remain outside their ship at any one time .  each day  however  they managed for longer .  by the eleventh day after arrival they had eliminated gc   as the container of the singing bells .   by the fifteenth day  peyton s cold spirit had grown warm with desperation .  it would have to be gc   .  mt    was too far away .  they would not have time to reach it and explore it and still allow for a return to earth by august    .   on that same fifteenth day  however  despair was laid to rest forever when they discovered the bells .   they were not beautiful .  they were merely irregular masses of gray rock  as large as a double fist  vacuum filled and feather light in the moon s gravity .  there were two dozen of them and each one  after proper polishing  could be sold for a hundred thousand dollars at least .   carefully  in double handfuls  they carried the bells to the ship  bedded them in excelsior  and returned for more .  three times they made the trip both ways over ground that would have worn them out on earth but which  under the moon s lilliputian gravity  was scarcely a barrier .   cornwell passed the last of the bells up to peyton  who placed them carefully within the outer lock .    keep them clear  mr .  peyton   he said  his radioed voice sounding harshly in the other s ear .   i m coming up .    he crouched for the slow high leap against lunar gravity  looked up  and froze in panic .  his face  clearly visible through the hard carved lusilite of his helmet  froze in a last grimace of terror .   no  mr .  peyton .  don t         peyton s fist tightened on the grip of the blaster he held .  it fired .  there was an unbearable brilliant flash and cornwell was a dead fragment of a man  sprawled amid remnants of a spacesuit and flecked with freezing blood .   peyton paused to stare somberly at the dead man  but only for a second .  then he transferred the last of the bells to their prepared containers  removed his suit  activated first the non grav field  then the micropiles  and  potentially a million or two richer than he had been two weeks earlier  set off on the return trip to earth .   on august    peyton s ship descended silently  stern bottomward  to the spot in wyoming from which it had taken off on august    .  the care with which peyton had chosen the spot was not wasted .  his aeroflitter was still there  drawn within the protection of an enclosing wrinkle of the rocky  tortuous countryside .   he moved the singing bells once again  in their containers  into the deepest recess of the wrinkle  covering them  loosely and sparsely  with earth .  he returned to the ship once more to set the controls and make last adjustments .  he climbed out again and two minutes later the ship s automatics took over .   silently hurrying  the ship bounded upward and up  veering to westward somewhat as the earth rotated beneath it .  peyton watched  shading his narrow eyes  and at the extreme edge of vision there was a tiny gleam of light and a dot of cloud against the blue sky .   peyton s mouth twitched into a smile .  he had judged well .  with the cadmium safety rods bent back into uselessness  the micropiles had plunged past the unit sustaining safety level and the ship had vanished in the heat of the nuclear explosion that had followed .   twenty minutes later  he was back on his property .  he was tired and his muscles ached under earth s gravity .  he slept well .   twelve hours later  in the earliest dawn  the police came .          the man who opened the door placed his crossed hands over his paunch and ducked his smiling head two or three times in greeting .  the man who entered  h .  seton davenport of the terrestrial bureau of investigation  looked about uncomfortably .   the room he had entered was large and in semidarkness except for the brilliant viewing lamp focused over a combination armchair desk .  rows of book films covered the walls .  a suspension of galactic charts occupied one corner of the room and a galactic lens gleamed softly on a stand in another corner .    you are dr .  wendell urth .   asked davenport  in a tone that suggested he found it hard to believe .  davenport was a stocky man with black hair  a thin and prominent nose  and a star shaped scar on one cheek which marked permanently the place where a neuronic whip had once struck him at too close a range .    i am   said dr .  urth in a thin  tenor voice .   and you are inspector davenport .    the inspector presented his credentials and said  the university recommended you to me as an extraterrologist .     so you said when you called me half an hour ago   said urth agreeably .  his features were thick  his nose was a snubby button  and over his somewhat protuberant eyes there were thick glasses .    i shall get to the point .  dr .  urth .  i presume you have visited the moon  .  .  .    dr .  urth  who had brought out a bottle of ruddy liquid and two glasses  just a little the worse for dust  from behind a straggling pile of book films  said with sudden brusqueness   i have never visited the moon  inspector .  i never intend to .  space travel is foolishness .  i don t believe in it .   then  in softer tones   sit down  sir  sit down .  have a drink .    inspector davenport did as he was told and said   but you re an .  .  .     extraterrologist .  yes .  i m interested in other worlds  but it doesn t mean i have to go there .  good lord  i don t have to be a time traveler to qualify as a historian  do i .   he sat down  and a broad smile impressed itself upon his round face once more as he said   now tell me what s on your mind .     i have come   said the inspector  frowning   to consult you in a case of murder .     murder .  what have i to do with murder .    this murder .  dr .  urth  was on the moon .     astonishing .     it s more than astonishing .  it s unprecedented  dr .  urth .  in the fifty years since the lunar dominion has been established  ships have blown up and spacesuits have sprung leaks .  men have boiled to death on sun side  frozen on dark side  and suffocated on both sides .  there have been deaths by falls  which  considering lunar gravity  is quite a trick .  but in all that time  not one man has been killed on the moon as the result of another man s deliberate act of violence   till now .    dr .  urth said   how was it done .     a blaster .  the authorities were on the scene within the hour through a fortunate set of circumstances .  a patrol ship observed a flash of light against the moon s surface .  you know how far a flash can be seen against the night side .  the pilot notified luna city and landed .  in the process of circling back  he swears that he just managed to see by earth light what looked like a ship taking off .  upon landing  he discovered a blasted corpse and footprints .    the flash of light   said dr .  urth   you suppose to be the firing blaster .    that s certain .  the corpse was fresh .  interior portions of the body had not yet frozen .  the footprints belonged to two people .  careful measurements showed that the depressions fell into two groups of somewhat different diameters  indicating differently sized spaceboots .  in the main  they led to craters gc   and gc    a pair of            am acquainted with the official code for naming lunar craters   said dr .  urth pleasantly .    umm .  in any case  gc   contained footprints that led to a rift in the crater wall  within which scraps of hardened pumice were found .  x ray diffraction patterns showed          singing bells   put in the extraterrologist in great excitement .   don t tell me this murder of yours involves singing  bells .     what if it does  .   demanded davenport blankly .    i have one .  a university expedition uncovered it and presented it to me in return for      come  inspector  i must show it to you .    dr .  urth jumped up and pattered across the room  beckoning the other to follow as he did .  davenport  annoyed  followed .   they entered a second room  larger than the first  dimmer  considerably more cluttered .  davenport stared with astonishment at the heterogeneous mass of material that was jumbled together in no pretense at order .   he made out a small lump of  blue glaze  from mars  the sort of thing some romantics considered to be an artifact of long extinct martians  a small meteorite  a model of an early spaceship  a sealed bottle of nothing scrawlingly labeled  venusian atmosphere .    dr .  urth said happily   i ve made a museum of my whole house .  it s one of the advantages of being a bachelor .  of course  i haven t quite got things organized .  someday  when i have a spare week or so  .  .  .    for a moment he looked about  puzzled  then  remembering  he pushed aside a chart showing the evolutionary scheme of development of the marine invertebrates that were the highest life forms on barnard s planet and said   here it is .  it s flawed  i m afraid .    the bell hung suspended from a slender wire  soldered delicately onto it .  that it was flawed was obvious .  it had a constriction line running halfway about it that made it seem like two small globes  firmly but imperfectly squashed together .  despite that  it had been lovingly polished to a dull luster  softly gray  velvety smooth  and faintly pock marked in a way that laboratories  in their futile efforts to prepare synthetic bells  had found impossible to duplicate .   dr .  urth said   i experimented a good deal before i found a decent stroker .  a flawed bell is temperamental .  but bone works .  i have one here    and he held up something that looked like a short thick spoon made of a gray white substance    which i had made out of the femur of an ox .  listen .    with surprising delicacy  his pudgy fingers maneuvered the bell  feeling for one best spot .  he adjusted it  steadying it daintily .  then  letting the bell swing free  he brought down the thick end of the bone spoon and stroked the bell softly .   it was as though a million harps had sounded a mile away .  it swelled and faded and returned .  it came from no particular direction .  it sounded inside the head  incredibly sweet and pathetic and tremulous all at once .   it died away lingeringly and both men were silent for a full minute .   dr .  urth said   not bad  eh .   and with a flick of his hand set the bell to swinging on its wire .   davenport stirred restlessly .   careful .  don t break it .   the fragility of a good singing bell was proverbial .   dr .  urth said   geologists say the bells are only pressure hardened pumice  enclosing a vacuum in which small beads of rock rattle freely .  that s what they say .  but if that s all it is  why can t we reproduce one .  now a flawless bell would make this one sound like a child s harmonica .     exactly   said davenport   and there aren t a dozen people on earth who own a flawless one  and there are a hundred people and institutions who would buy one at any price  no questions asked .  a supply of bells would be worth murder .    the extraterrologist turned to davenport and pushed his spectacles back on his inconsequential nose with a stubby forefinger .   i haven t forgotten your murder case .  please go on .    that can be done in a sentence .  i know the identity of the murderer .    they had returned to the chairs in the library and dr .  urth clasped his hands over his ample abdomen .   indeed .  then surely you have no problem .  inspector .     knowing and proving are not the same  dr .  urth .  unfortunately he has no alibi .     you mean  unfortunately he has  don t you .     i mean what i say .  if he had an alibi  i could crack it somehow  because it would be a false one .  if there were witnesses who claimed they had seen him on earth at the time of the murder  their stories could be broken down .  if he had documentary proof  it could be exposed as a forgery .    or some sort of trickery .  unfortunately he has none of it .     what does he have  .    carefully inspector davenport described the peyton estate in colorado .  he concluded   he has spent every august there in the strictest isolation .  even the t . b . i  would have to testify to that .  any jury would have to presume that he was on his estate this august as well  unless we could present definite proof that he was on the moon .     what makes you think he was on the moon  .  perhaps he is innocent .     no .   davenport was almost violent .   for fifteen years i ve been trying to collect sufficient evidence against him and i ve never succeeded .  but i can smell a peyton crime now .  i tell you that no one but peyton  no one on earth  would have the impudence or  for that matter  the practical business contacts to attempt disposal of smuggled singing bells .  he is known to be an expert space pilot .  he is known to have had contact with the murdered man  though admittedly not for some months .  unfortunately none of that is proof .    dr .  urth said   wouldn t it be simple to use the psycho probe  now that its use has been legalized .    davenport scowled  and the scar on his cheek turned livid .   have you read the konski hiakawa law .  dr .  urth .     no .     i think no one has .  the right to mental privacy  the government says  is fundamental .  all right  but what follows .  the man who is pyschoprobed and proves innocent of the crime for which he was psychoprobed is entitled to as much compensation as he can persuade the courts to give him .  in a recent case a bank cashier was awarded twenty five thousand dollars for having been psychoprobed on inaccurate suspicion of theft .  it seems that the circumstantial evidence which seemed to point to theft actually pointed to a small spot of adultery .  his claim that he lost his job  was threatened by the husband in question and put in bodily fear  and finally was held up to ridicule and contumely because a news strip man had learned the results of the probe held good in court .     i can see the man s point .     so can we all .  that s the trouble .  one more item to remember  any man who has been psychoprobed once for any reason can never be psychoprobed again for any reason .  no one man  the law says  shall be placed in mental jeopardy twice in his lifetime .     inconvenient .     exactly .  in the two years since the psychoprobe has been legitimized  i couldn t count the number of crooks and chiselers who ve tried to get themselves psychoprobed for purse snatching so that they could play the rackets safely afterward .  so you see the department will not allow peyton to be psychoprobed until they have firm evidence of his guilt .  not legal evidence  maybe  but evidence that is strong enough to convince my boss .  the worst of it  dr .  urth  is that if we come into court without a psychoprobe record  we can t win .  in a case as serious as murder  not to have used the psychoprobe is proof enough to the dumbest juror that the prosecution isn t sure of its ground .     now what do you want of me  .     proof that he was on the moon sometime in august .  it s got to be done quickly .  i can t hold him on suspicion much longer .  and if news of the murder gets out  the world press will blow up like an asteroid striking jupiter s atmosphere .  a glamorous crime  you know   first murder on the moon .     exactly when was the murder committed .   asked urth  in a sudden transition to brisk cross examination .    august twenty seventh .     and the arrest was made when  .     yesterday  august thirtieth .     then if peyton were the murderer  he would have had time to return to earth .     barely .  just barely .   davenport s lips thinned .   if i had been a day sooner      if i had found his place empty          and how long do you suppose the two  the murdered man and the murderer  were on the moon altogether .       judging by the ground covered by the footprints  a number of days .  a week  at the minimum .     has the ship they used been located .     no  and it probably never will .  about ten hours ago  the university of denver reported a rise in background radioactivity beginning day before yesterday at   p . m .  and persisting for a number of hours .  it s an easy thing .  dr .  urth  to set a ship s controls so as to allow it to blast off without crew and blow up  fifty miles high  in a micropile short .     if i had been peyton   said dr .  urth thoughtfully   i would have killed the man on board ship and blown up corpse and ship together .     you don t know peyton   said davenport grimly .   he enjoys his victories over the law .  he values them .  leaving the corpse on the moon is his challenge to us .     i see .   dr .  urth patted his stomach with a rotary motion and said   well  there is a chance .    that you ll be able to prove he was on the moon  .    that i ll be able to give you my opinion .     now .    the sooner the better .  if  of course  i get a chance to interview mr .  peyton .    that can be arranged .  i have a non grav jet waiting .  we can be in washington in twenty minutes .    but a look of the deepest alarm passed over the plump extraterrologist s face .  he rose to his feet and pattered away from the t . b . i  agent toward the duskiest corner of the cluttered room .    no .     what s wrong  dr .  urth  .     i won t use a non grav jet .  i don t believe in them .    davenport stared confusedly at dr .  urth .  he stammered   would you prefer a monorail  .    dr .  urth snapped   i mistrust all forms of transportation .  i don t believe in them .  except walking .  i don t mind walking .   he was suddenly eager .   couldn t you bring mr .  peyton to this city  somewhere within walking distance .  to city hall  perhaps .  i ve often walked to city hall .    davenport looked helplessly about the room .  he looked at the myriad volumes of lore about the light years .  he could see through the open door into the room beyond  with its tokens of the worlds beyond the sky .  and he looked at dr .  urth  pale at the thought of non grav jet  and shrugged his shoulders .    i ll bring peyton here .  right to this room .  will that satisfy you .    dr .  urth puffed out his breath in a deep sigh .   quite .     i hope you can deliver  dr .  urth .     i will do my best  mr .  davenport .    louis peyton stared with distaste at his surroundings and with contempt at the fat man who bobbed his head in greeting .  he glanced at the seat offered him and brushed it with his hand before sitting down .  davenport took a seat next to him  with his blaster holster in clear view .   the fat man was smiling as he sat down and patted his round abdomen as though he had just finished a good meal and were intent on letting the world know about it .   he said   good evening  mr .  peyton .  i am dr .  wendell urth  extraterrologist .    peyton looked at him again   and what do you want with me .     i want to know if you were on the moon at any time in the month of august .     i was not .     yet no man saw you on earth between the days of august first and august thirtieth .     i lived my normal life in august .  i am never seen during that month .  let him tell you .   and he jerked his head in the direction of davenport .   dr .  urth chuckled .   how nice if we could test this matter .  if there were only some physical manner in which we could differentiate moon from earth .  if  for instance  we could analyze the dust in your hair and say   aha  moon rock .   unfortunately we can t .  moon rock is much the same as earth rock .  even if it weren t  there wouldn t be any in your hair unless you stepped onto the lunar surface without a spacesuit  which is unlikely .    peyton remained impassive .   dr .  urth went on  smiling benevolently  and lifting a hand to steady the glasses perched precariously on the bulb of his nose .   a man traveling in space or on the moon breathes earth air  eats earth food .  he carries earth environment next to his skin whether he s in his ship or in his spacesuit .  we are looking for a man who spent two days in space going to the moon  at least a week on the moon  and two days coming back from the moon .  in all that time he carried earth next to his skin  which makes it difficult .     i d suggest   said peyton   that you can make it less difficult by releasing me and looking for the real murderer .     it may come to that   said dr .  urth .   have you ever seen anything like this .   his hand pushed its pudgy way to the ground beside his chair and came up with a gray sphere that sent back subdued highlights .   peyton smiled .   it looks like a singing bell to me .     it is a singing bell .  the murder was committed for the sake of singing bells .  what do you think of this one .     i think it is badly flawed .     ah  but inspect it   said dr .  urth  and with a quick motion of his hand  he tossed it through six feet of air to peyton .   davenport cried out and half rose from his chair .  peyton brought up his arms with an effort  but so quickly that he managed to catch the bell .   peyton said   you damned fool .  don t throw it around that way .     you respect singing bells  do you  .     too much to break one .  that s no crime  at least .   peyton stroked the bell gently  then lifted it to his ear and shook it slowly  listening to the soft clicks of the lunoliths  those small pumice particles  as they rattled in vacuum .   then  holding the bell up by the length of steel wire still attached to it  he ran a thumbnail over its surface with an expert  curving motion .  it twanged .  the note was very mellow  very flutelike  holding with a slight vibrato that faded lingeringly and conjured up pictures of a summer twilight .   for a short moment  all three men were lost in the sound .   and then dr .  urth said .  throw it back  mr .  peyton .  toss it here .   and held out his hand in peremptory gesture .   automatically louis peyton tossed the bell .  it traveled its short arc one third of the way to dr .  urth s waiting hand  curved downward and shattered with a heartbroken  sighing discord on the floor .   davenport and peyton stared at the grey slivers with equal wordlessness and dr .  urth s calm voice went almost unheard as he said   when the criminal s cache of crude bells is located  i ll ask that a flawless one  properly polished  be given to me  as replacement and fee .     a fee .  for what .   demanded davenport irritably .    surely the matter is now obvious .  despite my little speech of a moment ago  there is one piece of earth s environment that no space traveler carries with him and that is earth s surface gravity .  the fact that mr .  peyton could so egregiously misjudge the toss of an object he obviously valued so highly could mean only that his muscles are not yet readjusted to the pull of earthly gravity .  it is my professional opinion  mr .  davenport  that your prisoner has  in the last few days  been away from earth .  he had either been in space or on some planetary object considerably smaller in size than the earth   as  for example  the moon .    davenport rose triumphantly to his feet .   let me have your opinion in writing   he said  hand on blaster   and that will be good enough to get me permission to use a psycho probe .    louis peyton  dazed and unresisting  had only the numb realization that any testament he could now leave would have to include the fact of ultimate failure .   afterword  my stories generally bring me mail from my readers    usually very pleasant mail  even when some embarrassing point must be brought up .  alter this story was published  lor instance  i received a letter from a young man who said he was inspired by dr .  urth s reasoning to check on the problem of whether differences in weight would really affect the manner in which an object was thrown .  in the end  he made a science project out of it .   he prepared objects  all of the same size and appearance but of different weights  and had people throw them  without saying in advance which were heavy and which were light .  he found that all the objects were thrown with roughly equal accuracy .  this has bothered me a bit  but i have decided that the young man s findings are not strictly applicable .  merely by holding an object in preparation to throwing it  one estimates   quite unconsciously   it s weight and adjusts the muscular effort to correspond  provided one is accustomed to the intensity of the gravity field under which one is operating .  astronauts on their sights have generally been strapped in and have not operated under low gravity except for short walks in space .   apparently these walks have proven surprisingly tiring  so it would seem a change in gravity requires considerable acclimation .  and a return to earth s gravity after such acclimation would require considerable re acclimation .  so   as of now  at least   i stand pat with dr .  urth .       the talking stone  the asteroid belt is large and its human occupancy small .  larry vernadsky  in the seventh month of his year long assignment to station five  wondered with increasing frequency if his salary could possibly compensate for a nearly solitary confinement seventy million miles from earth .  he was a slight youth  who did not bear the look of either a spationautical engineer or an asteroid man .  he had blue eyes and butter yellow hair and an invincible air of innocence that masked a quick mind and an isolation sharpened bump of curiosity .   both the look of innocence and the bump of curiosity served him well on board the robert q .  when the robert q .  landed on the outer platform of station five  vernadsky was on board almost immediately .  there was an eager delight about him which  in a dog  would have been accompanied by a vibrating tail and a happy cacophony of barks .   the fact that the captain of the robert q .  met his grins with a stern sour silence that sat heavily on his thick featured face made no difference .  as far as vernadsky was concerned the ship was yearned for company and was welcome .  it was welcome to any amount of the millions of gallons of ice or any of the tons of frozen food concentrates stacked away in the hollowed out asteroid that served as station five .  vernadsky was ready with any power tool that might be necessary  any replacement that might be required for any hyperatomic motor .   vernadsky was grinning all over his boyish face as he filled out the routine form  writing it out quickly for later conversion into computer notation for filing .  he put down ship s name and serial number  engine number  field generator number  and so on  port of embarkation   asteroids  damned lot of them  don t know which was last  and vernadsky simply wrote  belt  which was the usual abbreviation for  asteroid belt    port of destination   earth    reason for stopping   stuttering hyperatomic drive   .    how many in your crew  captain  .   asked vernadsky  as he looked over ship s papers .   the captain said  two .  now how about looking over the hyperatomics  .  we ve got a shipment to make .   his cheeks were blue with dark stubble  his bearing that of a hardened and lifelong asteroid miner  yet his speech was that of an educated  almost a cultured  man .    sure .   vernadsky lugged his diagnostic kit to the engine room  followed by the captain .  he tested circuits  vacuum degree  force field density with easy going efficiency .   he could not help wondering about the captain .  despite his own dislike for his surroundings he realized dimly that there were some who found fascination in the vast emptiness and freedom of space .  yet he guessed that a man like this captain was not an asteroid miner for the love of solitude alone .   he said   any special type of ore you handle .    the captain frowned and said   chromium and manganese .    that so  .   .  .  .  i d replace the jenner manifold  if i were you .     is that what s causing the trouble  .     no  it isn t .  but it s a little beat up .  you d be risking another failure within a million miles .  as long as you ve got the ship in here          all right  replace it .  but find the stutter  will you .     doing my best  captain .    the captain s last remark was harsh enough to abash even vernadsky .  he worked awhile in silence  then got to his feet .   you ve got a gamma fogged semireflector .  every time the positron beam circles round to its position the drive flickers out for a second .  you ll have to replace it .     how long will it take .     several hours .  maybe twelve .     what  .  i m behind schedule .     can t help it .   vernadsky remained cheerful .  there s only so much i can do .  the system has to be flushed for three hours with helium before i can get inside .  and then i have to calibrate the new semireflector and that takes time .  i could get it almost right in minutes  but that s only almost right .  you d break down before you reach the orbit of mars .    the captain glowered .   go ahead .  get started .    vernadsky carefully maneuvered the tank of helium on board the ship .  with ship s pseudo grav generators shut off  it weighed virtually nothing  but it had its full mass and inertia .  that meant careful handling if it were to make turns correctly .  the maneuvers were all the more difficult since vernadsky himself was without weight .   it was because his attention was concentrated entirely on the cylinder that he took a wrong turn in the crowded quarters and found himself momentarily in a strange and darkened room .   he had time for one startled shout and then two men were upon him  hustling his cylinder  closing the door behind him .   he said nothing  while he hooked the cylinder to the intake valve of the motor and listened to the soft  soughing noise as the helium flushed the interior  slowly washing absorbed radioactive gases into the all accepting emptiness of space .   then curiosity overcame prudence and he said   you ve got a silicony aboard ship  captain .  a big one .    the captain turned to face vernadsky slowly .  he said in a voice from which all expression had been removed   is that right .     i saw it .  how about a better look .     why .    vernadsky grew imploring .   oh  look  captain  i ve been on this rock over half a year .  i ve read everything i could get hold of on the asteroids  which means all sorts of things about the siliconies .  and i ve never seen even a little one .  have a heart .     i believe there s a job here to do .     just helium flushing for hours .  there s nothing else to be done till that s over .  how come you carry a silicony about  anyway  captain .     a pet .  some people like dogs .  i like siliconies .     have you got it talking .    the captain flushed .   why do you ask .     some of them have talked .  some of them read minds  even .     what are you  .  an expert on these damn things  .     i ve been reading about them .  i told you .  come on  captain .  let s have a look .    vernadsky tried not to show that he noticed that there was the captain facing him and a crewman on either side of him .  each of the three was larger than he was  each  weightier  each   he felt sure   was armed .   vernadsky said   well  what s wrong .  i m not going to steal the thing .  i just want to see it .    it may have been the unfinished repair job that kept him alive at the moment .  even more so  perhaps  it was his look of cheerful and almost moronic innocence that stood him in good stead .   the captain said .   well  then  come on .    and vernadsky followed  his agile mind working and his pulse definitely quickened .   vernadsky stared with considerable awe and just a little revulsion at the gray creature before him .  it was quite true that he had never seen a silicony  but he had seen trimensional photographs and read descriptions .  yet there is something in a real presence for which neither words nor photographs are substitutes .   its skin was of an oily smooth grayness .  its motions were slow  as became a creature who burrowed in stone and was more than half stone itself .  there was no writhing of muscles beneath that skin  instead it moved in slabs as thin layers of stone slid greasily over one another .   it had a general ovoid shape  rounded above  flattened below  with two sets of appendages .  below were the  legs   set radially .  they totaled six and ended in sharp flinty edges  reinforced by metal deposits .  those edges could cut through rock  breaking it into edible portions .   on the creature s flat undersurface  hidden from view unless the silicony were overturned  was the one opening into its interior .  shredded rocks entered that interior .  within  limestone and hydrated silicates reacted to form the silicones out of which the creatures s tissues were built .  excess silica re emerged from the opening as hard white pebbly excretions .   how extraterrologists had puzzled over the smooth pebbles that lay scattered in small hollows within the rocky structure of the asteroids until the siliconies were first discovered .  and how they marveled at the manner in which the creatures made silicones   those silicone oxygen polymers with hydrocarbon side chains   perform so many of the functions that proteins performed in terrestrial life .   from the highest point on the creature s back came the remaining appendages  two inverse cones hollowed in opposing directions and fitting snugly into parallel recesses running down the back  yet capable of lifting upward a short way .  when the silicony burrowed through rock  the  ears  were retracted for streamlining .  when it rested in a hollowed out cavern  they could lift for better and more sensitive reception .  their vague resemblance to a rabbit s ears made the name silicony inevitable .  the more serious extraterrologists  who referred to such creatures habitually as siliconeus asteroidea  thought the  ears  might have something to do with the rudimentary telepathic powers the beasts possessed .  a minority had other notions .   the silicony was flowing slowly over an oil smeared rock .  other such rocks lay scattered in one corner of the room and represented  vernadsky knew  the creature s food supply .  or at least it was its tissue building supply .  for sheer energy  he had read  that alone would not do .   vernadsky marveled .   it s a monster .  it s more than a foot across .    the captain grunted noncommittally .    where did you get it  .   asked vernadsky .    one of the rocks .     well  listen  two inches is about the biggest anyone s found .  you could sell this to some museum or university on earth for a couple of thousand dollars  maybe .    the captain shrugged .   well  you ve seen it .  lets get back to the hyperatomics .    his hard grip was on vernadsky s elbow and he was turning away  when there was an interruption in the form of a slow and slurring voice  a hollow and gritty one .   it was made by the carefully modulated friction of rock against rock and vernadsky stared in near horror at the speaker .   it was the silicony  suddenly becoming a talking stone .  it said   the man wonders if this thing can talk .    vernadsky whispered   for the love of space .  it does .     all right   said the captain impatiently   you ve seen it and heard it  too .  let s go now .     and it reads minds   said vernadsky .   the silicony said   mars rotates in two four hours three seven and one half minutes .  jupiter s density is one point two two .  uranus was discovered in the year one seven eight one .  pluto is the planet which is most far .  sun is heaviest with a mass of two zero zero zero zero zero zero .  .  .    the captain pulled vernadsky away .  vernadsky  half walking backward  half stumbling  listened with fascination to the fading bumbling of zeroes .   he said   where does it pick up all that stuff  captain  .    there s an old astronomy book we read to him .  real old .     from before space travel was invented   said one of the crew members in disgust .   ain t even a fillum .  regular print .    shut up   said the captain .   vernadsky checked the outflow of helium for gamma radiation and eventually it was time to end the flushing and work in the interior .  it was a painstaking job  and vernadsky interrupted it only once for coffee and a breather .   he said  with innocence beaming in his smile   you know the way i figure it  captain .  that thing lives inside rock  inside some asteroid all its life .  hundreds of years  maybe .  it s a damn big thing and it s probably a lot smarter than the run of the mill silicony .  now you pick it up and it finds out the universe isn t rock .  it finds out a trillion things it never imagined .  that s why it s interested in astronomy .  it s this new world  all these new ideas it gets in the book and in human minds  too .  don t you think that s so .    he wanted desperately to smoke the captain out  get something concrete he could hang his deductions on .  for this reason he risked telling what must be half the truth  the lesser half  of course .   but the captain  leaning against a wall with his arms folded  said only   when will you be through .    it was his last comment and vernadsky was obliged to rest content .  the motor was adjusted finally to vernadsky s satisfaction  and the captain paid the reasonable fee in cash  accepted his receipt  and left in a blaze of ship s hyper energy .   vernadsky watched it go with an almost unbearable excitement .  he made his way quickly to his sub etheric sender .    i ve got to be right   he muttered to himself .   i ve got to be .    patrolman milt hawkins received the call in the privacy of his home station on patrol station asteroid no .     .  he was nursing a two day stubble  a can of iced beer  and a film viewer  and the settled melancholy on his ruddy  wide cheeked face was as much the product of loneliness as was the forced cheerfulness in vernadsky s eyes .   patrolman hawkins found himself looking into those eyes and was glad .  even though it was only vernadsky  company was company .  he gave him the big hello and listened luxuriously to the sound of a voice without worrying too strenuously concerning the contents of the speech .   then suddenly amusement was gone and both ears were on the job and he said   hold it .  ho   id it .  what are you talking about .     haven t you been listening  you dumb cop .  i m talking my heart out to you .     well  deal it out in smaller pieces  will you  .  what s this about a silicony .    this guy s got one on board .  he calls it a pet and feeds it greasy rocks .     huh  .  i swear  a miner on the asteroid run would make a pet out of a piece of cheese if he could get it to talk back to him .     not just a silicony .  not one of these little inch jobs .  it s over a foot across .  don t you get it .  space  you d think a guy would know something about the asteroids  living out here .     all right .  suppose you tell me .     look  greasy rocks build tissues  but where does a silicony that size get its energy from  .     i couldn t tell you .     directly from       have you got anyone around you right now .     right now  no .  i wish there were .     you won t in a minute .  siliconies get their energy by the direct absorption of gamma rays .     says who .     says a guy called wendell urth .  he s a big shot extraterrologist .  what s more  he says that s what the silicony s ears are for .   vernadsky put his two forefingers to his temples and wiggled them .   not telepathy at all .  they detect gamma radiation at levels no human instrument can detect .     okay .  now what .   asked hawkins .  but he was growing thoughtful  now this .  urth says there isn t enough gamma radiation on any asteroid to support siliconies more than an inch or two long .  not enough radioactivity .  so here we have one a foot long  a good fifteen inches .     well          so it has to come from an asteroid just riddled with the stuff  lousy with uranium  solid with gamma rays .  an asteroid with enough radioactivity to be warm to the touch and off the regular orbit patterns so that no one s come across it .  only suppose some smart boy landed on the asteroid by happenstance and noticed the warmth of the rocks and got to thinking .  this captain of the robert q .  is no rock hopping ignoramus .  he s a shrewd guy .     go on .     suppose he blasts off chunks for assay and comes across a giant silicony .  now he knows he s got the most unbelievable strike in all history .  and he doesn t need assays .  the silicony can lead him to the rich veins .     why should it .     because it wants to learn about the universe .  because it s spent a thousand years  maybe  under rock  and it s just discovered the stars .  it can read minds and it could learn to talk .  it could make a deal .  listen  the captain would jump at it .  uranium mining is a state monopoly .  unlicensed miners aren t even allowed to carry counters .  it s a perfect setup for the captain .    hawkins said   maybe you re right .     no maybe at all .  you should have seen them standing around me while i watched the silicony  ready to jump me if i said one funny word .  you should have seen them drag me out after two minutes .    hawkins brushed his unshaven chin with his hand and made a mental estimate of the time it would take him to shave .  he said   how long can you keep the boy at your station .     keep him .  space  he s gone .     what .  then what the devil is all this talk about  .  why did you let him get away  .     three guys   said vernadsky patiently   each one bigger than i am  each one armed  and each one ready to kill  i ll bet .  what did you want me to do  .     all right  but what do we do now  .     come out and pick them up .  that s simple enough .  i was fixing their semireflectors and i fixed them my way .  then power will shut off completely within ten thousand miles .  and i installed a tracer in the jenner manifold .    hawkins goggled at vernadsky s grinning face .   holy toledo .     and don t get anyone else in on this .  just you  me  and the police cruiser .  they ll have no energy and we ll have  a cannon or two .  they ll tell us where the uranium asteroid is .  we locate it  then get in touch with patrol headquarters .  we will deliver unto them  three  count them  three  uranium smugglers  one giant size silicony like nobody on earth ever saw  and one  i repeat  one great big fat chunk of uranium ore like nobody on earth saw  either .  and you make a lieutenancy and i get promoted to a permanent earth side job .  right .    hawkins was dazed .   right   he yelled .   i ll be right out there .    they were almost upon the ship before spotting it visually by the weak glinting of reflected sunlight .   hawkins said   didn t you leave them enough power for ship s lights .  you didn t throw off their emergency generator  did you .    vernadsky shrugged .  they re saving power  hoping they ll get picked up .  right now  they re putting everything they ve got into a sub etheric call  i ll bet .     if they are   said hawkins dryly   i m not picking it up .     you re not .     not a thing .    the police cruiser spiraled closer .  their quarry  its power off  was drifting through space at a steady ten thousand miles an hour .  the cruiser matched it  speed for speed  and drifted inward .   a sick expression crossed hawkins  face .   oh no .     what s the matter .    the ship s been hit .  a meteor .  lord knows there are enough of them in the asteroid belt .    all the verve washed out of vernadsky s face and voice .   hit  .  are they wrecked  .    there s a hole in it the size of a barn door .  sorry  vernadsky  but this might not look good .    vernadsky closed his eyes and swallowed hard .  he knew what hawkins meant .  vernadsky had deliberately misrepaired a ship  a procedure which could be judged a felony .  and death as a result of a felony was murder .   he said   look  hawkins  you know why i did it .     i know what you ve told me and i ll testify to that if i have to .  but if this ship wasn t smuggling .  .  .    he didn t finish the statement .  nor did he have to .   they entered the smashed ship in full spacesuit cover .   the robert q .  was a shambles  inside and out .  without power  there was no chance of raising the feeblest screen against the rock that hit them or of detecting it in time or of avoiding it if they had detected it .  it had caved in the ship s hull as though it were so much aluminum foil .  it had smashed the pilot room  evacuated the ship s air  and killed the three men on board .   one of the crew had been slammed against the wall by the impact and was so much frozen meat .  the captain and the other crewman lay in stiff attitudes  skins congested with frozen bloodclots where the air  boiling out of the blood  had broken the vessels .   vernadsky  who had never seen this form of death in space  felt sick  but he fought against vomiting messily inside his spacesuit and succeeded .   he said   let s test the ore they re carrying .  it s got to be alive .   it s got to be  he told himself .  it s got to be .   the door to the hold had been warped by the force of collision and there was a gap half an inch wide where it no longer met the frame .   hawkins lifted the counter he held in his gauntleted hand and held its mica window to that gap .   it chattered like a million magpies .   vernadsky said  with infinite relief   i told you so .    his misrepair of the ship was now only the ingenious and praisworthy fulfillment of a citizen s loyal duty and the meteor collision that had brought death to three men merely a regrettable accident .   it took two blaster bolts to break the twisted door loose  and tons of rock met their flashlights .   hawkins lifted two chunks of moderate size and dropped them gingerly into one of the suit s pockets .   as exhibits   he said   and for assay .     don t keep them near the skin too long   warned vernadsky .   the suit will protect me till i get it back to ship .  it s not pure uranium  you know .     pretty near  i ll bet .   every inch of his cockiness was back .   hawkins looked about .   well  this tears things .  we ve stopped a smuggling ring  maybe  or part of one .  but what next .    the uranium asteroid   uh  oh .     right .  where is it  .  the only ones who know are dead .     space .   and again vernadsky s spirits were dashed .  without the asteroid itself  they had only three corpses and a few tons of uranium ore .  good  but not spectacular .  it would mean a citation  yes  but he wasn t after a citation .  he wanted promotion to a permanent earth side job and that required something .   he yelled   for the love of space  the silicony .  it can live in a vacuum .  it lives in a vacuum all the time and it knows where the asteroid is .     right .   said hawkins  with instant enthusiasm .   where is the thing .     aft   cried vernadsky .  this way .    the silicony glinted in the light of their flashes .  it moved and was alive .   vernadsky s heart beat madly with excitement .   we ve got to move it  hawkins .     why .     sound won t carry in a vacuum  for the love of space .  we ve got to get it into the cruiser .     all right .  all right .     we can t put a suit around it with a radio transmitter  you know .     i said all right .    they carried it gingerly and carefully  their metal sheated fingers handling the greasy surface of the creature almost lovingly .   hawkins held it while kicking off the robert q .   it lay in the control room of the cruiser now .  the two men had removed their helmets and hawkins was shucking his suit .  vernadsky could not wait .   he said  you can read our minds .    he held his breath until finally the gratings of rock surfaces modulated themselves into words .  to vernadsky no finer sound could  at the moment  be imagined .   the silicony said   yes .   then he said   emptiness all about .  nothing .     what .   said hawkins .   vernadsky shushed him .   the trip through space just now  i guess .  it must have impressed him .    he said to the silicony  shouting his words as though to make his thoughts clearer  the men who were with you gathered uranium  special ore  radiations  energy .     they wanted food   came the weak  gritty sound .   of course .  it was food to the silicony .  it was an energy source .  vernadsky said   you showed them where they could get it .     yes .    hawkins said   i can hardly hear the thing .    there s something wrong with it   said vernadsky worriedly .  he shouted again .   are you well .     not well .  air gone at once .  something wrong inside .    vernadsky muttered .  the sudden decompression must have damaged it .  oh  lord       look  you know what i want .  where is your home  .  the place with the food  .    the two men were silent  waiting .   the silicony s ears lifted slowly  very slowly  trembled  and fell back .  there   it said .   over there .     where .   screamed vernadsky .   there .    hawkins said   it s doing something .  it s pointing in some way .     sure  only we don t know in what way .     well  what do you expect it to do .  give the coordinates .    vernadsky said at once   why not .   he turned again to the silicony as it lay huddled on the floor .  it was motionless now and there was a dullness to its exterior that looked ominous .   vernadsky said  the captain knew where your eating place was .  he had numbers concerning it  didn t he .   he prayed that the silicony would understand  that it would read his thoughts and not merely listen to his words .    yes   said the silicony in a rock against rock sigh .    three sets of numbers   said vernadsky .  there would have to be three .  three coordinates in space with dates attached  giving three positions of the asteroid in its orbit about the sun .  from these data the orbit could be calculated in full and its position determined at any time .  even planetary perturbations could be accounted for  roughly .    yes   said the silicony  lower still .    what were they .  what were the numbers .  write them down  hawkins .  get paper .    but the silicony said   do not know .  numbers not important .  eating place there .    hawkins said .  that s plain enough .  it didn t need the coordinates  so it paid no attention to them .    the silicony said  soon not    a long pause  and then slowly  as though testing a new and unfamiliar word     alive .  soon    an even longer pause    dead .  what after death .     hang on   implored vernadsky .  tell me  did the captain write down these figures anywhere .    the silicony did not answer for a long minute and then  while both men bent so closely that their heads almost touched over the dying stone  it said   what after death .    vernadsky shouted   one answer .  just one .  the captain must have written down the numbers .  where .  where .    the silicony whispered   on the asteroid .    and it never spoke again .   it was a dead rock  as dead as the rock which gave it birth  as dead as the walls of the ship  as dead as a dead human .   and vernadsky and hawkins rose from their knees and stared hopelessly at each other .    it makes no sense   said hawkins .   why should he write the coordinates on the asteroid .  that s like locking a key inside the cabinet it s meant to open .    vernadsky shook his head .   a fortune in uranium .  the biggest strike in history and we don t know where it is .           h .  seton davenport looked about him with an odd feeling of pleasure .  even in repose  there was usually something hard about his lined face with its prominent nose .  the scar on his right cheek  his black hair  startling eyebrows  and dark complexion all combined to make him look every bit the incorruptible agent of the terrestrial bureau of investigation that he actually was .   yet now something almost like a smile tugged at his lips as he looked about the large room  in which dimness made the rows of book films appear endless  and specimens of who knows what from who knows where bulk mysteriously .  the complete disorder  the air of separation  almost insulation  from the world  made the room look unreal .  it made it look every bit as unreal as its owner .   that owner sat in a combination armchair desk which was bathed in the only focus of bright light in the room .  slowly he turned the sheets of official reports he held in his hand .  his hand moved otherwise only to adjust the thick spectacles which threatened at any moment to fall completely from his round and completely unimpressive nubbin of a nose .  his paunch lifted and fell quietly as he read .   he was dr .  wendell urth  who  if the judgment of experts counted for anything  was earth s most outstanding extraterrologist .  on any subject outside earth men came to him  though dr .  urth had never in his adult life been more than an hour s walk distance from his home on the university campus .   he looked up solemnly at inspector davenport .   a very intelligent man  this young vernadsky   he said .   to have deduced all he did from the presence of the silicony  .  quite so   said davenport .    no  no .  the deduction was a simple thing .  unavoidable  in fact .  a noodle would have seen it .  i was referring    and his glance grew a trifle censorious    to the fact that the youngster had read of my experiments concerning the gamma ray sensitivity of siliconeus asteroidea .    ah  yes   said davenport .  of course .  dr .  urth was the expert on siliconies .  it was why davenport had come to consult him .  he had only one question for the man  a simple one  yet dr .  urth had thrust out his full lips  shaken his ponderous head  and asked to see all the documents in the case .   ordinarily that would have been out of the question  but dr .  urth had recently been of considerable use to the t . b . i  in that affair of the singing bells of luna and the singular non alibi shattered by moon gravity  and the inspector had yielded .   dr .  urth finished the reading  laid the sheets down on his desk  yanked his shirttail out of the tight confines of his belt with a grunt and rubbed his glasses with it .  he stared through the glasses at the light to see the effects of his cleaning  replaced them precariously on his nose  and clasped his hands on his paunch  stubby fingers interlacing .    your question again  inspector .    davenport said patiently   is it true  in your opinion  that a silicony of the size and type described in the report could only have developed on a world rich in uranium          radioactive material   interrupted dr .  urth .  thorium  perhaps  though probably uranium .     is your answer yes  then  .     yes .     how big would the world be .     a mile in diameter  perhaps   said the extraterrologist thoughtfully .   perhaps even more .     how many tons of uranium  or radioactive material  rather .     in the trillions .  minimum .     would you be willing to put all that in the form of a signed opinion in writing .     of course .     very well then  dr .  urth .   davenport got to his feet  reached for his hat with one hand and the file of reports with the other .   that is all we need .    but dr .  urth s hand moved to the reports and rested heavily upon them .   wait .  how will you find the asteroid .     by looking .  we ll assign a volume of space to every ship made available to us and   just look .    the expense  the time  the effort .  and you ll never find it .     one chance in a thousand .  we might    one chance in a million .  you won t .     we can t let the uranium go without some try .  your professional opinion makes the prize high enough .     but there is a better way to find the asteroid .  i can find it .    davenport fixed the extraterrologist with a sudden  sharp glance .  despite appearances dr .  urth was anything but a fool .  he had personal experience of that .  there was therefore just a bit of half hope in his voice as he said   how can you find it .     first   said dr .  urth   my price .     price .     or fee  if you choose .  when the government reaches the asteroid  there may be another large size silicony on it .  siliconies are very valuable .  the only form of life with solid silicone for tissues and liquid silicone as a circulating fluid .  the answer to the question whether the asteroids were once part of a single planetary body may rest with them .  any number of other problems  .  .  .  do you understand .     you mean you want a large silicony delivered to you  .     alive and well .  and free of charge .  yes .    davenport nodded .   i m sure the government will agree .  now what have you on your mind .    dr .  urth said quietly  as though explaining everything   the silicony s remark .    davenport looked bewildered .   what remark .    the one in the report .  just before the silicony died .  vernadsky was asking it where the captain had written down the coordinates  and it said   on the asteroid .      a look of intense disappointment crossed davenport s face .   great space  doctor  we know that  and we ve gone into every angle of it .  every possible angle .  it means nothing .     nothing at all  inspector .     nothing of importance .  read the report again .  the silicony wasn t even listening to vernadsky .  he was feeling life depart and he was wondering about it .  twice  it asked   what after death .   then  as vernadsky kept questioning it  it said   on the asteroid .   probably it never heard vernadsky s question .  it was answering its own question .  it thought that after death it would return to its own asteroid  to its home  where it would be safe once more .  that s all .    dr .  urth shook his head .   you are too much a poet  you know .  you imagine too much .  come  it is an interesting problem and let us see if you can t solve it for yourself .  suppose the silicony s remark were an answer to vernadsky .     even so   said davenport impatiently   how would it help .  which asteroid .  the uranium asteroid .  we can t find it  so we can t find the coordinates .  some other asteroid which the robert q .  had used as a home base .  we can t find that either .     how you avoid the obvious .  inspector .  why don t you ask yourself what the phrase  on the asteroid  means to the silicony .  not to you or to me  but to the silicony .    davenport frowned .   pardon me  doctor .     i m speaking plainly .  what did the word asteroid mean to the silicony .     the silicony learned about space out of an astronomy text that was read to it .  i suppose the book explained what an asteroid was .     exactly   crowed dr .  urth  putting a finger to the side of his snub nose .   and how would the definition go .  an asteroid is a small body  smaller than the planets  moving about the sun in an orbit which  generally speaking  lies between those of mars and jupiter .  wouldn t you agree .     i suppose so .     and what is the robert q .  .     you mean the ship .    that s what you call it   said dr .  urth .  the ship .  but the astronomy book was an ancient one .  it made no mention of ships in space .  one of the crewmen said as much .  he said it dated from before space flight .  then what is the robert q .  .  isn t it a small body  smaller than the planets .  and while the silicony was aboard  wasn t it moving about the sun in an orbit which  generally speaking  lay between those of mars and jupiter .     you mean the silicony considered the ship as just another asteroid  and when he said  on the asteroid   he meant  on the ship  .     exactly .  i told you i would make you solve the problem for yourself .    no expression of joy or relief lightened the gloom on the inspector s face .  that is no solution .  doctor .    but dr .  urth blinked slowly at him and the bland look on his round face became  if anything  blander and more childlike in its uncomplicated pleasure .   surely it is .     not at all .  dr .  urth  we didn t reason it out as you did .  we dismissed the silicony s remark completely .  but still  don t you suppose we searched the robert q .  .   we took it apart piece by piece  plate by plate .  we just about unwelded the thing .     and you found nothing .     nothing .     perhaps you did not look in the right place .     we looked in every place .   he stood up  as though to go .   you understand  dr .  urth  .  when we got through with the ship there was no possibility of those coordinates existing anywhere on it .     sit down  inspector   said dr .  urth calmly .   you are still not considering the silicony s statement properly .  now the silicony learned english by collecting a word here and a word there .  it couldn t speak idiomatic english .  some of its statements  as quoted  show that .  for instance  it said   the planet which is most far  instead of  the farthest planet .   you see .     well .     someone who cannot speak a language idiomatically either uses the idioms of his own language translated word by word or else he simply uses foreign words according to their literal meaning .  the silicony had no spoken language of its own so it could only make use of the second alternative .  let s be literal  then .  he said   on the asteroid   inspector .  on it .  he didn t mean on a piece of paper  he meant on the ship  literally .     dr .  urth   said davenport sadly   when the bureau searches  it searches .  there were no mysterious inscriptions on the ship either .    dr .  urth looked disappointed .   dear me  inspector .  i keep hoping you will see the answer .  really  you have had so many hints .    davenport drew in a slow  firm breath .  it went hard  but his voice was calm and even once more .   will you tell me what you have in mind  doctor .    dr .  urth patted his comfortable abdomen with one hand and replaced his glasses .   don t you see  inspector  that there is one place on board a spaceship where secret numbers are perfectly safe .  where  although in plain view  they would be perfectly safe from detection  .  where though they were being stared at by a hundred eyes  they would be secure .  except from a seeker who is an astute thinker  of course .     where .  name the place .     why  in those places where there happen to be numbers already .  perfectly normal numbers .  legal numbers .  numbers that are supposed to be there .     what are you talking about  .     the ship s serial number  etched directly on the hull .  on the hull  be it noted .  the engine number  the field generator number .  a few others .  each etched on integral portions of the ship .  on the ship  as the silicony said .  on the ship .    davenport s heavy eyebrows rose with sudden comprehension .   you may be all right   and if you are  i m hoping we find you a silicony twice the size of the robert q .  s .  one that not only talks  but whistles   up  asteroids  forever .     he hastily reached for the dossier  thumbed rapidly through it and extracted an official t . b . i  form .   of course  we noted down all the identification numbers we found .   he spread the form out .   if three of these resemble coordinates  .  .  .     we should expect some small effort at disguise   dr .  urth observed .  there will probably be certain letters and figures added to make the series appear more legitimate .    he reached for a scratch pad and shoved another toward the inspector .  for minutes the two men were silent  jotting down serial numbers  experimenting with crossing out obviously unrelated figures .   at last davenport let out a sigh that mingled satisfaction and frustration .   i m stuck   he admitted .   i think you re right  the numbers on the engine and the calculator are clearly disguised coordinates and dates .  they don t run anywhere near the normal series  and it s easy to strike out the fake figures .  that gives us two  but i ll take my oath the rest of these are absolutely legitimate serial numbers .  what are your findings  doctor .    dr .  urth nodded .   i agree .  we now have two coordinates and we know where the third was inscribed .     we know  do we  .  and how        the inspector broke off and uttered a sharp exclamation .   of course .  the number on the very ship itself  which isn t entered here   because it was on the precise spot on the hull where the meteor crashed through   i m afraid there goes your silicony .  doctor .   then his craggy face brightened .   but i m an idiot .  the number s gone  but we can get it in a flash from interplanetary  registry .     i fear   said dr .  urth   that i must dispute at least the second part of your statement .  registry will have only the ship s original legitimate number  not the disguised coordinate to which the captain must have altered it .    the exact spot on the hull   davenport muttered .   and because of that chance shot the asteroid may be lost forever .  what use to anybody are two coordinates without the third .     well   said dr .  urth precisely   conceivably of very great use to a two dimensional being .  but creatures of our dimensions   he patted his paunch   do require the third   which i fortunately happen to have right here .     in the t . b . i  dossier .  but we just checked the list of numbers          your list  inspector .  the file also includes young vernadsk s original report .  and of course the serial number listed there for the robert q .  is the carefully faked one under which she was then sailing   no point in rousing the curiosity of a repair mechanic by letting him note a discrepancy .    davenport reached for a scratch pad and the vernadsky list .  a moment s calculation and he grinned .   dr .  urth lifted himself out of the chair with a pleased puff and trotted to the door .   it is always pleasant to see you .  inspector davenport .  do come again .  and remember the government can have the uranium  but i want the important thing  one giant silicony  alive and in good condition .   he was smiling .    and preferably   said davenport   whistling .   which he was doing himself as he walked out .   afterword  of course  there is a catch about writing a mystery .  you are apt to concentrate so bard on the mystery itself  on occasion  as to lose sight of important peripheral values .  after this story first appeared  i received quite a bit of mail expressing interest in the silicony and  in some cases  finding fault with me for allowing it to die in so coldblooded a fashion .  as i reread the story now  i must admit the readers are right .  i showed a lack of sensitivity to the silicony s rather pathetic death because i was concentrating on his mysterious last words .  if i had to do it over again  i would certainly be warmer in my treatment of the poor thing .  i apologize .   this shows that even experienced writers don t always do the right thing  and can miss something that is bobbing up and down right at mustache level .   foreword  this next story is not  in the strictest sense of the word  a science fiction mystery  yet i include it .  the reason is that science is closely and intimately involved with the mystery  and i hesitate to penalize it by non inclusion merely because the science is of the present rather than of the future .       what s in a name  .   if you think it s hard to get hold of potassium cyanide  think again .  i stood there with a pound bottle in my hand .  brown glass  a nice clear label saying  potassium cyanide cp   the initials  i was told  meaning  chemically pure   with a small skull and crossbones underneath .   the fellow who owned the bottle polished his glasses and blinked at me .  he was associate professor helmuth rodney of carmody university .  he was of middle height  stocky  with a soft chin  plump lips  a budding paunch  a shock of brown hair  and a look of complete indifference to the fact that i was holding in my hand enough poison to kill a regiment .   i said   do you mean to say this just stands on your shelf  professor .    he said in the kind of deliberate tone he probably used in lecturing his students   yes  it always has  inspector .  along with the rest of the chemicals in alphabetic order .    i glanced about the cluttered room .  shelves lined the upper reaches of all the walls  and bottles  large and small  filled them all .   this one   i pointed out   is poison .     a great many of them are   he said with composure .    do you keep track of what you ve got .     in a general way .   he rubbed his chin .   i know i have that bottle .     but suppose someone came in here and helped himself to a spoonful of this stuff .  would you be able to tell  .    professor rodney shook his head .   i couldn t possibly .     well  then  who could get into this laboratory  .  it is kept locked .    he said   it s locked when i leave in the evening  unless i forget .  during the day  it isn t locked  and i m in and out .     in other words .  professor  anyone could come in here  even someone from the street  walk off with some of the cyanide  and no one would ever know .     i m afraid so .     tell me .  professor  why do you keep this much cyanide in the place anyway  .  to kill rats  .     good heavens  no .   he seemed family repelled at the thought .   cyanide is sometimes used in organic reactions to form necessary intermediates  to provide a proper basic medium  to catalyze          i see .  i see .  now in what other labs is cyanide available in this way .     in most of them   he answered at once .   even in the student labs .  after all  it s a common chemical  routinely used in syntheses .     i wouldn t call its use today routine   i said .   he sighed and said   no  i suppose not .   he added thoughtfully  they used to call them the  library twins .      i nodded .  i could see the reason for the nickname .  the two girl librarians were very alike .   not close up  of course .  one had a small pointed chin on a round face  and the other had a square jaw and a long nose .  still  bend them over a desk and both had honey blond hair parted in the middle with a similar wave .  look them quickly in the face and you would probably notice first wide set eyes of about the same shade of blue .  see them standing together at a moderate distance and you could see they were both of a height and both  probably  with the same brand and size uplift brassiere .  both had trim waists and neat legs .  today they had even dressed similarly .  both wore blue .   there was no confusing the two now  though .  the one with the small chin and round face was full of cyanide  and quite dead .   the similarity was the first thing that struck me when i arrived with my partner  ed hathaway .  there was one girl slumped in her chair and dead  her eyes open  one arm dangling straight down  with a broken teacup on the floor beneath like a period under an exclamation point .  her name  it turned out  was louella marie busch .  there was a second girl  like the first one brought back to life  white and shaken  staring straight ahead and letting the police and their work flow about her without seeming to notice .  her name was susan morey .   the first question i asked was   relatives .    they weren t .  not even second cousins .   i looked about the library .  there were whole shelves of books in similar bindings  then other shelves with books in another set of bindings .  they were volumes of different research journals .  in another room were stacks of what i found later to be textbooks  monographs  and older books .  in the back was a special alcove containing recent numbers of unbound research periodicals in dull and closely printed paper covers .  from wall to wall were long tables that might have seated a hundred people if all were fully occupied .  fortunately that wasn t the case .   we got the story out of susan morey in flat  toneless pieces .   mrs .  nettler  the old senior librarian had taken off for the afternoon and had left the two girls in charge .  that  apparently  was not unusual .   at two o clock  give or take five minutes  louella marie took herself into the back room behind the library desk .  there  in addition to new books that awaited cataloguing  stacks of periodicals that awaited binding  reserved books that awaited their reservers  there was also a small hot plate  a small kettle  and the fixings for weak tea .   two o clock tea was apparently usual  too .   i said   did louella marie prepare the tea every day .    susan looked at me out of her blank blue eyes .   sometimes mrs .  nettler does  but usually lou   louella marie did .    when the tea was ready  louella marie emerged to say so and after a few moments the two retired .    both of you .   i asked sharply .   who took care of the library .    susan shrugged as though this were a minor point to worry about  and said   we can see out the door if anyone came to the desk  one of us could have gone out .     did anyone come to the desk .     no one .  it s intersession .  hardly anyone s around .    by intersession she meant that the spring semester was over and the summer sessions had not yet started .  i learned quite a bit about college life that day .   what was left of the story was little enough .  the tea bags were already out of the gently steaming cups and the sugar had been added .   i interrupted .   you both take sugar .    susan said slowly   yes .  but mine didn t have any .     no .     she never forgot before .  she knows i take it .  i just took a sip or two and i was going to reach for the sugar and tell her  you know  when         when louella marie gave a queer strangled cry  dropped the cup  and was dead in a minute .   after that susan screamed and eventually we came .   the routine passed smoothly enough .  photographs and fingerprints had been taken .  the names and addresses of the men and women in the building were taken and they were sent home .  cause of death was obviously cyanide and the sugar bowl was the obvious villain .  samples were taken for official testing .   there had been six men in the library at the time of the murder .  five were students  who looked frightened  confused  or sick  depending  i suppose  on their personalities .  the sixth was a middle aged man  an outsider  who talked with a german accent and had no connection with the college at all .  he looked frightened  confused  and sick  all three .   my sidekick  hathaway  was leading them out of the library .  the idea was to get them to the co educational lounge and have them stay put till we could get to them in detail .   one of the students broke away and strode past me without a glance .  susan flew to meet him  clutching each sleeve above the elbow .   pete .  pete .    pete was built like a football player except that his profile looked as though he had never been within half a mile of the playing field .  he was too good looking for my taste  but then i get jealous easily .   pete was looking past the girl  his face coming apart at the seams till its prettiness was drowned in uneasy horror .  he said in a hoarse  choking way   how did lolly come to .  .  .    susan gasped   i don t know .  i don t know .   she kept trying to meet his eye .   pete pulled away .  he never looked at susan once  kept staring over her shoulder .  then he responded to hathaway s grip on his elbow and let himself be led away .   i said   boyfriend .    susan tore her eyes from the departing student .   what  .     is he your boy friend .    she looked down at her twisting hands .   we ve been out on dates .     how serious .    she whispered   pretty serious .     does he know the other girl  too .  he called her lolly .    susan shrugged .   well .  .  .     let s put it this way .  did he go out with her  .     sometimes .     seriously .    she snapped   how should i know .     come on  now .  was she jealous of you .     what s all this about .     someone put the cyanide in the sugar and put the mixture in only one cup .  suppose louella marie was jealous enough of you to try to poison you and leave herself a clear field with our friend pete .  and suppose she took the wrong teacup herself by mistake .    susan said  that s crazy .  louella marie wouldn t do such a thing .    but her lips were thin  her eyes sparkled  and i can tell hate in a voice when i hear it .   professor rodney came into the library .  he was the first man i had met on entering the building and my feelings toward him had grown no warmer .   he had begun by informing me that as senior faculty member present  he was in charge .   i said   i m in charge now  professor .    he said   of the investigation perhaps  inspector  but it is i who am responsible to the dean and i propose to fulfill my responsibilities .    and although he hadn t the figure of an aristocrat  more like a shopkeeper  if you follow me  he managed to look at me as though there were a microscope between as with himself on the large side .   now he said   mrs .  nettler is in my office .  she heard the news bulletin  apparently  and came at once .  she is quite agitated .  you will see her .   he made it sound like an order .    bring her in .  professor .   i made it sound like permission .   mrs .  nettler was in the usual quandary of the average old lady .  she didn t know whether to be horrified or fascinated at the closeness with which death had struck .  horror won out after she looked into the inner office and noticed what was left of the tea things .  the body was gone by then  of course .   she flopped into a chair and began crying .   i had tea here myself   she moaned .   it might have been  .  .  .    i said as quietly and soothingly as i could manage   when did you drink tea here  mrs .  nettler .    she turned in her seat  looked up .   why   why  just after one  i think .  i offered professor rodney a cup  i remember .  it was just after one  professor rodney  wasn t it .    a trace of annoyance crossed rodney s plump face .  he said to me   i was here a moment just after lunch to consult a reference .  mrs  nettler did offer a cup .  i was too busy  i m afraid  to accept or to note the time exactly .    i grunted and turned back to the old lady .   do you take sugar  mrs .  nettler .     yes  sir .     did you take sugar .    she nodded and started crying again .   i waited a bit .  then   did you notice the condition of the sugar bowl .     it was   it was        a sudden surprise at the question seemed to put her on her feet .   it was empty and i filled it myself .  i used the two pound box of granulated sugar and i remember saying to myself that whenever i wanted tea the sugar was gone and i wished the girls would         maybe it was the mention of the girls in the plural .  she broke out again .   i nodded to hathaway to lead her away .   between i and   p . m .   obviously  someone had emptied the sugar bowl and then added just a bit of laced sugar    very neatly laced sugar .   maybe it was mrs .  nettler s appearance that pumped librarianship back into susan  because when hathaway came back and reached for one of his cigars   he already had the match lit   the girl said   no smoking in the library  sir .    hathaway was so surprised he blew the match out and replaced the cigar in his pocket .   then the girl stepped briskly to one of the long tables and reached for a large volume that lay open on it .   hathaway was ahead of her .   what are you going to do  miss .    susan looked completely astonished .   i m just going to put it back on the shelves .     why .  what is it .   he looked down at the open page .  i was there too  by then .  i looked over his shoulder .   it was german .  i can t read the language  but i can recognize it when i see it .  the printing was small  and there were geometrical figures on the page with lines of letters attached at various places .  i knew enough  too  to know those were chemical formulas .   i put my finger in the place  closed the book and looked at the backstrap .  it said   beilstein   organische chemie   band vi   system nummer         .   i opened to the page again .  it was     and the first words  just to give you an idea  were    chlor   brom   nitro diphenylather c  h o  nclbr .   hathaway was busy copying things down .   professor rodney was at the table too  which made four of us all gathered round the book .   the professor said in a cool voice  as though he were on a platform with a pointer in one hand and a piece of chalk in the other   this is a volume of beilstein .    he pronounced it bile shtine .    it s a kind of encyclopedia of organic compounds .  it lists hundreds of thousands of them .     in this book .   demanded hathaway .   this book is only one of more than sixty volumes and supplementary volumes .  it is a tremendous german work which is years out of date because  first  organic chemistry is progressing at an ever increasing pace and  second  because of the interference of politics and war .  even so  there is nothing even faintly approaching its usefulness in english .  for all research men in organic chemistry  these volumes are an absolute necessity .    the professor actually patted the book as he spoke  a fond pat .   before dealing with any unfamiliar compound   he said   it is good practice to look it up in beilstein .  it will give you methods of preparation  properties  references  and so on .  it acts as a starting point .  the various compounds are listed according to a logical system which is clear but not obvious .  i myself give several lectures in my course on organic syntheses which deal entirely with methods for finding a particular compound somewhere in the sixty volumes .    i don t know how long he might have continued  but i wasn t there to learn organic syntheses and it was time to get down to cases .  i said abruptly   professor  i want to speak to you in your laboratory .    i suppose i had some notion that cyanide was kept in a safe  that every bit of it was accounted for  that people had to sign out for it when they wanted some .  i thought the question of opportunity to get some illicitly might supply what proof we needed .   and there i stood with a pound of it in my hand and the knowledge that anyone could have any amount for the asking  or without asking .   and he said thoughtfully   they used to call them the  library twins .     i nodded .  so .     only that it proves how superficial the judgment of most people is .  there was nothing alike about them except the accident of hair and eyes .  what happened in the library  inspector .    i told him susan s story briefly and watched him .   he shook his head .   i suppose you think the dead girl planned murder .    my thoughts weren t for sale at the moment .  i said   don t you .     no .  she was incapable of it .  her attitude toward her duties was a pleasant and helpful one .  besides  why would she .     there s a student   i said .   peter is his first name .     peter van norden   he said at once .   a reasonably bright student  but  somehow  worthless .     girls look at these things differently  professor .  both librarians were apparently interested .  susan may have been the more successful and louella marie may have decided on direct measures .     and then proceeded to take the wrong cup  .    i said   people do queer things under tension .     not this queer   he said .   one cup was left unsugared  so the murderess wasn t taking chances .  presumably even if she had not carefully memorized which cup was which  she could count on the sweetness to give it away .  she could easily have avoided a fatal dose .    i said dryly   both girls usually took sugar .  the dead girl was used to sweet tea .  in the excitement the accustomed sweetness didn t ring a bell .     i don t believe it .     what s the alternative  professor  .  the sugar was hocused after mrs .  nettler s tea at one o clock .  did mrs .  nettler do it .    he looked up sharply .   what possible motive .    i shrugged .   she might have been afraid the girls were going to be taking her job away .    that s nonsense .  she s retiring before the fall session begins .     you were there  professor   i said softly .   he took it in stride  to my surprise .   motive .   he said .   i said   you re not too old to have been interested in louella marie  professor .  suppose she had threatened to report some word or act of yours to the dean .    the professor smiled bitterly .   how did i manage to make sure the right girl got the cyanide .  why should one cup remain unsugared .  i may have hocused the sugar but i didn t prepare the tea .    i began to change my mind about professor rodney .  he hadn t bothered to work up indignation or register shock .   he simply pointed out the logical weakness and let it go at that .  i liked that .   i said   what do you think happened .    he said  the mirror image .  the reverse .  i think the survivor told the truth inside out .  suppose it was louella marie who was getting the boy and susan who didn t like it  rather than the reverse .  suppose it was susan who for once was preparing the tea and louella marie who was at the front desk rather than the reverse .  in that case  the girl who prepared the tea would have taken the right cup and remained safe .  everything would be logical instead of ridiculously improbable .    that did it .  the man had come to the same conclusion i had and so i had to like him after all .  i have a habit of feeling soft toward guys who agree with me .  it comes of being homo sapiens  i think .   i said   we ve got to prove that beyond reasonable doubt .  how  .  i d come up here  hoping to prove someone had had access to potassium cyanide and others had not .  that s out .  everyone had access .  now what .    the professor said   check on which girl was really at the desk at two o clock when the tea was being prepared .    it was obvious to me that the professor read detective stories and had faith in witnesses .  i didn t  but i got up anyway .    all right  professor .  i ll do that .    the professor rose also .  he said urgently   may i be present .    i considered .   why .  your responsibilities to the dean .     in a way .  i would like to see a quick  clean end to this .    i said   come along  if you think that will help .    ed hathaway was waiting for me when i came down .  he was sitting in an empty library .  he said .   i got it .     got what .   i wanted to know .    how it happened .  i figured it out by deduction .     oh .    he was paying no attention to professor rodney .  the cyanide had to be smuggled in .  by whom  .  by the joker in the deck  the outsider  the guy with the accent   whatzis name .    he started scrabbling through a series of cards on which he had filed information on the various presumably innocent bystanders .   i knew who he meant so i said   all right  never mind the name .  what s in a name .  go on    which shows that i can be as unbright as anyone .    all right .  the foreigner comes in with the cyanide in a little envelope .  he tapes the envelope to a page in the german book  that organish whatzisname with all the volumes .  .  .    the professor and i both nodded .   hathaway went on .   he was german  so was the book .  he was probably familiar with it .  he put the envelope on a prearranged page according to a particular formula that had been picked out .  the professor said there was a way to find any formula if you only knew how .  isn t that right .  professor .    that is right   said rodney coldly .    all right .  the librarian knew the formula so she could find the page too .  she picks up the cyanide and uses it for the tea .  in the excitement  she forgets to close the book         i said   look  hathaway .  why should that little guy be doing this .  what s his excuse for being here .     he says he s a furrier reading up on moth repellents and insecticides .  now isn t that phony right off .  ever hear anything so phony .     sure   i said   your theory .  look  no one is going to hide an envelope with cyanide in a book .  you don t have to find a particular formula or page with an envelope bulging a volume out of shape .  anyone who took the volume off the shelf would find that the book would fall open to the right page automatically .  a hell of a hiding place .    hathaway began to look foolish .   i drove on pitilessly   besides  cyanide doesn t have to be smuggled in from the outside .  they ve got tons of it here .  they can use it to make snow slides .  anyone who wants a pound or two can help himself .     what .     ask the professor .    hathaway s eyes widened and then he fumbled in his jacket pocket and drew out an envelope .  then what do i do with this .     what is it .    he took out a printed page with german on it and said   it s the page out of that german volume that         professor rodney grew suddenly scarlet .   you tore a page out of beilstein .    he shrieked it and surprised the hell out of me .  i wouldn t have thought him capable of shrieking .   hathaway said   i thought we could test it for stickum from the scotch tape  or maybe for a little cyanide that leaked out .     give it to me .   yelled the professor .   you ignorant fool .    he smoothed out the sheet and looked at both sides as though to make sure that none of the print had been rubbed off .    vandal .   he said  and i m sure that at the moment he could have killed hathaway and laughed during the entire process .   professor rodney might be morally certain of susan s guilt and so  for that matter  might i .  nevertheless  moral certainty cannot be taken before a jury .  evidence was needed .   so  lacking faith in witnesses  i attacked through the one weakness of any possibly guilty person   the possibly guilty person .   i brought her in to witness the new line of questioning  and if the questioning didn t pin her to her guilt  her own nerves might .   from her appearance i couldn t tell how good that  might  would be .  susan morey sat at her desk  hands clasped before her  eyes cold  and the skin around her nostrils tight looking .   the little german furrier was in first  looking sick with worry .   i did nothing   he babbled .   please .  i have business .  how long must i stay .    hathaway had his name and vital statistics  so i skipped all that and got to the point .    you came here a little before two o clock .  right .     yes .  i wanted to know about moth repellents          all right .  when you came in you went to the desk .  right .     yes .  i told her my name  who i was  what i wanted         told whom  .   that was the key question .   the little fellow stared at me .  he had curly hair and a mouth that fell in as though he were toothless  but that was just appearance  for when he talked  small yellow teeth were plainly visible .  he said   her .  i told her .  the girl sitting there .     that s right   said susan tonelessly .   he spoke to me .    professor rodney was gazing at her with a look of concentrated detestation .  it occurred to me that his reason for wishing to see justice done quickly might be more personal than idealistic at that .  however  that was none of my business .   i said to the furrier   are you sure this is the girl  .    he said   yes .  i told her my name and my business  and she smiled .  she told me where to find books on insecticides .  then  as i was stepping away  another girl came out from inside there .     good .   i said at once .   now here s a photograph of another girl .  tell me  was it the girl at the desk you spoke to and the girl in the photograph who came out of the back room  .  or was it the girl in the photograph you spoke to and the girl at the desk who came out of the back room  .    for a long minute  the furrier stared at the girl  then at the photograph  then at me .   they are alike .    i swore to myself .  the faintest smile had passed over susan s lips  hovering there a moment before vanishing .  she must have counted on this .  it was intersession .  hardly anyone would be in the library .  none of them would pay much attention to the librarians who are fixtures like the bookshelves  and if any did  he could never swear which of the library twins he had seen .   i knew she was guilty now  but knowing meant nothing .   i said   well  which was it .    he said  like one anxious to put an end to questioning   i spoke to her  the girl right there at the desk .     that s right   said susan  perfectly calm .   my hope in her nerves hit bottom .   i said to the furrier   would you swear .    he said at once   no .     all right .  hathaway  take him away .  send him home .    professor rodney leaned over to touch my elbow .  he whispered   why did she smile at the fellow when he stated his business .    i whispered back   why not .   but put the question to her anyway .   her eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch .   i was just being pleasant .  is there anything wrong with that .    she was almost enjoying herself .  i could swear to that .   the professor shook his head slightly .  he whispered to me again   she s not the type to smile at a troublesome stranger .  it had to be louella marie at the desk .    i shrugged .  i could see myself bringing that kind of evidence to the commissioner .   four of the students were a blank and took up little time .  they were engaged in research  they knew what books they wanted  what shelves the books would be on .  they went straight there without stopping at the desk .  none could say whether susan or louella marie had been at the desk at any particular time .  none had even looked up from their books  to hear them tell it  before the scream roused everything .   the fifth was peter van norden .  he kept his eyes fixed firmly on his right thumb  which had a badly bitten nail .  he did not look up at susan as he was brought in .   i let him sit awhile and soften up .   finally i said   what are you doing here this time of year  .  i understand it s between sessions .    he muttered   my qualifyings are coming up next month .  i m studying .  qualifying examinations .  if i pass  i can go on for my ph . d .   see .    i said   i suppose you stopped at the desk when you came in here .    he mumbled .   i said   what .    he said in a low voice that was hardly an improvement   i didn t .  i don t think i stopped at the desk .     you don t think .     i didn t .    i said   isn t that strange .  i understand you re good friends of both susan and louella marie .  don t you say hello .     i was worried .  i had this test in my mind .  i had to study .    so you couldn t even take time out for a hello .   i looked at susan to see how this was going over .  she seemed paler  but that might have been my imagination .   i said   isn t it true that you were practically engaged to one of them .    he looked up with uneasy indignation .   no .  i can t get engaged before i get my degree .  who told you i was engaged .     i said practically engaged .     no .  i had a few dates  maybe .  so what .  what s a date or two .    i said smoothly   come on  pete  which one was your girl .     i tell you it wasn t like that .    he was washing his hands of the whole matter so hard  he seemed buried and smothered in an invisible lather .    how about it .   i asked suddenly  addressing susan .   did he stop at your desk .     he waved as he passed   she said .    did you  pete .     i don t remember   he said sullenly .   maybe i did .  so what .     nothing   i said .  inside me  i wished susan joy of her bargain .  if she had killed for the sake of this specimen  she had done it for nothing .  to me it seemed a certainty that henceforward he would ignore her even if she fell off a two story building and hit him on the head .   susan must have realized that too .  from the look she was giving peter van norden  i marked him down as a second candidate for cyanide   assuming she went free   and it certainly seemed as though she would .   i nodded to hathaway to take him away .  hathaway rose to do that and said   say  you ever use those books .   and he pointed to the shelves where the sixty odd volumes of the organic chemistry encyclopedia stretched from floor to ceiling .   the boy looked over his shoulder and said in honest astonishment .   sure .  i ve got to .  lord  is something wrong with looking up compounds in beilst          it s all right   i assured him .   come on  ed .    ed hathaway scowled at me and led the boy out .  he hates letting go of an exploded theory .   it was about six and i didn t see that anything more could be done .  as it stood  it was susan s word against no word .  if she had been a hood with a record  we could have sweated out the truth in any of several effective  if tedious  ways .  in this case  such a procedure was inadvisable .   i turned to the professor to say so  but he was staring at hathaway s cards .  at one of them  anyway  which he was holding in his hand .  you know  people always talk about other people s hands shaking with excitement  but it s something you don t often see .  rodney s hand was shaking  though  shaking like the clapper of an old fashioned alarm clock .   he cleared his throat .   let me ask her something .  let me .  .  .    i stared at him  then pushed my chair back .   go ahead   i said .  at this point  there was nothing to lose .   he looked at the girl  putting the card down on the desk  blank side up .   he said shakily   miss morey .   he seemed to be deliberately avoiding the familiarity of her first name .   she stared at him .  for a moment she had seemed nervous  but that passed and she was calm again .   yes  professor .    the professor said   miss morey  you smiled when the furrier told you his business here .  why was that .     i told you  professor rodney   she said   i was being pleasant .     perhaps there was something peculiar about what he said .  something amusing .     i was just trying to be pleasant   she insisted .    perhaps you found his name amusing  miss morey .     not particularly   she said indifferently .    well  no one has mentioned his name here .  i didn t know it till i happened to look at this card .   then suddenly  tensely  he cried   what was his name  miss morey .    she paused before answering   i don t remember .     you don t  .  he gave it to you  didn t he  .    there was an edge to her voice now .   what if he did  .  it s just a name .  after all that s happened  you can t expect me to remember some peculiar foreign name i happened to hear one time .     it was foreign  then .    she pulled up short  avoiding the trap .   i don t remember   she said .   i think it was a typically german name  but i don t remember .  for all i know it was john smith .    i had to admit i didn t see the professor s point .  i said   what are you trying to prove .  professor rodney .     i m trying to prove   he said tightly   in fact i am proving  that it was louella marie  the dead girl  who was at the desk when the furrier came in .  he announced his name to louella marie and she smiled in consequence .  it was miss morey who was coming out of the inner office as he turned away .  it was miss morey  this girl  who had just finished preparing and poisoning the tea .     you re basing that on the fact i can t remember a man s name .   shrilled susan morey .  that s ridiculous .     no  it isn t   said the professor .   if you had been the girl at the desk  you would remember his name .  it would be impossiblefor you to forget it .  if you were the girl at the desk .   he was holding hathaway s card up now .  he said .  that furrier s first name is ernest  but his last name is beilstein .  his name is beilstein .   the air went out of susan as though she had been kicked in the stomach .  she turned white as talcum powder .   the professor went on intensely   no chemical librarian could possibly forget the name of anyone who came in and announced himself to be beilstein .  the sixty volume encyclopedia we ve mentioned half a dozen times today is referred to invariably by the name of its editor  beilstein .  the name is like mother goose to a chemical librarian  like george washington  like christopher columbus .  it is more second nature to her than any of them .    if this girl claims to have forgotten the name  it is only because she never heard it .  and she never heard it because she wasn t at the desk .    i rose and said grimly   well  miss morey    i abandoned the first name too    what about it .    she was screaming in earsplitting hysteria .  half an hour later  we had her confession .   foreword  some years before this next story was written  two colleagues and i joined forces in writing a large and complicated textbook in biochemistry lor medical students .  we spent days   literally   on the galley proofs  and frequently we came across minor inconsistencies .  we would spell a chemical one way here and another way there  here a hyphen and there no hyphen  here one phrase and yon an alternate .  we despaired of getting everything perfectly concordant and one of us finally said   to quote emerson   a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds .    we latched on to this with ebullient joy and thereafter  whenever the proof reader questioned a small inconsistency  we would write  emerson .   in the margin and let it go .  well  the following story revolves about the possible invention of mass transference  and in preparing these stories tor inclusion in this volume  i noted that in  the singing bell    an earlier story with the same background   mass transference was taken lor granted as already existing .  i was about to make certain changes to eliminate that discrepancy  when i remembered .  so if you don t mind  gentle reader  i cry  emerson .   and pass on .       the dying night  it was almost a class reunion  and though it was marked by joylessness  there was no reason as yet to think it would be marred by tragedy .   edward talliaferro  fresh from the moon and without his gravity legs yet  met the other two in stanley kaunas  room .  kaunas rose to greet him in a subdued manner .  battersley ryger merely sat and nodded .   talliaferro lowered his large body carefully to the couch  very aware of its unaccustomed weight .  he grimaced a little  his plump lips twisting inside the rim of hair that surrounded them on lip  chin  and cheek .   they had seen one another earlier that day under more formal conditions .  now for the first time they were alone and talliaferro said  this is a kind of occasion .  we re meeting for the first time in ten years .  first time since graduation  in fact .    ryger s nose twitched .  it had been broken shortly before that same graduation and he had received his degree in astronomy with a bandage disfiguring his face .  he said grumpily   anyone ordered champagne .  or something .    talliaferro said   come on .  first big interplanetary astronomical convention in history is no place for glooming .  and among friends  too .    kaunas said suddenly   it s earth .  it doesn t feel right .  i can t get used to it .   he shook his head but his look of depression remained .   talliaferro said   i know .  i m so heavy .  it takes all the energy out of me .  at that  you re better off than i am  kaunas .  mercurian gravity is     normal .  on the moon  it s only     i  .   he interrupted ryger s beginning of a sound by saying   and on ceres they use pseudo grav fields adjusted to     .  you have no problems at all  ryger .    the cerian astronomer looked annoyed .   it s the open air .  going outside without a suit gets me .     right   agreed kaunas .   and letting the sun beat down on you .  just letting it .    talliaferro found himself insensibly drifting back in time .  they had not changed much .  nor  he thought  had he himself .  they were all ten years older  of course .  ryger had put on some weight and kaunas  thin face had grown a bit leathery  but he would have recognized either if he had met him without warning .   he said   i don t think it s earth getting us .  let s face it .    kaunas looked up sharply .  he was a little fellow with quick  nervous movements of his hands and habitually wore clothes that looked a shade too large for him .   he said   villiers .  i know .  i think about him sometimes .   then  with an air of desperation   i got a letter from him .    ryger sat upright  his olive complexion darkening further  and said with energy   you did .  when .     a month ago .    ryger turned to talliaferro .   how about you .    talliaferro blinked placidly and nodded .   ryger said   he s gone crazy .  he claims he s discovered a practical method of mass transference through space .     he told you two also  .     that s it  then .  he was always a little bent .  now he s broken .    he rubbed his nose fiercely  and talliaferro thought of the day villiers had broken it .   for ten years villiers had haunted them like the vague shadow of a guilt that wasn t really theirs .  they had gone through their graduate work together  four picked and dedicated men being trained for a profession that had reached new heights in this age of interplanetary travel .   the observatories were opening on the other worlds  surrounded by vacuum  unblurred by air .   there was the lunar observatory  from which earth and the inner planets could be studied  a silent world in whose sky the home planet hung suspended .   mercury observatory  closest to the sun  perched at mercury s north pole  where the terminator moved scarcely at all  and the sun was fixed on the horizon and could be studied in the minutest detail .   ceres observatory  newest  most modern  with its range extending from jupiter to the outermost galaxies .   there were disadvantages  of course .  with interplanetary travel still difficult  leaves would be few  anything like normal life virtually impossible  but this was a lucky  . generation .  coming scientists would find the fields of knowledge well reaped and  until the invention of an interstellar drive  no new horizon as capacious as this one would be opened .   these lucky four  talliaferro  ryger  kaunas  and villiers  were to be in the position of a galileo  who  by virtue of owning the first real telescope  could not point it anywhere in the sky without making a major discovery .   but then romano villiers had fallen sick and it was rheumatic fever .  whose fault was that .  his heart had been left leaking and limping .   he was the most brilliant of the four  the most hopeful  the most intense   and he could not even finish his schooling and get his doctorate .   worse than that  he could never leave earth  the acceleration of a spaceship s takeoff would kill him .   talliaferro was marked for the moon  ryger for ceres  kaunas for mercury .  only villiers stayed behind  a life prisoner of earth .   they had tried telling their pity and villiers had rejected it with something approaching hate .  he had railed at them and cursed them .  when ryger lost his temper and lifted his fist  villiers had sprung at him screaming and broken his nose .   obviously ryger hadn t forgotten that  as he caressed his nose gingerly with one finger .   kaunas  forehead was an uncertain washboard of wrinkles .   he s at the convention  you know .  he s got a room in the hotel       .     i won t see him   said ryger .    he s coming up here .  he said he wanted to see us .  i thought he said nine .  he ll be here any minute .     in that case   said ryger   if you don t mind  i m leaving .    talliaferro said   oh  wait awhile .  what s the harm in seeing him .     because there s no point .  he s insane .     even so .  let s not be petty about it .  are you afraid of him .     afraid .   ryger looked contemptuous .    nervous  then .  what is there to be so nervous about .     i m not nervous   said ryger .    sure you are .  we all feel guilty about him  and without real reason .  nothing that happened was our fault .   but he was speaking defensively and he knew it .   and when  at that point  the door signal sounded  all three jumped and turned to stare uneasily at the barrier that stood between themselves and villiers .   the door opened and romano villiers walked in .  the others rose stiffly to greet him  then remained standing in embarrassment  without one hand being raised .   he stared them down sardonically .   he s changed  thought talliaferro .   he had .  he had shrunk in almost every dimension .  a gathering stoop even made him seem shorter .  the skin of his scalp glistened through thinning hair  the skin on the back of his hands was ridged crookedly with bluish veins .  he looked ill .  there seemed nothing to link him to the memory of the past except for his trick of shading his eyes with one hand when he stared intently and  when he spoke  the even  controlled baritone of his voice .   he said .   my friends .  my space trotting friends .  we ve lost touch .    talliaferro said   hello villiers .    villiers eyed him .   are you well .     well enough .     and you two .    kaunas managed a weak smile and a murmur .  ryger snapped   all right  villiers .  what s up .     ryger  the angry man   said villiers .   how s ceres .     it was doing well when i left .  how s earth .     you can see for yourself   but villiers tightened as he said that .   he went on   i am hoping that the reason all three of you have come to the convention is to hear my paper day after tomorrow .     your paper .  what paper .   asked talliaferro .    i wrote you all about it .  my method of mass transference .    ryger smiled with one corner of his mouth .   yes  you did .  you didn t say anything about a paper  though  and i don t recall that you re listed as one of the speakers .  i would have noticed it if you had been .     you re right .  i m not listed .  nor have i prepared an abstract for publication .    villiers had flushed and talliaferro said soothingly   take it easy  villiers .  you don t look well .    villiers whirled on him  lips contorted .   my heart s holding out  thank you .    kaunas said   listen  villiers  if you re not listed or abstracted          you listen .  i ve waited ten years .  you have the jobs in space and i have to teach school on earth  but i m a better man than any of you or all of you .     granted        began talliaferro .    and i don t want your condescension  either .  mandel witnessed it .  i suppose you ve heard of mandel .  well  he s chairman of the astronautics division at the convention and i demonstrated mass transference for him .  it was a crude device and it burned out after one use but       are you listening .     we re listening   said ryger coldly .   for what that counts .     he ll let me talk about it my way .  you bet he will .  no warning .  no advertisement .  i m going to spring it at them like a bombshell .  when i give them the fundamental relationships involved it will break up the convention .  they ll scatter to their home labs to check on me and builddevices .  and they ll find it works .  i made a five mousedisappear at one spot in my lab and appear in another .  mandelwitnessed it .    he stared at them  glaring first at one face  then at another .  he said   you don t believe me  do you .    ryger said   if you don t want advertisement  why do yon tell us .     you re different .  you re my friends  my classmates .  youwent out into space and left me behind .     that wasn t a matter of choice   objected kaunas in a thin  high voice .   villiers ignored that .  he said   so i want you to know now .  what will work for a mouse will work for a human .  what will move something ten feet across a lab will move it a million miles across space .  i ll be on the moon  and on mercury  and on ceres and anywhere i want to go .  i ll match every one of you and more .  and i ll have done more for astronomy just teaching school and thinking than all of you with your observatories and telescopes and cameras and spaceships .     well   said talliaferro   i m pleased .  more power to you .  may i see a copy of the paper .     oh  no .   villiers  hands clenched close to his chest as though he were holding phantom sheets and shielding them from observation .   you wait like everyone else .  there s only one copy and no one will see it till i m ready .  not even mandel .     one copy .   cried talliaferro .   if you misplace it          i won t .  and if i do  it s all in my head .     if you        talliaferro almost finished that sentence with  die  but stopped himself .  instead  he went on after an almost imperceptible pause      have any sense  you ll scan it at least .  for safety s sake .     no   said villiers shortly .   you ll hear me day after tomorrow .  you ll see the human horizon expanded at one stroke as it never has been before .    again he stared intently at each face .  ten years   he said .   good bye .     he s mad   said ryger explosively  staring at the door as though villiers were still standing before it .    is he .   said talliaferro thoughtfully .   i suppose he is  in a way .  he hates us for irrational reasons .  and  then  not even to scan his paper as a precaution  .  .  .    talliaferro fingered his own small scanner as he said that .  it was just a neutrally colored  undistinguished cylinder  somewhat thicker and somewhat shorter than an ordinary pencil .  in recent years it had become the hallmark of the scientist  much as the stethoscope was that of the physician and the microcomputer that of the statistician .  the scanner was worn in a jacket pocket  or clipped to a sleeve  or slipped behind the ear or swung at the end of a string .   talliaferro sometimes  in his more philosophical moments  wondered how it was in the days when research men had to make laborious notes of the literature or file away full sized reprints .  how unwieldy .   now it was only necessary to scan anything printed or written to have a micronegative which could be developed at leisure .  talliaferro had already recorded every abstract included in the program booklet of the convention .  the other two  he assumed with full confidence  had done likewise .   talliaferro said   under the circumstances  refusal to scan is mad .     space .   said ryger hotly .   there is no paper .  there is no discovery .  scoring one on us would be worth any lie to him .     but then what will he do day after tomorrow .   asked kaunas .    how do i know .  he s a madman .    talliaferro still played with his scanner and wondered idly if he ought to remove and develop some of the small slivers of film that lay stored away in its vitals .  he decided against it .  he said   don t underestimate villiers .  he s a brain .    ten years ago  maybe   said ryger .   now he s a nut .  i propose we forget him .    he spoke loudly  as though to drive away villiers and all that concerned him by the sheer force with which he discussed other things .  he talked about ceres and his work    the radio plotting of the milky way with new radioscopes capable of the resolution of single stars .   kaunas listened and nodded  then chimed in with information concerning the radio emissions of sunspots and his own paper  in press  on the association of proton storms with the gigantic hydrogen flares on the sun s surface .   talliaferro contributed little .  lunar work was unglamorous in comparison .  the latest information on long scale weather forecasting through direct observation of terrestrial jet streams would not compare with radioscopes and protonstorms .   more than that  his thoughts could not leave villers .  villiers was the brain .  they all knew it .  even ryger  for all his bluster  must feel that if mass transference were at all possible then villiers was a logical discoverer .   the discussion of their own work amounted to no more than an uneasy admission that none of them had come to much .  talliaferro had followed the literature and knew .  his own papers had been minor .  the others had authored nothing of great importance .   none of them   face the fact   had developed into space shakers .  the colossal dreams of schooldays had not come true and that was that .  they were competent routine workmen .  no more than that  they knew .   villiers would have been more .  they knew that  too .  it was that knowledge  as well as guilt  which kept them in antagonism .   talliaferro felt uneasily that villiers  despite everything  was yet to be more .  the others must be thinking so too  and mediocrity could grow quickly unbearable .  the mass transference paper would come to pass and villiers would be the great man after all  as he was always fated to be apparently  while his classmates  with all their advantages  would be forgotten .  their role would be no more than to applaud from the crowd .   he felt his own envy and chagrin and was ashamed of it  but felt it nonetheless .   conversation died  and kaunas said  his eyes turning away   listen  why don t we drop in on old villiers  .    there was a false heartiness about it  a completely unconvincing effort at casualness .  he added   no use leaving bad feelings .  .  .    talliaferro thought .  he wants to make sure about the mass transference .  he s hoping it is only a madman s nightmare so he can sleep tonight .   but he was curious himself  so he made no objection  and even ryger shrugged with ill grace and said   hell  why not .    it was then a little before eleven .   talliaferro was awakened by the insistent ringing of his door signal .  he hitched himself to one elbow in the darkness and felt distinctly outraged .  the soft glow of the ceiling indicator showed it to be not quite four in the morning .   he cried out   who is it  .    the ringing continued in spurts .   growling  talliaferro slipped into his bathrobe .  he opened the door and blinked in the corridor light .  he recognized the man who faced him from the trimensionals he had seen often enough .   nevertheless the man said in an abrupt whisper   my name is hubert mandel .     yes  sir   said talliaferro .  mandel was one of the names in astronomy  prominent enough to have an important executive position with the world astronomical bureau  active enough to be chairman of the astronautics section here at the convention .   it suddenly struck talliaferro that it was mandel for whom villiers claimed to have demonstrated mass transference .  the thought of villiers was somehow a sobering one .   mandel said   you are dr .  edward talliaferro .     yes  sir .    then dress and come with me .  it is very important .  it concerns a common acquaintance .     dr .  villiers .    mandel s eyes flickered a bit .  his brows and lashes were so fair as to give those eyes a naked  unfringed appearance .  his hair was silky thin  his age about fifty .   he said   why villiers .     he mentioned you last evening .  i don t know any other common acquaintance .    mandel nodded  waited for talliaferro to finish slipping into his clothes  then turned and led the way .  ryger and kaunas were waiting in a room one floor above talliaferro s .  kaunas  eyes were red and troubled .  ryger was smoking a cigarette with impatient puffs .   talliaferro said .   we re all here .  another reunion .   it fell flat .   he took a seat and the three stared at one another .  ryger shrugged .   mandel paced the floor  hands deep in his pockets .  he said   i apologize for any inconvenience  gentlemen  and i thank you for your cooperation .  i would like more of it .  our friend romano villiers is dead .  about an hour ago  his body was removed from the hotel .  the medical judgment is heart failure .    there was a stunned silence .  ryger s cigarette hovered halfway to his lips  then sank slowly without completing its journey .    poor devil   said talliaferro .    horrible   whispered kaunas hoarsely .   he was  .  .  .   his voice played out .   ryger shook himself .   well  he had a bad heart .  there s nothing to be done .     one little thing   corrected mandel quietly .   recovery .     what does that mean .   asked ryger sharply .   mandel said   when did you three see him last .    talliaferro spoke .   last evening .  it turned out to be a reunion .  we all met for the first time in ten years .  it wasn t a pleasant meeting  i m sorry to say .  villiers felt he had cause for anger with us  and he was angry .    that was   when .     about nine  the first time .    the first time .     we saw him again later in the evening .    kaunas looked troubled .   he had stormed off angrily .  we couldn t leave it at that .  we had to try .  it wasn t as if we hadn t all been friends at one time .  so we went to his room and         mandel pounced on that .   you were all in his room  .     yes   said kaunas  surprised .    about when .     eleven  i think .   he looked at the others .  talliaferro nodded .    and how long did you stay .     two minutes   put in ryger .   he ordered us out as though we were after his paper .   he paused as if expecting mandel to ask what paper  but mandel said nothing .  he went on   i think he kept it under his pillow .  at least he lay across the pillow as he yelled at us to leave .     he may have been dying then   said kaunas in a sick whisper .    not then   said mandel shortly .   so you probably all left fingerprints .     probably   said talliaferro .  he was losing some of his automatic respect for mandel and a sense of impatience was returning .  it was four in the morning  mandel or no .  he said   now what s all this about .     well  gentlemen   said mandel   there s more to villiers  death than the fact of death .  villiers  paper  the only copy of it as far as i know  was stuffed into the flash disposal unit and only scraps of it were left .  i ve never seen or read the paper  but i knew enough about the matter to be willing to swear in court if necessary that the remnants of unflashed paper in the disposal unit were of the paper he was planning to give at this convention .  you seem doubtful  dr .  ryger .    ryger smiled sourly .   doubtful that he was going to give it .  if you want my opinion  sir  he was mad .  for ten years he was a prisoner of earth and he fantasied mass transference as escape .  it was all that kept him alive probably .  he rigged up some sort of fraudulent demonstration .  i don t say it was deliberate fraud .  he was probably madly sincere  and sincerely mad .  last evening was the climax .  he came to our rooms   he hated us for having escaped earth   and triumphed over us .  it was what he had lived for for ten years .  it may have shocked him back to some form of sanity .  he knew he couldn t actually give the paper  there was nothing to give .  so he burned it and his heart gave out .  it is too bad .    mandel listened to the cerian astronomer  wearing a look of sharp disapproval .  he said   very glib  dr .  ryger  but quite wrong .  i am not so easily fooled by fraudulent demonstrations as you may believe .  now according to the registration data  which i have been forced to check rather hastily  you three were his classmates at college .  is that right .    they nodded .    are there any other classmates of your present at the convention .     no   said kaunas .   we were the only four qualifying for a doctorate in astronomy that year .  at least he would have qualified except          yes  i understand   said mandel .   well  then  in that case one of you three visited villiers in his room one last time at midnight .    there was a short silence .  then ryger said coldly   not i .   kaunas  eyes wide  shook his head .   talliaferro said   what are you implying .     one of you came to him at midnight and insisted on seeing his paper .  i don t know the motive .  conceivably it was with the deliberate intention of forcing him into heart failure .  when villiers collapsed  the criminal  if i may call him so  was ready .  he snatched the paper  which  i might add  probably was kept under his pillow  and scanned it .  then he destroyed the paper itself in the flash disposal  but he was in a hurry and destruction wasn t complete .    ryger interrupted .   how do you know all this  .  were you a witness .     almost   said mandel .   villiers was not quite dead at the moment of his first collapse .  when the criminal left  he managed to reach the phone and call my room .  he choked out a few phrases  enough to outline what had occurred .  unfortunately i was not in my room  a late conference kept me away .  however  my recording attachment taped it .  i always play the recording tape back whenever i return to my room or office .  bureaucratic habit .  i called back .  he was dead .     well  then   said ryger   who did he say did it .     he didn t .  or if he did  it was unintelligible .  but one word rang out clearly .  it was classmate .   talliaferro detached his scanner from its place in his inner jacket pocket and held it out toward mandel .  quietly he said   if you would like to develop the film in my scanner  you are welcome to do so .  you will not find villiers  paper there .    at once kaunas did the same  and ryger  with a scowl  joined .   mandel took all three scanners and said dryly   presumably  whichever one of you has done this has already disposed of the piece of exposed film with the paper on it .  however         talliaferro raised his eyebrows .   you may search my person or my room .    but ryger was still scowling .   now wait a minute  wait one bloody minute .  are you the police .    mandel stared at him .   do you want the police .  do you want a scandal and a murder charge .  do you want the convention disrupted and the system press making a holiday out of astronomy and astronomers  .  villiers  death might well have been accidental .  he did have a bad heart .  whichever one of you was there may well have acted on impulse .  it may not have been a premeditated crime .  if whoever it is will return the negative  we can avoid a great deal of trouble .     even for the criminal .   asked talliaferro .   mandel shrugged .  there may be trouble for him .  i will not promise immunity .  but whatever the trouble  it won t be public disgrace and life imprisonment  as it might be if the police are called in .    silence .   mandel said   it is one of you three .    silence .   mandel went on   i think i can see the original reasoning of the guilty person .  the paper would be destroyed .  only we four knew of the mass transference and only i had ever seen a demonstration .  moreover you had only his word  a madman s word perhaps  that i had seen it .  with villiers dead of heart failure and the paper gone  it would be easy to believe dr .  ryger s theory that there was no mass transference and never had been .  a year or two might pass and our criminal  in possession of the mass transference data  could reveal it little by little  rig experiments  publish careful papers  and end as the apparent discoverer with all that would imply in terms of money and renown .  even his own classmates would suspect nothing .  at most they would believe that the long past affair with villiers had inspired him to begin investigations in the field .  no more .    mandel looked sharply from one face to another   but none of that will work now .  any of the three of you who comes through with mass transference is proclaiming himself the criminal .  i ve seen the demonstration  i know it is legitimate  i know that one of you possesses a record of the paper .  the information is therefore useless to you .  give it up then .    silence .   mandel walked to the door and turned again .   i d appreciate it if you would stay here till i return .  i won t be long .  i hope the guilty one will use the interval to consider .  if he s afraid a confession will lose him his job  let him remember that a session with the police may lose him his liberty and cost him the psychoprobe .   he hefted the three scanners  looked grim and somewhat in need of sleep .   i ll develop these .    kaunas tried to smile .   what if we make a break for it while you re gone  .     only one of you has reason to try   said mandel .   i think i can rely on the two innocent ones to control the third  if only out of self protection .    he left .   it was five in the morning .  ryger looked at his watch indignantly .   a hell of a thing .  i want to sleep .     we can curl up here   said talliaferro philosophically .   is anyone planning a confession  .    kaunas looked away and ryger s lip lifted .    i didn t think so .   talliaferro closed his eyes  leaned his large head back against the chair  and said in a tired voice   back on the moon  they re in the slack season .  we ve got a two week night and then it s busy  busy .  then there s two weeks of sun and there s nothing but calculations  correlations  and bull sessions .  that s the hard time .  i hate it .  if there were more women  if i could arrange something permanent .  .  .    in a whisper  kaunas talked about the fact that it was still impossible to get the entire sun above the horizon and in view of the telescope on mercury .  but  with another two miles of track soon to be laid down for the observatory    move the whole thing  you know  tremendous forces involved  solar energy used directly   it might be managed .  it would be managed .   even ryger consented to talk of ceres after listening to the low murmur of the other voices .  there was the problem there of the two hour rotation period  which meant the stars whipped across the sky at an angular velocity twelve times that in earth s sky .  a net of three light scopes  three radioscopes  three of everything  caught the fields of study from one another as they whirled past .    could you use one of the poles .   asked kaunas .    you re thinking of mercury and the sun   said ryger  impatiently .   even at the poles the sky would still twist  and half of it would be forever hidden .  now if ceres showed only one face to the sun  the way mercury does  we could have a permanent night sky with the stars rotating slowly once in three years .    the sky lightened and it dawned slowly .   talliaferro was half asleep  but he kept hold of half consciousness firmly .  he would not fall asleep and leave the others awake .  each of the three  he thought  was wondering   who .  who .    except the guilty one  of course .   talliaferro s eyes snapped open as mandel entered again .  the sky  as seen from the window  had grown blue .  talliaferro was glad the window was closed .  the hotel was air conditioned  of course  but windows would be opened during the mild seasons of the year by those earthmen who fancied the illusion of fresh air .  talliaferro  with moon vacuum on his mind  shuddered at the thought with real discomfort .   mandel said   have any of you anything to say .    they looked at him steadily .  ryger shook his head .   mandel said   i have developed the film in your scanners  gentlemen  and viewed the results .   he tossed scanners and developed slivers of film on to the bed .   nothing .  you ll have trouble sorting out the film  i m afraid .  for that i m sorry .  and now there is still the question of the missing film .     if any   said ryger  and yawned prodigiously .   mandel said   i would suggest we come down to villiers  room  gentlemen .    kaunas looked startled .   why .    talliaferro said .   is this psychology  .  bring the criminal to the scene of the crime and remorse will wring a confession from him .    mandel said   a less melodramatic reason is that i would like to have the two of you who are innocent help me find the missing film of villiers  paper .     do you think it s there .   asked ryger challengingly .    possibly .  it s a beginning .  we can then search each of your rooms .  the symposium on astronautics doesn t start till tomorrow at    a . m .  we have till then .     and after that .     it may have to be the police .    they stepped gingerly into villiers  room .  ryger was red  kaunas pale .  talliaferro tried to remain calm .   last night they had seen it under artificial lighting with a scowling  disheveled villiers clutching his pillow  staring them down  ordering them away .  now there was the scentless odor of death about it .   mandel fiddled with the window polarizer to let more light in and adjusted it too far  so that the eastern sun slipped in .   kaunas threw his arm up to shade his eyes and screamed  the sun .   so that all the others froze .   kaunas  face had gone into a kind of terror  as though it were his mercurian sun that he had caught a blinding glimpse of .   talliaferro thought of his own reaction to the possibility of open air and his teeth gritted .  they were all bent crooked by their ten years away from earth .   kaunas ran to the window  fumbling for the polarizer  and then the breath came out of him in a huge gasp .   mandel stepped to his side .   what s wrong .   and the other two joined them .   the city lay stretched below them and outward to the horizon in broken stone and brick  bathed in the rising sun  with the shadowed portions toward them .  talliaferro cast it all a furtive and uneasy glance .   kaunas  his chest seemingly contracted past the point where he could cry out  stared at something much closer .  there  on the outer window sill  one corner secured hi a trifling imperfection  a crack in the cement  was an inch long strip of milky gray film  and on it were the early rays of the rising sun .   mandel  with an angry  incoherent cry  threw up the window and snatchedit away .  he shielded it in one cupped hand  staring out of hot and reddened eyes .   he said   wait here .    there was nothing to say .  when mandel left  they sat down and stared stupidly at one another .   mandel was back in twenty minutes .  he said quietly   in a voice that gave the impression  somehow  that it was quiet only because its owner had passed far beyond the raving stage   the corner in the crack wasn t overexposed .  i could make out a few words .  it is villiers  paper .  the rest is ruined  nothing can be salvaged .  it s gone .     what next .   said talliaferro .   mandel shrugged wearily .   right now  i don t care .  mass transference is gone until someone as brilliant as villiers works it out again .  i shall work on it  but i have no illusions as to my own capacity .  with it gone  i suppose you three don t matter  guilty or not .  what s the difference .   his whole body seemed to have loosened and sunk into despair .   but talliaferro s voice grew hard .   now  hold on .  in your eyes  any of the three of us might be guilty .  i  for instance .  you are a big man in the field and you will never have a good word to say for me .  the general idea may arise that i am incompetent or worse .  i will not be ruined by the shadow of guilt .  now let s solve this thing .     i am no detective   said mandel wearily .   then why don t you call in the police  damn it .    ryger said   wait awhile  tal .  are you implying that i m guilty .     i m only saying that i m innocent .    kaunas raised his voice in fright .   it will mean the psychoprobe for each of us .  there may be mental damage         mandel raised both arms high in the air .   gentlemen .  gentlemen .  please .  there is one thing we might do short of the police  and you are right  dr .  talliaferro  it would be unfair to the innocent to leave this matter here .    they turned to him in various stages of hostility .  ryger said   what do you suggest .     i have a friend named wendell urth .  you may have heard of him  or you may not  but perhaps i can arrange to see him tonight .     what if we can .   demanded talliaferro .   where does that get us .     he s an odd man   said mandel hesitantly .   very odd .  and very brilliant in his way .  he has helped the police before this and he may be able to help us now .    edward talliaferro could not forbear staring at the room and its occupant with the greatest astonishment .  it and he seemed to exist in isolation  and to be part of no recognizable world .  the sounds of earth were absent in this well padded  windowless nest .  the light and air of earth had been blanked out in artificial illumination and conditioning .   it was a large room  dim and cluttered .  they had picked their way across a littered floor to a couch from which book films had been brusquely cleared and dumped to one side in an amorphous tangle .   the man who owned the room had a large round face on a stumpy round body .  he moved quickly about on his short legs  jerking his head as he spoke until his thick glasses all but bounced off the thoroughly inconspicuous nubbin that served in the office of a nose .  his thick lidded  somewhat protuberant eyes gleamed in myopic good nature at them all  as he seated himself in his own chair desk combination  lit directly by the one bright light in the room .    so good of you to come  gentlemen .  pray excuse the condition of my room .   he waved stubby fingers in a wide sweeping gesture .   i am engaged in cataloguing the many objects of extraterrological interest i have accumulated .  it is a tremendous job .  for instance         he dodged out of his seat and burrowed in a heap of objects beside the desk till he came up with a smoky gray object  semi translucent and roughly cylindrical .   this   he said   is a callistan object that may be a relic of intelligent nonhuman entities .  it is not decided .  no more than a dozen have been discovered and that is the most perfect single specimen i know of .    he tossed it to one side and talliaferro jumped .  the plump man stared in his direction and said   it s not breakable .   he sat down again  clasped his pudgy fingers tightly over his abdomen and let them pump slowly in and out as he breathed .   and now what can i do for you  .    hubert mandel had carried through the introductions and talliaferro was considering deeply .  surely it was a man named wendell urth who had written a recent book entitled comparative evolutionary processes on water oxygen planets  and surely this could not be the man .   he said   are you the author of comparative evolutionary processes  dr .  urth .    a beatific smile spread across urth s face .   you ve read it .     well  no  i haven t  but         urth s expression grew instantly censorious .  then you should .  right now .  here  i have a copy .    he bounced out of his chair again and mandel cried   now wait  urth  first things first .  this is serious .    he virtually forced urth back into his chair and began speaking rapidly as though to prevent any further side issues from erupting .  he told the whole story with admirable word economy .   urth reddened slowly as he listened .  he seized his glasses and shoved them higher up on his nose .   mass transference .   he cried .    i saw it with my own eyes   said mandel .    and you never told me .     i was sworn to secrecy .  the man was  .  .  .  peculiar .  i explained that .    urth pounded the desk .   how could you allow such a discovery to remain the property of an eccentric  mandel .  the knowledge should have been forced from him by psychoprobe  if necessary .     it would have killed him   protested mandel .   but urth was rocking back and forth with his hands clasped tightly to his cheeks .   mass transference .  the only way a decent  civilized man could travel .  the only possible way .  the only conceivable way .  if i had known .  if i could have been there .  but the hotel is nearly thirty miles away .    ryger  who listened with an expression of annoyance on his face  interposed   i understand there s a flitter line direct to convention hall .  it could have got you there in ten minutes .    urth stiffened and looked at ryger strangely .  his cheeks bulged .  he jumped to his feet and scurried out of the room .   ryger said   what the devil .    mandel muttered   damn it  i should have warned you .     about what .     dr .  urth doesn t travel on any sort of conveyance .  it s a phobia .  he moves about only on foot .    kaunas blinked about in the dimness .   but he s an extraterrologist  isn t he .  an expert on life forms of other planets .    talliaferro had risen and now stood before a galactic lens on a pedestal .  he stared at the inner gleam of the star systems .  he had never seen a lens so large or so elaborate .   mandel said   he s an extraterrologist  yes  but he s never visited any of the planets on which he is expert and he never will .  in thirty years  he s never been more than a few miles from this room .    ryger laughed .   mandel flushed angrily .   you may find it funny  but i d appreciate your being careful what you say when dr .  urth comes back .    urth sidled in a moment later .   my apologies  gentlemen   he said in a whisper .   and now let us approach our problem .  perhaps one of you wishes to confess  .    talliaferro s lips quirked sourly .  this plump  self imprisoned extraterrologist was scarcely formidable enough to force a confession from anyone .  fortunately there would be no need of him .   talliaferro said   dr .  urth  are you connected with the police .    a certain smugness seemed to suffuse urth s ruddy face .   i have no official connection  dr .  talliaferro  but my unofficial relationships are very good indeed .     in that case  i will give you some information which you can carry to the police .    urth drew in his abdomen and hitched at his shirttail .  it came free and slowly he polished his glasses with it .  when he was quite through and had perched them precariously on his nose once more  he said   and what is that  .     i will tell you who was present when villiers died and who scanned his paper .     you have solved the mystery  .     i ve thought about it all day .  i think i ve solved it .   talliaferro rather enjoyed the sensation he was creating .    well  then .    talliaferro took a deep breath .  this was not going to be easy to do  though he had been planning it for hours .  the guilty man   he said   is obviously dr .  hubert mandel .    mandel stared at talliaferro in sudden  hard breathing indignation .   look here  doctor   he began loudly   if you have any basis         urth s tenor voice soared above the interruption .   let him talk  hubert  let us hear him .  you suspected him and there is no law that forbids him to suspect you .    mandel fell angrily silent .   talliaferro  not allowing his voice to falter  said   it is more than just suspicion .  dr .  urth .  the evidence is perfectly plain .  four of us knew about mass transference  but only one of us .  dr .  mandel  had actually seen a demonstration .  he knew it to be a fact .  he knew a paper on the subject existed .  we three knew only that villiers was more or less unbalanced .  oh  we might have thought there was just a chance .  we visited him at eleven  i think  just to check on that  though none of us actually said so  but he only acted crazier than ever .    check special knowledge and motive then on dr .  mandel s side .  now  dr .  urth  picture something else .  whoever it was who confronted villiers at midnight  saw him collapse  and scanned his paper  let s keep him anonymous for a moment  must have been terribly startled to see villiers apparently come to life again and to hear him talking into the telephone .  our criminal  in the panic of the moment  realized one thing  he must get rid of the one piece of incriminating material evidence .    he had to get rid of the undeveloped film of the paper and he had to do it in such a way that it would be safe from discovery so that he might pick it up once more if he remained unsuspected .  the outer window sill was ideal .  quickly he threw up villiers  window  placed the strip of film outside  and left .  now  even if villiers survived or if his telephoning brought results  it would be merely villiers  word against his own and it would be easy to show that villiers was unbalanced .    talliaferro paused in something like triumph .  this would be irrefutable .   wendell urth blinked at him and wiggled the thumbs of his clasped hands so that they slapped against his ample shirt front .  he said   and the significance of all that .    the significance is that the window was thrown open and the film placed in open air .  now ryger has lived for ten years on ceres  kaunas on mercury  i on the moon   barring short leaves and not many of them .  we commented to one another several times yesterday on the difficulty of growing acclimated to earth .    our work worlds are each airless objects .  we never go out in the open without a suit .  to expose ourselves to unenclosed space is unthinkable .  none of us could have opened the window without a severe inner struggle .  dr .  mandel  however  has lived on earth exclusively .  opening a window to him is only a matter of a bit of muscular exertion .  he could do it .  we couldn t .  ergo  he did it .    talliaferro sat back and smiled a bit .    space  that s it .   cried ryger with enthusiasm .   that s not it at all   roared mandel  half rising as though tempted to throw himself at talliaferro .   i deny the whole miserable fabrication .  what about the record i have of villiers  phone call  .  he used the word classmate .  the entire tape makes it obvious          he was a dying man   said talliaferro .   much of what he said you admitted was incomprehensible .  i ask you  dr .  mandel  without having heard the tape  if it isn t true that villiers  voice is distorted past recognition .     well        said mandel confused .    i m sure it is .  there is no reason to suppose  then  that you might not have rigged up the tape in advance  complete with the damning word classmate .   mandel said   good lord  how would i know there were classmates at the convention .  how would i know they knew about the mass tranference .     villiers might have told you .  i presume he did .     now  look   said mandel   you three saw villiers alive at eleven .  the medical examiner  seeing villiers  body shortly after   a . m .   declared he had been dead at least two hours .  that was certain .  the time of death therefore  was between ii p . m .  and i a . m .  i was at a late conference last night .  i can prove my whereabouts  miles from the hotel  between ten and two  by a dozen witnesses  no one of whom anyone can possibly question .  is that enough for you .    talliaferro paused a moment .  then he went on stubbornly   even so .  suppose you got back to the hotel by two thirty .  you went to villiers  room to discuss his talk .  you found the door open  or you had a duplicate key .  anyway  you found him dead .  you seized the opportunity to scan the paper          and if he were already dead  and couldn t make phone calls  why should i hide the film  .    to remove suspicion .  you may have a second copy of the film safe in your possession .  for that matter  we have only your own word that the paper itself was destroyed .     enough .  enough .   cried urth .   it is an interesting hypothesis .  dr .  talliaferro  but it falls to the ground of its own weight .    talliaferro frowned .  that s your opinion  perhaps          it would be anyone s opinion .  anyone  that is  with the power of human thought .  don t you see that hubert mandel did too much to be the criminal  .      no   said talliaferro .   wendell urth smiled benignly .   as a scientist .  dr .  talliaferro  you undoubtedly know better than to fall in love with your own theories to the exclusion of facts or reasoning .  do me the pleasure of behaving similarly as a detective .    consider that if dr .  mandel had brought about the death of villiers and faked an alibi  or if he had found villiers dead and taken advantage of that  how little he would really have had to do .  why scan the paper or even pretend that anyone had done so .  he could simply have taken the paper .  who else knew of its existence  .  nobody  really .  there was no reason to think villiers told anyone else about it .  villiers was pathologically secretive .  there would have been every reason to think that he told no one .    no one knew villiers was giving a talk  except dr .  man del .  it wasn t announced .  no abstract was published .  dr .  mandel could have walked off with the paper in perfect confidence .    even if he had discovered that villiers had talked to his classmates about the matter  what of it .  what evidence would his classmates have except the word of one whom they are themselves willing to consider a madman  .    by announcing instead that villiers  paper had been destroyed  by declaring his death to be not entirely natural  by searching for a scanned copy of the film   in short by everything dr .  mandel has done  he has aroused a suspicion that only he could possibly have aroused when he need only have remained quiet to have committed a perfect crime .  if he were the criminal  he would be more stupid  more colossally obtuse than anyone i have ever known .  and dr .  mandel  after all  is none of that .    talliaferro thought hard but found nothing to say .   ryger said  then who did it .     one of you three .  that s obvious .     but which .     oh  that s obvious too .  i knew which of you was guilty the moment dr .  mandel had completed his description of events .    talliaferro stared at the plump extraterrologist with distaste .  the bluff did not frighten him  but it was affecting the other two .  ryger s lips were thrust out and kaunas  lower jaw had relaxed moronically .  they looked like fish  both of them .   he said   which one  then .  tell us .    urth blinked .   first  i want to make it perfectly plain that the important thing is mass transference .  it can still be recovered .    mandel  scowling still  said querulously   what the devil are you talking about  urth .    the man who scanned the paper probably looked at what he was scanning .  i doubt that he had the time or the presence of mind to read it  and if he did  i doubt if he could remember it  .  .  .  consciously .  however  there is the psycho probe .  if he so much as glanced at the paper  what impinged on his retina could be probed .    there was an uneasy stir .   urth said at once   no need to be afraid of the psycho probe .  proper handling is safe  particularly if a man offers himself voluntarily .  when damage is done  it is usually because of unnecessary resistance  a kind of mental tearing  you know .  so if the guilty man will voluntarily confess  place himself in my hands         talliaferro laughed .  the sudden noise rang out sharply in the dim quiet of the room .  the psychology was so transparent and artless .   wendell urth looked almost bewildered at the reaction and stared earnestly at talliaferro over his glasses .  he said   i have enough influence with the police to keep the probing  entirely confidential .    ryger said savagely   i didn t do it .    kaunas shook his head .   talliaferro disdained any answer .   urth sighed .   then i shall have to point out the guilty man .  it will be traumatic .  it will make things harder .   he tightened the grip on his belly and his fingers twitched .   dr .  talliaferro indicated that the film was hidden on the outer window sill so that it might remain safe from discovery and from harm .  i agree with him .     thank you   said talliaferro dryly .    however  why should anyone think that an outer window sill is a particularly safe hiding place .  the police would certainly look there .    even in the absence of the police it was discovered .  who would tend to consider anything outside a building as particularly safe .  obviously some person who has lived a long time on an airless world has had it drilled into him that no one goes outside an enclosed place without detailed precautions .   to someone on the moon  for instance  anything hidden outside a lunar dome would be comparatively safe .  men venture out only rarely and then only on specific business .  so he would overcome the hardship of opening a window and exposing himself to what he would subconsciously consider a vacuum for the sake of a safe hiding place .  the reflex thought  outside an inhabited structure is safe  would do the trick .    talliaferro said between clenched teeth   why do you mention the moon  dr .  urth  .    urth said blandly   only as an example .  what i ve said so far applies to all three of you .  but now comes the crucial point  the matter of the dying night .    talliaferro frowned .   you mean the night villiers died .     i mean any night .  see here  even granted that an outer window sill was a safe hiding place  which of you would be mad enough to consider it a safe hiding place for a piece of unexposed film  .  scanner film isn t very sensitive  to be sure  and is made to be developed under all sorts of hit and miss conditions .  diffuse nighttime illumination wouldn t seriously affect it  but diffuse daylight would ruin it in a few minutes  and direct sunlight would ruin it at once .  everyone knows that .    mandel said   go ahead  urth .  what is this leading to .     you re trying to rush me   said urth  with a massive pout .   i want you to see this clearly .  the criminal wanted  above all  to keep the film safe .  it was his only record of something of supreme value to himself and to the world .  why would he put it where it would inevitably be ruined almost immediately by the morning sun .  only because he did not expect the morning sun ever to come .  he thought the night  so to speak  was immortal .    but nights aren t immortal .  on earth they die and give way to daytime .  even the six month polar night is a dying night eventually .  the nights on ceres last only two hours  the nights on the moon last two weeks .  they are dying nights too  and drs .  talliaferro and ryger know that day must always come .    kaunas rose .   but wait         wendell urth faced him full .   no longer any need to wait  dr .  kaunas .  mercury is the only sizable object in the solar system that turns only one face to the sun .  even taking libration into account  fully three eights of its surface is true dark side and never sees the sun .  the polar observatory is at the rim of that dark side .  for ten years you have grown used to the fact that nights are immortal  that a surface in darkness remains eternally in darkness  and so you entrusted unexposed film to earth s night  forgetting in your excitement that nights must die         kaunas came forward .   wait         urth was inexorable .   i am told that when mandel adjusted the polarizer in villiers  room  you screamed at the sunlight .  was that your ingrained fear of the mercurian sun  or your sudden realization of what sunlight meant to your plans .  you rushed forward .  was that to adjust the polarizer  or to stare at the ruined film  .    kaunas fell to his knees .   i didn t mean it .  i wanted to speak to him  only to speak to him  and he screamed and collapsed .  i thought he was dead and the paper was under his pillow and it all just followed .  one thing led on to another and before i knew it i couldn t get out of it anymore .  but i meant none of it .  i swear it .    they had formed a semicircle about him and wendell urth stared at the moaning kaunas with pity in his eyes .   an ambulance had come and gone .  talliaferro finally brought himself to say stiffly to mandel   i hope  sir  there will be no hard feelings for anything said here .    and mandel had answered as stiffly   i think we had all better forget as much as possible of what has happened during the last twenty four hours .    they were standing in the doorway  ready to leave  and wendell urth ducked his smiling head and said   there s the question of my fee  you know .    mandell looked at him with a startled expression .    not money   said urth at once .   but when the first mass transference setup for humans is established  i want a trip arranged for me right away .    mandel continued to look anxious .   now  wait .  trips through outer space are a long way off .    urth shook his head rapidly .   not outer space .  not at all .  i would like to step across to lower falls  new hampshire .     all right .  but why .    urth looked up .  to talliaferro s outright surprise  the extraterrologist s face wore an expression compounded equally of shyness and eagerness .   urth said   i once   quite a long time ago   knew a girl there .  it s been many years   but i sometimes wonder .  .  .    afterword  some readers may realize that this story  first published in       has been overtaken by events .  in       astronomers discovered that mercury does not keep one side always to the sun  but has a period of rotation of about fifty four days  so that all parts of it are exposed to sunlight at one time or another .  well  what can i do except say that i wish astronomers would get things right to begin with .  and i certainly refuse to change the story to suit their whims .   foreword  this item is not strictly a mystery in the usual sense of the word  or even a story in the usual sense of the word .  i don t know how to describe it  except perhaps as a good natured satire on scientific research .  i received more mail alter its publication than alter any other item of comparable length .  a particularly pleasant memory is that of receiving a telephone call from a man who spoke with a strong central european accent .  he said be was in boston for a convention and wanted to thank me lor the pleasure  pate de foie gras  had given him  since it so amusingly and effectively poked knowledgeable fun at science .  i tried to get his name  but he wouldn t give it to me .  he was afraid  i suspect  that his reputation might suffer if it were found he read science fiction .  if he is secretly reading this book and recognizes himself  i would like to assure him that he has plenty of company and can take off that plain wrapper .  honest .       pate de foie gras  i couldn t tell you my real name if i wanted to  and  under the circumstances  i don t want to .   i m not much of a writer myself  so i m having isaac asimov write this up for me .  i ve picked him for several reasons .  first  he s a biochemist  so he understands what i tell him  some of it  anyway .  secondly  he can write  or at least he has published considerable fiction  which may not  of course  be the same thing .   i was not the first person to have the honor of meeting the goose .  that belongs to a texas cotton farmer named ian angus macgregor  who owned it before it became government property .   by summer of      he had sent an even dozen of letters to the department of agriculture requesting information on the hatching of goose eggs .  the department sent him all the booklets on hand that were anywhere near the subject  but his letters simply got more impassioned and freer in their references to his  friend   the local congressman .   my connection with this is that i am in the employ of the department of agriculture .  since i was attending a convention at san antonio in july of       my boss asked me to stop off at macgregor s place and see what i could do to help him .  we re servants of the public and besides we had finally received a letter from macgregor s congressman .   on july          i met the goose .   i met macgregor first .  he was in his fifties  a tall man with a lined face full of suspicion .  i went over all the information he had been given  then asked politely if i might see his geese .   he said   its not geese  mister  it s one goose .    i said   may i see the one goose .     rather not .     well  then  i can t help you any further .  if it s only one goose  then there s just something wrong with it .  why worry about one goose .  eat it .    i got up and reached for my hat .   he said   wait .   and i stood there while his lips tightened and his eyes wrinkled and he had a quiet fight with himself .   come with me .    i went out with him to a pen near the house  surrounded by barbed wire  and a locked gate to it  and holding one goose   the goose .   that s the goose   he said .  the way he said it  i could hear the capitals .   i stared at it .  it looked like any other goose  fat  self satisfied  and short tempered .   macgregor said   and here s one of its eggs .  it s been in the incubator .  nothing happens .   he produced it from a capacious overall pocket .  there was a queer strain about his manner of holding it .   i frowned .  there was something wrong with the egg .  it was smaller and more spherical than normal .   macgregor said  take it .    i reached out and took it .  or tried to .  i gave it the amount of heft an egg like that ought to deserve and it just sat where it was .  i had to try harder and then up it came .   now i knew what was queer about the way macgregor held it .  it weighed nearly two pounds .   i stared at it as it lay there  pressing down the palm of my hand  and macgregor grinned sourly .   drop it   he said .   i just looked at him  so he took it out of my hand and dropped it himself .   it hit soggy .  it didn t smash .  there was no spray of white and yolk .  it just lay where it fell with the bottom caved in .   i picked it up again .  the white eggshell had shattered where the egg had struck .  pieces of it had naked away and what shone through was a dull yellow in color .  my hands trembled .  it was all i could do to make my fingers work  but i got some of the rest of the shell flaked away  and stared at the yellow .   i didn t have to run any analyses .  my heart told me .   i was face to face with the goose .   the goose that laid the golden eggs .  my first problem was to get macgregor to give up that golden egg .  i was almost hysterical about it .   i said   i ll give you a receipt .  i ll guarantee you payment .  i ll do anything in reason .     i don t want the government butting in   he said stubbornly .   but i was twice as stubborn and in the end i signed a receipt and he dogged me out to my car and stood in the road as i drove away  following me with his eyes .   the head of my section at the department of agriculture is louis p .  bronstein .  he and i are on good terms and i felt i could explain things without being placed under immediate observation .  even so  i took no chances .  i had the egg with me and when i got to the tricky part  i just laid it on the desk between us .   i said   it s a yellow metal and it could be brass only it isn t because it s inert to concentrated nitric acid .    bronstein said   it s some sort of hoax .  it must be .     a hoax that uses real gold  .  remember  when i first saw this thing  it was covered completely with authentic unbroken eggshell .  it s been easy to check a piece of the egg shell .  calcium carbonate .    project goose was started .  that was july          .   i was the responsible investigator to begin with and remained in titular charge throughout .   though matters quickly got beyond me .   we began with the one egg .  its average radius was    millimeters  major axis     millimeters  minor axis     millimeters  .  the gold shell was   .    millimeters in thickness .  studying other eggs later on  we found this value to be rather high .  the average thickness turned out to be   .   millimeters .   inside was egg .  it looked like egg and it smelled like egg .   aliquots were analyzed and the organic constituents were reasonably normal .  the white was   .   per cent albumin .  the yolk had the normal complement of vitellin  cholesterol  phospholipid  and carotenoid .  we lacked enough material to test for trace constituents  but later on with more eggs at our disposal we did and nothing unusual showed up as far as contents of vitamins  coenzymes  nucleotides  sulfhydryl groups  et cetera  et cetera were concerned .   one important gross abnormality that showed was the egg s behavior on heating .  a small portion of the yolk  heated   hard boiled  almost at once .  we fed a portion of the hard boiled egg to a mouse .  it survived .   i nibbled at another bit of it .  too small a quantity to taste  really  but it made me sick .  purely psychosomatic  i m sure .   boris w .  finley  of the department of biochemistry of temple university   a department consultant   supervised these tests .   he said  referring to the hard boiling  the ease with which the egg proteins are heat denatured indicates a partial denaturation to begin with and  considering the nature of the shell  the obvious guilt would lie at the door of heavy metal contamination .    so a portion of the yolk was analyzed for inorganic constituents  and it was found to be high in chloraurate ion  which is a singly charged ion containing an atom of gold and four of chlorine  the symbol for which is aucl   .   the  au  symbol for gold comes from the fact that the latin word for gold is  aurum .    when i say the chloraurate ion content was high  i mean it was   .   parts per thousand  or   .    per cent .  that s high enough to form insoluble complexes of  gold protein  which would coagulate easily .   finley said   it s obvious this egg cannot hatch .  nor can any other such egg .  it is heavy metal poisoned .  gold may be more glamorous than lead but it is just as poisonous to proteins .    i agreed gloomily .   at least it s safe from decay  too .     quite right .  no self respecting bug would live in this chlorauriferous soup .    the final spectrographic analysis of the gold of the shell came in .  virtually pure .  the only detectable impurity was iron which amounted to      per cent of the whole .  the iron content of the egg yolk had been twice normal  also .  at the moment  however  the matter of the iron was neglected .   one week after project goose was begun  an expedition was sent into texas .  five biochemists went   the accent was still on biochemistry  you see   along with three truckloads of equipment  and a squadron of army personnel .  i went along too  of course .   as soon as we arrived  we cut macgregor s farm off from the world .   that was a lucky thing  you know   the security measures we took right from the start .  the reasoning was wrong  at first  but the results were good .   the department wanted project goose kept quiet at the start simply because there was always the thought that this might still be an elaborate hoax and we couldn t risk the bad publicity if it were .  and if it weren t a hoax  we couldn t risk the newspaper hounding that would definitely result over any goose and golden egg story .   it was only well after the start of project goose  well after our arrival at macgregor s farm  that the real implications of the matter became clear .   naturally macgregor didn t like the men and equipment settling down all about him .  he didn t like being told the goose was government property .  he didn t like having his eggs impounded .   he didn t like it but he agreed to it   if you can call it agreeing when negotiations are being carried on while a machine gun is being assembled in a man s barnyard and ten men  with bayonets fixed  are marching past while the arguing is going on .   he was compensated  of course .  what s money to the government .   the goose didn t like a few things  either   like having blood samples taken .  we didn t dare anesthetize it for fear of doing anything to alter its metabolism  and it took two men to hold it each time .  ever try to hold an angry goose  .   the goose was put under a twenty four hour guard with the threat of summary court martial to any man who let anything happen to it .  if any of those soldiers read this article  they may get a sudden glimmer of what was going on .  if so  they will probably have the sense to keep shut about it .  at least  if they know what s good for them  they will .   the blood of the goose was put through every test conceivable .   it carried   parts per hundred thousand        per cent  of chloraurate ion .  blood taken from the hepatic vein was richer than the rest  almost   parts per hundred thousand .   finley grunted .   the liver   he said .   we took x rays .  on the x ray negative  the liver was a cloudy mass of light gray  lighter than the viscera in its neighborhood  because it stopped more of the x rays  because it contained more gold .  the blood vessels showed up lighter than the liver proper and the ovaries were pure white .  no x rays got through the ovaries at all .   it made sense  and in an early report finley stated it as bluntly as possible .  paraphrasing the report  it went  in part   the chloraurate ion is secreted by the liver into the blood stream .  the ovaries act as a trap for the ion  which is there reduced to metallic gold and deposited as a shell about the developing egg .  relatively high concentrations of unreduced chloraurate ion penetrate the contents of the developing egg .    there is little doubt that the goose finds this process useful as a means of getting rid of the gold atoms which  if allowed to accumulate  would undoubtedly poison it .  excretion by eggshell may be novel in the animal kingdom  even unique  but there is no denying that it is keeping the goose alive .    unfortunately  however  the ovary is being locally poisoned to such an extent that few eggs are laid  probably not more than will suffice to get rid of the accumulating gold  and those few eggs are definitely unhatchable .    that was all he said in writing  but to the rest of us  he said .  that leaves one peculiarly embarrassing question .    i knew what it was .  we all did .   where was the gold coming from  .   no answer to that for a while  except for some negative evidence .  there was no perceptible gold in the goose s feed  nor were there any gold bearing pebbles about that it might have swallowed .  there was no trace of gold anywhere in the soil of the area and a search of the house and grounds revealed nothing .  there were no gold coins  gold jewelry  gold plate  gold watches  or gold anything .  no one on the farm even had as much as gold fillings in his teeth .   there was mrs .  macgregor s wedding ring  of course  but she had only had one in her life and she was wearing it .   so where was the gold coming from  .   the beginnings of the answer came on august          .   albert nevis  of purdue  was forcing gastric tubes into the goose   another procedure to which the bird objected strenuously   with the idea of testing the contents of its alimentary canal .  it was one of our routine searches for exogenous gold .   gold was found  but only in traces  and there was every reason to suppose those traces had accompanied the digestive secretions and were  therefore  endogenous   from within  that is   in origin .   however  something else showed up  or the lack of it  anyway .   i was there when nevis came into finley s office in the temporary building we had put up overnight   almost   near the goosepen .   nevis said .  the goose is low in bile pigment .  duodenal contents show about none .    finley frowned and said   liver function is probably knocked loop the loop because of its gold concentration .  it probably isn t secreting bile at all .     it is secreting bile   said nevis .   bile acids are present in normal quantity .  near normal  anyway .  it s just the bile pigments that are missing .  i did a fecal analysis and that was confirmed .  no bile pigments .    let me explain something at this point .  bile acids are steroids secreted by the liver into the bile and via that are poured into the upper end of the small intestine .  these bile acids are detergentlike molecules which help to emulsify the fat in our diet   or the goose s   and distribute them in the form of tiny bubbles through the watery intestinal contents .  this distribution  or homogenization  if you d rather  makes it easier for the fat to be digested .   bile pigments  the substances that were missing in the goose  are something entirely different .  the liver makes them out of hemoglobin  the red oxygen carrying protein of the blood .  worn out hemoglobin is broken up in the liver  the heme part being split away .  the heme is made up of a squarish molecule   called a porphyrin   with an iron atom in the center .  the liver takes the iron out and stores it for future use  then breaks the squarish molecule that is left .  this broken porphyrin is bile pigment .  it is colored brownish or greenish   depending on further chemical changes  and is secreted into the bile .   the bile pigments are of no use to the body .  they are poured into the bile as waste products .  they pass through the intestines and come out with the feces .  in fact  the bile pigments are responsible for the color of the feces .   finley s eyes began to glitter .   nevis said   it looks as though porphyrin catabolism isn t following the proper course in the liver doesn t it to you .    it surely did .  to me too .   there was tremendous excitement after that .  this was the first metabolic abnormality  not directly involving gold  that had been found in the goose .   we took a liver biopsy  which means we punched a cylindrical sliver out of the goose reaching down into the liver  .  it hurt the goose but didn t harm it .  we took more blood samples  too .   this time we isolated hemoglobin from the blood and small quantities of the cytochromes from our liver samples .   the cytochromes are oxidizing enzymes that also contain heme .   we separated out the heme and in acid solution some of it precipitated in the form of a brilliant orange substance .  by august           we had   micrograms of the compound .   the orange compound was similar to heme  but it was not heme .  the iron in heme can be in the form of a double charged ferrous ion  fe    or a triply charged ferric ion  fe      in which latter case  the compound is called he matin .   ferrous and ferric  by the way  come from the latin word for iron  which is  ferrum .    the orange compound we had separated from heme had the porphyrin portion of the molecule all right  but the metal in the center was gold  to be specific  a triply charged auric ion  au     .  we called this compound  aureme   which is simply short for  auric heme .    aureme was the first naturally occurring gold containing organic compound ever discovered .  ordinarily it would rate headline news in the world of biochemistry .  but now it was nothing  nothing at all in comparison to the further horizons its mere existence opened up .   the liver  it seemed  was not breaking up the heme to bile pigment .  instead it was converting it to aureme  it was replacing iron with gold .  the aureme  in equilibrium with chloraurate ion  entered the blood stream and was carried to the ovaries  where the gold was separated out and the porphyrin portion of the molecule disposed of by some as yet unidentified mechanism .   further analyses showed that    per cent of the gold in the blood of the goose was carried in the plasma in the form of chloraurate ion .  the remaining    per cent was carried in the red blood corpuscles in the form of  auremo globin .   an attempt was made to feed the goose traces of radioactive gold so that we could pick up radioactivity in plasma and corpuscles and see how readily the auremo globin molecules were handled in the ovaries .  it seemed to us the auremoglobin should be much more slowly disposed of than the dissolved chloraurate ion in the plasma .   the experiment failed  however  since we detected no radioactivity .  we put it down to inexperience since none of us were isotopes men  which was too bad since the failure was highly significant  really  and by not realizing it we lost several weeks .   the auremoglobin was  of course  useless as far as carrying oxygen was concerned  but it only made up about   .   per cent of the total hemoglobin of the red blood cells so there was no interference with the respiration of the goose .   this still left us with the question of where the gold came from and it was nevis who first made the crucial suggestion .    maybe   he said at a meeting of the group held on the evening of august           the goose doesn t replace the iron with gold .  maybe it changes the iron to gold .    before i met nevis personally that summer  i had known him through his publications   his field is bile chemistry and liver function   and had always considered him a cautious  clear thinking person .  almost overcautious .  one wouldn t consider him capable for a minute of making any such completely ridiculous statement .   it just shows the desperation and demoralization involved in project goose .   the desperation was the fact that there was nowhere  literally nowhere  that the gold could come from .  the goose was excreting gold at the rate of      grams a day and had been doing it over a period of months .  that gold had to come from somewhere and  failing that   absolutely failing that    it had to be made from something .   the demoralization that led us to consider the second alternative was due to the mere fact that we were face to face with the goose that laid the golden eggs  the undeniable goose .  with that  everything became possible .  all of us were living in a fairy tale world and all of us reacted to it by losing all sense of reality .   finley considered the possibility seriously .   hemoglobin   he said   enters the liver and a bit of auremoglobin comes out .  the gold shell of the eggs has iron as its only impurity .  the egg yolk is high in only two things  in gold  of course  and also  somewhat  in iron .  it all makes a horrible kind of distorted sense .  we re going to need help  men .    we did  and it meant a third stage of the investigation .  the first stage had consisted of myself alone .  the second was the biochemical task force .  the third  the greatest  the most important of all  involved the invasion of the nuclear physicists .   on september          john l .  billings of the university of california arrived .  he had some equipment with him and more arrived in the following weeks .  more temporary structures were going up .  i could see that within a year we would have a whole research institution built about the goose .   billings joined our conference the evening of the fifth .   finley brought him up to date and said   there are a great many serious problems involved in this iron to gold idea .  for one thing  the total quantity of iron in the goose can only be of the order of half a gram  yet nearly forty grams of gold a day are being manufactured .    billings had a clear  high pitched voice .  he said  there s a worseproblem than that  iron is about at the the bottom of the packing fraction curve .  gold is much higher up .  to convert a gram of iron to a gram of gold takes just about as much energy as is produced by the fissioning of one gram of u     .    finley shrugged .   i ll leave the problem to you .    billings said   let me think about it .    he did more than think .  one of the things done was to isolate fresh samples of heme from the goose  ash it and send the iron oxide to brookhaven for isotopic analysis .  there was no particular reason to do that particular thing .  it was just one of a number of individual investigations  but it was the one that brought results .   when the figures came back  billings choked on them .  he said  there s no fe   .     what about the other isotopes .   asked finley at once .    all present   said billings   in the appropriate relative ratios  but no detectable fe   .    i ll have to explain again  iron  as it occurs naturally  is made up of four different isotopes .  these isotopes are varieties of atoms that differ from one another in atomic weight .  iron atoms with an atomic weight of     or fe    makes up    .   per cent of all the atoms in iron .  the other atoms have atomic weights of         and    .   the iron from the heme of the goose was made up only of fe    fe    and fe   .  the implication was obvious .  fe   was disappearing while the other isotopes weren t and this meant a nuclear reaction was taking place .  a nuclear reaction could take one isotope and leave others be .  an ordinary chemical reaction any chemical reaction at all  would have to dispose of all isotopes just about equally .    but it s energically impossible   said finley .   he was only saying that in mild sarcasm with billings  initial remark in mind .  as biochemists  we knew well enough that many reactions went on in the body which required an input of energy and that this was taken care of by coupling the energy demanding reaction with an energy producing reaction .   however  chemical reactions gave off or took up a few kilo calories per mole .  nuclear reactions gave off or took up millions .  to supply energy for an energy demanding nuclear reaction required  therefore  a second  and energy producing  nuclear reaction .   we didn t see billings for two days .   when he did come back  it was to say   see here .  the energy producing reaction must produce just as much energy per nucleon involved as the energy demanding reaction uses up .  if it produces even slightly less  then the overall reaction won t go .  if it produces even slightly more  then considering the astronomical number of nucleons in voided  the excess energy produced would vaporize the goose in a fraction of a second .     so .   said finley .    so the number of reactions possible is very limited .  i have been able to find only one plausible system .  oxygen   i   if converted to iron     will produce enough energy to drive the iron    on to gold     .  it s like going down one side of a roller coaster and then up the other .  we ll have to test this .     how .     first  suppose we check the isotopic composition of the oxygen in the goose .    oxygen is made up of three stable isotopes  almost all of it o   o   makes up only one oxygen atom out of     .   another blood sample .  the water content was distilled off in vacuum and some of it put through a mass spectograph .  there was o   there but only one oxygen atom out of      .  fully    per cent of the o   we expected wasn t there .   billings said  that s corroborative evidence .  oxygen    is being used up .  it is being supplied constantly in the food and water fed to the goose  but it is still being used up .  gold     is being produced .  iron    is one intermediate and since the reaction that uses up iron    is faster than the one that produces it  it has no chance to reach significant concentration and isotopic analysis shows its absence .    we weren t satisfied  so we tried again .  we kept the goose on water that had been enriched with o   for a week .  gold production went up almost at once .  at the end of a week it was producing    .   grams while the o  content of its body water was no higher than before .   there s no doubt about it   said billings .   he snapped his pencil and stood up .  that goose is a living nuclear reactor .    the goosewas obviously a mutation .   a mutation suggested radiation among other things and radiation brought up the thought of nuclear tests conducted in      and      several hundred miles away from the site of macgregor s farm .   if it occurs to you that no nuclear tests have been conducted in texas  it just shows two things  i m not telling you everything and you don t know everything .   i doubt that at any time in the history of the atomic era was background radiation so thoroughly analyzed and the radioactive content of the soil so rigidly sifted .   back records were studied .  it didn t matter how top secret they were .  by this time  project goose had the highest priority that had ever existed .   even weather records were checked in order to follow the behavior of the winds at the time of the nuclear tests .   two things turned up .   one  the background radiation at the farm was a bit higher than normal .  nothing that could possibly do harm  i hasten to add .  there were indications  however  that at the time of the birth of the goose  the farm had been subjected to the drifting edge of at least two fallouts .  nothing really harmful  i again hasten to add .   second  the goose  alone of all geese on the farm  in fact  alone of all living creatures on the farm that could be tested  including the humans  showed no radioactivity at all .  look at it this way  everything shows traces of radioactivity  that s what is meant by background radiation .  but the goose showed none .   finley sent one report on december          which i can paraphrase as follows   the goose is a most extraordinary mutation  born of a high level radioactivity environment which at once encouraged mutations in general and which made this particular mutation a beneficial one .   the goose has enzyme systems capable of catalyzing various nuclear reactions .  whether the enzyme system consists of one enzyme or more than one is not known .  nor is anything known of the nature of the enzymes in question .  nor can any theory be yet advanced as to how an enzyme can catalyze a nuclear reaction  since these involve particular interactions with forces five orders of magnitude higher than those involved in the ordinary chemical reactions commonly catalyzed by enzymes .   the overall nuclear change is from oxygen    to gold     .  the oxygen    is plentiful in its environment  being present in significant amount in water and all organic foodstuffs .  the gold     is excreted via the ovaries .  one known intermediate is iron    and the fact that auremoglobin is formed in the process leads us to suspect that the enzyme or enzymes involved may have heme as a prosthetic group .   there has been considerable thought devoted to the value this overall nuclear change might have to the goose .  the oxygen    does it no harm and the gold     is troublesome to be rid of  potentially poisonous  and a cause of its sterility .  its formation might possibly be a means of avoiding greater danger .  this danger         but just reading it in the report  friend  makes it all seem so quiet  almost pensive .  actually  i never saw a man come closer to apoplexy and survive than billings did when he found out about our own radioactive gold experiments which i told you about earlier   the ones in which we detected no radioactivity in the goose  so that we discarded the results as meaningless .   many times over he asked how we could possibly consider it unimportant that we had lost radioactivity .    you re like the cub reporter   he said   who was sent to cover a society wedding and on returning said there was no story because the groom hadn t shown up .    you fed the goose radioactive gold and lost it .  not only that  you failed to detect any natural radioactivity about the goose .  any carbon   i  .  any potassium    .  and you called it failure .    we started feeding the goose radioactive isotopes .  cautiously  at first  but before the end of january of      we were shoveling it in .   the goose remained nonradioactive .    what it amounts to   said billings   is that this enzyme catalyzed nuclear process of the goose manages to convert any unstable isotope into a stable isotope .     useful .   i said .    useful . its a thing of beauty .  it s the perfect defense against theatomic age .  listen  the conversion of oxygen    to gold     should liberate eight and a fraction positrons per oxygen atom .  that means eight and a fraction gamma rays as soon as each positron combines with an electron .  no gamma rays  either .  the goose must be able to absorb gamma rays harmlessly .    we irradiated the goose with gamma rays .  as the level rose  the goose developed a slight fever and we quit in panic .  it was just fever  though  not radiation sickness .  a day passed  the fever subsided  and the goose was as good as new .    do you see what we ve got .   demanded billings .    a scientific marvel   said finley .    man  don t you see the practical applications .  if we could find out the mechanism and duplicate it in the test tube  we ve got a perfect method of radioactive ash disposal .  the most important drawback preventing us from going ahead with a full scale atomic economy is the headache of what to do with the radioactive isotopes manufactured in the process .  sift them through an enzyme preparation in large vats and that would be it .    find out the mechanism  gentlemen  and you can stop worrying about fallouts .  we would find a protection against radiation sickness .    alter the mechanism somehow and we can have geese excreting any element needed .  how about uranium     eggshells  .   the mechanism .  the mechanism .    we sat there  all of us  staring at the goose .   if only the eggs would hatch .  if only we could get a tribe of nuclear reactor geese .    it must have happened before   said finley .   the legends of such geese must have started somehow .     do you want to wait .   asked billings .   if we had a gaggle of such geese  we could begin taking a few apart .  we could study its ovaries .  we could prepare tissue slices and tissue homogenates .   that might not do any good .  the tissue of a liver biopsy did not react with oxygen    under any conditions we tried .   but then we might perfuse an intact liver .  we might study intact embryos  watch for one to develop the mechanism .   but with only one goose  we could do none of that .   we don t dare kill the goose that lays the golden eggs .   the secret was in the liver of that fat goose .   liver of fat goose .  pate de foie gras .  no delicacy to us .   nevis said thoughtfully   we need an idea .  some radical departure .  some crucial thought .     saying it won t bring it   said billings despondently .   and in a miserable attempt at a joke  i said   we could advertise in the newspapers   and that gave me an idea .    science fiction .   i said .    what .   said finley .    look  science fiction magazines print gag articles .  the readers consider it fun .  they re interested .   i told them about the thiotimoline articles asimov wrote and which i had once read .   the atmosphere was cold with disapproval .    we won t even be breaking security regulations   i said   because no one will believe it .   i told them about the time in      when cleve cartmill wrote a story describing the atom bomb one year early and the f . b . i  kept its temper .    and science fiction readers have ideas .  don t underrate them .  even if they think it s a gag article  they ll send their notions in to the editor .  and since we have no ideas of our own  since we re up a dead end street  what can we lose  .    they still didn t buy it .   so i said   and you know  .  .  .  the goose won t live forever .    that did it  somehow .   we had to convince washington  then i got in touch with john campbell  editor of the magazine  and he got in touch with asimov .   now the article is done .  i ve read it  i approve  and i urge you all not to believe it .  please don t .   only        any ideas .   foreword  originally i had planned to make this another wendell urth story  but a new magazine was about to be published and i wanted to be represented in it with something that was not too clearly a holdover from another magazine .  i adjusted matters accordingly .  i am a little sorry now and i played with the thought of rewriting the story for this volume and restoring dr .  urth  but inertia rose triumphant over all .       the dust of death  like all men who worked under the great llewes  edmund farley reached the point where he thought with longing of the pleasure it would give him to kill that same great llewes .   no man who did not work for llewes would quite understand the feeling .  llewes  men forgot his first name or grew  almost unconsciously  to think it was great  with a capital g  was everyman s idea of the great prober into the unknown   both relentless  and brilliant  neither giving up in the face of failure nor ever at a loss for a new and more ingenious attack .   llewes was an organic chemist who had brought the solar system to the service of his science .  it was he who first used the moon for large scale reactions to be run in vacuum  at the temperature of boiling water or liquid air  depending on the time of month .  photochemistry became something new and wonderful when carefully designed apparatus was set floating freely in orbits about space stations .   but  truth to tell  llewes was a credit stealer  a sin almost impossible to forgive .  some nameless student had first thought of setting up apparatus on the lunar surface  a forgotten technician had designed the first self contained space reactor .  somehow both achievements became associated with the name of llewes .   and nothing could be done .  an employee who resigned in anger would lose his recommendation and find it difficult to obtain another job .  his unsupported word against that of llewes would be worth nothing .  on the other hand  those who remained with him  endured  and finally left with good grace and a recommendation were sure of future success .   but while they stayed  they at least enjoyed the dubious pleasure of voicing their hatred among themselves .   and edmund farley had full reason to join them .  he had come from titan  saturn s largest satellite  where he had singlehanded   aided by robots only   set up equipment to make full use of titan s reducing atmosphere .  the major planets have atmospherscomposed largely of hydrogen and methane but jupiter and saturn were too large to deal with  and uranus and neptune were still too expensively far .  titan  however  was mars size  small enough to operate upon and large enough and cold enough to retain a medium thin hydrogen methane atmosphere .   large scale reactions could proceed there easily in the hydrogen atmosphere  where on earth those same reactions were kinetically troublesome .  farley had designed and redesigned and endured titan for half a year and had come back with amazing data .  yet somehow  almost at once  farley could see it fragment and begin to come together as a llewes achievement .   the others sympathized  shrugged their shoulders  and bade him welcome to the fraternity .  farley tensed his acne scarred face  brought his thin lips together  and listened to the others as they plotted violence .   jim gorham was the most outspoken .  farley rather despised him  for he was a  vacuum man  who had never left earth .   gorham said   llewes is an easy man to kill because of his regular habits  you see .  you can rely on him .  for instance  look at the way he insists on eating by himself .  he closes his office at twelve sharp and opens it at one sharp .  right .  no one goes into his office in that interval  so poison has plenty of time to work .    belinsky said dubiously   poison .     easy .  plenty of poison all over the place .  you name it  we got it .  okay  then .  llewes eats one swiss cheese on rye with a special kind of relish knee deep in onions .  we all know that  right  .  after all  we can smell him all afternoon and we all remember the miserable howl he raised when the lunchroom ran out of the relish once last spring .  no one else in the place will ever touch the relish  so poison in it will hit only llewes and no one else  .  .  .    it was all a kind of lunchtime make believe  but not for farley .   grimly  and in earnest  he decided to murder llewes .   it became an obsession with him .  his blood tingled at the thought of llewes dead  of himself able to take the credit that was rightfully his for those months of living in a small bubble of oxygen and tramping across frozen ammonia to remove products and set up new reactions in the thin  chill winds of hydrogen and methane .   but it would have to be something which couldn t possibly harm anyone but llewes .  that sharpened the matter and focused things on llewes  atmosphere room .  it was a long  low room  isolated from the rest of the laboratories by cement blocks and fireproof doors .  no one but llewes ever entered  except in llewes  presence and with his permission .  not that the room was ever actually locked .  the effective tyranny llewes had established made the faded slip of paper on the laboratory door  reading  do not enter  and signed with his initials  more of a barrier than any lock  .  .  .  except where the desire for murder superseded all else .   then what about the atmosphere room .  llewes  routine of testing  his almost infinite caution  left nothing to chance .  any tampering with the equipment itself  unless it were unusually subtle  would certainly be detected .   fire then .  the atmosphere room contained inflammable materials and to spare  but llewes didn t smoke and was perfectly aware of the danger of fires .  no one took greater precautions against one .   farley thought impatiently of the man on whom it seemed so difficult to wreak a just vengeance  the thief playing with his little tanks of methane and hydrogen where farley had used it by the cubic mile .  llewes for the little tanks and fame  farley for the cubic miles and oblivion .   all those little tanks of gas  each its own color  each a synthetic atmosphere .  hydrogen gas in red cylinders and methane in striped red and white  a mixture of the two representing the atmosphere of the outer planets .  nitrogen in brown cylinders and carbon dioxide in silver for the atmosphere of venus .  the yellow cylinders of compressed air and the green cylinders of oxygen  where earthly chemistry was good enough .  a parade of the rainbow  each color dating back through centuries of convention .   then he had the thought .  it was not born painfully  but came all at once .  in one moment it had all crystallized in farley s mind and he knew what he had to do .   farley waited a painful month for september i th  which was space day .  it was the anniversary of man s first successful space flight and no one would be working that night .  space day was  of all holidays  the one most meaningful to the scientist in particular and even the dedicated llewes would be making merry then .   farley entered central organic laboratories   to use its official title   that night  certain he was unobserved .  the labs weren t banks or museums .  they were not subject to thievery and such night watch men as there were had a generally easy going attitude toward their jobs .   farley closed the main door carefully behind him and moved slowly down the darkened corridors toward the atmosphere room .  his equipment consisted of a flashlight  a small vial of black powder  and a thin brush he had bought in an art supply store at the other end of town three weeks before .  he wore gloves .   his greatest difficulty came in actually entering the atmosphere room .  it s  forbiddenness  hampered him more than the general forbiddenness of murder .  once in  however  once past the mental hazard  the rest was easy .   he cupped the flashlight and found the cylinder without hesitation .  his heart was beating so as almost to deafen him  while his breath came quickly and his hand trembled .   he tucked the flash under his arm  then dipped the tip of the artist s brush into the black dust .  grains of it adhered to the brush and farley pointed it into the nozzle of the gauge attached to the cylinder .  it took eons long seconds for that trembling tip to enter the nozzle .   farley moved it about delicately  dipped it into the black dust again  and inserted it once more in the nozzle .  he repeated it over and over  almost hypnotized by the intensity of his own concentration .  finally  using a bit of facial tissue dampened with saliva  he began to wipe off the outer rim of the nozzle  enormously relieved that the job was done and he d soon be out .   it was then his hand froze  and the sick uncertainty of fear surged through him .  the flashlight dropped clattering to the floor .   fool .  incredible and miserable fool .  he hadn t been thinking i under the stress of his emotion and anxiety  he had ended at the wrong cylinder .   he snatched up the flash  put it out  and  his heart thumping alarmingly  listened for any noise .   in the continuing dead silence  he regained a portion of his self control  and screwed himself to the realization that what could be done once could be done again .  if the wrong cylinder had been tampered with  then the right one would take two minutes more .   once again  the brush and the black dust came into play .  at least  he had not dropped the vial of dust  the deadly  burning dust .  this time  the cylinder was the right one .   he finished  wiping the nozzle again  with a badly trembling hand .  his flash then played about quickly and rested upon a reagent bottle of toluene .  that would do .  he unscrewed the plastic cap  splashed some of the toluene on the floor  and left the bottle open .   he then stumbled out of the building as in a dream  made his way to his rooming house and the safety of his own room .  as nearly as he could tell  he was unobserved throughout .   he disposed of the facial tissue he had used to wipe the nozzles of the gas cylinders by cramming it into the flash disposal unit .  it vanished into molecular dispersion .  so did the artist s brush that followed .   the vial of dust could not be so gotten rid of without adjustments to the disposal unit he did not think it safe to make .  he would walk to work  as he often did  and toss it off the grand street bridge .  .  .   farley blinked at himself in the mirror the next morning and wondered if he dared go to work .  it was an idle thought  he didn t dare not go to work .  he must do nothing that would attract attention to him on this day of all days .   with grayish desperation  he worked to reproduce normal acts of nothingness that made up so much of the day .  it was a fine  warm morning and he walked to work .  it was only a flicking motion of the wrist that was necessary to get rid of the vial .  it made a tiny splash in the river  filled with water  and sank .   he sat at his desk  later that morning  staring at his hand computer .  now that it had all been done  would it work .  llewes might ignore the smell of toluene .  why not .  the odor was unpleasant  but not disgusting .  organic chemists were used to it .   then  if llewes were still hot on the trail of the hydro genation procedures farley had brought back from titan  the gas cylinder would be put into use at once .  it would have to be .  with a day of holiday behind him  llewes would be more than usually anxious to get back to work .   then  as soon as the gauge cock was turned  a bit of gas would spurt out and turn into a sheet of flame .  if there were the proper quantity of toluene in the air  it would turn as quickly into an explosion     so intent was farley in his reverie that he accepted the dull boom in the distance as the creation of his own mind  a counter point to his own thoughts  until footsteps thudded by .   farley looked up  and out of a dry throat  cried   what    what          dunno   yelled back the other .   something wrong in the atmosphere room .  explosion .  hell of a mess .    the extinguishers were on and men beat out the flames and snatched the burned and battered llewes out of the wreckage .  he had the barest flicker of life left in him and died before a doctor had time to predict that he would .   on the outskirts of the group that hovered about the scene in grim and grisly curiosity stood edmund farley .  his pallor and the glisten of perspiration on his face did not  at that moment  mark him as different from the rest .  he tottered back to his desk .  he could be sick now .  no one would remark on it .   but somehow he wasn t .  he finished out the day and in the evening the load began to lighten .  accident was accident  wasn t it .  there were occupational risks all chemists ran  especially those working with inflammable compounds .  no one would question the matter .   and if anyone did  how could they possibly trace anything back to edmund farley  .  he had only to go about his life as though nothing had happened .   nothing .  good lord  the credit for titan would now be his .  he would be a great man .   the load lightened indeed and that night he slept .          jim gorham had faded a bit in twenty four hours .  his yellow hair was stringy and only the light color of his stubble masked the fact that he needed a shave badly .    we all talked murder   he said .   h .  seton davenport of the terrestrial bureau of investigation tapped one finger against the desktop methodically  and so lightly that it could not be heard .  he was a stocky man with a firm face and black hair  a thin  prominent nose made for utility rather than beauty  and a star shaped scar on one cheek .    seriously .   he asked .    no   said gorham  shaking his head violently .   at least  i didn t think it was serious .  the schemes were wild  poisoned sandwich spreads and acid on the helicopter  you know .  still  someone must have taken the matter seriously after all  .  .  .  the madman  .  for what reason .    davenport said   from what you ve said  i judge because the dead man appropriated other peoples  work .     so what   cried gorham .   it was the price he charged for what he did .  he held the entire team together .  he was its muscles and guts .  llewes was the one who dealt with congress and got the grants .  he . was the one who got permission to set up projects in space and send men to the moon or wherever .  he talked spaceship lines and industrialists into doing millions of dollars of work for us .  he organized central organic .     have you realized all this overnight .     not really .  i ve always known this  but what could i do  .  i ve chickened out of space travel  found excuses to avoid it .   i was a vacuum man  who never even visited the moon .  the truth was  i was afraid  and even more afraid to have the others think i was afraid .   he virtually spat self contempt .    and now you want to find someone to punish .   said davenport .   you want to make up to the dead llewes your crime against the live one .     no .  leave psychiatry out of this .  i tell you it is murder .  it s got to be .  you didn t know llewes .  the man was a monomaniac on safety .  no explosion could possibly have happened anywhere near him unless it were carefully arranged .    davenport shrugged .   what exploded  dr .  gorham .   it could have been almost anything .  he handled organic compounds of all sorts   benzene  ether  pyridine   all of them inflammable .     i studied chemistry once  dr .  gorham  and none of those liquids is explosive at room temperature as i remember .  there has to be some sort of heat  a spark  a flame .    there was fire all right .     how did that happen  .     i can t imagine .  there were no burners in the place and no matches .  electrical equipment of all sorts was heavily shielded .  even little ordinary things like clamps were specially manufactured out of beryllium copper or other non sparking alloys .  llewes didn t smoke and would have fired on the spot anyone who approached within a hundred feet of the room with a lighted cigarette .     what was the last thing he handled  then .     hard to tell .  the place was a shambles .     i suppose it has been straightened out by now  though .    the chemist said with instant eagerness   no  it hasn t .  i took care of that .  i said we had to investigate the cause of the accident to prove it wasn t neglect .  you know  to avoid bad publicity .  so the room hasn t been touched .    davenport nodded .   all right .  let s take a look at it .    in the blackened  disheveled room  davenport said   what s the most dangerous piece of equipment in the place .    gorham looked about .  the compressed oxygen tanks   he said  pointing .   davenport looked at the variously colored cylinders standing against the wall cradled in a binding chain .  some leaned heavily against the chain  tipped by the force of the explosion .   davenport said   how about this one .   he toed a red cylinder which lay flat on the ground in the middle of the room .  it was heavy and didn t budge .   that one s hydrogen   said gorham .    hydrogen is explosive  isn t it .    that s right   when heated .    davenport said  then why do you say the compressed oxygen is the most dangerous .  oxygen doesn t explode  does it .     no .  it doesn t even burn  but it supports combustion  see .  things burn in it .     so .     well  look here .   a certain vivacity entered gorham s voice  he was the scientist explaining something simple to the intelligent layman .   sometimes a person might accidentally put some lubricant on the valve before tightening it onto the cylinder  to make a tighter seal  you know .  or he might get something inflammable smeared on it by mistake .  when he opens the valve then  the oxygen rushes out  and whatever goo is on the valve explodes  wrenching off the valve .  then the rest of the oxygen blows out of the cylinder  which would then take off like a miniature jet and go through a wall  the heat of the explosion would fire other inflammable liquids nearby .     are the oxygen tanks in this place intact .     yes  they are .    davenport kicked the hydrogen cylinder at his feet .  the gauge on this cylinder reads zero .  i suppose that means it was in use at the time of explosion and has emptied itself since then .    gorham nodded .   i suppose so .     could you explode hydrogen by smearing oil on the gauge .     definitely not .    davenport rubbed his chin .   is there anything that would make hydrogen burst into flame outside of a spark of some sort .    gorham muttered   a catalyst  i suppose .  platinum black is the best .  that s powdered platinum .    davenport looked astonished .   do you have such a thing .     of course .  it s expensive  but there s nothing better for catalyzing hydrogenations .   he fell silent and stared down at the hydrogen cylinder for a long moment .   platinum black   he finally whispered .   i wonder         davenport said   platinum black would make hydrogen burn  then .     oh  yes .  it brings about the combination of hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature .  no heat necessary .  the explosion would be just as though it were caused by heat  just the same .    excitement was building upin gorham s voice and he fell to his knees beside the hydrogen cylinder .  he passed his finger over the blackened tip .  it might be just soot and it might be         he got to his feet   sir  that must be the way it was done .  i m going to get every speck of foreign material off that nozzle and run a spectrographic analysis .     how long will it take .     give me fifteen minutes .    gorham came back in twenty .  davenport had made a meticulous round of the burned out laboratory .  he looked up .   well .    gorham said triumphantly   it s there .  not much  but there .    he held up a strip of photographic negative against which there were short white parallel lines  irregularly spaced and of different degrees of brightness .   mostly extraneous material  but you see those lines  .  .  .    davenport peered closely .   very faint .  would you swear in court that platinum was present .     yes   said gorham at once .    would any other chemist .  if this photo were shown a chemist hired by the defense  could he claim the lines were too faint to be certain evidence .    gorham was silent .   davenport shrugged .   the chemist cried   but it is there .  the stream of gas and the explosion would have blown most of it out .  you wouldn t expect much to be left .  you see  that  don t you .    davenport looked about thoughtfully .   i do .  i admit there s a reasonable chance this is murder .  so now we look for more and better evidence .  do you suppose this is the only cylinder that might have been tampered with .     i don t know .    then the first thing we do is check every other cylinder in the place .  everything else  too .  if there is a murderer  he might conceivably have set other booby traps in the place .  it s got to be checked .     i ll get started        began gorham eagerly .    uh   not you   said davenport .   i ll have a man from our labs do it .    the next morning  gorham was in davenport s office again .  this time he had been summoned .   davenport said   it s murder  all right .  a second cylinder had been tampered with .     you see .     an oxygen cylinder .  there was platinum black inside the tip of the nozzle .  quite a bit of it .     platinum black .  on the oxygen cylinder .    davenport nodded .   right .  now why do you suppose that would be .    gorham shook his head .   oxygen won t burn and nothing will make it burn .  not even platinum black .     so the murderer must have put it on the oxygen cylinder by mistake in the tension of the moment .  presumably he corrected himself and tampered with the right cylinder  but meanwhile he left final evidence that this is murder and not accident .     yes  now it s only a matter of finding the person .    the scar on davenport s cheek crinkled alarmingly as he smiled .   only  dr .  gorham .  how do we do that .  our quarry left no calling card .  there are a number of people in the laboratories with motive  a greater number with the chemical knowledge required to commit the crime and with the opportunity to do so .  is there any way we can trace the platinum black .     no   said gorham hesitantly .   any of twenty people could have gotten into the special supply room without trouble .  what about alibis .     for what time .     for the night before .    davenport leaned across his desk .   when was the last time  previous to the fatal moment  that dr .  llewes used that hydrogen cylinder .     i   i don t know .  he worked alone .  very secretly it was part of his way of making sure he had sole credit .     yes  i know .  we ve been making our own inquiries .  so the platinum black might have been put on the cylinder a week before for all we know .    gorham whispered disconsolately  then what do we do .    davenport said  the only point of attack  it seems to me  is the platinum black on the oxygen cylinder .  it s an irrational point and the explanation may hold the solution .  but i m no chemist and you are  so if the answer is anywhere it s inside you .  could it have been a mistake   could the murderer have confused the oxygen with the hydrogen  .    gorham shook his head at once .   no .  you know about the colors .  a green tank is oxygen  a red tank is hydrogen .     what if he were color blind .   asked davenport .   this time gorham took more time .  finally he said   no .  color blind people don t generally go in for chemistry .  detection of color in chemical reactions is too important .  and if anybody in this organization were color blind  he d have enough trouble with one thing or another so that the rest of us would know about it .    davenport nodded .  he fingered the scar on his cheek absently   all right .  if the oxygen cylinder wasn t smeared by ignorance or accident  could it have been done on purpose .  deliberately .     i don t understand you .     perhaps the murderer had a logical plan in mind when he smeared the oxygen cylinder  then changed his mind .  are there any conditions where platinum black would be dangerous in the presence of oxygen .  any conditions at all .  you re the chemist  dr .  gorham .    there was a puzzled frown on the chemist s face .  he shook his head .   no  none .  there can t be .  unless          unless .     well  this is ridiculous  but if you stuck the oxygen jet into a container of hydrogen gas  platinum black on the gas cylinder could be dangerous .  naturally you d need a big container to make a satisfactory explosion .     suppose   said davenport   our murderer had counted on filling the room with hydrogen and then having the oxygen tank turned on .    gorham said  with a half smile   but why bother with the hydrogen atmosphere when        the half smile vanished completely while a complete pallor took its place .  he cried   farley .  edmund farley .     what s that .     farley just returned from six months on titan   said gorham in gathering excitement .  titan has a hydrogen methane atmosphere .  he is the only man here to have had experience in such an atmosphere  and it all makes sense now .  on titan a jet of oxygen will combine with the surrounding hydrogen if heated  or treated with platinum black .  a jet of hydrogen won t .  the situation is exactly the reverse of what it is here on earth .  it must have been farley .  when he entered llewes  lab to arrange an explosion  he put the platinum black on the oxygen  out of recent habit .  by the time he recalled that the situation was the other way round on earth  the damage was done .    davenport nodded in grim satisfaction .  that does it  i think .   his hand reached out to an intercom and he said to the unseen recipient at the other end   send out a man to pick up dr .  edmund farley at central organic .        a loint of paw  there was no question that montie stein had  through clever fraud  stolen better than          .  there was also no question that he was apprehended one day after the statute of limitations had expired .   it was his manner of avoiding arrest during that interval that brought on the epoch making case of the state of new yorkvs .  montgomery harlow stein  with all its consequences introduced law to the fourth dimension .   for you see after having committed the fraud and possessed himself of the hundred grand plus  stein had calmly entered a time machine  of which he was in illegal possession  and set the controls for seven years and one day in the future .   stein s lawyer put it simply .  hiding in time was not fundamentally different from hiding in space .  if the forces of law had not uncovered stein in the seven year interval that was their hard luck .   the district attorney pointed out that the statute of limitations was not intended to be a game between the law and the criminal .  it was a merciful measure designed to protect a culprit from indefinitely prolonged fear of arrest .  for certain crimes  a denned period of apprehension of apprehension   so to speak   was considered punishment enough .  but stein  the d . a .  insisted  had not experienced any period of apprehension at all .   stein s lawyer remained unmoved .  the law said nothing about measuring the extent of a culprit s fear and anguish .  it simply set a time limit .   the d . a .  said that stein had not lived through the limit .   defense stated that stein was seven years older now than at the time of the crime and had therefore lived through the limit .   the d . a .  challenged the statement and the defense produced stein s birth certificate .  he was born in      .  at the time of the crime        he was thirty one .  now  in       he was thirty eight .   the d . a .  shouted that stein was not physiologically thirty eight  but thirty one .   defense pointed out freezingly that the law  once the individual was granted to be mentally competent  recognized solely chronological age  which could be obtained only by subtracting the date of birth from the date of now .   the d . a .   growing impassioned  swore that if stein were allowed to go free  half the laws on the books would be useless .   then change the laws  said defense  to take time travel into account  but until the laws are changed  let them be enforced as written .   judge neville preston took a week to consider and then handed down his decision .  it was a turning point in the history of law .  it is almost a pity  then  that some people suspect judge preston to have been swayed in his way of thinking by the irresistible impulse to phrase his decision as he did .   for that decision  in full  was    a niche in time saves stein .    afterword  if you expect me to apologize for this  you little know your man .  i consider a play on words the noblest form of wit  so there .   foreword  this is a james bond type of story  written before i had ever heard of james bond .  actually  those who know my writing know that i never introduce naughty motifs into my stories .  you can tell that from the other stories in this volume .  however  an editor    i won t mention his name   once told me he suspected that i never had love scenes in my stories because i was incapable of writing them .  naturally i repudiated that suggestion with the scorn and contumely it deserved and said with heat that it was merely my natural purity and wholesomeness that kept me from doing so .  since the expression on his lace was one of obvious disbelief  i said   i ll show you .  i ll write a science fiction love story  but not for publication .   but it turned out also to be a mystery  and i was so pleased with it i let it be published .  anyway  it shows i can do it if i want to .  it s just that i don t want to  ordinarily .       i m in marsport without hilda  it worked itself out  to begin with  like a dream .  i didn t have to make any arrangements .  i didn t have to touch it .  i just watched things work out .  maybe right then s when i should have smelled catastrophe .   it began with my usual month s layoff between assignments .  a month on and a month off is the right and proper routine for the galactic service .  i reached marsport for the usual three day layover before the short hop to earth .   ordinarily  hilda  god bless her  as sweet a wife as any man ever had  would be there waiting for me and we d have a nice sedate time of it   a nice little interlude for the two of us .  the only trouble with that is that marsport is the rowdiest hellhole in the system  and a nice little interlude isn t exactly what fits in .  only  how do i explain that to hilda  hey .   well  this time my mother in law   god bless her  for a change   got sick just two days before i reached marsport  and the night before landing  i got a spacegram from hilda saying she would stay on earth with her mother and wouldn t meet me this one time .   i grammed back my loving regrets and my feverish anxiety concerning her mother  and when i landed  there i was   i was in marsport without hilda .  that was still nothing  you understand .  it was the frame of the picture  the bones of the woman .  now there was the matter of the lines and coloring inside the frame  the skin and flesh outside the bones .   so i called up flora   flora of certain rare episodes in the past   and for the purpose i used a video booth .  damn the expense  full speed ahead .   i was giving myself ten to one odds she d be out  she d be busy with her videophone disconnected  she d be dead  even .   but she was in  with her videophone connected and shewas anything but dead .   she looked better than ever .  age cannot wither nor custom stale  as somebody or other once said  her infinite variety .  and the robe she wore   or  rather  almost didn t wear   helped a lot .   was she glad to see me .  she squealed   max .  it s been years .     i know  flora  but this is it  if you re available .  because guess what .  i m in marsport without hilda .    she squealed again .   isn t that nice .  then come on over .    i goggled a bit .  this was too much .   you mean you are available .   you have to understand that flora was never available without plenty of notice .  well  she was that kind of knockout .   she said   oh  i ve got some quibbling little arrangement max  but i ll take care of that .  you come on over .     i ll come   i said happily .   flora was the kind of girl      well  i tell you  she had her rooms under martian gravity      earth normal .  the gadget to free her of marsport s pseudo grav field was expensive  of course  but i ll tell you just in passing that it was worth it  and she had no trouble paying it off .  if you ve ever held a girl in your arms at     gees  you need no explanation .  if you haven t  explanations will do no good .  i m also sorry for you .   talk about floating on clouds .  .  .   and mind you  the girl has to know how to handle low gravity .  flora did .  i won t talk about myself  you understand  but flora didn t howl for me to come over and start breaking previous engagements just because she was at loose ends .  her ends were never loose .   i closed connections  and only the prospect of seeing it all in the flesh   such flesh  .    could have made me wipe out the image with such alacrity .  i stepped out of the booth .   and at that point  that precise point  that very split instant of time  the first whiff of catastrophe nudged itself up to me .   that first whiff was the bald head of that lousy rog crinton of the mars offices  gleaming over a headful of pale blue eyes  pale yellow complexion  and pale brown mustache .  he was the same rog crinton  with some slavic strain in his ancestry  that half the people out on field work thought had a middle name that went sunnuvabich .   i didn t bother getting on all fours and beating my forehead against the ground because my vacation had started the minute i had gotten off the ship .   i said with only normal politeness   what the hell do you want and i m in a hurry .  i ve got an appointment .    he said   you ve got an appointment with me .  i ve got a little job for you .    i laughed and told him in all necessary anatomical detail where he could put the little job  and offered to get him a mallet to help .  i said   it s my month off  friend .    he said   red emergency alert  friend .    which meant  no vacation  just like that .  i couldn t believe it .  i said   nuts  rog .  have a heart .  i got an emergency alert of my own .     nothing like this .     rog   i pleaded   can t you get someone else .  anyone else .     you re the only class a agent on mars .     send to earth  then .  they stack agents like micropile units at headquarters .    this has got to be done before    p . m .  what s the matter  .  you haven t got three hours  .    i grabbed my head .  the boy just didn t know .  i said .   let me make a call  will you .    i stepped back in the booth  glared at him  and said   private .    flora shone on the screen again  like a mirage on an asteroid .  she said   something wrong  max  .  don t say something s wrong .  i canceled my other engagement .    i said   flora  baby  i ll be there .  i ll be there .  but something s come up .    .   she asked the natural question in a hurt tone of voice and i said   no .  not another girl .  with you in the same town they don t make any other girls .  females  maybe .  not girls .  baby .  honey .  it s business .  just hold on .  it won t take long .    she said   all right   but she said it kind of like it was just enough not all right so that i got the shivers .   i stepped out of the booth and said   all right  rog sunnuvabich  what kind of mess have you cooked up for me .    we went into the spaceport bar and got us an insulated booth .  he said   the an tores giant is coming in from sirius in exactly half an hour  at   p . m .  local time .     okay .     three men will get out  among others  and will wait for the space eater coming in from earth at    p . m .  and leaving for capella some time thereafter .  the three men will get on the space eater and will then be out of our jurisdiction .     so .     so between eight and eleven  they will be in a special waiting room and you will be with them .  i have a trimensional image of each for you so you ll know who they are and which is which .  you have between eight and eleven to decide which one is carrying contraband .     what kind of contraband .    the worst kind .  altered spaceoline .     altered spaceoline .    he had thrown me .  i knew what spaceoline was .  if you ve been on a space hop you know too .  and in case you re earthbound yourself the bare fact is that everyone needs it on the first space trip  almost everybody needs it for the first dozen trips  lots need it every trip .  without it  there is vertigo associated with free fall  screaming terrors  semipermanent psychoses .  with it  there is nothing  you don t mind a thing .  and it isn t habit forming  it has no adverse side effects .  spaceoline is ideal  essential  unsubstitutable .  when in doubt  take spaceoline .   rog said  that s right  altered spaceoline .  it can be changed chemically  by a simple reaction that can be conducted in anyone s basement  into a drug that will give one giant size charge and become your baby blue habit the first time .  it is on a par with the most dangerous alkaloids we know .     and we just found out about it .     no .  the service has known about it for years  and we ve kept others from knowing by squashing every discovery flat .  now  however  the discovery has gone too far .     in what way .     one of the men who will be stopping over at this spaceport is carrying some of the altered spaceoline on his person .  chemists in the capellan system  which is outside the federation  will analyze it and set up ways of synthesizing more .  after that  it s either fight the worst drug menace we ve ever seen or suppress the matter by suppressing the source .     you mean spaceoline .     right .  and if we suppress spaceoline  we suppress space travel .    i decided to put my finger on the point .   which one of the three has it .    rog smiled nastily .   if we knew  would we need you .  you re to find out which of the three .     you re calling on me for a lousy frisk job .    touch the wrong one at the risk of a haircut down to the larynx .  every one of the three is a big man on his own planet .  one is edward harponaster  one is joaquin lipsky  and one is andiamo ferrucci .  well  .    he was right .  i d heard of every one of them .  chances are you have too .  important  very important people  and not one was touchable without proof in advance .  i said   would one of them touch a dirty deal like         there are trillions involved   said rog   which means any one of the three would .  and one of them has  because jack hawk got that far before he was killed          jack hawk s dead .    right  and one of those guys arranged the killing .  now you find out which .  you put the finger on the right one before eleven and there s a promotion  a raise in pay  a payback for poor jack hawk  and a rescue of the galaxy .  you put the finger on the wrong one and there ll be a nasty interstellar situation and you ll be out on your ear and also on every blacklist from here to antares and back .    i said   suppose i don t finger anybody .    that would be like fingering the wrong one as far as the service is concerned .     i ve got to finger someone  but only the right one  or my head s handed to me .     in thin slices .  you re beginning to understand me  max .    in a long lifetime of looking ugly  rog crinton had never looked uglier .  the only comfort i got out of staring at him was the realization that he was married too  and that he lived with his wife at marsport all year round .  and does he deserve that .  maybe i m hard on him  but he deserves it .   i put in a quick call to flora  as soon as rog was out of sight .   she said   well .   the magnetic seams on her robe were opened just right and her voice sounded as thrillingly soft as she looked .   i said   baby  honey  it s something i can t talk about  but i ve got to do it  see  .  now you hang on  i ll get it over with if i have to swim the grand canal to the icecap in my underwear  see  .  if i have to claw phobos out of the sky .  if i have to cut myself in pieces and mail myself parcel post .     gee   she said   if i thought i was going to have to wait .  .  .    i winced .  she just wasn t the type to respond to poetry .  actually  she was a simple creature of action  .  .  .  but after all  if i were going to be drifting through low gravity in a sea of jasmine perfume with flora  poetry response is not the type of qualification i would consider most indispensable .   i said urgently   just hold on  flora .  i won t be any time at all .  i ll make it up to you .    i was annoyed  sure  but i wasn t worried as yet .  rog hadn t more than left me when i figured out exactly how i was going to tell the guilty man from the others .   it was easy .  i should have called rog back and told him  but there s no law against wanting egg in your beer and oxygen in your air .  it would take me five minutes and then off i would go to flora  a little late  maybe  but with a promotion  a raise  and a slobbering kiss from the service on each cheek .   you see  it s like this .  big industrialists don t go space hopping much  they use transvideo reception .  when they do go to some ultra high interstellar conference  as these three were probably going  they took spaceoline .  for one thing  they didn t have enough hops under their belt to risk doing without .  for another  spaceoline was the expensive way of doing it and industrialists did things the expensive way .  i know their psychology .   now that would hold for two of them .  the one who carried contraband  however  couldn t risk spaceoline   even at the price of risking space sickness .  under spaceoline influence  he could throw the drug away  or give it away  or talk gibberish about it .  he would have to stay in control of himself .   it was as simple as that .   the antares giant was on time .  they brought in lipsky first .  he had thick  ruddy lips  rounded jowls  very dark eyebrows  and hair just beginning to show gray .  he just looked at me and sat down .  nothing .  he was under spaceoline .   i said   good evening  sir .    he said  in a dreamy voice .   surrealismus of panamy hearts in three quarter time for a cup of coffeedom of speech .    that was spaceoline all the way .  the buttons in the human mind were set free swinging .  each syllable suggests the next in free association .   andiamo ferrucci came in next .  black mustache  long and waxed  olive complexion  pock marked face .  he sat down .   i said   nice trip  .    he said  trip the light fantastic lock the clock is growings on the bird .    lipsky said   bird to the wise guyed book to all places everybody .    i grinned .  that left harponaster .  i had my needle gun neatly palmed and out of sight and the magnetic coil ready to grip him .   an then harponaster came in .  he was thin  leathery  and  though near bald  considerably younger than he seemed in his trimensional image .  and he was spaceolined to the gills .   i said   damn .    harponaster said   damyankee note speech to his last time i saw wood you say so .    ferrucci said   sow the seed the territory under dispute do well to come along long road tonightingale .    lipsky said   gay lords hopping pong balls .    i stared from one to the other as the nonsense ran down in shorter and shorter spurts and then silence .   i got the picture  all right .  one of them was faking .  he had thought ahead and realized that omitting the spaceoline would be a giveaway .  he might have bribed an official into injecting saline or dodged it some other way .   one of them was faking .  it wasn t hard to fake the thing .  comedians on sub etheric had a spaceoline skit regularly .  it was amazing the liberties they could take with the moral code in that way .  you ve heard them .   i stared at them and got the first prickle at the base of my skull that said  what if you don t finger the right one  .   it was eight thirty and there was my job  my reputation  my head growing rickety upon my neck to be considered .  i saved it all for later and thought of flora .  she wasn t going to wait for me forever .  for that matter  chances were she wouldn t wait for half an hour .   i wondered .  could the faker keep up free association if nudged gently onto dangerous territory  .   i said  the floor s covered with a nice solid rug  and ran the last two words together to make it  soli drug .    lipsky   drug from underneath the dough re mi fa sol to be saved .    ferrucci said   saved and a haircut above the common herd something about younicorny as kansas high as my knee .    harponaster said   kneether wind nor snow use try to by four ever and effervescence and sensibilityter totter .    lipsky said  totters and rags .    ferrucci said   agsactly .    harponaster said   actiymation .    a few grunts and they ran down .   i tried again and i didn t forget to be careful .  they would remember everything i said afterward and what i said had to be harmless .  i said .  this is a darned good space line .    ferucci said  lines and tigers and elephanthills on the prairie dogs do bark of the boughwough         i interrupted  looking at harponaster   a darned good space line .     line the bed and rest a little black sheepishion of wrong way to ring the clothes of a perfect day .    i interrupted again  glaring at lipsky .   good space line .     liron is hot chacolit ain t gonna be the same on you vee and double the stakes and potato and heel .    someone else said   heel the sicknecessaryd and white will wincetance .     tance with mealtime .     i m comingle .     inglish .     ishter seals .     eels .    i tried a few more times and got nowhere .  the faker  whichever he was  had practiced or had natural talents at talking free association .  he was disconnecting his brain and letting the words come out any old way .  and he must be inspired by knowing exactly what i was after .  if  drug  hadn t given it away   space line  three times repeated must have .  i was safe with the other two  but he would know .   and he was having fun with me .  all three were saying phrases that might have pointed to a deep inner guilt    sol to be saved    little black sheepishion of wrong    drug from underneath   and so on .  two were saying such things helplessly  randomly .  the third was amusing himself .   so how did i find the third .  i was in a feverish thrill of hatred against him and my fingers twitched .  the bastard was subverting the galaxy .  more than that  he was keeping me from flora .   i could go up to each of them and start searching .  the two who were really under spaceoline would make no move to stop me .  they could feel no emotion  no fear  no anxiety  no hate  no passion  no desire for self defense .  and if one made the slightest gesture of resistance i would have my man .   but the innocent ones would remember afterward .   i sighed .  if i tried it  i would get the criminal all right  but later i would be the nearest thing to chopped liver any man had ever been .  there would be a shakeup in the service  a big stink the width of the galaxy  and in the excitement and disorganization  the secret of altered spaceoline would get out anyway and so what the hell .   of course  the one i wanted might be the first one i touched .  one chance out of three .  i d have one out and only god can make a three .   damn it  something had started them going while i was muttering to myself and spaceoline is contagioust a gigolo my  oh     i stared desperately at my watch and my line of sight focused on nine fifteen .   where the devil was the time going to  .   oh  my  oh  nuts  oh  flora .   i had no choice .  i made my way to the booth for another quick call to flora .  just a quick one  you understand  to keep things alive  assuming they weren t dead already .   i kept saying to myself  she won t answer .   i tried to prepare myself for that .  there were other girls  there were other     hell  there were no other girls .   if hilda had been in marsport  i would never have had flora on my mind in the first place and it wouldn t have mattered .  but i was in marsport without hilda and i had made a date with flora  flora and a body that had been made up out of heaping handfuls of all that was soft and fragrant and firm  flora and a low gravity room and a way about her that made it seem like free fall through a warm  breathable ocean of champagne flavored meringue    the signal was signaling and signaling and i didn t dare break off .   answer .  answer .   she answered .  she said   it s you  .     of course  sweetheart  who else would it be .     lots of people .  someone who would come .     there s just this little detail of business  honey .     what business .  plastons for who .    i almost corrected her grammar  but i was wondering what this plastons kick was .   then i remembered .  i told her once i was a plaston salesman .  that was the time  .  brought her a plaston nightgown that was honey .  just thinking of it made me ache where i needed no more ache .   i said   look  just give me another half hour  .  .  .    her eyes grew moist .   i m sitting here all by myself .     i ll make it up to you .   to show you how desperate i was getting  i was definitely beginning to think along paths that could lead only to jewelry  even though a sizable dent in the bankbook would show up to hilda s piercing eye like the horsehead nebula interrupting the milky way .   she said   i had a perfectly good date and i broke it off .    i protested   you said it was a quibbling little arrangement .    that was a mistake .  i knew it the minute i said it .   she shrieked .   quibbling little arrangement .   it was what she had said .  but having the truth on your side just makes it worse in arguing with a woman .  don t i know  .   you call a man who s promised me an estate on earth         she went on and on about that estate on earth .  there wasn t a gal in marsport who wasn t wangling for an estate on earth and you could count the number who got one on the sixth finger of either hand .  but hope springs eternal in the human breast  and flora had plenty of room for it to spring in .   i tried to stop her .  i threw in honeys and babies until you would have thought that every bee on the planet earth was pregnant .   no use .   she finally said   and here i am all alone  with nobody  and what do you think that will do to my reputation .   and broke off contact .   well  she was right .  i felt like the lowest heel in the galaxy .  if the word did get around that she had been stood up  the word would also get around that she was standuppable  that she was losing the old touch .  a thing like that can ruin a girl .   i went back into the reception room .  a flunky outside the door saluted me in .   i stared at the three industrialists and speculated on the order in which i would slowly choke each to death if i could but receive choking orders .  harponaster first  maybe .  he had a thin  stringy neck that the fingers could go around neatly and a sharp adam s apple against which the thumbs could find purchase .   it cheered me up infinitesimally  to the point where i muttered   boy .   just out of sheer longing .   it started them off at once .  ferrucci said   boyl the watern the spout you go in the .  snow to sneeze         harponaster of the scrawny neck added   nies and nephew don t like orporalley cat .    lipsky said   cattle for shipmentering the home stretchings are good bait and drank drunk .     drunkle aunterior passageway .  a while .     while beasts oh pray .     rayls to chicago .     go way .     waiter .     terble .     ble .    then nothing .   they stared at me .  i stared at them .  they were empty of emotion   or two were   and i was empty of ideas .  and time passed .   i stared at them some more and thought about flora .  it occurred to me that i had nothing to lose that i had not already lost .  i might as well talk about her .   i said   gentlemen  there is a girl in this town whose name i will not mention for fear of compromising her .  let me describe her to you  gentlemen .    and i did .  if i say so myself  the last two hours had honed me to such a fine force field edge that the description of flora took on a kind of poetry that seemed to be coining from some wellspring of masculine force deep in the sub basement of my unconscious .   and they sat frozen  almost as though they were listening  and hardly ever interrupting .  people under spaceoline have a kind of politeness about them .  they won t speak when someone else is speaking .  that s why they take turns .   occasionally  of course  i paused a bit because the poignancy of the subject matter made me want to linger and then one of them might put in a few words before i could gather myself together and continue .    pinknic of champagnes and aches and bittern of the century box .     round that and or thisandy beaches .     assault and peppert girlieping leopard .    i drowned them out and kept talking .  this young lady  gentlemen   i said   has an apartment fitted out for low gravity .  now you might ask of what use is low gravity .  i intend to tell you  gentlemen  for if you have never had occasion to spend a quiet evening with a marsport prima donna in privacy  you cannot imagine         but i tried to make it unnecessary for them to imagine    the way i told it they were there .  they would remember all this afterward but i doubted mightily that either of the two innocents would object to it in hindsight .  chances were they would look me up to ask a phone number .   i kept it up  with loving  careful detail and a kind of heartfelt sadness in my voice  until the loudspeaker announced the arrival of the space eater .  that was that .  i said in a loud voice   rise  gentlemen .    they got up in unison  faced the door  started walking  and as ferrucci passed me  i tapped him on the shoulder and said   not you  you murdering louse   and my magnetic coil was on his wrist before he could breathe twice .   ferrucci fought like a demon .  he was under no spaceoline influence .  they found the altered spaceoline in thin flesh colored plastic pads hugging the inner surface of his thighs  with hairs affixed to it in the normal pattern .  you couldn t see it at all  you could only feel it  and even then it took a knife to make sure .   afterward  rog crinton  grinning and half insane with relief  held me by the lapel with a death grip .   how did you do it .  what gave it away .    i said  trying to pull loose   one of them was faking a spaceoline jag .  i was sure of it .  so i told them        i grew cautious .  none of the bum s business as to the details  you know .      uh  ribald stories  see  and two of them never reacted  so they were spaceolined .  but ferrucci s breathing speeded up and the beads of sweat came out on his forehead .  i gave a pretty dramatic rendition  and he reacted  so he was under no spaceoline .  and when they all stood up to head out for the ship  i was sure of my man and stopped him .  now will you let me go .    he let go and i almost fell over backward .   i was set to take off .  my feet were pawing at the ground without any instructions for me  but i turned back .    hey  rog   i said   can you sign me a chit for a thousand credits without its going on the record   for services rendered to the service  .    that s when i realized he was half insane with relief and very temporary gratitude  because he said   sure  max  sure .  ten thousand credits if you want it .     i want   i said .   i want .  i want .    he filled out an official service chit for ten thousand credits  good as cash anywhere in half the galaxy .  he was actually grinning as he gave it to me and you can bet i was grinning as i took it .   how he intended accounting for it was his affair .  the point was that i wouldn t have to account for it to hilda .   i stood in the booth  one last time  signaling flora .  i didn t dare let matters go till i reached her place .  the additional half hour might just give her time to get someone else  if she hadn t already .   make her answer .  make her answer .  make her     she answered  but she was in formal clothes .  she was going out and i had obviously caught her by two minutes .    i am going out   she announced .   some men can be decent .  and i do not wish to see you in the henceforward .  i do not wish ever to find my eyes upon you .  you will do me a great favor  mister whoeveryouare  if you will unhand my signal combination and never pollute it with         i wasn t saying anything .  i was just standing there holding my breath and also holding the chit up where she could see it .  just standing there .  just holding .   sure enough  at the word  pollute  she came in for a closer look .  she wasn t much on education  that girl  but she could read  ten thousand credits  faster than any college graduate in the solar system .   she said   max .  for me .     all for you  baby   i said .   i told you i had a little business to do .  i wanted to surprise you .     oh max that s sweet of you .  i didn t really mind .  i was joking .  now you come right here to me .   she took off her coat  which with fiora is a very interesting action to watch .    what about your date  .   i said .    i said i was joking   she said .  she  . dropped her coat gently to the floor  and toyed with a brooch that seemed to hold together what there was of her dress .    i m coming   i said faintly .    with every single one of those credits now   she said roguishly .    with every single one   i said .   i broke contact  stepped out of the booth  and now  finally  i was set  really set .   i heard my name called .    max .  max .   someone was running toward me .   rog grinton said i would find you here .  mama s all right after all  so i got special passage on the space eater and what s this about ten thousand credits .    i didn t turn .  i said   hello  hilda .    i stood rock steady .   and then i turned and did the hardest thing i ever succeeded in doing in all my goddam  good for nothing  space hopping life .   i smiled .   foreword  this requires a little explanation .   marooned off vesta   the first of this connected pair of stories  is not a mystery in any way .  it does  however  happen to be the first story i ever published .  when the twentieth anniversary of that first publication approached  the editors of the magazine in which it had appeared asked me if i would write a story to mark the anniversary .  i did  and with predictable corniness this second story   anniversary   dealt with the meeting of the characters of the first story on the twentieth anniversary of the events in that first story .  and the pair of stories  taken together  make a mystery .  i think it only fair to tell the gentle reader that very little of that first published story has been changed .  if my inexperience shows   i was in my teens when it was published   forgive me .  what s more  to meet the suspicions of some readers who never read the story in its first appearance   not having been born at the time   i did not change one word of the first story in order to make it easier to plot the mystery in the second .  it is a sobering thought that when this book appears the thirtieth anniversary of that first publication will be only a year away .       marooned off vesta   will you please stop walking up and down like that .   said warren moore from the couch .   it won t do any of us any good .  think of our blessings  we re airtight  aren t we .    mark brandon whirled and ground his teeth at him .   i m glad you feel happy about that   he spat out viciously .   of course  you don t know that our air supply will last only three days .   he resumed his interrupted stride with a defiant air .   moore yawned and stretched  assumed a more comfortable position  and replied .   expending all that energy will only use it up faster .  why don t you take a hint from mike here .  he s taking it easy .     mike  was michael shea  late a member of the crew of the silver queen .  his short  squat body was resting on the only chair in the room and his feet were on the only table .  he looked up as his name was mentioned  his mouth widening in a twisted grin .    you ve got to expect things like this to happen sometimes   he said .   bucking the asteroids is risky business .  we should ve taken the hop .  it takes longer  but it s the only safe way .  but no  the captain wanted to make the schedule  he would go through    mike spat disgustedly    and here we are .     what s the  hop   .   asked brandon .    oh  i take it that friend mike means that we should have avoided the asteroid belt by plotting a course outside the plane of the ecliptic   answered moore .  that s it  isn t it  mike .    mike hesitated and then replied cautiously   yeah   i guess that s it .    moore smiled blandly and continued   well  i wouldn t blame captain crane too much .  the repulsion screen must have failed five minutes before that chunk of granite barged into us .  that s not his fault  though of course we ought to have steered clear instead of relying on the screen .   he shook his head meditatively .  the silver queen just went to pieces .  it s really miraculously lucky that this part of the ship remained intact  and what s more  airtight .     you ve got a funny idea of luck  warren   said brandon .   always have  for as long as i ve known you .  here we are in a tenth part of a spaceship  comprising only three whole rooms  with air for three days  and no prospect of being alive after that  and you have the infernal gall to prate about luck .     compared to the others who died instantly when the asteroid struck  yes   was moore s answer .    you think so  eh  .  well  let me tell you that instant death isn t so bad compared with what we re going to have to go through .  suffocation is a damned unpleasant way of dying .     we may find a way out   moore suggested hopefully .    why not face facts .   brandon s face was flushed and his voice trembled .   we re done  i tell you .  through .    mike glanced from one to the other doubtfully and then coughed to attract their attention .   well  gents  seeing that we re all in the same fix  i guess there s no use hogging things .   he drew a small bottle out of his pocket that was filled with a greenish liquid .   grad a jabra this is .  i ain t too proud to share and share alike .    brandon exhibited the first signs of pleasure for over a day .   martian jabra water .  why didn t you say so before .    but as he reached for it  a firm hand clamped down upon his wrist .  he looked up into the calm blue eyes of warren moore .    don t be a fool   said moore   there isn t enough to keep us drunk for three days .  what do you want to do  .  go on a tear now and then die cold sober  .  let s save this for the last six hours when the air gets stuffy and breathing hurts   then we ll finish the bottle among as and never know when the end comes or care .    brandon s hand fell away reluctantly .   damn it  warren  you d bleed ice if you were cut .  how can you think straight at a time like this .   he motioned to mike and the bottle was once more stowed away .  brandon walked to the porthole and gazed out .   moore approached and placed a kindly arm over the shoulders of the younger man .   why take it so hard  man .   he asked .   you can t last at this rate .  inside of twenty four hours you ll be a madman if you keep this up .    there was no answer .  brandon stared bitterly at the globe that filled almost the entire porthole  so moore continued   watching vesta won t do you any good either .    mike shea lumbered up to the porthole .   we d be safe if we were only down there on vesta .  there re people there .  how far away are we .     not more than three or four hundred miles judging from its apparent size   answered moore .   you must remember that it is only two hundred miles in diameter .     three hundred miles from salvation   murmured brandon   and we might as well be a million .  if there were only a way to get ourselves out of the orbit this rotten fragment adopted .  you know  manage to give ourselves a push so as to start falling .  there d be no danger of crashing if we did  because that midget hasn t got enough gravity to crush a cream puff .     it has enough to keep us in the orbit   retorted brandon .   it must have picked us up while we were lying unconscious after the crash .  wish it had come closer  we might have been able to land on it .     funny place  vesta   observed mike shea .   i was down there two three times .  what a dump .  it s all covered with some stuff like snow  only it ain t snow .  i forget what they call it .     frozen carbon dioxide .   prompted moore  yeah  dry ice .  that carbon stuff  that s it .  they say that s what makes vesta so shiny .    of course .  that would give it a high albedo .    mike cocked a suspicious eye at moore and decided to let it pass .   it s hard to see anything down there on account of the snow  but if you look close    he pointed    you can see a sort of gray smudge .  i think that s bennett s dome .  that s where they keep the observatory .  and there is calorn s dome up there .  that s a fuel station  that is .  there re plenty more  too  only i don t see them .    he hesitated and then turned to moore .   listen  boss  i ve been thinking .  wouldn t they be looking for us as soon as they hear about the crash . and wouldn t we be easy to find from vesta  seeing we re so close .    moore shook his head   no  mike  they won t be looking for us .  no one s going to find out about the crash until the silver queen fails to turn up on schedule .  you see  when the asteroid hit  we didn t have time to send out an sos    he sighed    and they won t find us down there at vesta  either .  we re so small that even at our distance they couldn t see us unless they knew what they were looking for  and exactly where to look .     hmm .   mike s forehead was corrugated in deep thought .  then we ve got to get to vesta before three days are up .     you ve got the gist of the matter  mike .  now  if we only knew how to go about it  eh  .    brandon suddenly exploded   will you two stop this infernal chitter chatter and do something  .  for god s sake  do something .    moore shrugged his shoulders and without answer returned to the couch .  he lounged at ease  apparently carefree  but there was the tiniest crease between his eyes which bespoke concentration .   there was no doubt about it  they were in a bad spot .  he reviewed the events of the preceding day for perhaps the twentieth time .   after the asteroid had struck  tearing the ship apart  he d gone out like a light  for how long he didn t know  his own watch being broken and no other timepiece available .  when he came to  he found himself  along with mark brandon  who shared his room  and mike shea  a member of the crew  sole occupants of all that was left of the silver queen .  this remnant was now careening in an orbit about vesta .  at present  things were fairly comfortable .  there was a food supply that would last a week .  likewise there was a regional gravitator under the room that kept them at normal weight and continue to do so for an indefinite time  certainly for longer than the air would last .  the lighting system was less satisfactory but had held on so far .   there was no doubt  however  where the joker in the pack lay .  three days  air .  not that there weren t other disheartening features .  there was no heating system   though it would take a long time for the ship to radiate enough heat into the vacuum of space to render them too uncomfortable .  far more important was the fact that their part of the ship had neither a means of communication nor a propulsive mechanism .  moore sighed .  one fuel jet in working order would fix everything  for one blast in the right direction would send them safely to vesta .   the crease between his eyes deepened .  what was to be done .  they had but one spacesuit among them  one heat ray  and one detonator .  that was the sum total of space appliances after a thorough search of the accessible parts of the ship .  a pretty hopeless mess  that .   moore shrugged  rose  and drew himself a glass of water .  he swallowed it mechanically  still deep in thought  when an idea struck him .  he glanced curiously at the empty cup in his hand .    say  mike   he said   what kind of water supply have we  .  funny that i never thought of that before .    mike s eyes opened to their fullest extent in an expression of ludicrous surprise .   didn t you know  boss .     know what .   asked moore impatiently .    we ve got all the water there was .   he waved his hand in an all inclusive gesture .  he paused  but as moore s expression showed nothing but total mystification  he elaborated   don t you see  .  we ve got the main tank  the place where all the water for the whole ship was stored .   he pointed to one of the walls .    do you mean to say that there s a tank full of water adjoining us .    mike nodded vigorously   yep .  cubic vat a hundred feet each way .  and she s three quarters full .    moore was astonished .   seven hundredand fifty thousand cubic feetof water .  then suddenly  why hasn t it run out through the broken pipes  .     it only has one main outlet  which runs down the corridor just outside this room .  i was fixing that main when the asteroid hit and had to shut it off .  after i came to i opened the pipe leading to our faucet  but that s the only outlet open now .     oh .   moore had a curious feeling way down deep inside .  an idea had half formed in his brain  but for the life of him he could not drag it into the light of day .  he knew only that there was something in what he had just heard that had some important meaning but he just could not place his finger on it .   brandon  meanwhile  had been listening to shea in silence  and now he emitted a short  humorless laugh .   fate seems to be having its fill of fun with us  i see .  first  it puts us within arm s reach of a place of safety and then sees to it that we have no way of getting there .    then she provides us with a week s food  three days  air  and a year s supply of water .  a year s supply  do you hear me  .  enough water to drink and to gargle and to wash and to take baths in and   and to do anything else we want .  water   damn the water .     oh  take a less serious view  mark   said moore in an attempt to break the younger man s melancholy .   pretend we re a satellite of vesta   which we are .  we have our own period of revolution and of rotation .  we have an equator and an axis .  our  north pole  is located somewhere toward the top of the porthole  pointing toward vesta  and our  south  sticks out away from vesta through the water tank somewhere .  well  as a satellite  we have an atmosphere  and now  you see  we have a newly discovered ocean .    and seriously  we re not so badly off .  for the three days our atmosphere will last  we can eat double rations and drink ourselves soggy .  hell  we have water enough to throw away         the idea which had been half formed before suddenly sprang to maturity and was nailed .  the careless gesture with which he had accompanied the last remark was frozen in mid air .  his mouth closed with a snap and his head came up with a jerk .   but brandon  immersed in his own thoughts  noticed nothing of moore s strange actions .   why don t you complete the analogy to a satellite   he sneered   or do you  as a professional optimist  ignore any and all disagreeable facts  .  if i were you  i d continue this way .   here he imitated moore s voice  the satellite is at present habitable and inhabited but  due to the approaching depletion of its atmosphere in three days  is expected to become a dead world .    well  why don t you answer .  why do you persist in making a joke out of this .  can t you see       what s the matter .    the last was a surprised exclamation and certainly moore s actions did merit surprise .  he had risen suddenly and  after giving himself a smart rap on the forehead  remained stiff and silent  staring into the far distance with gradually narrowing eyelids .  brandon and mike shea watched him in speechless astonishment .   suddenly moore burst out   ha .  i ve got it .  why didn t i think of it before .   his exclamations degenerated into the unintelligible .   mike drew out the jabra bottle with a significant look  but moore waved it away impatiently .  whereupon brandon  without any warning  lashed out with his right  catching the surprised moore flush on the jaw and toppling him .   moore groaned and rubbed his chin .  somewhat indignant  he asked   what was the reason for that .     stand up and i ll do it again   shouted brandon   i can t stand it anymore .  i m sick and tired of being preached at and having to listen to your pollyanna talk .  you re the one that s going daffy .     daffy  nothing .  just a little overexcited  that s all .  listen  for god s sake .  i think i know a way         brandon glared at him balefully .   oh  you do  do  you .  raise our hopes with some silly scheme and then find it doesn t work .  i won t take it  do you hear .  i ll find a real use for the water   drown you   and save some of the air besides .    moore lost his temper .   listen  mark  you re out of this .  i m going through alone .  i don t need your help and i don t want it .  if you re that sure of dyingand that afraid  why not havethe agony over .  we ve got oneheat ray and one detonator  both reliable weapons .  take your choice and kill yourself .  shea and i won t interfere .   brandon s lip curled in a last weak gesture of defiance and then suddenly he capitulated  completely and abjectly .   all right  warren  i m with you .  i   i guess i didn t quite know what i was doing .  i don t feel well  warren .  i   i          aw  that s all right  boy .   moore was genuinely sorry for him .   take it easy .  i know how you feel .  it s got me too .  but you mustn t give in to it .  fight it  or you ll go stark  raving mad .  now you just try and get some sleep and leave everything to me .  things will turn out right yet .    brandon  pressing a hand to an aching forehead  stumbled to the couch and tumbled down .  silent sobs shook his frame while moore and shea remained in embarrassed silence nearby .   at last moore nudged mike .   come on   he whispered  let s get busy .  we re going places .  airlock five is at the end of the corridor  isn t it .   shea nodded and moore continued   is it airtight .     well   said shea after some thought   the inner door is  of course  but i don t know anything about the outer one .  for all i know it may be a sieve .  you see  when i tested the wall for airtightness  i didn t dare open the inner door  because if there was anything wrong with the outer one   blooey .   the accompanying gesture was very expressive .   then it s up to us to find out about that outer door right now .  i ve got to get outside some way and we ll just have to take chances .  where s the spacesuit .    he grabbed the lone suit from its place in the cupboard  threw it over his shoulder and led the way into the long corridor that ran down the side of the room .  he passed closed doors behind whose airtight barriers were what once had been passenger quarters but which were now merely cavities  open to space .  at the end of the corridor was the tight fitting door of airlock   .   moore stopped and surveyed it appraisingly .   looks all right   he observed   but of course you can t tell what s outside .  god  i hope it ll work .   he frowned .   of course we could use the entire corridor as an airlock  with the door to our room as the inner door and this as the outer door  but that would mean the loss of half our air supply .  we can t afford that   yet .    he turned to shea .    . all right  now .  the indicator shows that the lock was last used for entrance  so it should be full ofair .  open the door the tiniest crack  and if there s a hissing noise  shut it quick .      here goes   and the lever moved one notch .  the mechanism had been severely shaken up during the shock of the crash and its former noiseless workings had given way to a harsh  rasping sound  but it was still in commission .  a thin black line appeared on the left hand side of the lock  marking where lie door had slid a fraction of an inch on the runners .   there was no hiss .  moore s look of anxiety faded somewhat .  he took a small pasteboard from his pocket and held it against the crack .  if air were leaking  that card should have held there  pushed by the escaping gas .  it fell to the floor .   mike shea stuck a forefinger in his mouth and then put it against the crack .   thank the lord   he breathed   not a sign of a draft .     good  good .  open it wider .  go ahead .    another notch and the crack opened farther .  and still no draft .  slowly  ever so slowly  notch by notch  it creaked its way wider and wider .  the two men held their breaths  afraid that while not actually punctured  the outer door might have been so weakened as to give way any moment .  but it held .  moore was jubilant as he wormed into the spacesuit .   things are going fine so far  mike   he said .   you sit down right here and wait for me .  i don t know how long i ll take  but i ll be back .  where s the heat ray .  have you got it .    shea held out the ray and asked   but what are you going to do  .  i d sort of like to know .    moore paused as he was about to buckle on the helmet .   did you hear me say inside that we had water enough to throw away  .  well  i ve been thinking it over and that s not such a bad idea .  i m going to throw it away .   with no other explanation  he stepped into the lock  leaving behind him a very puzzled mike shea .   it was with a pounding heart that moore waited for the outer door to open .  his plan was an extraordinarily simple one  but it might not be easy to carry out .   there was a sound of creaking gears and scraping ratchets .  air sighed away to nothingness .  the door before him slid open a few inches and stuck .  moore s heart sank as for a moment he thought it would not open at all  but after a few preliminary jerks and rattles the barrier slid the rest of the way .   he clicked on the magnetic grapple and very cautiously put a foot out into space .  clumsily he groped his way out to the side of the ship .  he had never been outside a ship in open space before and a vast dread overtook him as he clung there  flylike  to his precarious perch .  for a moment dizziness overcame him .   he closed his eyes and for five minutes hung there  clutching the smooth sides of what had once been the silver queen .  the magnetic grapple held him firm and when he opened his eyes once more he found his self confidence in a measure returned .   he gazed about him .  for the first time since the crash he saw the stars instead of the vision of vesta which their porthole afforded .  eagerly he searched the skies for the little blue white speck that was earth .  it had often amused him that earth should always be the first object sought by space travelers when star gazing  but the humor of the situation did not strike him now .  however  his search was in vain .  from where he lay  earth was invisible .  it  as well as the sun  must be hidden behind vesta .   still  there was much else that he could not help but note .  jupiter was off to the left  a brilliant globe the size of a small pea to the naked eye .  moore observed two of its attendant satellites .  saturn was visible too  as a brilliant planet of some negative magnitude  rivaling venus as seen from earth .   moore had expected that a goodly number of asteroids would be visible   marooned as they were in the asteroid belt   but space seemed surprisingly empty .  once he thought he could see a hurtling body pass within a few miles  but so fast had the impression come and gone that he could not swear that it was not fancy .   and then  of course  there was vesta .  almost directly below him it loomed like a balloon filling a quarter of the sky .  it floated steadily  snowy white  andmoore gazed at it with earnest longing .  a good hard kick against the side of theship  he thought  might start him falling toward vesta .  he might land safely and get help for the others .  but the chance was too great that he would merely take on a new orbit about vesta .  no  it would have to be better than that .   this reminded him that he had no time to lose .  he scanned the side of the ship  looking for the water tank  but all he could see was a jungle of jutting walls  jagged  crumbling  and pointed .  he hesitated .  evidently the only thing to do was to make for the lighted porthole to their room and proceed to the tank from there .   carefully he dragged himself along the wall of the ship .  not five yards from the lock the smoothness stopped abruptly .  there was a yawning cavity which moore recognized as having once been the room adjoining the corridor at the far end .  he shuddered .  suppose he were to come across a bloated dead body in one of those rooms .  he had known most of the passengers  many of them personally .  but he overcame his squeamishness and forced himself to continue his precarious journey toward its goal .   and here he encountered his first practical difficulty .  the room itself was made of non ferrous material in many parts .  the magnetic grapple was intended for use only on outer hulls and was useless throughout much of the ship s interior .  moore had forgotten this when suddenly he found himself floating down an incline  his grapple out of use .  he gasped and clutched at a nearby projection .  slowly he pulled himself back to safety .   he lay for a moment  almost breathless .  theoretically he should be weightless out here in space   vesta s influence being negligible   but the regional gravitator under his room was working .  without the balance of the other gravitators  it tended to place him under variable and suddenly shifting stresses as he kept changing his position .  for his magnetic grapple to let go suddenly might mean being jerked away from the ship altogether .  and then what .   evidently this was going to be evenmore difficult than he had thought .   he inched forward in a crawl  testing each spot to see if the grapple would hold .  sometimes he had to make long  circuitous journeys to gain a few feet s headway and at other times he was forced to scramble and slip across small patches of non ferrous material .  and always there was that tiring pull of the gravitator  continually changing directions as he progressed  setting horizontal floors and vertical walls at queer and almost haphazard angles .   carefully he investigated all objects that he came across .  but it was a barren search .  loose articles  chairs  tables had been jerked away at the first shock  probably  and now were independent bodies of the solar system .  he did manage  however  to pick up a small field glass and fountain pen .  these he placed in his pocket .  they were valueless under present conditions  but somehow they seemed to make more real this macabre trip across the sides of a dead ship .   for fifteen minutes  twenty  half an hour  he labored slowly toward where he thought the porthole should be .  sweat poured down into his eyes and rendered his hair a matted mass .  his muscles were beginning to ache under the unaccustomed strain .  his mind  already strained by the ordeal of the previous day  was beginning to waver  to play him tricks .   the crawl began to seem eternal  something that had always existed and would exist forever .  the object of the journey  that for which he was striving  seemed unimportant  he only knew that it was necessary to move .  the time  one hour back  when he had been with brandon and shea  seemed hazy and lost in the far past .  that more normal time  two days  age  wholly forgotten .   only the jagged walls before him  only the vital necessity of getting at some uncertain destination existed in his spinning brain .  grasping  straining  pulling .  feeling for the iron alloy .  up and into gaping holes that were rooms and then out again .  feel and pull   feel and pull   and   a light .   moore stopped .  had he not been glued to the wall he would have fallen .  somehow that light seemed to clear things .  it was the porthole  not the many dark  staring ones he had passed  but alive and alight .  behind it was brandon .  a deep breath and he felt better  his mind cleared .   and now his way lay plain before him .  toward that spark of life he crept .  nearer  and nearer  and nearer until he could touch it .  he was there .   his eyes drank inthe familiar room .  god knows that it hadn t any happy associations in his mind  but it was something real  something almost natural .  brandon slept on the couch .  his face was worn and lined but a smile passed over it now and then .   moore raised his fist to knock .  he felt the urgent desire to talk with someone  if only by sign language  yet at the last instant he refrained .  perhaps the kid was dreaming of home .  he was young and sensitive and had suffered much .  let him sleep .  time enough to wake him when   and if   his idea had been carried through .   he located the wall within the room behind which lay the water tank and then tried to spot it from the outside .  now it was not difficult  its rear wall stood out prominently .  moore marveled  for it seemed a miracle that it had escaped puncture .  perhaps the fates had not been so ironic after all .   passage to it was easy though it was on the other side of the fragment .  what was once a corridor led almost directly to it .  once when the silver queen had been whole  that corridor had been level and horizontal  but now  under the unbalanced pull of the regional gravitator  it seemed more of a steep incline than anything else .  and yet it made the path simple .  since it was of uniform beryl steel  moore found no trouble holding on as he wormed up the twenty odd feet to the water supply .   and now the crisis   the last stage   had been reached .  he felt that he ought to rest first  but his excitement grew rapidly in intensity .  it was either now or bust .  he pulled himself out to the button center of the tank .  there  resting on the small ledge formed by the floor of the corridor that had once extended on that side of the tank  he began operations .    it s a pity that the main pipe is pointing in the wrong direction   he muttered .   it would have saved me a lot of trouble had it been right .  as it is .  .  .   he sighed and bent to his work .  the heat ray was adjusted to maximum concentration and the invisible enamations focused at a spot perhaps a foot above the floor of the tank .   gradually the effect of the excitatory beam upon the molecules of the wall became noticeable .  a spot the size of a dime began shining faintly at the point of focus of the ray gun .  it wavered uncertainly  now dimming  now brightening  as moore strove to steady his tired arm .  he propped it on the ledge and achieved better results as the tiny circle of radiation brightened .   slowly the color ascended the spectrum .  the dark  angry red that had first appeared lightened to a cherry color .  as the heat continued pouring in  the brightness seemed to ripple out in widening areas  like a target made of successively deepening tints of red .  the wall for a distance of some feet from the focal point was becoming uncomfortably hot even though it did not glow and moore found it necessary to refrain from touching it with the metal of his suit .   moore cursed steadily  for the ledge itself was also growing hot .  it seemed that only imprecations could soothe him .  and as the melting wall began to radiate heat in its own right  the chief object of his maledictions were the spacesuit manufacturers .  why didn t they build a suit that could keep heat out as well as keep it in  .   but what brandon called professional optimism crept up .  with the salt tang of perspiration in his mouth  he kept consoling himself   it could be worse  i suppose .  at least  the two inches of wall here don t present too much of a barrier .  suppose the tank had been built flush against the outer hull .  whew .  imagine trying to melt through a foot of this .   he gritted his teeth and kept on .   the spot of brightness was now flickering into the orange yellow and moore knew that the melting point of the beryl steel alloy would soon be reached .  he found himself forced to watch the spot only at widely spaced intervals and then only for fleeting moments .   evidently it would have to be done quickly if it were to be done at all .  the heat ray had not been fully loaded in the first place  and  pouring out energy at maximum as it had been doing for almost ten minutes now  must be approaching exhaustion .  yet the wall was just barely passing the plastic stage .  in a fever of impatience moore jammed the muzzle of the gun directly at the center of the spot  drawing it back speedily .   a deep depression formed in the soft metal  but a puncture had not been formed .  however  moore was satisfied .  he was almost there now .  had there been air between himself and the wall  he would undoubtedly have heard the gurgling and the hissing of the steaming water within .  the pressure was building up .  how long would the weakened wall endure .   then  so suddenly that moore did not realize it for a few moments  he was through .  a tiny fissure formed at the bottom of that little pit made by the ray gun and in less time than it takes to imagine  die churning water within had its way .   the soft  liquid metal at that spot puffed out  sticking out raggedly around a pea sized hole .  and from that hole there came a hissing and a roaring .  a cloud of steam emerged and enveloped moore .   through the mist he could see the steam condense almost immediately to ice droplets and saw these icy pellets shrink rapidly into nothingness .   for fifteen minutes he watched the steam shoot out .   then he became aware of a gentle pressure pushing him away from the ship .  a savage joy welled up within him as he realized that this was the effect of acceleration on the ship s part .  his own inertia was holding him back .   that meant his work had been finished   and successfully .  that stream of water was substituting for the rocket blast he started back .   if the horrors and dangers of the journey to the tank had been great  those of the way back should have been greater .  he was infinitely more tired  his aching eyes were all but blind  and added to the crazy pull of the gravitator was the force induced by the varying acceleration of the ship .  but whatever his labors to return  they did not bother him .  in later time  he never even remembered the heartbreaking trip .   how he managed to negotiate the distance in safety he did not know .  most of the time he was lost in a haze of happiness  scarcely realizing the actualities of the situation .  his mind was filled with one thoughtonly   to get back quickly to tell thehappy news of theirescape .   suddenly he found himself before the airlock .  he hardly grasped the fact that it was the airlock .  he almost did not understand why he pressed the signal button .  some instinct told him it was the thing to do .   mike shea was waiting .  there was a creak and a rumble and the outer door started opening  caught  and stopped at the same place as before  but once again it managed to slide the rest of the way .  it closed behind moore  then the inner door opened and he stumbled into shea s arms .   as in a dream he felt himself half pulled  half carried down the corridor to the room .  his suit was ripped off .  a hot  burning liquid stung his throat .  moore gagged  swallowed  and felt better .  shea pocketed the jabra bottle once more .   the blurred  shifting images of brandon and shea before him steadied and became solid .  moore wiped the perspiration from his face with a trembling hand and essayed a weak smile .    wait   protested brandon   don t say anything .  you look half dead .  rest  will you .    but moore shook his head .  in a hoarse  cracked voice he narrated as well as he could the events of the past two hours .  the tale was incoherent  scarcely intelligible but marvelously impressive .  the two listeners scarcely breathed during the recital .    you mean   stammered brandon   that the water spout is pushing us toward vesta  like a rocket exhaust .     exactly   same thing as   rocket exhaust   panted moore .    action  . and reaction .  is located   on side opposite vesta    hence pushing us toward vesta .    shea was dancing before the porthole .   he s right  brandon  me boy .  you can make out bennett s dome as clear as day .  we re getting there  we re getting there .    moore felt himself recovering .   we re approaching in spiral path on account of original orbit .  we ll land in five or six hours probably .  the water will last for quite a long while and the pressure is still great  since the water issues as steam .     steam   at the low temperature of space .   brandon was surprised .    steam   at the low pressure of space .   corrected moore .  the boiling point of water falls with the pressure .  it is very low indeed in a vacuum even ice has a vapor pressure sufficient to sublime .    he smiled .   as a matter of fact it freezes and boils at the same time .  i watched it .   a short pause  then   well  how do you feel now  brandon .  much better  eh .    brandon reddened and his face fell .  he groped vainly for words for a few moments .  finally he said in a half whisper   you know  i must have acted like a damn fool and a coward at first .  i   i guess i don t deserve all this after going to pieces and letting the burden of our escape rest on your shoulders .    i wish you d beat me up  or something  for punching you before .  it d make me feel better .  i mean it .   and he really did seem to mean it .   moore gave him an affectionate push .   forget it .  you ll never know how near i came to breaking down myself .   he raised his voice in order to drown out any further apologies on brandon s part   hey  mike  stop staring out of that porthole and bring over that jabra bottle .    mike obeyed with alacrity  bringing with him three plexatron units to be used as makeshift cups .  moore filled each precisely to the brim .  he was going to be drunk with a vengeance .    gentlemen   he said solemnly   a toast .   the three raised the mugs in unison   gentlemen  i give you the year s supply of good old h o we used to have .    anniversary  the annual ritual was all set .   it was the turn of moore s house this year  of course  and mrs .  moore and the children had resignedly gone to her mother s for the evening .   warren moore surveyed the room with a faint smile .  only mark brandon s enthusiasm kept it going at the first  but he himself had come to like this mild remembrance .  it came with age  he supposed  twenty additional years of it .  he had grown paunchy thin haired  soft jowled  and     worst of all   sentimental .   so an the windows were polarized into complete darkness and the drapes were drawn .  only occasional stipples of wall were illuminated  thus celebrating the poor lighting and the terrible isolation of that day of wreckage long ago .   there were spaceship rations in sticks and tubes on the table and  of course  in the center an unopened bottle of sparkling green jabra water  the potent brew that only the chemical activity of martian fungi could supply .   moore looked at his watch .  brandon would be here soon  he was never late for this occasion .  the only thing that disturbed him was the memory of brandon s voice on the tube   warren  i have a surprise for you this time .  wait and see .  wait and see .    brandon  it always seemed to moore  aged little .  the younger man had kept his slimness  and the intensity with which he greeted all in life  to the verge of his fortieth birthday .  he retained the ability to be in high excitement over the good and in deep despair over the bad .  his hair was going gray  but except for that  when brandon walked up and down  talking rapidly at the top of his voice about anything at all  moore didn t even have to close his eyes to see the panicked youngster on the wreck of the silver queen .  the door signal sounded and moore kicked the release without turning round .   come  mark .    it was a strange voice that answered  though  softly  tentatively   mr .  moore .    moore turned quickly .  brandon was there  to be sure  but only in the background  grinning with excitement .  someone else was standing before him  short  squat  quite bald  nut brown and with the feel of space about him .   moore said wonderingly   mike shea   mike shea  by all space .    they pounded hands together  laughing .   brandon said   he got in touch with me through the office .  he remembered i was with atomic products          it s been years   said moore .   lets see  you were on earth twelve years ago          he s never been here on an anniversary   said brandon .   how about that .  he s retiring now .  getting out of space to a place he s buying in arizona .  he came to say hello before he left   stopped off at the city just for that   and i was sure he came for the anniversary .   what anniversary .   says the old jerk .    shea nodded  grinning .   he said you made a kind of celebration out of it every year .     you bet   said brandon enthusiastically   and this will be the first one with all three of us here  the first real anniversary .  it s twenty years  mike  twenty years since warren scrambled over what was left of the wreck and brought us down to vesta .    shea looked about .   space ration  eh .  that s old home week to me .  and jabra .  oh  sure  i remember  .  .  .  twenty years .  i never give it a thought and now  all of a sudden  it s yesterday .  remember when we got back to earth finally .     do i .   said brandon .  the parades  the speeches .  warren was the only real hero of the occasion and we kept saying so  and they kept paying no attention .  remember .     oh  well   said moore .   we were the first three men ever to survive a spaceship crash we were unusual and anything unusual is worth a celebration .  these things are irrational .     hey   said shea   any of you remember the songs they wrote .  that marching one .   you can sing of routes through space and the weary maddened pace of the          brandon joined in with his clear tenor and even moore added his voice to the chorus so that the last line was loud enough to shake the drapes .   on the wreck of the silver que e en   they roared out  and ended laughing wildly .   brandon said   let s open the jabra for the first little sip .   this one bottle has to last all of us all night .    moore said   mark insists on complete authenticity .  i m surprised he doesn t expect me to climb out the window and human fly my way around the building .     well  now  that s an idea   said brandon .    remember the last toast we made .   shea held his empty glass before him and intoned     gentlemen  i give you the year s supply of good old h o we used to have .   three drunken bums when we landed .  well  we were kids .  i was thirty and i thought i was old .  and now   his voice was suddenly wistful   they ve retired me .     drink .  said brandon .  today you rethirty again  and we remember the day on the silver queen even if no one else does .  dirty  fickle public .    moore laughed .   what do you expect  .  a national holiday every year with space ration and jabra the ritual food and drink .     listen  we re still the only men ever to survive a spaceship crash and now look at us .  we re in oblivion .     it s pretty good oblivion .  we had a good time to begin with and the publicity gave us a healthy boost up the ladder .  we are doing well  mark .  and so would mike shea be if he hadn t wanted to return to space .    shea grinned and shrugged his shoulders .   that s where i like to be .  i m not sorry  either .  what with the insurance compensation i got  i have a nice piece of cash now to retire on .    brandon said reminiscently   the wreck set back trans space insurance a real packet .  just the same  there s still something missing .  you say  silver queen  to anyone these days and he can only think of quentin  if he can think of anyone .     who .   said shea .    quentin .  dr .  horace quentin .  he was one of the non survivors on the ship .  you say to anyone   what about the three men who survived .   and they ll just stare at you   huh .   they ll say .    moore said calmly   come  mark  face it .  dr .  quentin was one of the world s great scientists and we three are just three of the world s nothings .     we survived .  we re still the only men on record to survive .     so .  look  john hester was on the ship  and he was an important scientist too .  not in quentin s league  but important .  as a matter of fact  i was next to him at the last dinner before the rock hit us .  well  just because quentin died in the same wreck  hester s death was drowned out .  no one ever remembers hester died on the silver queen .  they only remember quentin .  we may be forgotten too  but at least we re alive .     i tell you what   said brandon after a period of silence during which moore s rationale had obviously failed to take   we re marooned again .  twenty years ago today  we were marooned off vesta .  today  we re marooned in oblivion .  now here are the three of us back together again at last  and what happened before can happen again .  twenty years ago  warren pulled us down to vesta .  now let s solve this new problem .     wipe out the oblivion  you mean .   said moore .   make ourselves famous .     sure .  why not .  do you know any better way of celebrating a twentieth anniversary .     no  but i d be interested to know where you expect to start .  i don t think people remember the silver queen at all  except for quentin  so you ll have to think of some way of bringing the wreck back to mind .  that s just to begin with .    shea stirred uneasily and a thoughtful expression crossed his blunt countenance .   some people remember the silver queen .  the insurance company does  and you know that s a funny thing  now that you bring up the matter .  i was on vesta about ten eleven years ago  and i asked if the piece of the wreck we brought down was still there and they said sure  who would cart it away .  so i thought i d take a look at it and shot over by reaction motor strapped to my back .  with vestan gravity  you know  a reaction motor is all you need .  anyway  i didn t get to see it except from a distance .  it was circled off by force field .    brandon s eyebrows went sky high .   our silver queen .  for what reason .     i went back and asked how come .  they didn t tell me and they said they didn t know i was going there .  they said it belonged to the insurance company .    moore nodded .   surely .  they took over when they paid off .  i signed a release  giving up my salvage rights when i accepted the compensation check .  you did too  i m sure .    brandon said   but why the force field .  why all the privacy .     i don t know .    the wreck isn t worth anything even as scrap metal .  it would cost too much to transport it .    shea said  that s right .  funny thing  though  they were bringing pieces back from space .  there was a pile of it there .  i could see it and it lookedlike just junk  twisted pieces of frame  you know .  i asked about it and they said ships were always landing and unloading more scrap  and the insurance company had a standard price for any piece of the silver queen brought back  so ships in the neighbourhood of vesta were always looking .  then  on my last voyage in  i went to see the silver queen again and that pile was a lot bigger .     you mean they re still looking .   brandon s eyes glittered .    i don t know .  maybe they ve stopped .  but the pile was bigger than it was ten eleven years ago so they were still looking then .    brandon leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs .   well  now  that s very queer .  a hard headed insurance company is spending all kinds of money  sweeping space near vesta  trying to find pieces of a twenty year old wreck .     maybe they re trying to prove sabotage   said moore .    after twenty years .  they won t get their money back even if they do .  it s a dead issue .    they may have quit looking years ago .    brandon stood up with decision .   let s ask .  there s something funny here and i m just jabrified enough and anniversaried enough to want to find out .     sure   said shea   but ask who .     ask multivac   said brandon .   shea s eyes opened wide .   multivac .  say  mr .  moore  do you have a multivac outlet here .     yes .     i ve never seen one  and i ve always wanted to .     it s nothing to look at  mike .  it looks just like a typewriter .  don t confuse a multivac outlet with multivac itself .  i don t know anyone who s seen multivac .    moore smiled at the thought .  he doubted if ever in his life he would meet any of the handful of technicians who spent most of their working days in a hidden spot in the bowels of earth tending a mile long super computer that was the repository of all the facts known to man  that guided man s economy  directed his scientific research  helped make his political decisions  and had millions of circuits left over to answer individual questions that did not violate the ethics of privacy .   brandon said as they moved up the power ramp to the second floor   i ve been thinking of installing a multivac  jr .   outlet for the kids .  homework and things  you know .  and yet i don t want to make it just a fancy and expensive crutch for them .  how do you work it  warren .    moore said tersely .  they show me the questions first .  if i don t pass them  multivac does not see them .    the multivac outlet was indeed a simple typewriter arrangement and little more .   moore set up the coordinates that opened his portion of the planet wide network of circuits and said   now listen .  for the record  i m against this and i m only going along because it s the anniversary and because i m just jackass enough to be curious .  now how ought i to phrase the question .    brandon said   just ask  are pieces of the wreck of the silver queen still being searched for in the neighborhood of vesta by trans space insurance .  it only requires a simple yes or no .    moore shrugged and tapped it out  while shea watched with awe .   the spaceman said   how does it answer .  does it talk .    moore laughed gently   oh  no .  i don t spend that kind of money .  this model just prints the answer on a slip of tape that comes out of that slot .    a short strip of tape did come out as he spoke .  moore removed it and  after a glance  said   well  multivac says yes .     hah .   cried brandon .  told you .  now ask why .     now that s silly .  a question like that would obviously be against privacy .  you ll just get a yellow state your reason .     ask and find out .  they haven t made the search for the pieces secret .  maybe they re not making the reason secret .    moore shrugged .  he tapped out  why is trans space insurance conducting its silver queen search project to which reference was made in the previous question  .   a yellow slip clicked out almost at once  state your reason for requiring the information requested .   all right   said brandon unabashed .   you tell it we re the three survivors and have a right to know .  go ahead .  tell it .    mooretapped that out unemotional phrasing and another yellow slip was pushed out at them  your reason is insufficient .  no answer can be given .   brandon said   i don t see they have a right to keep that secret .    that s up to multivac   said moore .   it judges the reasons given it and if it decides the ethics of privacy is against answering  that s it .  the government itself couldn t break those ethics without a court order  and the courts don t go against multivac once in ten years .  so what are you going to do .    brandon jumped to his feet and began the rapid walk up and down the room that was so characteristic of him .   all right  then let s figure it out for ourselves .  it s something important to justify all their trouble .  we re agreed they re not trying to find evidence of sabotage  not after twenty years .  but trans space must be looking for something  something so valuable that it s worth looking for all this time .  now what could be that valuable .     mark  you re a dreamer   said moore .   brandon obviously didn t hear him .   it can t be jewels or money or securities .  there just couldn t be enough to pay them back for what the search has already cost them .  not if the silver queen were pure gold .  what would be more valuable .     you can t judge value  mark   said moore .   a letter might be worth a hundredth of a cent as wastepaper and yet make a difference of a hundred million dollars to a corporation  depending on what s in the letter .    brandon nodded his head vigorously .   right .  documents .  valuable papers .  now who would be most likely to have papers worth billions in his possession on that trip  .     how could anyone possibly say .     how about dr .  horace quentin  .  how about that .  warren .  he s the one people remember because he was so important .  what about the papers he might have had with him .  details of a new discovery  maybe  damn it .  if i had only seen him on that trip  he might have told mesomething  just in casual conversation  you know .  did yon eversee him  warren .     not that i recall .  not to talk to .  so casual conversation with me is out too .  of course  i might have passed him at some time without knowing it .     no  you wouldn t have   said shea  suddenly thoughtful .   i think i remember something .  there was one passenger who never left his cabin .  the steward was talking about it he wouldn t even come out for meals .     and that was quentin .   said brandon  stopping his pacing and staring at the spaceman eagerly .    it might have been  mr .  brandon .  it might have been him .  i don t know that anyone said it was .  i don t remember .  but it must have been a big shot  because on a spaceship you don t fool around bringing meals to a man s cabin unless he is a big shot .     and quentin was the big shot on the trip   said brandon  with satisfaction .   so he had something in his cabin .  something very important .  something he was concealing .     he might just have been space sick   said moore   except that        he frowned and fell silent .    go ahead   said brandon urgently .   you remember something too .     maybe .  i told you i was sitting next to dr .  hester at the last dinner .  he was saying something about hoping to meet dr .  quentin on the trip and not having any luck .     sure   cried brandon   because quentin wouldn t come out of his cabin .     he didn t say that .  we got to talking about quentin .  though .  now what was it he said .   moore put his hands to his temples as though trying to squeeze out the memory of twenty years ago by main force .   i can t give you the exact words  of course  but it was something about quentin being very theatrical or a slave of drama or something like that  and they were heading out to some scientific conference on ganymede and quentin wouldn t even announce the title of his paper .     it all fits .   brandon resumed his rapid pacing .   he had a new  great discovery  which he was keeping absolutely secret  because he was going to spring it on the ganymede conference and get maximum drama out of it .  he wouldn t come out of his cabin because he probably thought hester would pump him   and hester would  i ll bet .  and then the ship hittherock and quentin was killed .  trans space insuranceinvestigated  got rumors of this new discovery and figured that if they gained control of it they could make back their losses and plenty more .  so they took ownership of the ship and have been hunting for quentin s papers among the pieces ever since .    moore smiled  in absolute affection for the other man .   mark  that s a beautiful theory .  the whole evening is worth it  just watching you make something out of nothing .     oh  yeah  .  something out of nothing  .  let s ask multivac again .  i ll pay the bill for it this month .     it s all right .  be my guest .  if you don t mind  though  i m going to bring up the bottle of jabra .  i want one more little shot to catch up with you .     me  too   said shea .   brandon took his seat at the typewriter .  his fingers trembled with eagerness as he tapped out  what was the nature of dr .  horace quentin s final investigations  .   moore had returned with the bottle and glasses  when the answer came back  on white paper this time .  the answer was long and the print was fine  consisting for the most part of references to scientific papers in journals twenty years old .   moore went over it .   i m no physicist  but it looks to me as though he was interested in optics .    brandon shook his head impatiently .   but all that is published .  we want something he had not published yet .     we ll never find out anything about that .    the insurance company did .    that s just your theory .    brandon was kneading his chin with an unsteady hand .   let me ask multivac one more question .    he sat down again and tapped out  give me the name and tube number of the surviving colleagues of dr .  horace quentin from among those associated with him at the university on whose faculty he served .    how do you know he was on a university faculty .   asked moore .    if not  multivac will tell us .    a slip popped out .  it contained only one name .   moore said   are you planning to call the man  .     i sure am   said brandon .   otis fitzsimmons  with a detroit tube number .  warren  may i          be my guest  mark .  it s still part of the game .    brandon set up the combination on moore s tube keyboard .  a woman s voice answered .  brandon asked for dr .  fitzsimmons and there was a short wait .   then a thin voice said   hello .   it sounded old .   brandon said   dr .  fitzsimmons  i m representing trans space insurance in the matter of the late dr .  horace quentin          for heaven s sake  mark   whispered moore  but brandon held up a sharply restraining hand .   there was a pause so long that a tube breakdown began to seem possible and then the old voice said   after all these years .  again .    brandon snapped his fingers in an irrepressible gesture of triumph .  but he said smoothly  almost glibly   we re still trying to find out  doctor  if you have remembered further details about what dr .  quentin might have had with him on that last trip that would pertain to his last unpublished discovery .     well    there was an impatient clicking of the tongue     i ve told you  i don t know .  i don t want to be bothered with this again .  i don t know that there was anything .  the man hinted  but he was always hinting about some gadget or other .     what gadget  sir .     i tell you i don t know .  he used a name once and i told you about that .  i don t think it s significant .     we don t have the name in our records  sir .     well  you should have .  uh  what was that name .  an optikon  that s it .     with a k .     c or k .  i don t know or care .  now  please  i do not wish to be disturbed again about this .  good bye .   he was still mumbling querulously when the line went dead .   brandon was pleased .   moore said   mark  that was the stupidest thing you could have done .  claiming a fraudulent identity on the tube is illegal .  if he wants to make trouble for you          why should he .  he s forgotten about it already .  but don t you see  warren .  trans space has been asking him about this .  he kept saying he d explained all this before .    all right .  but you d assumed that much .  what else do you know .     we also know   said brandon   that quentin s gadget was called on optikon .     fitzsimmons didn t sound certain about that .  and even so  since we already know he was specializing in optics toward the end  a name like optikon does not push us any further forward .     and trans space insurance is looking either for the optikon or for papers concerning it .  maybe quentin kept the details in his hat and just had a model of the instrument .  after all  shea said they were picking up metal objects .  right .     there was a bunch of metal junk in the pile   agreed shea .    they d leave that in space if it were papers they were after .  so that s what we want  an instrument that might be called an optikon .     even if all your theories were correct  mark  and we re looking for an optikon  the search is absolutely hopeless now   said moore flatly .   i doubt that more than ten per cent of the debris would remain in orbit about vesta .  vesta s escape velocity is practically nothing .  it was just a lucky thrust in a lucky direction and at a lucky velocity that put our section of the wreck in orbit .  the rest is gone  scattered all over the solar system in any conceivable orbit about the sun    they ve been picking up pieces   said brandon .    yes  the ten per cent that managed to make a vestan orbit out of it .  that s all .    brandon wasn t giving up .  he said thoughtfully   suppose it were there and they hadn t found it .  could someone have beat them to it  .    mike shea laughed .   we were right there  but we sure didn t walk off with anything but our skins  and glad to do that much .  who else .    that s right   agreed moore   and if anyone else picked it up  why are they keeping it a secret .     maybe they don t know what it is .    then how do we go about        moore broke off and turned to shea   what did you say .    shea looked blank .   who  me .     just now  about us being there .   moore s eyes narrowed .  he shook his head as though to clear it  then whispered   great galaxy .     what is it .   asked brandon tensely .   what s the matter .  warren .     i m not sure .  you re driving me mad with your theories  so mad  i m beginning to take them seriously  i think .  you know  we did take some things out of the wreck with us .  i mean besides our clothes and what personal belongings we still had .  or at least i did .      what .     it was when i was making my way across the outside of the wreckage   space  i seem to be there now  i see it so clearly   i picked up some items and put them in the pocket of my spacesuit .  i don t know why  i wasn t myself  really .  i did it without thinking .  and then  well  i held on to them .  souvenirs  i suppose .  i brought them back to earth .     where are they .     i don t know .  we haven t stayed in one place  you know .     you didn t throw them out  did you  .     no  but things do get lost when you move .     if you didn t throw them out  they must be somewhere in this house .     if they didn t get lost .  i swear i don t recall seeing them in fifteen years .     what were they .    warren moore said   one was a fountain pen  as i recall  a real antique  the kind that used an ink spray cartridge .  what gets me  though  is that the other was a small field glass  not more than about six inches long .  you see what i mean .  a field glass .     an optikon   shouted brandon .   sure .     it s just a coincidence   said moore  trying to remain levelheaded .   just a curious coincidence .    but brandon wasn t having it .   a coincidence  nuts i trans space couldn t find the optikon on the wreck and they couldn t find it in space because you had it all along .     your crazy .     come on  we ve got to find the thing now .    ell  i ll look  if that s what moore blew out his breath .   well  i ll look  if that s what you want  but i doubt i ll find it .  okay  let s start with the storage level .  that s the logical place .    shea chuckled .  the logical place is usually the worst place to look .   but they all headed for the power ramp once more and the additional flight upward .   the storage level had a musty  unused odor to it .  moore turned on the precipitron .   i don t think we ve precipitated the dust in two years .  that shows you how often i m up here .  now  let s see   if it s anywhere at all  it would be in with the bachelor collection .  i mean the junk i ve been hanging on to since bachelor days .  we can start here .    moore started leafing through the contents of plastic collapsibles while brandon kept peering anxiously over his shoulder .   moore said   what do you know  .  my college yearbook .  i was a sonist in those days  a real bug on it .  in fact  i managed to get a voice recording with the picture of every senior in this book .   he tapped its cover fondly .   you could swear there was nothing there but the usual trimensional photos  but each one has an imprisoned         he grew aware of brandon s frown and said   okay  i ll keep looking .    he gave up on the collapsibles and opened a trunk of heavy  old fashioned woodite .  he separated the contents of the various compartments .   brandon said  hey  is that it .    he pointed to a small cylinder that rolled out on the floor with a small clunk .   moore said   i don t      yes .  that s the pen .  there it is .   and here s the field glass .  neither one works  of course .  they re both broken .  at least  i suppose the pen s broken .  something s loose and rattles in it .  hear .  i wouldn t have the slightest idea about how to fill it so i can check whether it really works .  they haven t even made ink spray cartridges in years .    brandon held it under the light .   it has initials on it    oh  .  i don t remember noticing any .     it s pretty worn down .  it looks like j . k . q .     q .     right  and that s an unusual letter with which to start a last name .  this pen might have belonged to quentin .  an heirloom he kept for luck or sentiment .  it might have belonged to a great grandfather in the days when they used pens like this  a great grandfather called jason knight quentin or judah kent quentin or something like that .  we can check the names of quentin s ancestors through multivac .    moore nodded .   i think maybe we should .  see  you ve got me as crazy as you are .     and if this is so  it proves you picked it up in quentin s room .  so you picked up the field glass there too .     now hold it .  i don t remember that i picked them up in the same place .  i don t remember the scrounging over the outside of the wreck that well .    brandon turned the small field glass over and over under the light .   no initials here .     did you expect any .     i don t see anything  in fact  except this narrow joining mark here .   he ran his thumbnail into the fine groove that circled the glass near its thicker end .  he tried to twist it unsuccessfully .   one piece .   he put it to his eye .  this thing doesn t work .     i told you it was broken .  no lenses         shea broke in .   you ve got to expect a little damage when a spaceship hits a good sized meteor and goes to pieces .     so even if this were it   said moore  pessimistic again   if this were the optikon  it would not do us any good .    he took the field glass from brandon and felt along the empty rims .   you can t even tell where the lenses belonged .  there s no groove i can feel into which they might have been seated .  it s as if there never      hey .   he exploded the syllable violently .    hey what .   said brandon .   the name .  the name of the thing .     optikon  you mean .     optikon  i don t mean .  fitzsimmons  on the tube  called it an optikon and we thought he said  an optikon .       well  he did   said brandon .    sure  said shea .   i heard him .     you just thought you heardhim .  he said  anoptikon .   don t you get it .  not an  optikon   two words   anopti kon  one word .  brandon blankly .  and what s the difference .     a hell of a difference .   an optikon  would mean instrument with lenses  but  anoptikon   one word  has the greek prefix  an   which means  no .   words of greek derivation use it for  no .   anarchy means  no government   anemia means  no blood   anonymous means  no name   and anoptikon means          no lenses   cried brandon .    right .  quentin must have been working on an optical device without lenses and this may be it and it may not be broken .    shea said   but you don t see anything when you look through it .     it must be set to neutral   said moore .  there must be some way of adjusting it .   like brandon  he placed it in both hands and tried to twist it about that circumscribing groove .  he placed pressure on it  grunting .    don t break it   said brandon .    it s giving .  either it s supposed to be stiff or else it s corroded shut .   he stopped  looked at the instrument impatiently  and put it to his eye again .  he whirled  unpolarized a window and looked out at the lights of the city .    i ll be dumped in space   he breathed .   brandon said   what .  what .    moore handed the instrument to brandon wordlessly .  brandon put it to his eyes and cried out sharply   it s a telescope .    shea said at once   let me see .    they spent nearly an hour with it  converting it into a telescope with turns in one direction  a microscope with turns in the other .    how does it work .   brandon kept asking .    i don t know   moore kept saying .  in the end he said   i m sure it involves concentrated force fields .  we are turning against considerable field resistance .  with larger instruments  power adjustment will be required .     it s a pretty cute trick   said shea .    it s more than that   said moore .   i ll bet it represents a completely new turn in theoretical physics .  it focuses light without lenses  and it can be adjusted to gather light over a wider and wider area without any change in focal length .  i ll bet we could duplicate the five hundred inch ceres telescope in one direction and an electron microscope in the other .  what s more  i don t see any chromatic aberration  so it must bend light of all wavelengths equally .  maybe it bends radio waves and gamma rays also .  maybe it distorts gravity  if gravity is some kind of radiation .  maybe          worth money .   asked shea  breaking in dryly .    all kinds if someone can figure out how it works .     then we don t go to trans space insurance with this .  we go to a lawyer first .  did we sign these things away with our salvage rights or didn t we .  you had them already in your possession before signing the paper .  for that matter  is the paper any good if we didn t know what we were signing away  .  maybe it might be considered fraud .     as a matter of fact   said moore   with something like this  i don t know if any private company ought to own it .  we ought to check with some government agency .  if there s money in it         but brandon was pounding both fists on his knees .  to hell with the money  warren .  i mean  i ll take any money that comes my way but that s not the important thing .  we re going to be famous  man  famous .  imagine the story .  a fabulous treasure lost in space .  a giant corporation combing space for twenty years to find it and all the time we  the forgotten ones  have it in our possession .  then  on the twentieth anniversary of the original loss  we find it again .   if this thing works  if anoptics becomes a great new scientific technique  they ll never forget us .    moore grinned  then started laughing .  that s right .  you did it  mark .  you did just what you set out to do .  you ve rescued us from being marooned in oblivion .     we all did it   said brandon .   mike shea started us off with the necessary basic information .  i worked out the theory  and you had the instrument .     okay .  it s late  and the wife will be back soon  so let s get the ball rolling right away .  multivac will tell us which agency would be appropriate and who          no  no   said brandon .   ritual first .  the closing toast of the anniversary the appropriate change .  won t you oblige warren  .   he passed over the still half full bottle of jabra water .   carefully  moore filled each small glass precisely to the brim .   gentlemen   he said solemnly   a toast .   the three raised the glasses in unison .   gentlemen  i give you the silver queen souvenirs we used to have .    foreword  i am ashamed to say that the idea for this story occurred to me when i read the obituary of a fellow science fiction writer in the new york times and began to wonder whether my own obituary  when it came  would be as long .  from that to this story was but a tiny little step .       obituary  my husband  lancelot  always reads the paper at breakfast .  what i see of him when he first appears is his lean  abstracted face  carrying its perpetual look of angry and slightly puzzled frustration .  he doesn t greet me  and the newspaper  carefully unfolded in readiness for him  goes up before his face .   thereafter  there is only his arm  emerging from behind the paper for a second cup of coffee into which i have carefully placed the necessary level teaspoonful of sugar    neither heaping nor deficient under pain of a stinging glare .   i am no longer sorry for this .  it makes for a quiet meal  at least .   however  on this morning the quiet was broken when lancelot barked out abruptly   good lord .  that fool paul farber is dead .  stroke .    i just barely recognized the name .  lancelot had mentioned him on occasion  so i knew him as a colleague  as another theoretical physicist .  from my husband s exasperated epithet  i felt reasonably sure he was a moderately famous one who had achieved the success that had eluded lancelot .   he put down the paper and stared at me angrily .   why do they fill obituaries with such lying trash .   he demanded .  they make him out to be a second einstein for no better reason than that he died of a stroke .    if there was one subject i had learned to avoid  it was that of obituaries .  i dared not even nod agreement .   he threw down the paper and walked away and out the room  leaving his eggs half finished and his second cup of coffee untouched .   i sighed .  what else could i do .  what else could i ever do .   of course  my husband s name isn t really lancelot stebbins  because i am changing names and circumstances  as far as i can  to protect the guilty .  however  the point is that even if i used real names you would not recognize my husband .   lancelot had a talent in that respect   a talent for being passed over  for going unnoticed .  his discoveries are invari ably anticipated  or blurred by the presence of a greater made simultaneously .  at scientific conventions his papers are poorly attended because another paper of greater importance is being given in another section .   naturally this has had its effect on him .  it changed him .   when i first married him  twenty five years ago  he was a sparkling catch .  he was well to do through inheritance and already a trained physicist with an intense ambition and great promise .  as for myself  i believe myself to have been pretty then  but that didn t last .  what did last was my introversion and my failure to be the kind of social success an ambitious young faculty member needs for a wife .   perhaps that was part of lancelot s talent for going unnoticed .  had he married another kind of wife  she might have made him visible in her radiation .   did he realize that himself after a while .  was that why he grew away from me after the first two or three reasonably happy years .  sometimes i believed this and bitterly blamed myself .   but then i would think it was only his thirst for fame  which grew for being unslaked .  he left his position on the faculty and built a laboratory of his own far outside town  for the sake  he said  of cheap land and of isolation .   money was no problem .  in his field  the government was generous with its grants and those he could always get .  on top of that  he used our own money without limit .   i tried to withstand him .  i said   but it s not necessary  lancelot .  it s not as though we have financial worries .  it s not as though they re not willing to let you remain on the university staff .  all i want are children and a normal life .    but there was a burning inside him that blinded him to everything else .  he turned angrily on me .   there is something that must come first .  the world of science must recognize me for what i am  for a   a   great investigator .    at that time  he still hesitated to apply the term genius to himself .   it didn t help .  the fall of chance remained always and perpetually against him .  his laboratory hummed with work  he hired assistants at excellent salaries  he drove himself roughly and pitilessly .  nothing came of it .   i kept hoping he would give up someday  return to the city  allow us to lead a normal  quiet life .  i waited  but always when he might have admitted defeat  some new battle would be taken up  some new attempt to storm the bastions of fame .  each time he charged with such hope and fell back in such despair .   and always he turned on me  for if he was ground down by the world  he could always grind me in return .  i am not a brave person  but i was coming to believe i must leave him .   and yet .  .  .   in this last year he had obviously been girding himself for another battle .  a last one  i thought .  there was something about him more intense  more a quiver than i had ever seen before .  there was the way he murmured to himself and laughed briefly at nothing .  there were the times he went for days without food and nights without sleep .  he even took to keeping laboratory notebooks in a bedroom safe as though he feared even his own assistants .   of course i was fatalistically certain that this attempt of his would fail also .  but surely  if it failed  then at his age  he would have to recognize that his last chance had gone .  surely he would have to give up .   so i decided to wait  as patiently as i could .   but the affair of the obituary at breakfast came as something of a jolt .  once  on an earlier occasion of the sort  i had remarked that at least he could count on a certain amount of recognition in his own obituary .   i suppose it wasn t a very clever remark  but then my remarks never are .  i had meant it to be lighthearted  to pull him out of a gathering depression during which i knew  from experience  he would be most intolerable .   and perhaps there had been a little unconscious spite in .  it  too .  i cannot honestly say .   at any rate  he turned full on me .  his lean body shook and his dark eyebrows pulled down over his deep set eyes as he shrieked at me in falsetto   but i ll never read my obituary .  i ll be deprived even of that .    and he spat at me .  he deliberately spat at me .   i ran to my bedroom .   he never apologized  but after a few days in which i avoided him completely  we carried on our frigid life as before .  neither of us ever referred to the incident .   ere was another obituary .   somehow  as i sat there alone at the breakfast table  i felt it to be the last straw for him  the climax of his long drawn out failure .   i could sense a crisis coming and didn t know whether to fear or welcome it .  perhaps  on the whole  i would welcome it .  any change could not fail to be a change for the better .   shortly before lunch  he came upon me in the living room  where a basket of unimportant sewing gave my hands something to do and a bit of television occupied my mind .   he said abruptly   i will need your help .    it had been twenty years or more since he had said anything like that and involuntarily i thawed toward him .  he looked unhealthily excited .  there was a flush on his ordinarily pale cheeks .   i said   gladly  if there s something i can do for you .    there is .  i have given my assistants a month s vacation .  they will leave saturday and after that you and i will work alone in the laboratory .  i tell you now so that you will refrain from making any other arrangements for the coming week .    i shriveled a bit .   but lancelot  you know i can t help you with your work .  i don t understand          i know that   he said with complete contempt   but you don t have to understand my work .  you need only follow a few simple instructions and follow them carefully .  the point is that i have discovered something  finally  which will put me where i belong          oh  lancelot   i said involuntarily  for i had heard this before a number of times .    listen to me  you fool  and for once try to behave like an adult .  this time i have done it .  no one can anticipate me this time because my discovery is based on such an unorthodox concept that no physicist alive  except me  is genius enough to think of it  not for a generation at least .  and when my work bursts on the world .  i could be recognized as the greatest name of all time in science .     i m sure i m very glad for you  lancelot .     i said i could be recognized .  i could not be  also .  there is a great deal of injustice in the assignment of scientific credit .  i ve learned that often enough .  so it will not be enough merely to announce the discovery .  if i do  everyone will crowd into the field and after a while i ll just be a name in the history books  with glory spread out over a number of johnny come latelies .    i think the only reason he was talking to me then  three days before he could get to work on whatever it was he planned to do  was that he could no longer contain himself .  he bubbled over and i was the only one who was nonentity enough to be witness to that .   he said   i intend my discovery to be so dramatized  to break on mankind with so thunderous a clap  that there will be no room for anyone else to be mentioned in the same breath with me  ever .    he was going too far  and i was afraid of the effect of another disappointment on him .  might it not drive him mad  .  i said   but lancelot  why need we bother  .  why don t we leave all this  .  why not take a long vacation  .  you have worked hard enough and long enough  lancelot .  perhaps we can take a trip to europe .  i ve always wanted to         he stamped his foot .   will you stop your foolish meowing  .  saturday  you will come into my laboratory with me .    i slept poorly for the next three nights .  he had never been quite like this before  i thought  never quite as bad .  might he not be mad already  perhaps  .   it could be madness now  i thought  a madness born of disappointment no longer endurable  and sparked by the obituary .  he had sent away his assistants and now he wanted me in the laboratory .  he had never allowed me there before .  surely he meant to do something to me  to make me the subject of some insane experiment  or to kill me outright .   during the miserable  frightened nights i would plan to call the police  to run away  to   to do anything .   but then morning would come and i would think surely he wasn t mad  surely he wouldn t offer me violence .  even the spitting incident was not truly violent and he had never actuary tried to hurt me physically .   so in the end i waited and on saturday i walked to what might be my death as meekly as a chicken .  together  silently  we walked down the path that led from our dwelling to the laboratory .   the laboratory was frightening just in itself  and i stepped about gingerly  but lancelot only said   oh  stop staring about you as though something were going to hurt you .  you just do as i say and look where i tell you .     yes  lancelot .   he had led me into a small room  the door of which had been padlocked .  it was almost choked with objects of very strange appearance and with a great deal of wiring .   lancelot said   to begin with  do you see this iron crucible .     yes  lancelot .   it was a small but deep container made out of thick metal and rusted in spots on the outside .  it was covered by a coarse wire netting .   he urged me toward it and i saw that inside it was a white mouse with its front paws up on the inner side of the crucible and its small snout at the wire netting in quivering curiosity  or perhaps in anxiety .  i am afraid i jumped  for to see a mouse without expecting to is startling  at least to me .   lancelot growled   it won t hurt you .  now just back against the wall and watch me .    my fears returned most forcefully .  i grew horribly certain that from somewhere a lightning bolt would shoot out and incinerate me  or some monstrous thing of metal might emerge and crush me  or   or     i closed my eyes .   but nothing happened  to me  at least .  i heard only a phfft as though a small firecracker had misfired  and lancelot said to me   well .    i opened my eyes .  he was looking at me  fairly shining with pride .  i stared blankly .   he said   here  don t you see it  you idiot .  right here .    a foot to one side of the crucible was a second one .  i hadn t seen him put it there .    do you mean this second crucible .   i asked .    it isn t quite a second crucible  but a duplicate of the first one .  for all ordinary purposes  they are the same crucible  atom for atom .  compare them .  you ll find the rust marks identical .     you made the second one out of the first  .     yes  but in a special way .  to create matter would require a prohibitive amount of energy ordinarily .  it would take the complete fission of a hundred grams of uranium to create one gram of duplicate matter  even granting perfect efficiency .  the great secret i have stumbled on is that the duplication of an object at a point in future time requires very little energy if that energy is applied correctly .  the essence of the feat  my   my dear  in my creating such a duplicate and bringing it back is that i have accomplished the equivalent of time travel .    it was the measure of his triumph and happiness that he actually used an affectionate term in speaking to me .    isn t that remarkable .   i said  for to tell the truth  i was impressed .   did the mouse come too .    i looked inside the second cubicle as i asked that and got another nasty shock .  it contained a white mouse   a dead white mouse .   lancelot turned faintly pink .  that is a shortcoming .  i can bring back living matter  but not as living matter .  it comes back dead .     oh  what a shame .  why .     i don t know yet .  i imagine the duplications are completely perfect on the atomic scale .  certainly there is no visible damage .  dissections show that .     you might ask        i stopped myself quickly as he glanced at me .  i decided i had better not suggest a collaboration of any sort  for i knew from experience that in that case the collaborator would invariably get all the credit for the discovery .   lancelot said with sour amusement   i have asked .  a trained biologist has performed autopsies on some of my animals and found nothing .  of course  they didn t know where the animal came from and i took care to take it back before anything would happen to give it away .  lord  even my assistants don t know what i ve been doing .     but why must you keep it so secret  .     just because i can t bring objects back alive .  some subtle molecular derangement .  if i published my results  someone  eventing such derangement                  my basic discovery  and achieve a greater fame  because he would bring back a living man who might give information about the future .    i saw that quite well .  nor need he say it  might  be done .  it would be done .  inevitably .  in fact  no matter what he did  he would lose the credit .  i was sure of it .    however   he went on  more to himself than to me   i can wait no longer .  i must announce this  but in such a way that it will be indelibly and permanently associated with me .  there must be a drama about it so effective that thereafter there will be no way of mentioning time travel without mentioning me no matter what other men may do in the future .  i am going to prepare that drama and you will play a part in it .     but what do you want me to do  lancelot .     you ll be my widow .    i clutched at his arm .   lancelot  do you mean        i cannot quite analyze the conflicting feelings that upset me at that moment .   he disengaged himself roughly .   only temporarily .  i am not committing suicide i am simply going to bring myself back from three days in the future .     but you ll be dead then .     only the  me  that is brought back .  the real  me  will be as alive as ever .  like that white rat .   his eyes shifted to a dial and he said   ah  zero time in a few seconds .  watch the second crucible and the dead mouse .    before my eyes it disappeared and there was a phfft sound again .    where did it go .     nowhere   said lancelot .   it was only a duplicate .  the moment we passed that instant in time at which the duplicate was formed  it naturally disappeared .  it was the first mouse that was the original  and it remains alive and well .  the same will be true of me .  a duplicate  me  will come back dead .  the original  me  will be alive .  after three days  we will come to the instant at which the duplicate  me  was formed  using the real  me  as a model  and sent back dead .  once we pass that instant the dead duplicate  me  will disappear and the live  me  will remain .  is that clear .     it sounds dangerous .     it isn t .  once my dead body appears  the doctor will pronounce me dead  the newspapers will report me dead  the undertaker will prepare to bury the dead .  i will return to life and announce how i did it .  when that happens  i will be more than the discoverer of time travel  i will be the man who came back from the dead .  time travel and lancelot stebbins will be publicized so thoroughly and so intermingled  that nothing will extricate my name from the thought of time travel ever again .     lancelot   i said softly   why can t we just announce your discovery .  this is too elaborate a plan .  a simple announcement will make you famous enough and then we can move to the city perhaps          quiet .  you will do what i say .    i don t know how long lancelot was thinking of all this before the obituary actually brought matters to a head .  of course  i don t minimize his intelligence .  despite his phenomenally bad luck  there is no questioning his brilliance .   he had informed his assistants before they had left of the experiments he intended to conduct while they were gone .  once they testified it would seem quite natural that he should be bent over a particular set of reacting chemicals and that he should be dead of cyanide poisoning to all appearances .    so you see to it that the police get in touch with my assistants at once .  you know where they can be reached .  i want no hint of murder or suicide  or anything but accident  natural and logical accident .  i want a quick death certificate from the doctor  a quick notification to the newspapers .    i said   but lancelot  what if they find the real you  .     why should they .   he snapped .   if you find a corpse  do you start searching for the living replica also .  no one will look for me and i will stay quietly in the temporal chamber for the interval .  there are toilet facilities and i can bring in enough sandwich fixings to keep me .    he added regretfully   i ll have to make do without coffee  though  till it s over .  i can t have anyone smelling unexplained coffee here while i m supposed to be dead .  well  there s plenty of water and it s only three days .    i clasped my hands nervously and said   even if they do find you  won t it be the same thing anyway .  there ll be a dead  you  and a living  you          it was myself i was trying to console  myself i was trying to prepare for the inevitable disappointment .   but he turned on me  shouting   no  it won t be the same thing at all .  it will all become a hoax that failed .  i ll be famous  but only as a fool .     but lancelot   i said cautiously   something always goes wrong .     not this time .     but you always say  not this time  and yet something always         he was white with rage and his irises showed clear all about their circle .  he caught my elbow and hurt it terribly but i dared not cry out .  he said   only one thing can go wrong and that is you .  if you give it away  if you don t play your part perfectly  if you don t follow the instructions exactly  i   i        he seemed to cast about for a punishment .   i ll kill you .    i turned my head away in sheer terror and tried to break loose  but he held on grimly .  it was remarkable how strong he could be when he was in a passion .  he said   listen to me .  you have done me a great deal of harm by being you  but i have blamed myself for marrying you in the first place and for never finding the time to divorce you in the second .  but now i have my chance  despite you  to turn my life into a vast success .  if you spoil even that chance  i will kill you .  i mean that literally .    i was sure he did .   i ll do everything you say   i whispered  and he let me go .   he spent a day on his machinery .   i ve never transported more than a hundred grams before   he said  calmly thoughtful .   i thought  it won t work .  how can it  .   the next day he adjusted the device to the point where i needed only to close one switch .  he made me practice that particular switch on a dead circuit for what seemed an interminable time .    do you understand now  .  do you see exactly how it is done .     yes .    then do it  when this light flashes and not a moment before .    it won t work  i thought .   yes   i said .   he took his position and remained in stolid silence .  he was wearing a rubber apron over a laboratory jacket .   the light flashed  and the practice turned out to be worth while for i pulled the switch automatically before thought could stop me or even make me waver .   for an instant there were two lancelots before me  side by side  the new one dressed as the old one was but more rumpled .  and then the new one collapsed and lay still .    all right   cried the living lancelot  stepping off the carefully marked spot .   help me .  grab his legs .    i marveled at lancelot .  how  without wincing or showing any uneasiness  could he carry his own dead body  his own body of three days in the future .  yet he held it under its arms without showing any more emotion than if it had been a sack of wheat .   i held it by the ankles  my stomach turning at the touch .  it was still blood warm to the touch  freshly dead .  together we carried it through a corridor and up a flight of stairs  down another corridor and into a room .  lancelot had it already arranged .  a solution was bubbling in a queer all glass contraption inside a closed section  with a movable glass door partitioning it off .   other chemical equipment was scattered about  calculated  no doubt  to show an experiment in progress .  a bottle  boldly labeled  potassium cyanide  was on the desk  prominent among the others .  there was a small scattering of crystals on the desk near it  cyanide  i presume .   carefully lancelot crumpled the dead body as though it had fallen off the stool .  he placed crystals on the body s left hand and more on the rubber apron  finally  a few on the body s chin .    they ll get the idea   he muttered .   a last look around and he said   all right  now .  go back to the house now and call the doctor .  your story is that you came here to bring me a sandwich because i was working through lunch .  there it is .   and he showed me a broken dish and a scattered sandwich where  presumably  i had dropped it .   do a little screaming  but don t overdo it .    it was not difficult for me to scream when the time came  or to weep .  i had felt like doing both for days and now it was a relief to let the hysteria out .   the doctor behaved precisely as lancelot had said he would .  the bottle of cyanide was virtually the first thing he saw .  he frowned .   dear me  mrs .  stebbins  he was a careless chemist .    .    i suppose so   i said  sobbing .   he shouldn t have been working himself  but both his assistants are on vacation .     when a man treats cyanide as though it were salt  it s bad .   the doctor shook his head in grave moralistic fashion .   now  mrs .  stebbins  i will have to call the police .  it s accidental cyanide poisoning  but it s a violent death and the police          oh  yes  yes  call them .   and then i could almost have beaten myself for having sounded suspiciously eager .   the police came  and along with them a police surgeon  who grunted in disgust at the cyanide crystals on hand  apron  and chin .  the police were thoroughly disinterested  asked only statistical questions concerning names and ages .  they asked if i could manage the funeral arrangements .  i said yes  and they left .   i then called the newspapers  and two of the press associations .  i said i thought they would be picking up news of the death from the police records and i hoped they would not stress the fact that my husband was a careless chemist  with the tone of one who hoped nothing ill would be said of the dead .  after all  i went on  he was a nuclear physicist rather than a chemist and i had a feeling lately he might be in some sort of trouble .   i followed lancelot s line exactly in this and that also worked .  a nuclear physicist in trouble .  spies .  enemy agents  .   the reporters began to come eagerly .  i gave them a youthful portrait of lancelot and a photographer took pictures of the laboratory buildings .  i took them through a few rooms of the main laboratory for more pictures .  no one  neither the police nor the reporters  asked questions about the bolted room or even seemed to notice it .   i gave them a mass of professional and biographical material that lancelot had made ready for me and told several anecdotes designed to show a combination of humanity and brilliance .  in everything i tried to be letter perfect and yet i could feel no confidence .  something would go wrong  something would go wrong .   and when it did  i knew he would blame me .  and this time he had promised to kill me .   the next day i brought him the newspapers .  over and over again  he read them  eyes glittering .  he had made a full box on the lower left of the new york times  front page .  the times made little of the mystery of his death and so did the a . p .   but one of the tabloids had a front page scare headline  atom savant in mystery death .   he laughed aloud as he read that and when he completed all of them  he turned back to the first .   he looked up at me sharply .   don t go .  listen to what they say .     i ve read them already  lancelot .     listen  i tell you .    he read every one aloud to me  lingering on their praises of the dead  then said to me  aglow with self satisfaction   do you still think something will go wrong .    i said hesitantly   if the police come back to ask why i thought you were in trouble  .  .  .     you were vague enough .  tell them you had had bad dreams .  by the time they decide to push investigations further  if they do  it will be too late .    to be sure  everything was working  but i could not hope that all would continue so .  and yet the human mind is odd  it will persist in hoping even when it cannot hope .   i said   lancelot  when this is all over and you are famous  really famous  then after that  surely you can retire .  we can go back to the city and live quietly .     you are an imbecile .  don t you see that once i am recognized  i must continue .  young men will flock to me .  this laboratory will become a great institute of temporal investigation .  i ll become a legend in my lifetime .  i will pile my greatness so high that no one afterward will ever be able to be anything but an intellectual dwarf compared to me .   he raised himself on tiptoe  eyes shining  as though he already saw the pedestal onto which he would be raised .   it had been my last hope of some personal shreds of happiness and a small one .  i sighed .   i asked the undertaker that the body be allowed to remain in its coffin in the laboratories before burial in the stebbins family plot on long island .  i asked that it remain unembalmed  offering to keep it in a large refrigerated room with the temperature set at forty .  i asked that it not be removed to the funeral home .   the undertaker brought the coffin to the laboratory in frigid disapproval .  no doubt this was reflected in the eventual bill .  my offered explanation that i wanted him near me for a last period of time and that i wanted his assistants to be given a chance to view the body was lame and sounded lame .   still  lancelot had been most specific in what i was to say .   once the dead body was laid out  with the coffin lid still open  i went to see lancelot .    lancelot   i said   the undertaker was quite displeased .  i think he suspects that something odd is going on .     good   said lancelot with satisfaction .    but          we need only wait one more day .  nothing will be brought to a head out of mere suspicion before then .  tomorrow morning the body will disappear  or should .     you mean it might not .   i knew it  i knew it .   there could be some delay  or some prematurity .  i have never transported anything this heavy and i m not certain how exactly my equations hold .  to make the necessary observation is one reason i want the body here and not in a funeral parlor .     but in the funeral parlor it would disappear before witnesses .     and here you think they will suspect trickery .     of course .    he seemed amused .  they will say  why did he send his assistants away .  why did he run experiments himself that any child could perform and yet manage to kill himself running them  .  why did the dead body happen to disappear without witnesses  .  they will say  there is nothing to this absurd story of time travel .  he took drugs to throw himself in a cataleptic trance and doctors were hoodwinked .     yes   i said faintly .  how did he come to understand all that .    and   he went on   when i continue to insist i have solved time travel and that i was indisputably pronounced dead and was not indisputably alive  orthodox scientists will heatedly denounce me as a fraud .  why  in one week  i will have become a household name to every man on earth .  they will talk of nothing else .  i will offer to make a demonstration of time travel before any group of scientists who wish to see it .  i will offer to make the demonstration on an intercontinental tv circuit .  public pressure will force scientists to attend  and the networks to give permission .  it doesn t matter whether people will watch hoping for a miracle or for a lynching .  they will watch .  and then i will succeed and who in science will ever have had a more transcendent climax to his life .    i was dazzled for a moment  but something unmoved within me said  too long  too complicated  something will go wrong .   that evening  his assistants arrived and tried to be respectfully grieving in the presence of the corpse .  two more witness to swear they had seen lancelot dead  two more witnesses to confuse the issue and help build events to their stratospheric peak .   by four the next morning  we were in the cold room  bundled in overcoats and waiting for zero moment .   lancelot  in high excitement  kept checking his instruments and doing i know not what with them .  his desk computer was working constantly  though how he could make his cold fingers jiggle the keys so nimbly  i am at a loss to say .   i  myself  was quite miserable .  there was the cold  the dead body in the coffin  the uncertainty of the future .   we had been there for what seemed an eternity and finally lancelot said   it will work .  it will work as predicted .  at the most  disappearance will be five minutes late and this when seventy kilograms of mass are involved .  my analysis of chronous forces is masterly indeed .   he smiled at me  but he also smiled at his own corpse with equal warmth .   i noticedthat his lab jacket  which he had been wearing constantly for three days now  sleeping in it i am certain  had become wrinkled and shabby .  it was about as it had seemed upon the second lancelot  the dead one  when it had appeared .   lancelot seemed to be aware of my thoughts  or perhaps only of my gaze  for he looked down at his jacket and said   ah  yes  i had better put on the rubber apron .  my second self was wearing it when it appeared .     what if you didn t put it on  .  i asked tonelessly .    i would have to .  it would be a necessity .  something would have reminded me .  else it would not have appeared in one .   his eyes narrowed .   do you still think something will go wrong .     i don t know   i mumbled .    do you think the body won t disappear  or that i ll disappear instead .    when i didn t answer at all  he said in a half scream   can t you see my luck has changed at last .  can t you see how smoothly and according to plan it is all working out .  i will be the greatest man who ever lived .  come  heat up the water for the coffee .   he was suddenly calm again .   it will serve as celebration when my double leaves us and i return to life .  i haven t had any coffee for three days .    it was only instant coffee he pushed in my direction  but after three days that  too  would serve .  i fumbled at the laboratory hot plate with my cold fingers until lancelot pushed me roughly to one side and set a beaker of water upon it .    it ll take a while   he said  turning the control to  high .   he looked at his watch  then at various dials on the wall .   my double will be gone before the water boils .  come here and watch .   he stepped to the side of the coffin .   i hesitated .   come   he said peremptorily .   i came .   he looked down at himself with infinite pleasure and waited .  we both waited  staring at a corpse .   there was the phfft sound and lancelot cried out   less than two minutes off .    without a blur or a wink  the dead body was gone .   the open coffin contained an empty set of clothes .  the clothes  of course  had not been those in which the dead body had been brought back .  they were real clothes and they stayed in reality .  there they now were  underwear within shirt and pants  shirt within tie  tie within jacket .  shoes had turned over  dangling socks from within them .  the body was gone .   i could hear water boiling .    coffee   said lancelot .   coffee first .  then we call the police and the newspapers .    i made the coffee for him and myself .  i gave him the usual level teaspoon from the sugar bowl  neither heaping nor deficient .  even under these conditions  when i was sure for once it wouldn t matter to him  habit was strong .   i sipped at my coffee  which i drank without cream or sugar  as was my habit .  its warmth was most welcome .   he stirred his coffee .   all   he said softly   all i have waited for .   he put the cup to his grimly triumphant lips and drank .   those were his last words .   now that it was over  there was a kind of frenzy over me .  i managed to strip him and dress him in the clothing from the coffin .  somehow i was able to heave his weight upward and place him in the coffin .  i folded his arms across his chest as they had been .   i then washed out every trace of coffee in the sink in the room outside  and the sugar bowl  too .  over and over again i rinsed  until all the cyanide  which i had substituted for the sugar  was gone .   i carried his laboratory jacket and other clothes to the hamper where i had stored those the double had brought back .  the second set had disappeared  of course  and i put the first set there .   next i waited .   by that evening  i was sure the corpse was cold enough  and called the undertakers .  why should they wonder  .  they expected a dead body and there was the dead body .  the same dead body .  really the same body .  it even had cyanide in it as the first was supposed to have .   i suppose they might still be able to tell the difference between a body dead twelve hours and one dead three and half days  even under refrigeration  but why should they dream of looking .   they didn t .  they nailed down the coffin  took him away  and buried him .  it was the perfect murder .   as a matter of fact  since lancelot was legally dead at the time i killed him  i wonder if  strictly speaking  it was murder at all .  of course  i don t intend to ask a lawyer about this .   life is quiet for me now  peaceful and contented .  i have money enough .  i attend the theater .  i have made friends .   and i live without remorse .  to be sure  lancelot will never receive credit for time travel .  someday when time travel is discovered again  the name of lancelot stebbins will rest in stygian darkness  unrecognized .  but then  i told him that whatever his plans  he would end without the credit .  if i hadn t killed him  something else would have spoiled things  and then he would have killed me .   no  i live without remorse .   in fact  i have forgiven lancelot everything  everything but that moment when he spat at me .  so it is rather ironic that he did have one happy moment before he died  for he was given a gift few could have  and he  above all men  savored it .   despite his cry  when he spat at me  lancelot managed to read his own obituary .       star light  arthur trent heard them quite clearly .  the tense  angry words shot out of his receiver .   trent .  you can t get away .  we will intersect your orbit in two hours and if you try to resist we will blow you out of space .    trent smiled and said nothing .  he had no weapons and no need to fight .  in far less than two hours the ship would make its jump through hyperspace and they would never find him .  he would have with him nearly a kilogram of krillium  enough for the construction of the brain paths of thousands of robots and worth some ten million credits on any world in the galaxy   and no questions asked .   old brennmeyer had planned the whole thing .  he had planned it for thirty years and more .  it had been his life s work .    it s the getaway  young man   he had said .   that s why i need you .  you can lift a ship off the ground and out into space .  i can t .     getting it into space is no good  mr .  brennmeyer   trent said .   we ll be caught in half a day .     not   said brennmeyer craftily   if we make the jump .  not if we flash through hyperspace and end up light years away .     it would take half a day to plot the jump and even if we could take the time  the police would alert all stellar systems .     no  trent  no .   the old man s hand fell on his  clutching it in trembling excitement .   not all stellar systems  only the dozen in our neighborhood .  the galaxy is big and the colonists of the last fifty thousand years have lost touch with each other .    he talked avidly  painting the picture .  the galaxy was now like the surface of man s original planet   earth  they had called it   in prehistoric times .  man had been scattered over all the continents but each group had known only the area immediately surrounding itself .    if we make the jump at random   brennmeyer said   we would be anywhere  even fifty thousand light years away  and there would be no more chance of finding us than of finding a pebble in a meteor swarm .    trent shook his head .   and we don t find ourselves  either .  we wouldn t have the foggiest way of getting to an inhabited planet .    brennmeyer s quick moving eyes inspected the surroundings .  no one was near him  but his voice sank to a whisper anyway .   i ve spent thirty years collecting data on every habitable planet in the galaxy .  i ve searched all the old records .  i ve traveled thousands of light years  farther than any space pilot .  and the location of every habitable planet   the memory story of the best computer in the trent lifted his eyebrows politely .   brennmeyer said   i design computers and i have the best .  i ve also plotted the exact location of every luminous star in the galaxy  every star of spectral class of f  b  a  and o  and put that into the memory store .  once we ve made the jump the computer will scan the heavens spectroscopically and compare the results with the map of the galaxy it contains .  once it finds the proper match  and sooner or later it will  the ship is located in space and it is then automatically guided through a second jump to the neighborhood of the nearest inhabited planet .     sounds too complicated .     it can t miss .  all these years i ve worked on it and it can t miss .  i ll have ten years left yet to be a millionaire .  but you re young  you ll be a millionaire much longer .     when you jump at random  you can end inside a star .     not one chance in a hundred trillion  trent .  we might also land so far from any luminous star that the computer can t find anything to match up against its program .  we might find we ve jumped only a light year or two and the police are still on our trail .  the chances of that are smaller still .  if you want to worry  worry that you might die of a heart attack at the moment of takeoff .  the chances for that are much higher .     you might  mr .  brennmeyer .  you re older .    the old man shrugged .   i don t count .  the computer will do everything automatically .    trent nodded and remembered that .  one midnight  when the ship was ready and brennmeyer arrived with the krillium in a briefcase   he had no difficulty for he was a greatly trusted man   trent took the briefcase with one hand while his other moved quickly and surely .   a knife was still the best  just as quick as a molecular depolarizer  just as fatal  and much more quiet .  trent left the knife there with the body  complete with fingerprints .  what was the difference  .  they wouldn t get him .  deep in space now  with the police cruisers inpursuit  he felt the gathering tension that always preceded a jump .  no physiologist could explain it  but every space wise pilot knew what it felt like .   there was a momentary inside out feeling as his ship and himself for one moment of non space and non time  became non matter and non energy  then reassembled itself instantaneously in another part of the galaxy .   trent smiled .  he was still alive .  no star was too close and there were thousands that were close enough .  the sky was alive with stars and the pattern was so different that he knew the jump had gone far .  some of those stars had to be spectral class f and better .  the computer would have a nice rich pattern to match against its memory .  it shouldn t take long .   he leaned back in comfort and watched the bright pattern of star light move as the ship rotated slowly .  a bright star came into view  a really bright one .  it didn t seem more than a couple of light years away and his pilot s sense told him it was a hot one  good and hot .  the computer would use that as its base and match the pattern centered about it .  once again he thought  it shouldn t take long .   but it did .  the minutes passed .  then an hour .  and still the computer clicked busily and its lights flashed .   trent frowned .  why didn t it find the pattern .  the pattern had to be there .  brennmeyer had showed him his long years of work .  he couldn t have left out a star or recorded it in the wrong place .   surely stars were born and died and moved through space while in being  but these changes were slow  slow .  in a million years the patterns that brennmeyer had recorded couldn t     a sudden panic clutched at trent .  no .  it couldn t be .  the chances for it were even smaller than jumping into a star s interior .   he waited for the bright star to come into view again and  with trembling hands  brought it into telescopic focus .  he put in all the magnification he could  and around the bright speck of light was the telltale fog of turbulent gases caught  as it were  in mid flight .   it was a nova .   from dim obscurity the star had raised itself to bright luminosity  perhaps only a month ago .  it had graduated from a spectral class low enough to be ignored by the com   one that would be most certainly taken into bat the nova that existed in space didn t exist in the computer s memory store because brennmeyer had not put it there .  it had not existed when brennmeyer was collecting his data   at least not as a brightly luminous star .    don t count it  shrieked trent .   ignore it .    but he was shouting at automatic machinery that would match the nova centered pattern against the galactic pattern and find it nowhere and continue  nevertheless  to match and match and match for as long as its energy supply held out .   the air supply would run out much sooner .  trent s life would ebb away much sooner .   helplessly trent slumped in his chair  watching the mocking pattern of star light and beginning the long and agonized wait for death .   if he had only kept the knife .  .  .   afterword  in recent years  several students in english literature or in library science have taken to writing term papers  or even masters theses  on my books  and stories .  very flattering  of course  but very scary  too  tor they find out all sorts of things about my literary life that i never knew existed .  for instance  there is a certain similarity between  star light  and  the singing bell  that i was not aware of until i went over both stories for this volume .  and  the dust of death  resembles  the singing bell  in another fashion .  i guess it comes from using the same aging brain for all three stories .  i ll bet anyone studying my literary output notices such resemblances at once  but lest they draw unwarranted conclusions  let me assure them that i remain blissfully ignorant of such things until i reread the stories in question in quick succession .   foreword  this story was written under extremely pleasant circumstances .  joseph w .  ferman and edward l .  ferman  father and son  and also publisher and editor of the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  wanted to put out a special issue in my honor .  i pretended to be overcome by modesty  but  in actual fact  the appeal to my vanity was absolutely overpowering .  when they said they wanted a new story especially written for the issue  i agreed at once .  so i sat down and wrote a fourth wendell urth story  fully ten years after i had written the third .  it was so nice to be back in harness  and so nice to see the special issue when it appeared .  ed emshwiller  s . f .  artist without peer  succeeded in drawing my portrait for the cover and in performing that incredible tour de force of making it look  at one and the same time  like me and yet handsome .  now if i could have persuaded my publishers to run that portrait on the jacket of this book  you would have seen for yourself .  incidentally  in preparing this volume i saw that the level of technology on earth and moon in this story is tar behind that described in  the singing bell .   to which i shout   emerson .        the key  karl jennings knew he was going to die .  he had a matter of hours to live and much to do .   there was no reprieve from the death sentence  not hereon the moon  not with no communications in operation .   even on earth there were a few fugitive patches where  without radio handy  a man might die without the hand of his fellow man to help him  without the heart of his fellow man to pity him  without even the eye of his fellow man to discover the corpse .  here on the moon  there were few spots that were otherwise .   earthmen knew he was on the moon  of course .  he had been part of a geological expedition   no  selenological expedition  .  odd  how his earth centered mind insisted on the  geo  .    wearily he drove himself to think  even as he worked .  dying though he was  he still felt that artificially imposed clarity of thought .  anxiously he looked about .  there was nothing to see he was in the dark of the eternal shadow of the northern interior of the wall of the crater  a blackness relieved only by the intermittent blink of his flash .  he kept that intermittent  partly because he dared not consume its power source before he was through and partly because he dared not take more than the minimum chance that it be seen .   on his left hand  toward the south along the nearby horizon of the moon  was a crescent of bright white sunlight .  beyond the horizon  and invisible  was the opposite lip of the crater .  the sun never peered high enough over the lip of his own edge of the crater to illuminate the floor immediately beneath his feet .  he was safe from radiation    from that at least .   he dug carefully but clumsily  swathed as he was in his spacesuit .  his side ached abominably .   the dust and broken rock did not take up the  fairy castle  appearance characteristic of those portions of the moon s surface exposed to the alternation of light and dark  heat and cold .  here  in eternal cold  the slow crumbling of the crater wall had simply piled fine rubble in a heterogeneous mass .  it would not be easy to tell there had been digging going on .   he misjudged the unevenness of the dark surface for a moment and spilled a cupped handful of dusty fragments .  the particles dropped with the slowness characteristic of the moon and yet with the appearance of a blinding speed  for there was no air resistance to slow them further still and spread them out into a dusty haze .   jennings  flash brightened for a moment  and he kicked a jagged rock out of the way .   he hadn t much time .  he dug deeper into the dust .   a little deeper and he could push the device into the depression and begin covering it .  strauss must not find it .   strauss .   the other member of the team .  half share in the discovery .  half share in the renown .   if it were merely the whole share of the credit that strauss had wanted  jennings might have allowed it .  the discovery was more important than any individual credit that might go with it .  but what strauss wanted was something far more  something jennings would fight to prevent .   one of the few things jennings was willing to die to prevent .   and he was dying .   they had found it together .  actually  strauss had found the ship or  better  the remains of theship  or  better still  what just conceivably might havebeen the remains of something analogous to a ship .    metal   said strauss  as he picked up something ragged and nearly amorphous .  his eyes and face could just barely be seen through the thick lead glass of the visor  but his rather harsh voice sounded clearly enough through the suit radio .   jennings came drifting over from his own position half a mile away .  he said   odd .  there is no free metal on the moon .    there shouldn t be .  but you know well enough they haven t explored more than one per cent of the moon s surface .  who knows what can be found on it .    jennings grunted assent and reached out his gauntlet to take the object .   it was true enough that almost anything might be found on the moon for all anyone really knew .  theirs was the first privately financed selenographic expedition ever to land on the moon .   i ll l then  there had been only government conducted shotgun affairs  with half a dozen ends in view .  it was a sign of the advancing space age that the geological society could afford to send two men to the moon for selenological studies only .   strauss said   it looks as though it once had a polished surface .     you re right   said jennings .   maybe there s more about .    they found three more pieces  two of trifling size and one a jagged object that showed traces of a seam .    let s take them to the ship   said strauss .   they took the small skim boat back to the mother ship .   they shucked their suits once on board  something jennings at least was always glad to do .  he scratched vigorously at his ribs and rubbed his cheeks till his light skin reddened into welts .   strauss eschewed such weakness and got to work .  the laser beam pock marked the metal and the vapor recorded itself on the spectrograph .  titanium steel  essentially  with a hint of cobalt and molybdenum .   that s artificial  all right   said strauss .  his broad boned face was as dour and as hard as ever .  he showed no elation  although jennings could feel his own heart begin to race .   it may have been the excitement that trapped jennings into beginning   this is a development against which we must steel ourselves        with a faint stress on  steel  to indicate the play on words .   strauss  however  looked at jennings with an icy distaste  and the attempted set of puns was choked off .   jennings sighed .  he could never swing it  somehow .  never could .  he remembered at the university       well  never mind .  the discovery they had made was worth a far better pun than any he could construct for all strauss s calmness .   jennings wondered if strauss could possibly miss the significance .   he knew very little about strauss  as a matter of fact  except by selenological reputation .  that is  he had read strauss s papers and he presumed strauss had read his .  although their ships might well have passed by night in their university days  they had never happened to meet until after both had volunteered for this expedition and had been accepted .   in the week s voyage  jennings had grown uncomfortably aware of the other s stocky figure  his sandy hair and china blue eyes  and the way the muscles over his prominent jawbones worked when he ate .  jennings  himself  much slighter in build  also blue eyed  but with darker hair  tended to withdraw automatically from the heavy exudation of the other s power and drive .   jennings said   there s no record of any ship ever having landed on this part of the moon .  certainly none has crashed .     if it were a part of a ship   said strauss   it should be smooth and polished .  this is eroded and  without an atmosphere here  that means exposure to micrometeor bombardment over many years .    then he did see the significance .  jennings said  with an almost savage jubilation   it s a non human artifact .  creatures not of earth once visited the moon .  who knows how long ago .     who knows  .   agreed strauss dryly .    in the report          wait   said strauss imperiously .  time enough to report when we have something to report .  if it was a ship  there will be more to it than what we now have .    but there was no point in looking further just then .  they had been at it for hours  and the next meal and sleep were overdue .  better to tackle the whole job fresh and spend hours at it .  they seemed to agree on that without speaking .   the earth was low on the eastern horizon  almost full in phase  bright and blue streaked .  jennings looked at it while they ate and experienced  as he always did  a sharp homesickness .    it looks peaceful enough   he said   but there are six billion people busy on it .    strauss looked up from some deep inner life of his own and said   six billion people ruining it .    jennings frowned .   you re not an ultra  are you .    strauss said   what the hell are you talking about .    jennings felt himself flush .  a flush always showed against his fair skin  turning it pink at the slightest upset of the even tenor of his emotions .  he found it intensely embarrassing .   he turned back to his food  without saying anything .   for a whole generation now  the earth s population had held steady .  no further increase could be afforded .  everyone admitted that .  there were those  in fact  who said that  no higher  wasn t enough  the population had to drop .  jennings himself sympathized with that point of view .  the globe of the earth was being eaten alive by its heavy freight of humanity .   but how was the population to be made to drop .  randomly  by encouraging the people to lower the birth rate still further  as and how they wished  .  lately there had been the slow rise of a distant rumble which wanted not only a population drop but a selected drop   the survival of the fittest  with the self declared fit choosing the criteria of fitness .   jennings thought  i ve insulted him  i suppose .   later  when he was almost asleep  it suddenly occurred to him that he knew virtually nothing of strauss s character .  what if it were his intention to go out now on a foraging expedition of his own so that he might getsole credit for       .   he raised himself on his elbow in alarm  but strauss wasbreathing heavily  and even as jennings listened  the breathing grew into the characteristic burr of a snore .   they spent the next three days in a single minded search for additional pieces .  they found some .  they found more than that .  they found an area glowing with the tiny phosphorescence of lunar bacteria .  such bacteria were common enough  but nowhere previously had their occurrence been reported in concentration so great as to cause a visible glow .   strauss said   an organic being  or his remains  may have been here once .  he died  but the micro organisms within him did not .  in the end they consumed him .     and spread perhaps   added jennings .  that may be the source of lunar bacteria generally .  they may not be native at all but may be the result of contamination instead   eons ago .     it works the other way  too   said strauss .   since the bacteria are completely different in very fundamental ways from any earthly form of micro organism  the creatures they parasitized   assuming this was their source   must have been fundamentally different too .  another indication of extraterrestrial origin .    the trail ended in the wall of a small crater .    it s a major digging job   said jennings  his heart sinking .   we had better report this and get help .     no   said strauss somberly .  there may be nothing to get help for .  the crater might have formed a million years after the ship had crash landed .     and vaporized most of it  you mean  and left only what we ve found .    strauss nodded .   jennings said   let s try anyway .  we can dig a bit .  if we draw a line through the finds we ve made so far and just keep on .  .  .    strauss was reluctant and worked halfheartedly  so that it was jennings who made the real find .  surely that counted .  even though strauss had found the first piece of metal  jennings had found the artifact itself .   it was an artifact   cradled three feet underground under the irregular shape of a boulder which had fallen in such a way that it left a hollow in its contact with the moon s surface .  in the hollow lay the artifact  protected from everything for a million years or more  protected from radiation  from micrometors  from temperature change  so that it remained fresh and new forever .   jennings labeled it at once the device .  it looked not remotely similar to any instrument either had ever seen  but then  as jennings said  why should it  .   there are no rough edges that i can see   he said .   it may not be broken .    there may be missing parts  though .     maybe   said jennings   but there seems to be nothing movable .  it s all one piece and certainly oddly uneven .   he noted his own play on words  then went on with a not altogether successful attempt at self control .  this is what we need .  a piece of worn metal or an area rich in bacteria is only material for deduction and dispute .  but this is the real thing   a device that is clearly of extraterrestrial manufacture .    it was on the table between them now  and both regarded it gravely .   jennings said   let s put through a preliminary report  now .     no .   said strauss  in sharp and strenuous dissent .   hell  no .     why not .     because if we do  it becomes a society project .  they ll swarm all over it and we won t be as much as a footnote when all is done .  no .   strauss looked almost sly .   let s do all we can with it and get as much out of it as possible before the harpies descend .    jennings thought about it .  he couldn t deny that he too wanted to make certain that no credit was lost .  but still     he said   i don t know that i like to take the chance  strauss .   for the first time he had an impulse to use the man s first name  but fought it off .   look  strauss .   he said   it s not right to wait .  if this is of extraterrestrial origin  then it must be from some other planetary system .  there isn t a place in the solar system  outside the earth  that can possibly support an advanced life form .     not proven  really   grunted strauss   but what if you reright .    then it would mean that the creatures of the ship had interstellar travel and therefore had to be far in advance  technologically  of ourselves .  who knows what the device can tell us about their advanced technology .  it might be the key to   who knows what .  it might be the clue to an unimaginable scientific revolution .    that s romantic nonsense .  if this is the product of a technology far advanced over ours  we ll learn nothing from it .  bring einstein back to life and show him a microprotowarp and what would he make of it .     we can t be certain that we won t learn .     so what  even so .  what if there s a small delay .  what if we assure credit for ourselves  .  what if we make sure that we ourselves go along with this  that we don t let go of it .     but strauss    jennings felt himself moved almost to tears in his anxiety to get across his sense of the importance of the device    what if we crash with it .  what if we don t make it back to earth  .  we can t risk this thing .   he tapped it then  almost as though he were in love with it .   we should report it now and have them send ships out here to get it .  it s too precious to         at the peak of his emotional intensity  the device seemed to grow warm under his hand .  a portion of its surface  half hidden under a flap of metal  glowed phosphorescently .   jennings jerked his hand away in a spasmodic gesture and the device darkened .  but it was enough  the moment had been infinitely revealing .   he said  almost choking   it was like a window opening into your skull .  i could see into your mind .     i read yours   said strauss   or experienced it  or entered into it  or whatever you choose .   he touched the device in his cold  withdrawn way  but nothing happened .    you re an ultra   said jennings angrily .   when i touched this    and he did so .   it s happening again .  i see it .  are you a madman  .  can you honestly believe it is humanly decent to condemn almost all the human race to extinction and destroy the versatility and variety of the species  .    his hand dropped away from the device again  in repugnance at the glimpses revealed  and it grew dark again .  once more  strauss touched it gingerly and again nothing happened .   said  lets not start a discussion  for god s sake .  this thing is an aid to communication   a telepathic amplifier .  why not .  the brain cells have each their electric potentials .  thought can be viewed as a wavering electromagnetic field of microintensities         jennings turned away .  he didn t want to speak to strauss .  he said   we ll report it now .  i don t give a damn about credit .  take it all .  i just want it out of our hands .    for a moment strauss remained in a brown study .  then he said   it s more than a communicator .  it responds to emotion and it amplifies emotion .     what are you talking about .    twice it started at your touch just now  although you d been handling it all day with no effect .  it still has no effect when i touch it .     well .     it reacted to you when you were in a state of high emotional tension .  that s the requirement for activation  i suppose .  and when you raved about the ultras while you were holding it just now  i felt as you did  for just a moment .     so you should .     but  listen to me .  are you sure you re so right .  there isn t a thinking man on earth that doesn t know the planet would be better off with a population of one billion rather than six billion .  if we used automation to the full   as now the hordes won t allow us to do   we could probably have a completely efficient and viable earth with a population of no more than  say  five million .  listen to me  jennings .   don t turn away  man .    the harshness in strauss s voice almost vanished in his effort to be reasonably winning .   but we can t reduce the population democratically .  you know that .  it isn t the sex urge  because uterine inserts solved the birth control problem long ago  you know that .  it s a matter of nationalism .  each ethnic group wants other groups to reduce themselves in population first  and i agree with them .  i want my ethnic group  our ethnic group  to prevail .  i want the earth to be inherited by the elite  which means by men like ourselves .  we re the true men  and the horde of half apes who hold us down are destroying us all .  they re doomed to death anyway  why not save ourselves .     no   said jennings strenuously .   no one group has a monopoly on humanity .  your five million mirror images  trapped in a humanity robbed of its variety and versatility  would die of boredom   and serve them right .     emotional nonsense  jennings .  you don t believe that .  you ve just been trained to believe it by our damn fool equalitarians .  look  this device is just what we need .  even if we can t build any others or understand how this one works  this one device might do .  if we could control or influence the minds of key men  then little by little we can superimpose our views on the world .  we already have an organization .  you must know that if you ve seen my mind .  it s better motivated and better designed than any other organization on earth .  the brains of mankind flock to us daily .  why not you too .  this instrument is a key  as you see  but not just a key to a bit more knowledge .  it is a key to the final solution of men s problems .  join us .  join us .   he had reached an earnestness that jennings had never heard in him .   strauss s hand fell on the device  which flickered a second or two and went out .   jennings smiled humorlessly .  he saw the significance of that .  strauss had been deliberately trying to work himself into an emotional state intense enough to activate the device and had failed .    you can t work it   said jennings .   you re too darned super mannishly self controlled and can t break down  can you .   he took up the device with hands that were trembling  and it phosphoresced at once .    then you work it .  get the credit for saving humanity .     not in a hundred million years   said jennings  gasping and barely able to breathe in the intensity of his emotion .   i m going to report this now .     no   said strauss .  he picked up one of the table knives .   it s pointed enough  sharp enough .     you needn t work so hard to make your point   said jennings  even under the stress of the moment conscious of the pun .   i can see your plans .  with the device you can convince anyone that i neverexisted .  you can bring about an ultra victory .   strauss nodded .   you read my mind perfectly .     but you won t   gasped jennings .   not while i hold this .   he was willing strauss into immobility .   strauss moved raggedly and subsided .  he held the knife out stiffly and his arm trembled  but he did not advance .   both were perspiring freely .   strauss said between clenched teeth   you can t keep it   up all   day .    the sensation was clear  but jennings wasn t sure he had the words to describe it .  it was  in physical terms  like holding a slippery animal of vast strength  one that wriggled incessantly .  jennings had to concentrate on the feeling of immobility .   he wasn t familiar with the device .  he didn t know how to use it skillfully .  one might as well expect someone who had never seen a sword to pick one up and wield it with the grace of a musketeer .    exactly   said strauss  following jennings  train of thought .  he took a fumbling step forward .   jennings knew himself to be no match for strauss s mad determination .  they both knew that .  but there was the skim boat .  jennings had to get away .  with the device .   but jennings had no secrets .  strauss saw his thought and tried to step between the other and the skim boat .   jennings redoubled his efforts .  not immobility  but unconsciousness .  sleep  strauss  he thought desperately .  sleep .  strauss slipped to his knees  heavy lidded eyes closing .   heart pounding  jennings rushed forward .  if he could strike him with something  snatch the knife        but his thoughts had deviated from their all important concentration on sleep  so that strauss s hand was on his ankle  pulling downward with raw strength .   strauss did not hesitate .  as jennings tumbled  the hand that held the knife rose and fell .  jennings felt the sharp pain and his mind reddened with fear and despair .   it was the very access of emotion that raised the flicker of the device to a blaze .  strauss s hold relaxed as jennings silently and incoherently screamed fear and rage from his own mind to the other .   strauss rolled over  face distorted .   jennings rose unsteadily to his feet and backed away .  he dared do nothing but concentrate on keeping the other unconscious .  any attempt at violent action would block out too much of his own mind force  whatever it was  too much of his unskilled bumbling mind force that could not lend itself to really effective use .   he backed toward the skim boat .  there would be a suit on board   bandages       the skim boat was not really meant for long distance runs .  nor was jennings  any longer .  his right side was slick with blood despite the bandages .  the interior of his suit was caked with it .   there was no sign of the ship itself on his tail  but surely it would come sooner or later .  its power was many times his own  it had detectors that would pick up the cloud of charge concentration left behind by his ion drive reactors .   desperately jennings had tried to reach luna station on his radio  but there was still no answer  and he stopped in despair .  his signals would merely aid strauss in pursuit .   he might reach luna station bodily  but he did not think he could make it .  he would be picked off first .  he would die and crash first .  he wouldn t make it .  he would have to hide the device  put it away in a safe place  then make for luna station .   the device .  .  .   he was not sure he was right .  it might ruin the human race  but it was infinitely valuable .  should he destroy it altogether .  it was the only remnant of non human intelligent life .  it held the secrets of an advanced technology  it was an instrument of an advanced science of the mind .  whatever the danger  consider the value   the potential value       no  he must hide it so that it could be found again   but only by the enlightened moderates of the government .  never by the ultras  .  .  .   the skim boat flickered down along the northern inner rim of the crater .  he knew which one it was  and the device could be buried here .  if he could not reach luna station thereafter  either in person or by radio  he would have to at least get away from the hiding spot  well away  so that his own person would not give it away .  and he would have to leave some key to it s location .   he was thinking with an unearthly clarity  it seemed to him .  was it the influence of the device he was holding  .  did it stimulate his thinking and guide him to the perfect message .  or was it the hallucination of the dying  and would none of it make any sense to anyone .  he didn t know  but he had no choice .  he had to try .   for karl jennings knew he was going to die .  he had a matter of hours to live and much to do .          h .  seton davenport of the american division of the terrestrial bureau of investigation rubbed the star shaped scar on his left cheek absently .   i m aware  sir  that the ultras are dangerous .    the division head  m .  t .  ashley  looked at davenport narrowly .  his gaunt cheeks were set in disapproving lines .  since he had sworn off smoking once again  he forced his groping fingers to close upon a stick of chewing gum  which he shelled  crumpled  and shoved into his mouth morosely .  he was getting old  and bitter  too  and his short iron gray mustache rasped when he rubbed his knuckles against it .   he said   you don t know how dangerous .  i wonder if anyone does .  they are small in numbers  but strong among the powerful who  after all  are perfectly ready to consider themselves the elite .  no one knows for certain who they are or how many .     not even the bureau  .     the bureau is held back .  we ourselves aren t free of the taint  for that matter .  are you  .    davenport frowned .   i m not an ultra .     i didn t say you were   said ashley .   i asked if you were free of the taint .  have you considered what s been happening to the earth in the last two centuries .  has it never occurred to you that a moderate decline in population would be a good thing .  have you never felt that it would be wonderful to get rid of the unintelligent  the incapable  the insensitive  and leave the rest .  i have  damn it .     i m guilty of thinking that sometimes  yes .  but considering something as a wish fulfillment idea is one thing  but planning it as a practical scheme of action to be hitlerized through is something else .     the distance from wish to action isn t as great as you think .  convince yourself that the end is important enough  that the danger is great enough  and the means will grow increasingly less objectionable .  anyway  now that the istanbul matter is taken care of  let me bring you up to date on this matter .  istanbul was of no importance in comparison .  do you know agent ferrant .    the one who s disappeared  .  not personally .     well  two months ago  a stranded ship was located on the moon s surface .  it had been conducting a privately financed selenographic survey .  the russo america geological society  which had sponsored the flight  reported the ship s failure to report .  a routine search located it without much trouble within a reasonable distance of the site from which it had made its last report .    the ship was not damaged but its skim boat was gone and with it one member of the crew .  name   karl jennings .  the other man  james strauss  was alive but in delirium .  there was no sign of physical damage to strauss  but he was quite insane .  he still is  and that s important .     why .   put in davenport .    because the medical team that investigated him reported neurochemical and neuroelectrical abnormalities of unprecedented nature .  they d never seen a case like it .  nothing human could have brought it about .    a flicker of a smile crossed davenport s solemn face .   you suspect extraterrestrial invaders .     maybe   said the other  with no smile at all .   but let me continue .  a routine search in the neighborhood of the stranded ship revealed no signs of the skim boat .  then luna station reported receipt of weak signals of uncertain origin .  they had been tabbed as coming from the western rim of mare imbrium  but it was uncertain whether they were of human origin or not  and no vessel was believed to be in the vicinity .  the signals had been ignored .  with the skim boat in mind  however  the search party headed out for imbrium and located it .  jennings was aboard  dead .  knife wound in one side .  it s rather surprising he hadlived as long as he did .    meanwhile the medico s were becoming increasingly dis turbed at the nature of strauss s babbling .  they contacted the bureau and our two men on the moon   one of them happened to be ferrant   arrived at the ship .    ferrant studied the tape recordings of the babblings .  there was no point in asking questions  for there was  and is  no way of reaching strauss .  there is a high wall between the universe and himself   probably a permanent one .  however  the talk in delirium  although heavily repetitious and disjointed  can be made to make sense .  ferrant put it together like a jigsaw puzzle .    apparently strauss and jennings had come across an object of some sort which they took to be of ancient and non human manufacture  an artifact of some ship wrecked eons ago .  apparently it could somehow be made to twist the human mind .    davenport interrupted .   and it twisted strauss s mind .  is that it .    that s exactly it .  strauss was an ultra   we can say  was  for he s only technically alive   and jennings did not wish to surrender the object .  quite right  too .  strauss babbled of using it to bring about the self liquidation  as he called it  of the undesirable .  he wanted a final  ideal population of five million .  there was a fight in which only jennings  apparently  could handle the mind thing  but in which strauss had a knife .  when jennings left  he was knifed  but strauss s mind had been destroyed .     and where was the mind thing .     agent ferrant acted decisively .  he searched the ship and the surroundings again .  there was no sign of anything that was neither a natural lunar formation nor an obvious product of human technology .  there was nothing that could be the mind thing .  he then searched the skim boat and its surroundings .  again nothing .     could the first search team  the ones who suspected nothing   could they have carried something off .    they swore they did not  and there is no reason to suspect them of lying .  then ferrant s partner           who was he .     gorbansky   said the district head .    i know him .  we ve worked together .     i know you have .  what do you think of him  .     capable and honest .     all right .  gorbansky found something .  not an alien artifact .  rather  something most routinely human indeed .  it was an ordinary white three by five card with writing on it  spindled  and in the middle finger of the right gauntlet .  presumably jennings had written it before his death and  also presumably  it represented the key to where he had hidden the object .     what reason is there to think he had hidden it .     i said we had found it nowhere .     i mean  what if he had destroyed it  as something too dangerous to leave intact .    that s highly doubtful .  if we accept the conversation as reconstructed from strauss s ravings   and ferrant built up what seems a tight word for word record of it   jennings thought the mind thing to be of key importance to humanity .  he called it  the clue to an umimaginable scientific revolution .   he wouldn t destroy something like that .  he would merely hide it from the ultras and try to report its whereabouts to the government .  else why leave a clue to its whereabouts .    davenport shook his head   you re arguing in a circle  chief .  you say he left a clue because you think there is a hidden object  and you think there is a hidden object because he left a clue .     i admit that .  everything is dubious .  is strauss s delirium meaningful .  is ferrant s reconstruction valid .  is jennings  due really a clue .  is there a mind thing  or a device  as jennings called it  or isn t there  .  there s no use asking such questions .  right now  we must act on the assumption that there is such a device and that it must be found .     because ferrant disappeared .     exactly .     kidnapped by the ultras  .     not at all .  the card disappeared with him .     oh   i see .     ferrant has been under suspicion for a long time as a secret ultra .  he s not the only one in the bureau under suspicion either .  the evidence didn t warrant open action  we can t simply lay about on pure suspicion  you know  or we ll gut the bureau from top to bottom .  he was under surveillance .     by whom .     by gorbansky  of course .  fortunately gorbansky had filmed the card and sent the reproduction to the headquarters on earth  but he admits he considered it as nothing more than a puzzling object and included it in the information sent to earth only out of a desire to be routinely complete .  ferrant   the better mind of the two  i suppose   did see the significance and took action .  he did so at great cost  for he has given himself away and has destroyed his future usefulness to the ultras  but there is a chance that there will be no need for future usefulness .  if the ultras control the device           perhaps ferrant has the device already .     he was under surveillance  remember .  gorbansky swears the device did not turn up anywhere .     gorbansky did not manage to stop ferrant from leaving with the card .  perhaps he did not manage to stop him from obtaining the device unnoticed  either .    ashley tapped his fingers on the desk between them in an uneasy and uneven rhythm .  he said at last   i don t want to think that .  if we find ferrant  we may find out how much damage he s done .   i ll l then  we must search for the device .  if jennings hid it  he must have tried to get away from the hiding place .  else why leave a clue  .  it wouldn t be found in the vicinity .     he might not have lived long enough to get away .    again ashley tapped   the skim boat showed signs of having engaged in a long  speedy flight and had all but crashed at the end .  that is consistent with the view that jennings was trying to place as much space as possible between himself and some hiding place .     can you tell from what direction he came .     yes  but that s not likely to help .  from the condition of the side vents  he had been deliberately tacking and veering .    davenport sighed .   i suppose you have a copy of the card with you .     i do .  here it is .   he flipped a three by five replica toward davenport .  davenport studied it for a few moments .  it looked like this   davenport said   i don t see any significance here .     neither did i  at first  nor did those i first consulted .  but consider .  jennings must have thought that strauss was in pursuit  he might not have known that strauss had been put out of action  at least  not permanently .  he was deadly afraid  then  that an ultra would find him before a moderate would .  he dared not leave a clue to open .  this    and the division head tapped the reproduction    must represent a clue that is opaque on the surface but clear enough to anyone sufficiently ingenious .     can we rely on that .   asked davenport doubtfully .   after all  he was a dying  frightened man  who might have been subjected to this mind altering object himself .  he need not have been thinking clearly  or even humanly .  for instance  why didn t he make an effort to reach lunar station .  he ended half a circumference away almost .  was he too twisted to think clearly .  too paranoid to trust even the station  .  yet he must have tried to reach them at first since they picked up signals .  what i m saying is that this card  which looks as though it is covered with gibberish  is covered with gibberish .    ashley shook his head solemnly from side to side  like a tolling bell .   he was in panic  yes .  and i suppose he lacked the presence of mind to try to reach lunar station .  only the need to run and escape possessed him .  even so this can t be gibberish .  it hangs together too well .  every notation on the card can be made to make sense  and the whole can be made to hang together .     where s the sense  then  .   asked davenport .    you ll notice that there are seven items on the left side and two on the right .  consider the left hand side first .  the third one down looks like an equals sign .  does an equals sign mean anything to you  anything in particular  .     an algebraic equation .    that s general .  anything particular .     no .     suppose you consider it as a pair of parallel lines .     euclid s fifth postulate .   suggested davenport  groping .    good .  there is a crater called euclides on the moon   the greek name of the mathematician we call euclid .    davenport nodded .   i see your drift .  as for f a  that s force divided by acceleration  the definition of mass by newton s second law of motion           yes  and there is a crater called newton on the moon also .     yes  but wait awhile  the lowermost item is the astronomic symbol for the planet uranus  and there is certainly no crater   or any other lunar object  so far as i know   that is named uranus .     you re right there .  but uranus was discovered by william herschel  and the h that makes up part of the astronomic symbol is the initial of his name .  as it happens  there is a crater named herschel on the moon   three of them  in fact  since one is named for caroline herschel  his sister  and another for john herschel  his son .     davenport thought awhile  then said   pc     pressure times half the speed of light .  i m not familiar with that equation .     try craters .  try p for ptolemaeus and c for copernicus .     and strike an average  .  would that signifiy a spot exactly between ptolemaeus and copernicus .     i m disappointed  davenport   said ashley sardonically .   i thought you knew your history of astronomy better than that .  ptolemy  or ptolemaeus in latin  presented a geocentric picture of the solar system with the earth at the center  while copernicus presented a heliocentric one with the sun at the center .  one astronomer attempted a compromise  a picture halfway between that of ptolemy and copernicus          tycho brahe .   said davenport .    right .  and the crater tycho is the most conspicuous feature on the moon s surface .     ah right .  let s take the rest .  the c c is a common way of writing a common type of chemical bond  and i think there is a crater named bond .     yes  named for an american astronomer  w .  c .  bond .    the item on top  xy  .  hmm .  xyy .  an x and two y s .  wait .  alfonso x .  he was the royal astronomer in medieval spain who was called alfonso the wise .  x the wise .  xyy .  the crater alphonsus .     very good .  what s su  .    that stumps me  chief .     i ll tell you one theory .  it stands for soviet union  the old name for the russian region .  it was the soviet union that first mapped the other side of the moon  and maybe it s a crater there .  tsiolkovsky  for instance .  you see  then  the symbols on the left can each be interpreted as standing for a crater  alphonsus  tycho  euclides  newton  tsiolkovsky  bond  herschel .    what about the symbols on the right hand side .    that s perfectly transparent .  the quartered circle is the astronomic symbol for the earth .  an arrow pointing to it indicates that earth must be directly overhead .     ah   said davenport   the sinus medii   the middle bay    over which the earth is perpetuity at zenith .  that s not a crater  so it s on the right hand side  away from the other symbols .     all right   said ashley .  thenotations all make sense  or they can be made to make sense so there s at least a good chance that this isn t gibberish and that it is trying to tell us something .  but what . so far we vegot seven craters and a non crater mentioned  and what doesthat mean .  presum ably  the device can only be in one place .     well   said davenport heavily   a crater can be a huge place to search .  even if we assume he hugged the shadow to avoid solar radiation  there can be dozens of miles to examine in each case .  suppose the arrow pointing to the symbol for the earth defines the crater where he hid the device  the place from which the earth can be seen nearest the zenith .    that s been thought of  old man .  it cuts out one place and leaves us with seven pinpointed craters  the southernmost extremity of those north of the lunar equator and the northernmost extremity of those south .  but which of the seven .    davenport was frowning .  so far  he hadn t thought of anything that hadn t already been thought of .   search them all   he said brusquely .   ashley crackled into brief laughter .   in the weeks since this has all come up  we ve done exactly that .     and what have you found .     nothing .  we haven t found a thing .  we re still looking  though .     obviously one of the symbols isn t interpreted correctly .     obviously .     you said yourself there were three craters named herschel .  the symbol su  if it means the soviet union and therefore the other side of the moon  can stand for any crater on the other side  lomonosov  jules verne  joliot curie  any of them .  for that matter  the symbol of the earth might stand for the crater atlas  since he is pictured as supporting the earth in some versions of the myth .  the arrow might stand for the straight wall .    there s no argument there  davenport .  but even if we get the right interpretation for the right symbol  how do we recognize it from among all the wrong interpretations  or from among the right interpretations of the wrong symbols  .  somehow there s got to be something that leaps up at us from this card and gives us so clear a piece of information that we can tell it at once as the real thing from among all the red herrings .  we ve all failed and we need a fresh mind  davenport .  what do you see here .     i ll tell you one thing we could do   said davenport reluctantly .   we can consult someone i       oh  my god .   he half rose .   ashley was all controlled excitement at once .   what do you see .    davenport could feel his hand trembling .  he hoped his lips weren t .  he said .  tell me  have you checked on jennings  past life .     of course .     where did he go to college  .     eastern university .    a pang of joy shot through davenport  but he held on .  that was not enough .   did he take a course in extraterro logy .     of course  he did .  that s routine for a geology major .     all right  then  don t you know who teaches extraterrology at eastern university .    ashley snapped his fingers .   that oddball .  what s his name    wendell urth .     exactly  an oddball who is a brilliant man in his way .  an oddball who s acted as a consultant for the bureau on several occasions and given perfect satisfaction every time .  an oddball i was going to suggest we consult this time and then noticed that this card was telling us to do so .  an arrow pointing to the symbol for the earth .  a rebus that couldn t mean more clearly  go to urth   written by a man who was once a student of urth and would know him .    ashley stared at the card   by god  it s possible .  but what could urth tell us about the card that we can t see for ourselves .    davenport said  with polite patience   i suggest we ask him  sir .           ashley looked about curiously  half wincing as he turned from one direction to another .  he felt as though he had found himself in some arcane curiosity shop  darkened and dangerous  from which at any moment some demon might hurtle forth squealing .   the lighting was poor and the shadows many .  the walls seemed distant  and dismally alive with book films from floor to ceiling .  there was a galactic lens in soft three dimentionality in one corner andbehind it were star charts that could be made out a map of the moon in another corner might  however  possibly be a map of mars .   only the desk in the center of the room was brilliantly lit by a tight beamed lamp .  it was littered with papers and opened printed books .  a small viewer was threaded with film  and a clock with an old fashioned round faced dial hummed with subdued merriment .   ashley found himself unable to recall that it was late afternoon outside and that the sun was quite definitely in the sky .  here  within  was a place of eternal night .  there was no sign of any window  and the clear presence of circulating air did not spare him a claustrophobic sensation .   he found himself moving closer to davenport  who seemed insensible to the unpleasantness of the situation .   davenport said in a low voice   he ll be here in a moment  sir .     is it always like this .   asked ashley .    always .  he never leaves this place  as far as i know  except to trot across the campus and attend his classes .     gentlemen .  gentlemen .   came a reedy  tenor voice .   i am so glad to see you .  it is good of you to come .    a round figure of a man bustled in from another room  shedding shadow and emerging into the light .   he beamed at them  adjusting round  thick lensed glasses upward so that he might look through them .  as his fingers moved away  the glasses slipped downward at once to a precarious perch upon the round nubbin of his snub nose .   i am wendell urth   he said .   the scraggly gray van dyke on his pudgy  round chin did not in the least add to the dignity which the smiling face and the stubby ellipsoidal torso so noticeably lacked .    gentlemen .  it is good of you to come   urth repeated  as he jerked himself backward into a chair from which his legs dangled with the toes of his shoes a full inch above the floor .   mr .  davenport remembers  perhaps  that it is a matter of   uh   some importance to me to remain here .  i do not like to travel  except to walk  of course  and a walk across the campus is quite enough for me .    ashley looked baffled as he remained standing  and urth stared at him with a growing bafflement of his own .  he pulled a handkerchief out and wiped his glasses  then replaced them  and said   oh  i see the difficulty .  you want chairs .  yes .  well  just take some .  if there are things on them  just push them off .  push them off .  sit down  please .    davenport removed the books from one chair and placed them carefully on the floor .  he pushed the chair toward ashley .  then he took a human skull off a second chair and placed the skull even more carefully on urth s desk .  its mandible  insecurely wired  unhinged as he transferred it  and it sat there with jaw askew .    never mind   said urth  affably   it will not hurt .  now tell me what is on your mind  gentlemen  .    davenport waited a moment for ashley to speak  then  rather gladly  took over .   dr .  urth  do you remember a student of yours named jennings .  karl jennings .    urth s smile vanished momentarily with the effort of recall .  his somewhat protuberant eyes blinked .   no   he said at last .   not at the moment .     a geology major .  he took your extraterrology course some years ago .  i have his photograph here  if that will help .    urth studied the photograph handed him with nearsighted concentration  but still looked doubtful .   davenport drove on .   he left a cryptic message which is the key to a matter of great importance .  we have so far failed to interpret it satisfactorily  but this much we see   it indicates we are to come to you .     indeed .  how interesting .  for what purpose are you to come to me .     presumably for your advice on interpreting the message .     may i see it .    silently ashely passed the slip of paper to wendell urth .  the extraterrologist looked at it casually  turned it over  and stared for a moment at the blank back .  he said   where does it say to ask me .    ashley looked startled  but davenport forestalled him by saying  the arrow pointing to the symbol of the earth .  it seems clear .     it is clearly an arrow pointing to the symbol for the planet earth .  i suppose it might literally mean  go to the earth  if this were found on some other world .     it was found on the moon  dr .  urth  and it could  i sup pose mean that .  however  the reference to you seemed clear once we realized that jennings had been a student of yours .     he took a course in extraterrology here at the university .    that s right .     in what year  mr .  davenport .     in     .     ah .  the puzzle is solved .     you mean the significance of the message .   said davenport .    no  no .  the message has no meaning to me .  i mean the puzzle of why it is that i did not remember him  for i remember him now .  he was a very quiet fellow  anxious  shy  self effacing   not at all the sort of person anyone would remember .  without this    and he tapped the message    i might never have remembered him .     why does the card change things .   asked davenport .   the reference to me is a play on words .  earth   urth .  not very subtle  of course  but that is jennings .  his unattainable delight was the pun .  my only clear memory of him is his occasional attempts to perpetrate puns .  i enjoy puns  i adore puns  but jennings   yes  i remember him well now   was atrocious at it .  either that  or distressingly obvious at it  as in this case .  he lacked all talent for puns  yet craved them so much          ashley suddenly broke in .  this message consists entirely of a kind of wordplay  dr .  urth .  at least  we believe so  and that fits in with what you say .     ah .   urth adjusted his glasses and peered through them once more at the card and the symbols it carried .  he pursed his plump lips  then said cheerfully   i make nothing of it .     in that case         began ashley  his hands balling into fists .    but if you tell me what it s all about   urth went on   then perhaps it might mean something .    davenport said quickly   may i  sir .  i am confident that this man can be relied on   and it may help .     go ahead   muttered ashley .   at this point  what can it hurt .    davenport condensed the tale  giving it in crisp  telegraphic sentences  while urth listened carefully  moving his stubby fingers over the shining milk white desktop as though he were sweeping up invisible cigar ashes .  toward the end of the recital  he hitched up his legs and sat with them crossed like an amiable buddha .   when davenport was done  urth thought a moment  then said   do you happen to have a transcript of the conversation reconstructed by ferrant .     we do   said davenport .   would you like to see it .     please .    urth placed the strip of microfilm in a scanner and worked his way rapidly through it  his lips moving unintelligibly at some points .  then he tapped the reproduction of the cryptic message .   and this  you say  is the key to the entire matter .  the crucial clue .     we think it is  dr .  urth .     but it is not the original .  it is a reproduction .     that is correct .    the original has gone with this man  ferrant  and you believe it to be in the hands of the ultras .     quite possibly .    urth shook his head and looked troubled .   everyone knows my sympathies are not with the ultras .  i would fight them by all means  so i don t want to seem to be hanging back  but   what is there to say that this mind affecting object exists at all  .  you have only the ravings of a psychotic and your dubious deductions from the reproduction of a mysterious set of marks that may mean nothing at all .     yes  dr .  urth  but we can t take chances .     how certain are you that this copy is accurate .  what if the original has something on it that this lacks  something that makes the message quite clear  something without which the message must remain impenetrable .     we are certain the copy is accurate .     what about the reverse side .  there is nothing on the back of this reproduction .  what about the reverse of the original .     the agent who made the reproduction tells us that the back of the original was blank .     men can make mistakes .     we have no reason to think he did  and we must work on at least until such time as the original is regained .     then you assure me   said urth   that any interpretation to be made of this message must be made on the basis of exactly what one sees here .     we think so .  we are virtually certain   said davenport with a sense of ebbing confidence .   urth continued to look troubled .  he said   why not leave the instrument where it is .  if neither group finds it  so much the better .  i disapprove of any tampering with minds and would not contribute to making it possible .    davenport placed a restraining hand on ashley s arm sensing the other was about to speak .  davenport said   let me put it to you .  dr .  urth  that the mind tampering aspect is not the whole of the device .  suppose an earth expedition to a distant primitive planet had dropped an old fashioned radio there  and suppose the native population had discovered electric current had been not yet developed the vacuum tube .   the population might discover that if the radio was hooked up to a current  certain glass objects within it would grow warm and would glow  but of course they would receive no intelligible sound  merely  at best  some buzzes and crackles .  however  if they dropped the radio into a bathtub while it was plugged in  a person in that tub might be electrocuted .  should the people of this hypothetical planet therefore conclude that the device they were studying was designed solely for the purpose of tilling people .     i see your analogy .   said urth .   you think that the mind tampering property is merely an incidental function of the device .     i m sure of it   said davenport earnestly .   if we can puzzle out its real purpose  earthly technology may leap ahead centuries .    then you agree with jennings when he said    here urth consulted the microfilm      it might be the key to   who knows what .  it might be the clue to an unimaginable scientific revolution .      exactly .     and yet the mind tampering aspect is there and is infinitely dangerous .  whatever the radio s purpose  it does electrocute .     which is why we can t let the ultras get it .     or the government either  perhaps  .     but i must point out that there is a reasonable limit to caution .  consider that men have always held danger in their hands .  the first flint knife in the old stone age  the first wooden club before that could kill .  they could be used to bend weaker men to the will of stronger ones under threat of force and that  too  is a form of mind tampering .  what counts  dr .  urth  is not the device itself  however dangerous it may be in the abstract  but the intentions of the men who make use of the device .  the ultras have the declared intention of killing off more than      per cent of humanity .  the government  whatever the faults of the men composing it  would have no such intention .     what would the government intend .     a scientific study of the device .  even the mind tampering aspect itself could yield infinite good .  put to enlightened use  it could educate us concerning the physical basis of mental function .  we might learn to correct mental disorders or cure the ultras .  mankind might learn to develop greater intelligence generally .     how can i believe that such idealism will be put into practice .     i believe so .  consider that you face a possible turn to evil by the government if you help us  but you risk the certain and declared evil purpose of the ultras if you don t .    urth nodded thoughtfully .   perhaps you re right .  and yet i have a favor to ask of you .  i have a niece who is  i believe quite fond of me .  she is constantly upset over the fact that i steadfastly refuse to indulge in the lunacy of travel .  she states that she will not rest content until someday i accompany her to europe or north carolina  or some other outlandish place          ashley leaned forward earnestly  brushing davenport s restraining gesture to one side .   dr .  urth  if you help us find the device and if it can be made to work  then i assure you that we will be glad to help you free yourself of your phobia against travel and make it possible for you to go with your niece anywhere you wish .    urth s bulging eyes widened and he seemed to shrink within himself .  for a moment he looked wildly about as though he were already trapped .   no .    he gasped .   not at all .  never .    his voice dropped to an earnest  hoarse whisper .   let me plain the nature of my fee .  if i help you  if you retrieve the device and learn its use  if the fact of my help becomes public  then my niece will be on the government like a fury .  she is a terribly headstrong and shrill voiced woman who will raise public subscriptions and organize demonstrations .  she will stop at nothing .  and yet you must not give in to her .  you must not .  you must resist all pressures .  i wish to be left alone exactly as i am now .  that is my absolute and minimum fee .    ashley flushed .   yes  of course  since that is your wish .     i have your word .     you have my word .     please remember .  i rely on you too  mr .  davenport .     it will be as you wish   soothed davenport .   and now  i presume  you can interpret the items .    the items .   asked urth  seeming to focus his attention with difficulty on the card .   you mean these markings  xy  and so on .     yes .  what do they mean  .     i don t know .  your interpretations are as good as any  i suppose .    ashley exploded .   do you mean that all this talk about helping us is nonsense  .  what was this maundering about a fee  then .    wendell urth looked confused and taken aback .   i would like to help you .     but you don t know what these items mean .     i   i don t .  but i know what this message means .     you do .   cried davenport .    of course .  it s meaning is transparent .  i suspected it halfway through your story .  and i was sure of it once i read the reconstruction of the conversations between strauss and jennings .  you would understand it yourself  gentlemen  if you would only stop to think .     see here   said ashley in exasperation   you said you don t know what the items mean .     i don t .  i said i know what the message means .     what is the message if it is not the items  .  is it the paper  for heaven s sake .     yes  in a way .     you mean invisible ink or something like that .     no .  why is it so hard for you to understand  when you yourself stand on the brink .    davenport leaned toward ashley and said in a low voice   sir  will you let me handle it  please  .    ashley snorted  then said in a stifled manner   go ahead .     dr .  urth   said davenport   will you give us your analysis .     ah .  well  all right .   the little extraterrologist settled back in his chair and mopped his damp forehead on his sleeve .   let s consider the message .  if you accept the quartered circle and the arrow as directing you to me  that leaves seven items .  if these indeed refer to seven craters  six of them  at least  must be designed merely to distract  since the device surely cannot be in more than one place .  it contained no movable or detachable parts   it was all one piece .    then  too  none of the items are straightforward .  su might  by your interpretation  mean any place on the other side of the moon  which is an area the size of south america .  again pc   can mean  tycho   as mr .  ashley says  or it can mean  halfway between ptolemaeus and copernicus   as mr .  davenport thought  or for that matter  halfway between plato and cassini .   to be sure  xy  could mean  alfonsus    very ingenious interpretation  that   but it could refer to some coordinate system in which the y coordinate was the square of the x coordinate .  similarly c c would mean  bond  or it could mean  halfway between cassini and copernicus .   f a could mean  newton  or it could mean  between fabricius and archimedes .     in short  the items have so many meanings that they are meaningless .  even if one of them had meaning  it could not be selected from among the others  so that it is only sensible to suppose that all the items are merely red herrings .    it is necessary  then  to determine what about the message is completely unambiguous  what is perfectly clear .  the answer to that can only be that it is a message  that it is a clue to a hiding place .  that is the one thing we are certain about isn t it  .    davenport nodded  then said cautiously   at least  we think we are certain of it .     well  you have referred to this message as the key to the whole matter .  you have acted as though it were the crucial clue .  jennings himself referred to the device as a key or a clue .  if we combine this serious view of the matter with jennings  penchant for puns  a penchant which may have been heightened by the mind tampering device he was carrying       so let me tell you a story .    in the last half of the sixteenth century  there lived a german jesuit in rome .  he was a mathematician and astronomer of note and helped pope gregory xiii reform the calendar in       performing all the enormous calculations required .  this astronomer admired copernicus but he did not accept the heliocentric view of the solar system .  he clung to the older belief that the earth was the center of the universe .    in       nearly forty years after the death of this mathematician  the moon was mapped by another jesuit  the italian astronomer  giovanni battista riccioli .  he named the craters after astronomers of the past and since he too rejected copernicus  he selected the largest and most spectacular craters for those who placed the earth at the center of the universe   for ptolemy  hipparchus  alfonso x  tycho brahe .  the biggest crater riccioli could find he reserved for his german jesuit predecessor .   this crater is actually only the second largest of the craters visible from earth .  the only larger crater is bailly  which is right on the moon s limb and is therefore very difficult to see from the earth .  riccioli ignored it  and it was named for an astronomer who lived a century after his time and who was guillotined during the french revolution .    ashley was listening to all this restlessly .   but what has this to do with the message .     why  everything   said urth  with some surprise .   did you not call this message the key to the whole business .  isn t it the crucial clue .     yes  of course .     is there any doubt that we are dealing with something that is a clue or key to something else .     no  there isn t   said ashley .    well  then       the name of the german jesuit i have been speaking of is christoph klau   pronounced  klow .   don t you see the pun  .  klau   clue  .    ashley s entire body seemed to grow flabby with disappointment .   farfetched   he muttered .   davenport said anxiously   dr .  urth  there is no feature on the moon named klau as far as i know .     of course not   said urth excitedly .  that is the whole point .  at this period of history  the last half of the sixteenth century  european scholars were latinizing their names .  klau did so .  in place of the german  u   he made use of the equivalent letter  the latin  v  .  he then added an  ius  ending typical of latin names and christoph klau became christopher clavius  and i suppose you are all aware of the giant crater we call clavius .     but        began davenport .    don t  but  me   said urth .   just let me point out that the latin word  clavis  means  key .   now do you see the double and bilingual pun .  klau   clue  clavius   clavis    key .  in his whole life  jennings could never have made a double  bilingual pun  without the device .  now he could  and i wonder if death might not have been almost triumphant under the circumstances .  and he directed you to me because he knew i would remember his penchant for puns and because he knew i loved them too .    the two men of the bureau were looking at him wide eyed .   urth said solemnly   i would suggest you search the shaded rim of clavius  at that point where the earth is nearest the zenith .    ashley rose .   where is your videophone  .     in the next room .    ashley dashed .  davenport lingered behind .   are you sure .  dr .  urth .     quite sure .  but even if i am wrong  i suspect it doesn t matter .     what doesn t matter  .     whether you find it or not .  for if the ultras find the device  they will probably be unable to use it .     why do you say that  .     you asked me if jennings had ever been a student of mine  but you never asked me about strauss  who was also a geologist .  he was a student of mine a year or so after jennings .  i remember him well .     oh .     an unpleasant man .  very cold .  it is the hallmark of the ultras  i think .  they are all very cold  very rigid  very sure of themselves .  they can t empathize  or they wouldn t speak of killing off billions of human beings .  what emotions they possess are icy ones  self absorbed ones  feelings incapable of spanning the distance between two human beings .     i think i see .     i m sure you do .  the conversation reconstructed from strauss s ravings showed us he could not manipulate the device .  he lacked the emotional intensity  or the type of necessary emotion .  i imagine all ultras would .  jennings  who was not an ultra  could manipulate it .  anyone who could use the device would  i suspect  be incapable of deliberate cold blooded cruelty .  he might strike out of panic fear as jennings struck at strauss  but never out of calculation  as strauss tried to strike at jennings .  in short  to put it tritely  i think the device can be actuated by love  but never by hate  and the ultras are nothing if not haters .    davenport nodded .   i hope you re right .  but then   why were you so suspicious of the government s motives if you felt the wrong men could not manipulate the device .    urth shrugged .   i wanted to make sure you could bluff and rationalize on your feet and make yourself convincingly persuasive at a moment s notice .  after all  you may have to face my niece .    foreword  this story has even pleasanter memories for me than the one before .  at the twenty fourth world science fiction convention  held in cleveland over the labor day weekend in       i was one of those who received a hugo  the  oscar  of science fiction fandom   under conditions of great satisfaction to myself  and with my wife and children in the audience to see .   i am grinning foolishly for sheer joy of recall as i type this .   the science fiction magazine if also won a hugo and its editor set about collecting promises from other hugo winners to write stories for a special hugo issue .  i would have had to have a heart of obsidian not to promise   so i did .  this is the result .  it is the only story i know of to combine the mystery form with einstein s general theory of relativity .       the billiard ball  james priss   i suppose i ought to say professor james priss  though everyone is sure to know whom i mean even without the tide   always spoke slowly .   i know .  i interviewed him often enough .  he had the greatest mind since einstein  but it didn t work quickly .  he admitted his slowness often .  maybe it was because he had so great a mind that it didn t work quickly .   he would say something in slow abstraction  then he would think  and then he would say something more .  even over trivial matters  his giant mind would hover uncertainly  adding a touch here and then another there .   would the sun rise tomorrow  i can imagine him wondering .  what do we mean by  rise  .  can we be certain that tomorrow will come .  is the term  sun  completely unambiguous in this connection  .   add to this habit of speech a bland countenance  rather pale  with no expression except for a general look of uncertainty  gray hair  rather thin  neatly combed  business suits of an invariably conservative cut  and you have what professor james priss was   a retiring person  completely lacking in magnetism .   that s why nobody in the world  except myself  could possibly suspect him of being a murderer .  and even i am not sure .  after all  he was slow thinking  he was always slow thinking .  is it conceivable that at one crucial moment he managed to think quickly and act at once  .   it doesn t matter .  even if he murdered  he got away with it .  it is far too late now to try to reverse matters and i wouldn t succeed in doing so even if i decided to let this be published edward bloom was priss s classmate in college  and an associate  through circumstance  for a generation afterward .  they were equal in age and in their propensity for the bachelor life  but opposites in everything else that mattered .   bloom was a living flash of light  colorful  tall  broad  loud  brash  and self confident .  he had a mind that resembled a meteor strike in the sudden and unexpected way it could seize the essential .  he was no theoretician  as priss was  bloom had neither the patience for it  nor the capacity to concentrate intense thought upon a single abstract point .  he admitted that  he boasted of it .   what he did have was an uncanny way of seeing the application of a theory  of seeing the manner in which it could be put to use .  in the cold marble block of abstract structure  he could see  without apparent difficulty  the intricate design of a marvelous device .  the block would fall apart at his touch and leave the device .   it is a well known story  and not too badly exaggerated  that nothing bloom ever built had failed to work  or to be patentable  or to be profitable .  by the time he was forty five  he was one of the richest men on earth .   and if bloom the technician were adapted to one particular matter more than anything else  it was to the way of thought of priss the theoretician .  bloom s greatest gadgets were built upon priss s greatest thoughts  and as bloom grew wealthy and famous  priss gained phenomenal respect among his colleagues .   naturally it was to be expected that when priss advanced his two field theory  bloom would set about at once to build the first practical anti gravity device .   my job was to find human interest in the two field theory for the subscribers to tele news press  and you get that by trying to deal with human beings and not with abstract ideas .  since my interviewee was professor priss  that wasn t easy .   naturally  i was going to ask about the possibilities of anti gravity  which interested everyone  and not about the two field theory  which no one could understand .    anti gravity .   priss compressed his pale lips and considered .   i m not entirely sure that it is possible  or ever will be .  i haven t   uh   worked the matter out to my satisfaction .  i don t entirely see whether the two field equations would have a finite solution  which they would have to have  of course  if         and then he went off into a brown study .   i prodded him .   bloom says he thinks such a device can be built .    priss nodded .   well  yes  but i wonder .  ed bloom has had an amazing knack at seeing the unobvious in the past .  he has an unusual mind .  it s certainly made him rich enough .    we were sitting in priss s apartment .  ordinary middle class .  i couldn t help a quick glance this way and that .  priss was not wealthy .   i don t think he read my mind .  he saw me look .  and i think it was on his mind .  he said   wealth isn t the usual reward for the pure scientist .  or even a particularly desirable one .    maybe so  at that  i thought .  priss certainly had his own kind of reward .  he was the third person in history to win two nobel prizes  and the first to have both of them in the sciences and both of them unshared .  you can t complain about that .  and if he wasn t rich  neither was he poor .   but he didn t sound like a contented man .  maybe it wasn t bloom s wealth alone that irked priss  maybe it was bloom s fame among the people of earth generally  maybe it was the fact that bloom was a celebrity wherever he went  where as priss  outside scientific conventions and faculty clubs  was largely anonymous .   i can t say how much of all this was in my eyes or in the way i wrinkled the creases in my forehead  but priss went on to say   but we re friends  you know .  we play billiards once or twice a week .  i beat him regularly .     i never published that statement .  i checked it with bloom  who made a long counterstatement that began   he beats me at billiards .  that jackass         and grew increasingly personal thereafter .  as a matter of fact  neither one was a novice at billiards .  i watched them play once for a short while  after the statement and counterstatement  and both handled the cue with professional aplomb .  what s more  both played for blood  and there was no friendship in the game that i could see .   i said   would you care to predict whether bloom will manage to build an anti gravity device .     you mean would i commit myself to anything .  hmm .  well  let s consider  young man .  just what do we mean by anti gravity .  our conception of gravity is built around einstein s general theory of relativity  which is now a century and a half old but which  within its limits  remains firm .  we can picture it          i listened politely .  i d heard priss on the subject before  but if i was to get anything out of him   which wasn t certain   i d have to let him work his way through in his own way .    we can picture it   he said   by imagining the universe to be a flat  thin  superflexible sheet of untearable rubber .  if we picture mass as being associated with weight  as it is on the surface of the earth  then we would expect a mass  resting upon the rubber sheet  to make an indentation .  the greater the mass  the deeper the indentation .    in the actual universe   he went on   all sorts of masses exist  and so our rubber sheet must be pictured as riddled with indentations .  any object rolling along the sheet would dip into and out of the indentations it passed  veering and changing direction as it did so .  it is this veer and change of direction that we interpret as demonstrating the existence of a force of gravity .  if the moving object comes close enough to the center of the indentation and is moving slowly enough  it gets trapped and whirls round and round that indentation .  in the absence of friction  it keeps up that whirl forever .  in other words  what isaac newton interpreted as a force  albert einstein interpreted as geometrical distortion .    he paused at this point .  he had been speaking fairly fluently   for him   since he was saying something he had said often before .  but now he began to pick his way .   he said   so in trying to produce anti gravity  we are trying to alter the geometry of the universe .  if we carry on our metaphor  we are trying to straighten out the indented rubber sheet .  we could imagine ourselves getting under the indenting mass and lifting it upward  supporting it so as to prevent it from making an indentation .  if we make the rubber sheet flat in that way  then we create a universe   or at least a portion of the universe   in which gravity doesn t exist .  a rolling body would pass the non indenting mass without altering its direction of travel a bit  and we could interpret this as meaning that the mass was exerting no gravitational force .  in order to accomplish this feat  however  we need a mass equivalent to the indenting mass .  to produce anti gravity on earth in this way  we would have to make use of a mass equal to that of earth and poise it above our heads  so to speak .    i interrupted him .   but your two field theory           exactly .  general relativity does not explain both the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field in a single set of equations .  einstein spent half his life searching for that single set   for a unified field theory   and failed .  all who followed einstein also failed .  i  however  began with the assumption that there were two fields that could not be unified and followed the consequences  which i can explain  in part  in terms of the  rubber sheet  metaphor .    now we came to something i wasn t sure i had ever heard before .   how does that go .   i asked .    suppose that  instead of trying to lift the indenting mass  we try to stiffen the sheet itself  make it less indentable .  it would contract  at least over a small area  and become flatter .  gravity would weaken  and so would mass  for the two are essentially the same phenomenon in terms of the indented universe .  if we could make the rubber sheet completely flat  both gravity and mass would disappear altogether .    under the proper conditions  the electromagnetic field could be made to counter the gravitational field  and serve to stiffen the indented fabric of the universe .  the electromagnetic field is tremendously stronger than the graviational field  so the former could be made to overcome the latter .    i said uncertainly   but you say  under the proper conditions .   can those proper conditions you speak of be achieved .  professor .    that is what i don t know   said priss thoughtfully and slowly .   if the universe were really a rubber sheet  its stiffness would have to reach an infinite value before it could be expected to remain completely flat under an indenting mass .  if that is also so in the real universe  then an infinitely intense electromagnetic field would be required and that would mean anti gravity would be impossible .     but bloom says           yes  i imagine bloom thinks a finite field will do  if it can be properly applied .  still  however ingenious he is   and priss smiled narrowly   we needn t take him to be infallible .  his grasp on theory is quite faulty .  he   he never earned his college degree  did you know that .    i was about to say that i knew that .  after all  everyone did .  but there was a touch of eagerness in priss s voice as he said it and i looked up in time to catch animation in his eye  as though he were delighted to spread that piece of news .  so i nodded my head as if i were filing it for future reference .   then you would say  professor priss   i prodded again   that bloom is probably wrong and that anti gravity is impossible .    and finally priss nodded and said  the gravitational field can be weakened  of course  but if by anti gravity we mean a true zero gravity field   no gravity at all over a significant volume of space   then i suspect anti gravity may turn out to be impossible  despite bloom .    and i had  after a fashion  what i wanted .   i wasn t able to see bloom for nearly three months after that  and when i did see him he was in an angry mood .   he had grown angry at once  of course  when the news first broke concerning priss s statement .  he let it be known that priss would be invited to the eventual display of the anti gravity device as soon as it was constructed  and would even be asked to participate in the demonstration .  some reporter   not i  unfortunately   caught him between appointments and asked him to elaborate on that and he said    i ll have the device eventually  soon  maybe .  and you can be there  and so can anyone else the press would care to have there .  and professor james priss can be there .  he can represent theoretical science and after i have demonstrated anti gravity  he can adjust his theory to explain it .  i m sure he will know how to make his adjustments in masterly fashion and show exactly why i couldn t possibly have failed .  he might do it now and save time  but i suppose he won t .    it was all said very politely  but you could hear the snarl under the rapid flow of words .   yet he continued his occasional game of billiards with priss and when the two met they behaved with complete propriety .  one could tell the progress bloom  was making by their respective attitudes to the press .  bloom grew curt and even snappish  while priss developed an increasing good humor .   when my umpteenth request for an interview with bloom was finally accepted  i wondered if perhaps that meant a break in bloom s quest .  i had a little daydream of him announcing final success to me .  it didn t work out that way .  he met me in his office at bloom enterprises in upstate new york .  it was a wonderful setting  well away from any populated area  elaborately landscaped  and covering as much ground as a rather large industrial establishment .  edison at his height  two centuries ago  had never been as phenomenally successful as bloom .   but bloom was not in a good humor .  he came striding in ten minutes late and went snarling past his secretary s desk with the barest nod in my direction .  he was wearing a lab coat  unbuttoned .   he threw himself into his chair and said   i m sorry if i ve kept you waiting  but i didn t have as much time as i had hoped .   bloom was a born showman and knew better than to antagonize the press  but i had the feeling he was having a great deal of difficulty at that moment in adhering to this principle .   i made the obvious guess .   i am given to understand  sir  that your recent tests have been unsuccessful .     who told you that  .     i would say it was general knowledge  mr .  bloom .     no  it isn t .  don t say that  young man .  there is no general knowledge about what goes on in my laboratories and workshops .  you re stating the professor s opinions  aren t you  .  priss s  i mean .     no i m          of course you are .  aren t you the one to whom he made that statement   that anti gravity is impossible .     he didn t make the statement that flatly .     he never says anything flatly  but it was flat enough for him  and not as flat as i ll have his damned rubber sheet universe before i m finished .    then does that mean you re making progress  mr .  bloom  .     you know i am   he said with a snap .   or you should know .  weren t you at the demonstration last week .     yes  i was .    i judged bloom to be in trouble or he wouldn t be mentioning that demonstration .  it worked but it was not a world beater .  between the two poles of a magnet a region of lessened gravity was produced .   it was done very cleverly .  a mossbauer effect balance was used to probe the space between the poles .  if you ve never seen an m e balance in action  it consists primarily of a tight monochromatic beam of gamma rays shot down the low gravity field .  the gamma rays change wavelength slightly but measurably under the influence of the  gravitational field and if anything happens to alter the intensity of the field  the wavelength change shifts correspondingly .  it is an extremely delicate method for probing a gravitational field and it worked like a charm .  there was no question but that bloom had lowered gravity .   the trouble was that it had been done before by others .  bloom  to be sure  had made use of circuits that greatly increased the ease with which such an effect had been achieved   his system was typically ingenious and had been duly patented   and he maintained that it was by this method that anti gravity would become not merely a scientific curiosity but a practical affair with industrial applications .   perhaps .  but it was an incomplete job and he didn t usually make a fuss over incompleteness .  he wouldn t have done so this time if he weren t desperate to display something .  i said   it s my impression that what you accomplished at that preliminary demonstration was   .    g  and better than that was achieved in brazil last spring .    that so .  well  calculate the energy input in brazil and here  and then tell me the difference in gravity decrease per kilowatt hour .  you ll be surprised .     but the point is  can you reach   g   zero gravity  .  that s what professor priss thinks may be impossible .  everyone agrees that merely lessening the intensity of the field is no great feat .    bloom s fist clenched .  i had the feeling that a key experiment had gone wrong that day and he was annoyed almost past endurance .  bloom hated to be balked by the universe .   he said  theoreticians make me sick .   he said it in a low  controlled voice  as though he were finally tired of not saying it  and he was going to speak his mind and be damned .   priss has won two nobel prizes for sloshing around a few equations  but what has he done with it .  nothing .  i have done something with it and i m going to do more with it  whether priss likes it or not .    i m the one people will remember .   i m the one who gets the credit .  he can keep his damned title and his prizes and his kudos from the scholars .  listen  i ll tell you what gripes him .  plain old fashioned jealousy .  it kills him that i get what i get for doing .  he wants it for thinking .   i said to him once   we play billiards together  you know          it was at this point that i quoted priss s statement about billiards and got bloom s counterstatement .  i never published either .  that was just trivia .    we play billiards   said bloom  when he had cooled down   and i ve won my share of games .  we keep things friendly enough .  what the hell   college chums and all that    though how he got through  i ll never know .  he made it in physics  of course  and in math  but he got a bare pass    out of pity  i think   in every humanities course he ever took .     you did not get your degree  did you  mr .  bloom .   that was sheer mischief on my part .  i was enjoying his eruption .    i quit to go into business  damn it .  my academic average  over the three years i attended  was a strong b .  don t imagine anything else  you hear  .  hell  by the time priss got his ph . d .   i was working on my second million .    he went on  clearly irritated .   anyway  we were playing billiards and i said to him .   jim  the average man will never understand why you get the nobel prize when i m the one who gets the results .  why do you need two .  give me one .   he stood there  chalking up his cue  and then he said in his soft namby pamby way   you have two billions  ed .  give me one .   so you see  he wants the money .    i said   i take it you don t mind his getting the honor .    for a minute i thought he was going to order me out  but he didn t .  he laughed instead  waved his hand in front of him  as though he were erasing something from an invisible blackboard in front of him .  he said   oh  well  forget it .  all that is off the record .  listen  do you want a statement .  okay .  things didn t go right today and i blew my top a bit  but it will clear up .  i think i know what s wrong .  and if i don t  i m going to know .    look  you can say that i say that we don t need infinite electromagnetic intensity  we will flatten out the rubber sheet  we will have zero gravity .  and when we get it  i ll have the damndest demonstration you ever saw  exclusively for the press and for priss  and you ll be invited .  and you can say it won t be long .  okay .    okay .   i had time after that to see each man once or twice more .  i even saw them together when i was present at one of their billiard games .  as i said before  both of them were good .  but the call to the demonstration did not come as quickly as all that .  it arrived six weeks less than a year after bloom gave me his statement .  and at that  perhaps it was unfair to expect quicker work .   i had a special engraved invitation  with the assurance of a cocktail hour first .  bloom never did things by halves and he was planning to have a pleased and satisfied group of reporters on hand .  there was an arrangement for trimensional tv  too .  bloom felt completely confident  obviously  confident enough to be willing to trust the demonstration in every living room on the planet .   i called up professor priss  to make sure he was invited too .  he was .    do you plan to attend  sir .    there was a pause and the professor s face on the screen was a study in uncertain reluctance .   a demonstration of this sort is most unsuitable where a serious scientific matter is in question .  i do not like to encourage such things .    i was afraid he would beg off  and the dramatics of the situation would be greatly lessened if he were not there .  but then  perhaps  he decided he dared not play the chicken before the world .  with obvious distaste he said   of course  ed bloom is not really a scientist and he must have his day in the sun .  i ll be there .     do you think mr .  bloom can produce zero gravity  sir .     uh  .  .  .  mr .  bloom sent me a copy of the design of his device and  .  .  .  and i m not certain .  perhaps he can do it  if  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  he says he can do it .  of course    he paused again for quite a long time    i think i would like to see it .    so would i  and so would many others .   the staging was impeccable .  a whole floor of the main building at bloom enterprises   the one on the hilltop   was cleared .  there were the promised cocktails and a splendid array of hors d oeuvres  soft music and lighting  and a carefully dressed and thoroughly jovial edward bloom playing the perfect host  while a number of polite and unobtrusive menials fetched and carried .  all was geniality and amazing confidence .   james priss was late and i caught bloom watching the corners of the crowd and beginning to grow a little grim about the edges .  then priss arrived  dragging a volume of colorlessness in with him  a drabness that was unaffected by the noise and the absolute splendor  no other word would describe it   or else it was the two martinis glowing inside me  that filled the room .   bloom saw him and his face was illuminated at once .  he bounced across the floor  seized the smaller man s hand and dragged him to the bar .    jim .  glad to see you .  what ll you have .  hell  man  i d have called it off if you hadn t showed .  can t have this thing without the star  you know .   he wrung priss s hand .   it s your theory  you know .  we poor mortals can t do a thing without you few  you damned few few  pointing the way .    he was being ebullient  handing out the flattery  because he could afford to do so now .  he was fattening priss for the kill .   priss tried to refuse a drink  with some sort of mutter  but a glass was pressed into his hand and bloom raised his voice to a bull roar .    gentlemen .  a moment s quiet  please .  to professor priss  the greatest mind since einstein  two time noble laureate  father of the two field theory  and inspirer of the demonstration we are about to see   even if he didn t think it would work  and had the guts to say so publicly .    there was a distinct titter of laughter that quickly faded out and priss looked as grim as his face could manage .    but now that professor priss is here   said bloom   and we ve had our toast  let s get on with it .  follow me  gentlemen .    the demonstration was in a much more elaborate place than had housed the earlier one .  this time it was on the top floor of the building .  different magnets were involved    smaller ones  by heaven   but as nearly as i could tell  the same m e balance was in place .   one thing was new  however  and it staggered everybody  drawing much more attention than anything else in the room .  it was a billiard table  resting under one pole of the magnet .  beneath it was the companion pole .  a round hole  about a foot across  was stamped out of the very tenter of the table and it was obvious that the zero gravity field  if it was to be produced  would be produced through that hole in the center of the billiard table .   it was as though the whole demonstration had been designed  surrealist fashion  to point up the victory of bloom over priss .  this was to be another version of their everlasting billiards competition and bloom was going to win .   i don t know if the other newsmen took matters in that fashion  but i think priss did .  i turned to look at him and saw that he was still holding the drink that had been forced into his hand .  he rarely drank  i knew  but now he lifted the glass to his lips and emptied it in two swallows .  he stared at that billiard ball and i needed no gift of esp to realize that he took it as a deliberate snap of fingers under his nose .   bloom led us to the twenty seats that surrounded three sides of the table  leaving the fourth free as a working area .  priss was carefully escorted to the seat commanding the most convenient view .  priss glanced quickly at the trimensional cameras which were now working .  i wondered if he were thinking of leaving but deciding that he couldn t in the full glare of the eyes of the world .   essentially  the demonstration was simple  it was the production that counted .  there were dials in plain view that measured the energy expenditure .  there were others that transferred the m e balance readings into a position and a size that were visible to all .  everything was arranged for easy trimensional viewing .   bloom explained each step in a genial way  with one or two pauses in which he turned to priss for a confirmation that had to come .  he didn t do it often enough to make it obvious  but just enough to turn priss upon the spit of his own torment .  from where i sat i could look across the table and see priss on the other side .   he had the look of a man in hell .   as we all know  bloom succeeded .  the m e balance showed the gravitational intensity to be sinking steadily as the electro magnetic field was intensified .  there were cheers when it dropped below the   .    g mark .  a red line indicated that on the dial .    the   .    g mark  as you know   said bloom confidently  represents the previous record low in gravitational intensity .  we are now lower than that at a cost in electricity that is less than ten per cent what it cost at the time that mark was set .  and we will go lower still .    bloom   i think deliberately  for the sake of the suspense   slowed the drop toward the end  letting the trimensional cameras switch back and forth between the gap in the billiard table and the dial on which the m e balance reading was lowering .   bloom said suddenly   gentlemen  you will find dark goggles in the pouch on the side of each chair .  please put them on now .  the zero gravity field will soon be established and it will radiate a light rich in ultraviolet .    he put goggles on himself  and there was a momentary rustle as others went on too .   i think no one breathed during the last minute  when the dial reading dropped to zero and held fast .  and just as that happened a cylinder of light sprang into existence from pole to pole through the holein the billiard table .   there was a ghost of twenty sighs at that .  someone called out   mr .  bloom  what is the reason for the light .     it s characteristic of the zero gravity field   said bloom smoothly  which was no answer  of course .   reporters were standing up now  crowding about the edge of the table .  bloom waved them back .   please  gentlemen  stand clear .    only priss remained sitting .  he seemed lost in thought and i have been certain ever since that it was the goggles that obscured the possible significance of everything that followed .  i didn t see his eyes .  i couldn t .  and that meant neither i nor anyone else could even begin to make a guess as to what was going on behind those eyes .  well  maybe we couldn t have made such a guess  even if the goggles hadn t been there  but who can say  .   bloom was raising his voice again .   please .  the demonstration is not yet over .  so far  we ve only repeated what i have done before .  i have now produced a zero gravity field and i have shown it can be done practically .  but i want to demonstrate something of what such a field can do .  what we are going to see next will be something that has never been seen  not even by myself .  i have not experimented in this direction  much as i would have liked to  because i have felt that professor priss deserved the honor of          priss looked up sharply .   what   what           professor priss   said bloom  smiling broadly  iwould like you to perform the first experiment involving the interaction of a solid object with a zero gravity field .  notice that the field has been formed in the center of a billiard table .  the world knows your phenomenal skill in billiards  professor  a talent second only to your amazing aptitude in theoretical physics .  won t you send a billiard ball into the zero gravity volume .    eagerly he was handing a ball and cue to the professor .  priss  his eyes hidden by the goggles  stared at them and only very slowly  very uncertainly  reached out to take them .   i wonder what his eyes were showing .  i wonder  too  how much of the decision to have priss play billiards at the demonstration was due to bloom s anger at priss s remark about their periodic game  the remark i had quoted .  had i been  in my way  responsible for what followed  .    come  stand up  professor   said bloom   and let me have your seat .  the show is yours from now on .  go ahead .    bloom seated himself  and still talked  in a voice that grew more organlike with each moment .   once professor priss sends the ball into the volume of zero gravity  it will no longer be affected by earth s gravitational field .  it will remain truly motionless while the earth rotates about its axis and travels about the sun .  in this latitude  and at this time of day  i have calculated that the earth  in its motions  will sink downward .  we will move with it and the ball will stand still .  to us it will seem to rise up and away from the earth s surface .  watch .    priss seemed to stand in front of the table in frozen paralysis .  was it surprise .  astonishment .  i don t know .  i ll never know .  did he make a move to interrupt bloom s little speech  or was he just suffering from an agonized reluctance to play the ignominious part into which he was being forced by his adversary  .   priss turned to the billiard table  looking first at it  then back at bloom .  every reporter was on his feet  crowding as closely as possible in order to get a good view .  only bloom himself remained seated  smiling and isolated .  he  of course  was not watching the table  or the ball  or the zero gravity field .  as nearly as i could tell through the goggles  he was watching priss .   priss turned to the table and placed his ball .  he was going to be the agent that was to bring final and dramatic triumph to bloom and make himself   the man who said it couldn t be done   the goat to be mocked forever .   perhaps he felt there was no way out .  or perhaps       with a sure stroke of his cue  he set the ball into motion .  it was not going quickly  and every eye followed it .  it struck the side of the table and caromed .  it was going even slower now as though priss himself were increasing the suspense and making bloom s triumph the more dramatic .   i had a perfect view  for i was standing on the side of the table opposite from that where priss was .  i could see the ball moving toward the glitter of the zero gravity field and beyond it i could see those portions of the seated bloom which were not hidden by that glitter .   the ball approached the zero gravity volume  seemed to hang on the edge for a moment  and then was gone  with a streak of light  the sound of a thunderclap and the sudden smell of burning cloth .   we yelled .  we all yelled .   i ve seen the scene on television since   along with the rest of the world .  i can see myself in the film during that fifteen second period of wild confusion  but i don t really recognize my face .   fifteen seconds .   and then we discovered bloom .  he was still sitting in the chair  his arms still folded  but there was a hole the size of a billiard ball through forearm  chest  and back .  the better part of his heart  as it later turned out under autopsy  had been neatly punched out .   they turned off the device .  they called in the police .  they dragged off priss  who was in a state of utter collapse .  i wasn t much better off  to tell the truth  and if any reporter then on the scene ever tried to say he remained a cool observer of that scene  then he s a cool liar .   it was some months before i got to see priss again .  he had lost some weight but seemed well otherwise .  indeed  there was color in his cheeks and an air of decision about him .  he was better dressed than i had ever seen him to be .   he said   i know what happened now .  if i had had time to think  i would have known then .  but i am a slow thinker  and poor ed bloom was so intent on running a great show and doing it so well that he carried me along with him .  naturally  i ve been trying to make up for some of the damage i unwittingly caused .     you can t bring bloom back to life   i said soberly .    no  i can t   he said  just as soberly .   but there s bloom enterprises to think of  too .  what happened at the demonstration  in full view of the world  was the worst possible advertisement for zero gravity  and it s important that the story be made clear .  that is why i have asked to see you .     yes .     if i had been a quicker thinker  i would have known ed was speaking the purest nonsense when he said that the billiard ball would slowly rise in the zero gravity field .  it couldn t be so .  if bloom hadn t despised theory so  if he hadn t been so intent on being proud of his own ignorance of theory  he d have known it himself .    the earth s motion  after all  isn t the only motion involved  young man .  the sun itself moves in a vast orbit about the center of the milky way galaxy .  and the galaxy moves too  in some not very clearly defined way .  if the billiard ball were subjected to zero gravity  you might think of it as being unaffected by any of these motions and therefore of suddenly falling into a state of absolute rest   when there is no such thing as absolute rest .    priss shook his head slowly .   the trouble with ed  i think  was that he was thinking of the kind of zero gravity one gets in a spaceship in free fall  when people float in mid air .  he expected the ball to float in mid air .  however  in a spaceship  zero gravity is not the result of an absence of gravitation  but merely the result of two objects  a ship and a man within the ship  falling at the same rate  responding to gravity in precisely the same way  so that each is motionless with respect to the other .    in the zero gravity field produced by ed  there was a flattening of the rubber sheet universe  which means an actual loss of mass .  everything in that field  including molecules of air caught within it  and the billiard ball i pushed into it  was completely massless as long as it remained with it .  a completely massless object can move in only one way .    he paused  inviting the question .  i asked   what motion would that be .     motion at the speed of light .  any massless object  such as a neutrino or a photon  must travel at the speed of light as long as it exists .  in fact  light moves at that speed only because it is made up of photons .  as soon as the billiard ball entered the zero gravity field and lost its mass  it too assumed the speed of light at once and left .    i shook my head .   but didn t it regain its mass as soon as it left the zero gravity volume .     it certainly did  and at once it began to be affected by the gravitational field and to slow up in response to the friction of the air and the top of the billiard table .  but imagine how much friction it would take to slow up an object the mass of a billiard ball going at the speed of light .  it went through the hundred mile thickness of our atmosphere in a thousandth of a second and i doubt that it was slowed more than a few miles a second in doing so  a few miles out of         of them .  on the way  it scorched the top of the billiard table  broke cleanly through the edge  went through poor ed and the window too  punching out neat circles because it had passed through before the neighboring portions of something even as brittle as glass had a chance to split and splinter .    it is extremely fortunate we were on the top floor of a building set in a countrified area .  if we were in the city  it might have passed through a number of buildings and killed a number of people .  by now that billiard ball is off in space  far beyond the edge of the solar system and it will continue to travel so forever  at nearly the speed of light  until it happens to strike an object large enough to stop it .  and then it will gouge out a sizable crater .    i played with the notion and was not sure i liked it .   how is that possible .  the billiard ball entered the zero gravity volume almost at a standstill .  i saw it .  and you say it left with an incredible quantity of kinetic energy .  where did the energy come from  .    priss shrugged .   it came from nowhere .  the law of conservation of energy only holds under the conditions in which general relativity is valid  that is  in an indented rubber sheet universe .  wherever the indentation is flattened out  general relativity no longer holds  and energy can be created and destroyed freely .  that accounts for the radiation along the cylindrical surface of the zero gravity volume .  that radiation  you remember .  bloom did not explain  and  i fear  could not explain .  if he had only experimented further first  if he had only not been so foolishly anxious to put on his show          what accounts for the radiation  sir .    the molecules of air inside the volume .  each assumes the speed of light and conies smashing outward .  they re only molecules  not billiard balls  so they re stopped  but the kinetic energy of their motion is converted into energetic radiation .  it s continuous because new molecules are always drifting in  and attaining the speed of light and smashing out .    then energy is being created continuously  .     exactly .  and that is what we must make clear to the public .  anti gravity is not primarily a device to lift spaceships or to revolutionize mechanical movement .  rather  it is the source of an endless supply of free energy  since part of the energy produced can be diverted to maintain the field that keeps that portion of the universe flat .  what ed bloom invented  without knowing it  was not just anti gravity  but the first successful perpetual motion machine of the first class   one that manufactures energy out of nothing .    i said slowly   any one of us could have been killed by that billiard ball  is that right .  professor .  it might have come out in any direction .    priss said   well  massless photons emerge from any light source at the speed of light in any direction  that s why a candle casts light in all directions .  the massless air molecules come out of the zero gravity volume in all directions  which is why the entire cylinder radiates .  but the billiard ball was only one object .  it could have come out in any direction  but it had to come out in some one direction  chosen at random  and the chosen direction happened to be the one that caught ed .    that was it .  everyone knows the consequences .  mankind had free energy and so we have the world we have now .  professor priss was placed in charge of its development by the board of bloom enterprises  and in time he was as rich and famous as ever edward bloom had been .  and priss still has two nobel prizes in addition .   only .  .  .   i keep thinking .  photons smash out from a light source in all directions because they are created at the moment and there is no reason for them to move in one direction more than in another .  air molecules come out of a zero gravity field in all directions because they enter it in all directions .   but what about a single billiard ball  entering a zero gravity field from one particular direction .  does it come out in the same direction or in any direction  .   i ve inquired delicately  but theoretical physicists don t seem to be sure  and i can find no record that bloom enterprises .  which is the only organization working with zero gravity fields  has ever experimented in the matter .  someone at the organization once told me that the uncertainty principle guarantees the random emersion of an object entering in any direction but then why don t they try the experiment  .   could it be  then .  .  .   could it be that for once priss s mind had been working quickly  .  could it be that  under the pressure of what bloom was trying to do to him  priss had suddenly seen everything .  he had been studying the radiation surrounding the zero gravity volume .  he might have realized its cause and been certain of the speed of light motion of anything entering the volume .   why  then  had he said nothing .   one thing is certain .  nothing priss would do at the billiard table could be accidental .  he was an expert and the billiard ball did exactly what he wanted it to .  i was standing right there .  i saw him look at bloom and then at the table as though he were judging angles .   i watched him hit that ball .  i watched it bounce off the side of the table and move into the zero gravity volume  heading in one particular direction .   for when priss sent that ball toward the zero gravity volume   and the tri di films bear me out   it was already aimed directly at bloom s heart .   accident .  coincidence .    .  .  . murder .   afterword  a friend of mine alter reading the above story suggested i change the title to  dirty pool .   i have been tempted to do so but have refrained  for it seems too flippant a title for so grave a story   or perhaps i am just corroded with jealousy at not having thought of it first .  but in either case  now that all the stories in this volume have been gone over  and i have experienced the memories to which each gave rise  all i can say is   gee  it s great to be a science fiction writer .    the end .
