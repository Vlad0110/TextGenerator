terry pratchett     lords and ladies      a novel of discworld        contents      begin reading      author   s note    about the author    praise    other books by terry pratchett    copyright    about the publisher      now read on     when does it start .   there are very few starts .  oh  some things seem to be beginnings .  the curtain goes up  the first pawn moves  the first shot is fired    but that   s not the start .  the play  the game  the war is just a little window on a ribbon of events that may extend back thousands of years .  the point is  there   s always something before .  it   s always a case of now read on .   much human ingenuity has gone into finding the ultimate before .   the current state of knowledge can be summarized thus   in the beginning  there was nothing  which exploded .   other theories about the ultimate start involve gods creating the universe out of the ribs  entrails  and testicles of their father .    there are quite a lot of these .  they are interesting  not for what they tell you about cosmology  but for what they say about people .  hey  kids  which part do you think they made your town out of .   but this story starts on the discworld  which travels through space on the back of four giant elephants which stand on the shell of an enormous turtle and is not made of any bits of anyone   s bodies .   but when to begin .   thousands of years ago .  when a great hot cascade of stones came screaming out of the sky  gouged a hole out of copperhead mountain  and flattened the forest for ten miles around .   the dwarfs dug them up  because they were made of a kind of iron  and dwarfs  contrary to general opinion  love iron more than gold .  it   s just that although there   s more iron than gold it   s harder to sing songs about .  dwarfs love iron .   and that   s what the stones contained .  the love of iron .  alove so strong that it drew all iron things to itself .  the three dwarfs who found the first of the rocks only got free by struggling out of their chain mail trousers .   many worlds are iron  at the core .  but the discworld is as coreless as a pancake .   on the disc  if you enchant a needle it will point to the hub  where the magical field is strongest .  it   s simple .   elsewhere  on worlds designed with less imagination  the needle turns because of the love of iron .   at the time  the dwarfs and the humans had a very pressing need for the love of iron .   and now  spool time forward for thousands of years to a point fifty years or more before the ever moving now  to a hillside and a young woman  running .  not running away from something  exactly  or precisely running toward anything  but running just fast enough to keep ahead of a young man although  of course  not so far ahead that he   ll give up .  out from the trees and into the rushy valley where  on a slight rise in the ground  are the stones .   they   re about man height  and barely thicker than a fat man .   and somehow they don   t seem worth it .  if there   s a stone circle you mustn   t go near  the imagination suggests  then there should be big brooding trilithons and ancient altar stones screaming with the dark memory of blood soaked sacrifice .  not these dull stubby lumps .   it will turn out that she was running a bit too fast this time  and in fact the young man in laughing pursuit will get lost and fed up and will eventually wander off back to the town alone .  she does not  at this point  know this  but stands absentmindedly adjusting the flowers twined in her hair .  it   s been that kind of afternoon .   she knows about the stones .  no one ever gets told about the stones .  and no one is ever told not to go there  because those who refrain from talking about the stones also know how powerful is the attraction of prohibition .  it   s just that going to the stones is not   what we do .  especially if we   re nice girls .   but what we have here is not a nice girl  as generally understood .  for one thing  she   s not beautiful .  there   s a certain set to the jaw and arch to the nose that might  with a following wind and in the right light  be called handsome by a good natured liar .  also  there   s a certain glint in her eye generally possessed by those people who have found that they are more intelligent than most people around them but who haven   t yet learned that one of the most intelligent things they can do is prevent said people ever finding this out .  along with the nose  this gives her a piercing expression which is extremely disconcerting .  it   s not a face you can talk to .  open your mouth and you   re suddenly the focus of a penetrating stare which declares  what you   re about to say had better be interesting .   now the eight little stones on their little hill are being subjected to the same penetrating gaze .   hmm .   and then she approaches  cautiously .  it   s not the caution of a rabbit about to run .  it   s closer to the way a hunter moves .   she puts her hands on her hips  such as they are .   there   s a skylark in the hot summer sky .  apart from that  there   s no sound .  down in the little valley  and higher in the hills  grasshoppers are sizzling and bees are buzzing and the grass is alive with micro noise .  but it   s always quiet around the stones .      i   m here     she says .     show me .      a figure of a dark haired woman in a red dress appears inside the circle .  the circle is wide enough to throw a stone across  but somehow the figure manages to approach from a great distance .   other people would have run away .  but the girl doesn   t  and the woman in the circle is immediately interested .      so you   re real  then .         of course .  what is your name  girl .         esmerelda .         and what do you want .         i don   t want anything .         everyone wants something .  otherwise  why are you here .         i just wanted to find out if you was real .         to you  certainly   you have good sight .      the girl nods .  you could bounce rocks off her pride .      and now you have learned this     said the woman in the circle     what is it that you really want .         nothing .         really .  last week you went all the way up to the mountains above copperhead to talk to the trolls .  what did you want from them .      the girl put her head on one side .      how do you know i did that .         it   s at the top of your mind  girl .  anyone could see it .  anyone with   good sight .         i shall be able to do that one day     said the girl smugly .      who knows .  possibly .  what did you want from the trolls .         i   wanted to talk to them .  d   you know they think time goes backward .  because you can see the past  they say  and        the woman in the circle laughed .      but they are like the stupid dwarfs .  all they are interested in is pebbles .  there is nothing of interest in pebbles .      the girl gives a kind of one shoulder uni shrug  as if indicating that pebbles may be full of quiet interest .      why can   t you come out from between the stones .      there was a distinct impression that this was the wrong question to have asked .  the woman carefully ignored it .      i can help you find far more than pebbles     she said .      you can   t come out of the circle  can you .         let me give you what you want .         i can go anywhere  but you   re stuck in the circle     said the girl .      can you go anywhere .         when i am a witch i shall be able to go anywhere .         but you   ll never be a witch .         what .         they say you won   t listen .  they say you can   t keep your temper .  they say you have no discipline .      the girl tossed her hair .     oh  you know that too  do you .  well  they would say that  wouldn   t they .  but i mean to be a witch whatever they say .  you can find things out for yourself .  you don   t have to listen to a lot of daft old ladies who   ve never had a life .  and  circle lady  i shall be the best witch there has ever been .         with my help  i believe you may     said the woman in the circle .     your young man is looking for you  i think     she added mildly .   another of those one shoulder shrugs  indicating that the young man can go on looking all day .      i will  will i .         you could be a great witch .  you could be anything .  anything you want .  come into the circle .  let me show you .      the girl takes a few steps forward  and then hesitates .  there is something about the woman   s tone .  the smile is pleasant and friendly  but there is something in the voice   too desperate  too urgent  too hungry .      but i   m learning a lot           step through the stones now .      the girl hesitates again .      how do i know           circle time is nearly over .  think of what you can learn .  now .         but           step through .      but that was a long time ago  in the past .   and besides  the bitch is        older .      a land of ice     not winter  because that presumes an autumn and perhaps one day a spring .  this is a land of ice  not just a time of ice .   and three figures on horseback  looking down the snow covered slope to a ring of eight stones .  from this side they look much bigger .   you might watch the figures for some time before you realized what it was about them that was strange   stranger  that is  than their clothing .  the hot breath of their horses hung in the freezing air .  but the breath of the riders did not .      and this time     said the figure in the center  a woman in red     there will be no defeat .  the land will welcome us .  it must hate humans now .         but there were witches     said one of the other riders .     i remember the witches .         once  yes     said the woman .     but now   poor things  poor things .  scarce any power in them at all .  and suggestible .  pliant minds .  i have crept about  my deary .  i have crept about o    nights .  i know the witches they have now .  leave the witches to me .         i remember the witches     said the third rider insistently .     minds like   like metal .         not anymore .  i tell you  leave them to me .      the queen smiled benevolently at the stone circle .      and then you can have them     she said .     for me  i rather fancy a mortal husband .  a special mortal .  a union of the worlds .  to show them that this time we mean to stay .         the king will not like that .         and when has that ever mattered .         never  lady .         the time is right  lankin .  the circles are opening .  soon we can return .      the second rider leaned on the saddlehorn .      and i can hunt again     it said .     when .  when .         soon     said the queen .     soon .         it was a dark night  the kind of darkness which is not simply explainable by absence of moon or stars  but the darkness that appears to flow in from somewhere else   so thick and tangible that maybe you could snatch a handful of air and squeeze the night out of it .   it was the kind of darkness which causes sheep to leap fences and dogs to skulk in kennels .   yet the wind was warm  and not so much strong as loud   it howled around the forests and wailed in chimneys .   on nights like this  normal people would pull the covers over their head  sensing that there were times when the world belonged to something else .  in the morning it would be human again  there would be fallen branches  a few tiles off the roof  but human .  for now   better to snuggle down     but there was one man awake .   jason ogg  master blacksmith and farrier  pumped the bellows of his forge once or twice for the look of the thing  and sat down on his anvil again .  it was always warm in the forge  even with the wind whistling around the eaves .   he could shoe anything  could jason ogg .  they   d brought him an ant once  for a joke  and he   d sat up all night with a magnifying glass and an anvil made out of the head of a pin .  the ant was still around  somewhere   sometimes he could hear it clatter across the floor .   but tonight   well  tonight  in some way  he was going to pay the rent .  of course  he owned the forge .  it had been passed down for generations .  but there was more to a forge than bricks and mortar and iron .  he couldn   t put a name to it  but it was there .  it was the difference between being a master farrier and just someone who bent iron in complicated ways for a living .  and it had something to do with iron .  and something to do with being allowed to be very good at his job .  some kind of rent .   one day his dad had taken him aside and explained what he had to do  on nights like this .   there   d be times  he said  there   d be times   and he   d know when they were without being told   there   d be times when someone would come with a horse to shoe .  make them welcome .  shoe the horse .  don   t let your mind wander .  and try not to think about anything except horseshoes .   he   d got quite used to it now .   the wind rose  and somewhere there was the creak of a tree going over .   the latch rattled .   then there was a knock at the door .  once .  twice .   jason ogg picked up his blindfold and put it on .  that was important  his dad had said .  it saved you getting distracted .   he undid the door .      evening  m   lord     he said .   a wild night .   he smelled wet horse as it was led into the forge  hooves clattering on the stones .      there   s tea brewing on the forge and our dreen done us some biscuits in the tin with a present from ankh morpork on it .      thank you .  i trust you are well .      yes  m   lord .  i done the shoes already .  won   t hold you up long .  i know you   re   very busy  like .      he heard the click click of footsteps cross the floor to the old kitchen chair reserved for customers  or at least for the owners of customers .   jason had laid the tools and the horseshoes and the nails ready to hand on the bench beside the anvil .  he wiped his hands on his apron  picked up a file  and set to work .  he didn   t like cold shoeing  but he   d shod horses ever since he was ten .  he could do it by feel .  he picked up a rasp and set to work .   and he had to admit it .  it was the most obedient horse he   d ever encountered .  pity he   d never actually seen it .  it   d be a pretty good horse  a horse like that     his dad had said  don   t try to sneak a look at it .   he heard the glug of the teapot and then the glingglong sound of a spoon being stirred and then the clink as the spoon was laid down .   never any sound  his dad had said .  except when he walks and talks  you   ll never hear him make a sound .  no smacking of lips  stuff like that .   no breathing .   oh  and another thing .  when you takes the old shoes off  don   t chuck    em in the corner for to go for melt with the other scrap .  keep    em separate .  melt    em separate .  keep a pot special for it  and make the new shoes out of that metal .  whatever else you do  never put that iron on another living thing .   in fact  jason had saved one set of the old shoes for pitching contests at the various village fairs  and never lost when he used them .  he won so often that it made him nervous  and now they spent most of their time hanging on a nail behind the door .   sometimes the wind rattled the window frame  or made the coals crackle .  a series of thumps and a squawk a little way off suggested that the chicken house at the end of the garden had parted company with the ground .   the customer   s owner poured himself another cup of tea .   jason finished one hoof and let it go .  then he held out his hand .  the horse shifted its weight and raised the last hoof .   this was a horse in a million .  perhaps more .   eventually  he had finished .  funny  that .  it never seemed to take very long .  jason had no use for a clock  but he had a suspicion that a job which took the best part of an hour was at the same time over in a matter of minutes .      there     he said .        tis done .      thank you .  i must say these are very good biscuits .  how do they get the bits of chocolate in .      dunno  m   lord     said jason  staring fixedly at the inside of his blindfold .   i mean  the chocolate ought to melt out when they   re baked .  how do they do it  do you think .         tis probably a craft secret     said jason .     i never asks that kind o    question .      good man .  very wise .  i must     he had to ask  if only so   s he   d always know that he had asked .      m   lord .      yes  mr .  ogg .      i    as got one question        yes  mr .  ogg .   jason ran his tongue over his lips .      if i were to   take the blindfold off  what   d i see .      there .  it was done now .   there was a clicking sound on the flagstones  and a change in the air movement which suggested to jason that the speaker was now standing in front of him .   are you a man of faith  mr .  ogg .   jason gave this some swift consideration .  lancre was not knee deep in religions .  there were the nine day wonderers  and the strict offlians  and there were various altars to small gods of one sort or another  tucked away in distant clearings .  he   d never really felt the need  just like the dwarfs .  iron was iron and fire was fire   start getting metaphysical and you were scraping your thumb on the bottom of your hammer .   what do you really have faith in  right at this moment .   he   s inches away  jason thought .  i could reach out and touch     there was a smell .  it wasn   t unpleasant .  it was hardly anything at all .  it was the smell of air in old forgotten rooms .  if centuries could smell  then old ones would smell like that .   mr .  ogg .   jason swallowed .      well  m   lord     he said     right now   i really believe in this blindfold .      good man .  good man .  and now   i must be going .   jason heard the latch lift .  there was a thud as the doors scraped back  driven by the wind  and then there was the sound of hooves on the cobbles again .   your work  as always  is superb .      thank you  m   lord .      i speak as one craftsman to another .      thank you  m   lord .      we will meet again .      yes  m   lord .      when next my horse needs shoeing .      yes  m   lord .      jason closed the door and bolted it  although there was probably no point  when you thought about it .   but that was the bargain   you shod anything they brought to you  anything  and the payment was that you could shoe anything .  there had always been a smith in lancre  and everyone knew the smith in lancre was a very powerful smith indeed .   it was an ancient bargain  and it had something to do with iron .      the wind slackened .  now it was a whisper around the horizons  as the sun rose .   this was the octarine grass country .  good growing country  especially for corn .   and here was a field of it  waving gently between the hedges .  not a big field .  not a remarkable one  really .  it was just a field with corn in it  except of course during the winter  when there were just pigeons and crows in it .   the wind dropped .   the corn still waved .  they weren   t the normal swells of the wind .  they spread out from the center of the field like ripples from a dropped stone .   the air sizzled and was filled with an angry buzzing .   then  in the center of the field  rustling as it bent  the young corn lay down .   in a circle .   and in the sky the bees swarmed and teemed  buzzing angrily .      it was a few weeks to midsummer .  the kingdom of lancre dozed in the heat  which shimmered on the forests and the fields .   three dots appeared in the sky .   after a while  they became identifiable as three female figures on broomsticks  flying in a manner reminiscent of the famous three plaster flying ducks .   observe them closely .   the first one   let us call her the leader   flies sitting bolt upright  in defiance of air resistance  and seems to be winning .  she has features that would generally be described as striking  or even handsome  but she couldn   t be called beautiful  at least by anyone who didn   t want their nose to grow by three feet .   the second is dumpy and bandy legged with a face like an apple that   s been left for too long and an expression of near terminal good nature .  she is playing a banjo and  until a better word comes to mind  singing .  it is a song about a hedgehog .   unlike the broomstick belonging to the first figure  which is more or less unburdened except for a sack or two  this one is overladen with things like fluffy purple toy donkeys  corkscrews in the shape of small boys urinating  bottles of wine in straw baskets  and other international cultural items .  nestling among them is the smelliest and most evil minded cat in the world  currently asleep .   the third  and definitely the last  broomstick rider is also the youngest .  unlike the other two  who dress like ravens  she wears bright  cheerful clothes which don   t suit her now and probably didn   t even suit her ten years ago .  she travels with an air of vague good natured hopefulness .  there are flowers in her hair but they   re wilting slightly  just like her .   the three witches pass over the borders of lancre  the kingdom  and very shortly afterward over the town of lancre itself .  they begin their descent over the moorlands beyond  eventually touching down near a standing stone which happens to mark the boundaries of their territories .   they   re back .   and everything   s all right again .   for about five minutes .      there was a badger in the privy .   granny weatherwax poked it with her broom until it got the message and lumbered off .  then she took down the key which hung on the nail beside the copy of last year   s almanack and booke of dayes  and walked back up the path to her cottage .   a whole winter away .  there   d be a lot to do .  go and pick the goats up from mr .  skindle  get the spiders out of the chimney  fish the frogs out of the well  and generally get back into the business of minding everyone   s business for them because there   d be no telling what business people   d get up to without a witch around     but she could afford an hour with her feet up first .   there was a robin   s nest in the kettle  too .  the birds had got in through a broken window pane .  she carefully took the kettle outside and wedged it over the door so   s to be safe from weasels  and boiled up some water in a saucepan .   then she wound up the clock .  witches didn   t have much use for clocks  but she kept it for the tick   well  mainly for the tick .  it made a place seem lived in .  it had belonged to her mother  who   d wound it up every day .   it hadn   t come as a surprise to her when her mother died  firstly because esme weatherwax was a witch and witches have an insight into the future and secondly because she was already pretty experienced in medicine and knew the signs .  so she   d had a chance to prepare herself  and hadn   t cried at all until the day afterward  when the clock stopped right in the middle of the funeral lunch .  she   d dropped a tray of ham rolls and then had to go and sit by herself in the privy for a while  so that no one would see .   time to think about that sort of thing  now .  time to think about the past     the clock ticked .  the water boiled .  granny weatherwax fished a bag of tea from the meager luggage on her broomstick  and swilled out the teapot .   the fire settled down .  the clamminess of a room unlived in for months was gradually dispelled .  the shadows lengthened .   time to think about the past .  witches have an insight into the future .  the business she   d have to mind soon enough would be her own     and then she looked out of the window .      nanny ogg balanced carefully on a stool and ran a finger along the top of the dresser .  then she inspected the finger .  it was spotless .      hummph     she said .     seems to be moderately clean .      the daughters in law shivered with relief .      so far     nanny added .   the three young women drew together in their mute terror .   her relationship with her daughters in law was the only stain on nanny ogg   s otherwise amiable character .  sons in law were different   she could remember their names  even their birthdays  and they joined the family like overgrown chicks creeping under the wings of a broody bantam .  and grandchildren were treasures  every one .  but any woman incautious enough to marry an ogg son might as well resign herself to a life of mental torture and nameless domestic servitude .   nanny ogg never did any housework herself  but she was the cause of housework in other people .   she got down from the stool and beamed at them .      you kept the place quite nice     she said .     well done .      her smile faded .      under the bed in the spare room     she said .     haven   t looked under there yet  have i .      inquisitors would have thrown nanny ogg out of their ranks for being too nasty .   she turned as more members of the family filed into the room  and her face contorted into the misty grin with which she always greeted grandchildren .   jason ogg pushed his youngest son forward .  this was pewsey ogg  aged four  who was holding something in his hands .      what you got there  then .     said nanny .     you can show your nan .      pewsey held it up .      my word  you have been a        it happened right there  right then  right in front of her .      and then there was magrat .   she   d been away eight months .   now panic was setting in .  technically she was engaged to the king  verence ii .  well   not exactly engaged  as such .  there was  she was almost sure  a general unspoken understanding that engagement was a definite option .  admittedly she   d kept on telling him that she was a free spirit and definitely didn   t want to be tied down in any way  and of course this was the case  more or less  but   but     but   well   eight months .  anything could have happened in eight months .  she should have come straight back from genua  but the other two had been enjoying themselves .   she wiped the dust off her mirror and examined herself critically .  not a lot to work with  really .  no matter what she did with her hair it took about three minutes for it to tangle itself up again  like a garden hosepipe left in a shed .   she   d bought herself a new green dress  but what had looked exciting and attractive on the plaster model looked like a furled umbrella on magrat .   whereas verence had been here reigning for eight months .  of course  lancre was so small that you couldn   t lie down without a passport  but he was a genuine king and genuine kings tended to attract young women looking for career opportunities in the queening department .   she did her best with the dress and dragged a vengeful brush through her hair .   then she went up to the castle .   guard duty at lancre castle was the province of anyone who didn   t have much of anything else to do at the moment .  on duty today was nanny ogg   s youngest son shawn  in ill fitting chain mail .  he brought himself to what he probably thought was attention as magrat pattered past  and then dropped his pike and hurried after her .      can you slow down a bit  please  miss .      he overtook her  ran up the steps to the door  picked up a trumpet that was hanging from a nail by a bit of string  and blew an amateurish fanfare .  then he looked panicky again .      wait right there  miss  right there   count to five  and then knock     he said  and darted through the door  slamming it behind him .   magrat waited  and then tried the knocker .   after a few seconds shawn opened the door .  he was red in the face and had a powdered wig on back to front .      yeeeuss .     he drawled  and tried to look like a butler .      you   ve still got your helmet on under the wig     said magrat helpfully .   shawn deflated .  his eyes swiveled upward .      everyone at the haymaking .     said magrat .   shawn raised his wig  removed the helmet  and put the wig back .  then he distractedly put the helmet back on top of the wig .      yes  and mr .  spriggins the butler is in bed with his trouble again     said shawn .     there   s only me  miss .  and i   ve got to get the dinner started before i   m off    ome because mrs .  scorbic is poorly .         you don   t have to show me in     said magrat .     i do know the way .         no  it   s got to be done proper     said shawn .     you just keep movin    slow and leave it to me .      he ran on ahead and flung open some double doors        meeeyisss magraaaaat garrrrrli ick .         and scurried toward the next set of doors .   by the third pair he was out of breath  but he did his best .      meeeyisss   magraaaaa   garrrrrli ick   his majesteeeyyaa the ki   oh  bugger  now where   s he gone .      the throne room was empty .   they eventually found verence ii  king of lancre  in the stable yard .   some people are born to kingship .  some achieve kingship  or at least arch generalissimo father of his countryship .  but verence had kingship thrust upon him .  he hadn   t been raised to it  and had only arrived at the throne by way of one of those complicated mix ups of fraternity and parentage that are all too common in royal families .   he had in fact been raised to be a fool  a man whose job it was to caper and tell jokes and have custard poured down his trousers .  this had naturally given him a grave and solemn approach to life and a grim determination never to laugh at anything ever again  especially in the presence of custard .   in the role of ruler  then  he had started with the advantage of ignorance .  no one had ever told him how to be a king  so he had to find out for himself .  he   d sent off for books on the subject .  verence was a great believer in the usefulness of knowledge derived from books .   he had formed the unusual opinion that the job of a king is to make the kingdom a better place for everyone to live in .   now he was inspecting a complicated piece of equipment .  it had a pair of shafts for a horse  and the rest of it looked like a cartful of windmills .   he glanced up  and smiled in an absentminded way .      oh  hello     he said .     all back safe then .         um       magrat began .      it   s a patent crop rotator     said verence .  he tapped the machine .     just arrived from ankh morpork .  the wave of the future  you know .  i   ve really been getting interested in agricultural improvement and soil efficiency .  we   ll really have to get cracking on this new three field system .      magrat was caught off balance .      but i think we   ve only got three fields     she said     and there isn   t much soil in           it   s very important to maintain the correct relationship between grains  legumes  and roots     said verence  raising his voice .     also  i   m seriously considering clover .  i should be interested to know what you think .         um           and i think we should do something about the pigs .     verence shouted .     the lancre stripe .  is very hardy .  but we could really bring the poundage up .  by careful cross breeding .  with  say  the sto saddleback .  i   m having a boar sent up   shawn  will you stop blowing that damn trumpet .      shawn lowered the trumpet .      i   m doin    a fanfare  your majesty .         yes  yes  but you   re not supposed to go on .  a few brief notes are a sufficiency .     verence sniffed .     and something   s burning .         oh  blow   it   s the carrots       shawn hurried away .      that   s better     said verence .     where were we .         pigs  i think     said magrat     but i really came to           it all comes down to the soil     said verence .     get the soil right  and everything else follows .  incidentally  i   m arranging the marriage for midsummer day .  i thought you   d like that .      magrat   s mouth formed an o .      we could move it  of course  but not too much because of the harvest     said verence .      i   ve had some invitations sent out already  to the more obvious guests     said verence .      and i thought it might be a nice idea to have some sort of fair or festival beforehand     said verence .      i asked boggi   s in ankh morpork to send up their best dressmaker with a selection of materials and one of the maids is about your size and i think you   ll be very pleased with the result     said verence .      and mr .  ironfoundersson  the dwarf  came down the mountain specially to make the crown     said verence .      and my brother and mr .  vittoller   s men can   t come because they   re touring klatch  apparently  but hwel the playsmith has written a special play for the wedding entertainment .  something even rustics can   t muck up  he says     said verence .      so that   s all settled then .     said verence .   finally  magrat   s voice returned from some distant apogee  slightly hoarse .      aren   t you supposed to ask me .     she demanded .      what .  um .  no  actually     said verence .     no .  kings don   t ask .  i looked it up .  i   m the king  you see  and you are  no offense meant  a subject .  i don   t have to ask .      magrat   s mouth opened for the scream of rage but  at last  her brain jolted into operation .   yes  it said  of course you can yell at him and sweep away .  and he   ll probably come after you .   very probably .   um .   maybe not that probably .  because he might be a nice little man with gentle runny eyes but he   s also a king and he   s been looking things up .  but very probably quite probably .   but     do you want to bet the rest of your life .  isn   t this what you wanted anyway .  isn   t it what you came here hoping for .  really .   verence was looking at her with some concern .      is it the witching .     he said .     you don   t have to give that up entirely  of course .  i   ve got a great respect for witches .  and you can be a witch queen  although i think that means you have to wear rather revealing clothes and keep cats and give people poisoned apples .  i read that somewhere .  the witching   s a problem  is it .         no     magrat mumbled     it   s not that   um   did you mention a crown .         you   ve got to have a crown     said verence .     queens do .  i looked it up .      her brain cut in again .  queen magrat  it suggested .  it held up the mirror of the imagination        you   re not upset  are you .     said verence .      what .  oh .  no .  me .  no .         good .  that   s all sorted out  then .  i think that just about covers everything  don   t you .         um        verence rubbed his hands together .      we   re doing some marvelous things with legumes     he said  as if he hadn   t just completely rearranged magrat   s life without consulting her .     beans  peas   you know .  nitrogen fixers .  and marl and lime  of course .  scientific husbandry .  come and look at this .      he bounced away enthusiastically .      you know     he said     we could really make this kingdom work .      magrat trailed after him .   so that was all settled  then .  not a proposal  just a statement .  she hadn   t been quite sure how the moment would be  even in the darkest hours of the night  but she   d had an idea that roses and sunsets and bluebirds might just possibly be involved .  clover had not figured largely .  beans and other leguminous nitrogen fixers were not a central feature .   on the other hand magrat was  at the core  far more practical than most people believed who saw no further than her vague smile and collection of more than three hundred pieces of occult jewelry  none of which worked .   so this was how you got married to a king .  it all got arranged for you .  there were no white horses .  the past flipped straight into the future  carrying you with it .   perhaps that was normal .  kings were busy people .  magrat   s experience of marrying them was limited .      where are we going .     she said .      the old rose garden .      ah   well  this was more like it .   except that there weren   t any roses .  the walled garden had been stripped of its walks and arbors and was now waist high in green stalks with white flowers .  bees were furiously at work in the blossoms .      beans .     said magrat .      yes .  a specimen crop .  i keep bringing the farmers up here to show them     said verence .  he sighed .     they nod and mumble and smile but i   m afraid they just go off and do the same old things .         i know     said magrat .     the same thing happened when i tried to give people lessons in natural childbirth .      verence raised an eyebrow .  even to him the thought of magrat giving lessons in childbirth to the fecund and teak faced women of lancre was slightly unreal .      really .  how had they been having babies before .     he said .      oh  any old way     said magrat .   they looked at the little buzzing bean field .      of course  when you   re queen  you won   t need to       verence began .   it happened softly  almost like a kiss  as light as the touch of sunlight .   there was no wind  only a sudden heavy calmness that made the ears pop .   the stems bent and broke  and lay down in a circle .   the bees roared  and fled .      the three witches arrived at the standing stone together .   they didn   t even bother with explanations .  there were some things you know .      in the middle of my bloody herbs .     said granny weatherwax .      on the palace garden .     said magrat .      poor little mite .  and he was holding it up to show me  too .     said nanny ogg .   granny weatherwax paused .      what   re you talking about  gytha ogg .     she said .      our pewsey was growing mustard and cress on a flannel for his nan     said nanny ogg  patiently .     he shows it to me  right enough  and just as i bends down and   splat .  crop circle .         this     said granny weatherwax     is serious .  it   s been years since they   ve been as bad as this .  we all know what it means  don   t we .  what we   ve got           um     said magrat .         to do now is           excuse me     said magrat .  there were some things you had to be told .      yes .         i don   t know what it means     said magrat .     i mean  old goodie whemper              maysherestinpeace       the older witches chorused .         told me once that the circles were dangerous  but she never said anything about why .      the older witches shared a glance .      never told you about the dancers .     said granny weatherwax .      never told you about the long man .     said nanny ogg .      what dancers .  you mean those old stones up on the moor .         all you need to know right now     said granny weatherwax     is that we   ve got to put a stop to them .         what them .      granny radiated innocence        the circles  of course     she said .      oh  no     said magrat .     i can tell by the way you said it .  you said them as though it was some sort of curse .  it wasn   t just a them  it was a them with a capital the .      the old witches looked awkward again .      and who   s the long man .     said magrat .      we do not     said granny     ever talk about the long man .         no harm in telling her about the dancers  at any rate     mumbled nanny ogg .      yes  but   you know   i mean   she   s magrat     said granny .      what   s that meant to mean .     magrat demanded .      you probably won   t feel the same way about them  is what i am saying     said granny .      we   re talking about the       nanny ogg began .      don   t name    em .         yeah  right .  sorry .         mind you  a circle might not find the dancers     said granny .     we can always hope .  could be just random .         but if one opens up inside the       said nanny ogg .   magrat snapped .      you just do this on purpose .  you talk in code the whole time .  you always do this .  but you won   t be able to when i   m queen .      that stopped them .   nanny ogg put her head on one side .      oh .     she said .     young verence popped the question  then .         yes .         when   s the happy event .     said granny weatherwax  icily .      two weeks    time     said magrat .     midsummer day .         bad choice  bad choice     said nanny ogg .     shortest night o    the year           gytha ogg .         and you   ll be my subjects     said magrat  ignoring this .     and you   ll have to curtsy and everything .      she knew as soon as she said it that it was stupid  but anger drove her on .   granny weatherwax   s eyes narrowed .      hmm     she said .     we will  will we .         yes  and if you don   t     said magrat     you can get thrown in prison .         my word     said granny .     deary deary me .  i wouldn   t like that .  i wouldn   t like that at all .      all three of them knew that the castle dungeons  which in any case had never been its most notable feature  were now totally unused .  verence ii was the most amiable monarch in the history of lancre .  his subjects regarded him with the sort of good natured contempt that is the fate of all those who work quietly and conscientiously for the public good .  besides  verence would rather cut his own leg off than put a witch in prison  since it   d save trouble in the long run and probably be less painful .      queen magrat  eh .     said nanny ogg  trying to lighten the atmosphere a bit .     cor .  well  the old castle could do with a bit of lightening up           oh  it   ll lighten up all right     said granny .      well  anyway  i don   t have to bother with this sort of thing     said magrat .     whatever it is .  it   s your business .  i just shan   t have time  i   m sure .         i   m sure you can please yourself  your going to be majesty     said granny weatherwax .      hah .     said magrat .     i can .  you can jol   you can damn well find another witch for lancre .  all right .  another soppy girl to do all the dreary work and never be told anything and be talked over the head of the whole time .  i   ve got better things to do .         better things than being a witch .     said granny .   magrat walked into it .      yes .         oh  dear     murmured nanny .      oh .  well  then i expect you   ll be wanting to be off     said granny  her voice like knives .     back to your palace  i   ll be bound .         yes .      magrat picked up her broomstick .   granny   s arm shot out very fast and grabbed the handle .      oh  no     she said     you don   t .  queens ride around in golden coaches and whatnot .  each to their own .  brooms is for witches .         now come on  you two     began nanny ogg  one of nature   s mediators .     anyway  someone can be a queen and a w           who cares .     said magrat  dropping the broomstick .     i don   t have to bother with that sort of thing anymore .      she turned  clutched at her dress  and ran .  she became a figure outlined against the sunset .      you daft old besom  esme     said nanny ogg .     just because she   s getting wed .         you know what she   d say if we told her     said granny weatherwax .     she   d get it all wrong .  the gentry .  circles .  she   d say it was   nice .  best for her if she   s out of it .         they ain   t been active for years and years     said nanny .     we   ll need some help .  i mean   when did you last go up to the dancers .         you know how it is     said granny .     when it   s so quiet   you don   t think about    em .         we ought to have kept    em cleared .         true .         we better get up there first thing tomorrow     said nanny ogg .      yes .         better bring a sickle  too .         there isn   t much of the kingdom of lancre where you could drop a football and not have it roll away from you .  most of it is moorland and steeply forested hillside  giving way to sharp and ragged mountains where even trolls wouldn   t go and valleys so deep that they have to pipe the sunlight in .   there was an overgrown path up to the moorland where the dancers stood  even though it was only a few miles from the town .  hunters tracked up there sometimes  but only by accident .  it wasn   t that the hunting was bad but  well        there were the stones .   stone circles were common enough everywhere in the mountains .  druids built them as weather computers and since it was always cheaper to build a new    megalith circle than upgrade an old slow one there were generally plenty of ancient ones around .   no druids ever came near the dancers .   the stones weren   t shaped .  they weren   t even positioned in any particularly significant way .  there wasn   t any of that stuff about the sun striking the right stone at dawn on the right day .  someone had just dragged eight red rocks into a rough circle .   but the weather was different .  people said that  if it started to rain  it always began to fall inside the circle a few seconds after it had started outside  as if the rain was coming from further away .  if clouds crossed the sun  it   d be a moment or two before the light faded inside the circle .   william scrope is going to die in a couple of minutes .  it has to be said that he shouldn   t have been hunting deer out of season  and especially not the fine stag he was tracking  and certainly not a fine stag of the ramtop red species  which is officially endangered although not as endangered  right now  as william scrope .   it was ahead of him  pushing through the bracken  making so much noise that a blind man could have tracked it .   scrope waded through after it .   mist was still hanging around the stones  not in a blanket but in long raggedy strings .   the stag reached the circle now  and stopped .  it trotted back and forth once or twice  and then looked up at scrope .   he raised the crossbow .   the stag turned  and leapt between the stones .   there were only confused impressions from then on .  the first was of        distance .  the circle was a few yards across  it shouldn   t suddenly appear to contain so much distance .   and the next was of        speed .  something was coming out of the circle  a white dot growing bigger and bigger .   he knew he   d aimed the bow .  but it was whirled out of his hands as the thing struck  and suddenly there was only the sensation of        peace .   and the brief remembrance of pain .   william scrope died .   william scrope looked through his hands at the crushed bracken .  the reason that it was crushed was that his own body was sprawled upon it .   his newly deceased eyes surveyed the landscape .   there are no delusions for the dead .  dying is like waking up after a really good party  when you have one or two seconds of innocent freedom before you recollect all the things you did last night which seemed so logical and hilarious at the time  and then you remember the really amazing thing you did with a lampshade and two balloons  which had them in stitches  and now you realize you   re going to have to look a lot of people in the eye today and you   re sober now and so are they but you can both remember .      oh     he said .   the landscape flowed around the stones .  it was all so obvious now  when you saw it from the outside     obvious .  no walls  only doors .  no edges  only corners     william scrope .      yes .      if you would please step this way .      are you a hunter .      i like to think i am a picker up of unconsidered trifles .   death grinned hopefully .  scrope   s post physical brow furrowed .      what .  like   sherry  custard   that sort of thing .      death sighed .  metaphors were wasted on people .  sometimes he felt that no one took him seriously enough .   i take away people   s lives is what i mean  he said testily .      where to .      we shall have to see  won   t we .   william scrope was already fading into the mist .      that thing that got me        yes .      i thought they were extinct .         no .  they just went away .      where to .      death extended a bony digit .   over there .      magrat hadn   t originally intended to move into the palace before the wedding  because people would talk .  admittedly a dozen people lived in the palace  which had a huge number of rooms  but she   d still be under the same roof  and that was good enough .  or bad enough .   that was before .  now her blood was sizzling .  let people talk .  she had a pretty good idea which people they   d be  too .  which person  anyway .  witch person .  hah .  let them talk all they liked .   she got up early and packed her possessions  such as they were .  it wasn   t exactly her cottage  and most of the furniture went with it .  witches came and went  but witches    cottages went on forever  usually with the same thatch they started with .   but she did own the set of magical knives  the mystic colored cords  the assorted grails and crucibles  and a box full of rings  necklaces  and bracelets heavy with the hermetic symbols of a dozen religions .  she tipped them all into a sack .   then there were the books .  goodie whemper had been something of a bookworm among witches .  there were almost a dozen .  she hesitated about the books  and finally she let them stay on the shelves .   there was the statutory pointy hat .  she   d never liked it anyway  and had always avoided wearing it .  into the sack with it .   she looked around wild eyed until she spotted the small cauldron in the inglenook .  that   d do .  into the sack with that  and then tie the neck with string .   on the way up to the palace she crossed the bridge over lancre gorge and tossed the sack into the river .   it bobbed for a moment in the strong current  and then sank .   she   d secretly hoped for a string of multicolored bubbles  or even a hiss .  but it just sank .  just as if it wasn   t anything very important .      another world  another castle     the elf galloped over the frozen moat  steam billowing from its black horse and from the thing it carried over its neck .   it rode up the steps and into the hall itself  where the queen sat amidst her dreams        my lord lankin .         a stag .      it was still alive .  elves were skilled at leaving things alive  often for weeks .      from out of the circle .         yes  lady .         it   s weakening .  did i not tell you .         how long .  how long .         soon .  soon .  what went through the other way .      the elf tried to avoid her face .      your   pet  lady .         no doubt it won   t go far .     the queen laughed .     no doubt it will have an amusing time           it rained briefly at dawn .   there   s nothing nastier to walk through than shoulder high wet bracken .  well  there is .  there are an uncountable number of things nastier to walk through  especially if they   re shoulder high .  but here and now  thought nanny ogg  it was hard to think of more than one or two .   they hadn   t landed inside the dancers  of course .  even birds detoured rather than cross that airspace .  migrating spiders on gossamer threads floating half a mile up curved around it .  clouds split in two and flowed around it .   mist hung around the stones .  sticky  damp mist .   nanny hacked vaguely at the clinging bracken with her sickle .      you there  esme .     she muttered .   granny weatherwax   s head rose from a clump of bracken a few feet away .      there   s been things going on     she said  in a cold and deliberate tone .      like what .         all the bracken and weeds is trampled around the stones .  i reckon someone   s been dancing .      nanny ogg gave this the same consideration as would a nuclear physicist who   d just been told that someone was banging two bits of sub critical uranium together to keep warm .      they never     she said .      they have .  and another thing        it was hard to imagine what other thing there could be  but nanny ogg said    yes .     anyway .      someone got killed up here .         oh  no     moaned nanny ogg .     not inside the circle too .         nope .  don   t be daft .  it was outside .  a tall man .  he had one leg longer   n the other .  and a beard .  he was probably a hunter .         how   d you know all that .         i just trod on    im .      the sun rose through the mists .      the morning rays were already caressing the ancient stones of unseen university  premier college of wizardry  five hundred miles away .   not that many wizards were aware of this .   for most of the wizards of unseen university their lunch was the first meal of the day .  they were not  by and large  breakfast people .  the archchancellor and the librarian were the only two who knew what the dawn looked like from the front  and they tended to have the entire campus to themselves for several hours .   the librarian was always up early because he was an orang utan  and they are naturally early risers  although in his case he didn   t bellow a few times to keep other males off his territory .  he just unlocked the library and fed the books .   and mustrum ridcully  the current archchancellor  liked to wander around the sleepy buildings  nodding to the servants and leaving little notes for his subordinates  usually designed for no other purpose than to make it absolutely clear that he was up and attending to the business of the day while they were still fast asleep .    today  however  he had something else on his mind .  more or less literally .   it was round .  there was healthy growth all around it .  he could swear it hadn   t been there yesterday .   he turned his head this way and that  squinting at the reflection in the mirror of the other mirror he was holding above his head .   the next member of staff to wake up after ridcully and the librarian was the bursar  not because he was a naturally early riser  but because by around ten o   clock the archchancellor   s very limited supply of patience came to an end and he would stand at the bottom of the stairs and shout      bursaaar .         until the bursar appeared .   in fact it happened so often that the bursar  a natural neurovore   frequently found that he   d got up and dressed himself in his sleep several minutes before the bellow .  on this occasion he was upright and fully clothed and halfway to the door before his eyes snapped open .   ridcully never wasted time on small talk .  it was always large talk or nothing .      yes  archchancellor .     said the bursar  glumly .   the archchancellor removed his hat .      what about this  then .     he demanded .      um  um  um   what  archchancellor .         this  man .  this .      close to panic  the bursar stared desperately at the top of ridcully   s head .      the what .  oh .  the bald spot .         i have not got a bald spot .         um  then           i mean it wasn   t there yesterday .         ah .  well .  um .     at a certain point something always snapped inside the bursar  and he couldn   t stop himself .     of course these things do happen and my grandfather always swore by a mixture of honey and horse manure  he rubbed it on every day           i   m not going bald .      a tic started to dance across the bursar   s face .  the words started to come out by themselves  without the apparent intervention of his brain .         and then he got this device with a glass rod and  and  and you rubbed it with a silk cloth and           i mean it   s ridiculous .  my family have never gone bald  except for one of my aunts .            and  and  and then he   d collect morning dew and wash his head  and  and  and        ridcully subsided .  he was not an unkind man .      what   re you taking for it at the moment .     he murmured .      dried  dried  dried  dried     stuttered the bursar .      the old dried frog pills  right .         r r r r .         left hand pocket .         r r r r .         ok   right   swallow        they stared at one another for a moment .   the bursar sagged .      m m much better now  archchancellor  thank you .         something   s definitely happening  bursar .  i can feel it in my water .         anything you say  archchancellor .         bursar .         yes  archchancellor .         you ain   t a member of some secret society or somethin     are you .         me .  no  archchancellor .         then it   d be a damn good idea to take your underpants off your head .            know him .     said granny weatherwax .   nanny ogg knew everyone in lancre  even the forlorn thing on the bracken .      it   s william scrope  from over slice way     she said .     one of three brothers .  he married that palliard girl  remember .  the one with the air cooled teeth .         i hope the poor woman   s got some respectable black clothes     said granny weatherwax .      looks like he   s been stabbed     said nanny .  she turned the body over  gently but firmly .  corpses as such didn   t worry her .  witches generally act as layers out of the dead as well as midwives  there were plenty of people in lancre for whom nanny ogg   s face had been the first and last thing they   d ever seen  which had probably made all the bit in the middle seem quite uneventful by comparison .      right through     she said .     stabbed right through .  blimey .  who   d do a thing like that .      both the witches turned to look at the stones .      i don   t know what  but i knows where it come from     said granny .   now nanny ogg could see that the bracken all around the stones was indeed well trodden down  and quite brown .      i   m going to get to the bottom of this     said granny .      you   d better not go into           i knows exactly where i should go  thank you .      there were eight stones in the dancers .  three of them had names .  granny walked around the ring until she reached the one known as the piper .   she removed a hatpin from among the many that riveted her pointy hat to her hair and held it about six inches from the stone .  then she let it go  and watched what happened .   she went back to nanny .      there   s still power there     she said .     not much  but the ring is holding .         but who   d be daft enough to come up here and dance around the stones .     said nanny ogg  and then  as a treacherous thought drifted across her mind  she added     magrat   s been away with us the whole time .         we shall have to find out     said granny  setting her face in a grim smile .     now help me up with the poor man .      nanny ogg bent to the task .      coo  he   s heavy .  we could   ve done with young magrat up here .         no .  flighty     said granny weatherwax .     head easily turned .         nice girl  though .         but soppy .  she thinks you can lead your life as if fairy stories work and folk songs are really true .  not that i don   t wish her every happiness .         hope she does all right as queen     said nanny .      we taught her everything she knows     said granny weatherwax .      yeah     said nanny ogg  as they disappeared into the bracken .     d   you think   maybe    .         what .         d   you think maybe we ought to have taught her everything we know .         it   d take too long .         yeah  right .         it took a while for letters to get as far as the archchancellor .  the post tended to be picked up from the university gates by anyone who happened to be passing  and then left lying on a shelf somewhere or used as a pipe lighter or a bookmark or  in the case of the librarian  as bedding .   this one had only taken two days  and was quite intact apart from a couple of cup rings and a bananary fingerprint .  it arrived on the table along with the other post while the faculty were at breakfast .  the dean opened it with a spoon .      anyone here know where lancre is .     he said .      why .     said ridcully  looking up sharply .      some king   s getting married and wants us to come .         oh dear  oh dear     said the lecturer in recent runes .     some tinpot king gets wed and he wants us to come .         it   s up in the mountains     said the archchancellor  quietly .     good trout fishin    in those parts  as i recall .  my word .  lancre .  good grief .  hadn   t thought about the place in years .  you know  there   s glacier lakes up there where the fish   ve never seen a rod .  lancre .  yes .         and it   s far too far     said the lecturer in recent runes .   ridcully wasn   t listening .     and there   s deer .  thousands of head of deer .  and elk .  wolves all over the place .  mountain lions too  i shouldn   t wonder .  i heard that ice eagles have been seen up there again  too .      his eyes gleamed .      there   s only half a dozen of    em left     he said .   mustrum ridcully did a lot for rare species .  for one thing  he kept them rare .      it   s the back of beyond     said the dean .     right off the edge of the map .         used to stay with my uncle up there  in the holidays     said ridcully  his eyes misty with distance .     great days i had up there .  great days .  the summers up there   and the sky   s a deeper blue than anywhere else  it   s very   and the grass   and        he returned abruptly from the landscapes of memory .      got to go  then     he said .     duty calls .  head of state gettin    married .  important occasion .  got to have a few wizards there .  look of the thing .  nobblyess obligay .         well  i   m not going     said the dean .     it   s not natural  the countryside .  far too many trees .  never could stand it .         the bursar could do with an outing     said ridcully .     seems a bit jumpy just lately  can   t imagine why .     he leaned forward to look along the high table .     bursaaar .      the bursar dropped his spoon into his oatmeal .      see what i mean .     said ridcully .     bundle o    nerves the whole time .  i was saying you could do with some fresh air  bursar .     he nudged the dean heavily .     hope he   s not going off his rocker  poor fella     he said  in what he chose to believe was a whisper .     spends too much time indoors  if you get my drift .      the dean  who went outdoors about once a month  shrugged his shoulders .      i expect you   d like a little time away from the university  eh .     said the archchancellor  nodding and grimacing madly .     peace and quiet .  healthy country livin    .         i  i  i  i should like that very much  archchancellor     said the bursar  hope rising in his face like an autumn mushroom .      good man .  good man .  you shall come with me     said ridcully  beaming .   the bursar   s expression froze .      got to be someone else  too     said ridcully .     volunteers  anyone .      the wizards  townies to a man  bent industriously over their food .  they always bent industriously over their food in any case  but this time they were doing it to avoid catching ridcully   s eye .      what about the librarian .     said the lecturer in recent runes  throwing a random victim to the wolves .   there was a sudden babble of relieved agreement .      good choice     said the dean .     just the thing for him .  countryside .  trees .  and   and   trees .         mountain air     said the lecturer in recent runes .      yes  he   s been looking peaky lately     said the reader in invisible writings .      it   d be a real treat for him     said the lecturer in recent runes .      home away from home  i expect     said the dean .     trees all over the place .      they all looked expectantly at the archchancellor .      he doesn   t wear clothes     said ridcully .     and he goes    ook    all the time .         he does wear the old green robe thing     said the dean .      only when he   s had a bath .      ridcully rubbed his beard .  in fact he quite liked the librarian  who never argued with him and always kept himself in shape  even if that shape was a pear shape .  it was the right shape for an orang utan .   the thing about the librarian was that no one noticed he was an orang utan anymore  unless a visitor to the university happened to point it out .  in which case someone would say     oh  yes .  some kind of magical accident  wasn   t it .  pretty sure it was something like that .  one minute human  next minute an ape .  funny thing  really   can   t remember what he looked like before .  i mean  he must have been human  i suppose .  always thought of him as an ape  really .  it   s more him .      and indeed it had been an accident among the potent and magical books of the university library that had as it were bounced the librarian   s genotype down the evolutionary tree and back up a different branch  with the significant difference that now he could hang on to it upside down with his feet .      oh  all right     said the archchancellor .     but he   s got to wear something during the ceremony  if only for the sake of the poor bride .      there was a whimper from the bursar .   all the wizards turned toward him .   his spoon landed on the floor with a small thud .  it was wooden .  the wizards had gently prevented him from having metal cutlery since what was now known as the unfortunate incident at dinner .      a a a a     gurgled the bursar  trying to push himself away from the table .      dried frog pills     said the archchancellor .     someone fish    em out of his pocket .      the wizards didn   t rush this .  you could find anything in a wizard   s pocket   peas  unreasonable things with legs  small experimental universes  anything     the reader in invisible writings craned to see what had unglued his colleague .      here  look at his porridge     he said .   there was a perfect round depression in the oatmeal .      oh dear  another crop circle     said the dean .   the wizards relaxed .      damn things turning up everywhere this year     said the archchancellor .  he hadn   t taken his hat off to eat the meal .  this was because it was holding down a poultice of honey and horse manure and a small mouse powered electrostatic generator he   d got those clever young fellas in the high energy magic research building to knock together for him  clever fellas they were  one day he might even understand half of what they were always gabblin    on about     in the meantime  he   d keep his hat on .      particularly strong  too     said the dean .     the gardener told me yesterday they   re playing merry hell with the cabbages .         i thought them things only turned up out in fields and things     said ridcully .     perfectly normal natural phenomenon .         if there is a suitably high flux level  the inter continuum pressure can probably overcome quite a high base reality quotient     said the reader in invisible writings .   the conversation stopped .  everyone turned to look at this most wretched and least senior member of the staff .   the archancellor glowered .      i don   t even want you to begin to start explainin    that     he said .     you   re probably goin    to go on about the universe bein    a rubber sheet with weights on it again  right .         not exactly a           and the word    quantum    is hurryin    toward your lips again     said ridcully .      well  the           and    continuinuinuum    too  i expect     said ridcully .   the reader in invisible writings  a young wizard whose name was ponder stibbons  sighed deeply .      no  archchancellor  i was merely pointing out           it   s not wormholes again  is it .      stibbons gave up .  using a metaphor in front of a man as unimaginative as ridcully was like a red rag to a bu   was like putting something very annoying in front of someone who was annoyed by it .   it was very hard  being a reader in invisible writings .       i reckon you   d better come too     said ridcully .      me  archchancellor .         can   t have you skulking around the place inventing millions of other universes that   re too small to see and all the rest of that continuinuinuum stuff     said ridcully .     anyway  i shall need someone to carry my rods and crossbo   my stuff     he corrected himself .   stibbons stared at his plate .  it was no good arguing .  what he had really wanted out of life was to spend the next hundred years of it in the university  eating big meals and not moving much in between them .  he was a plump young man with a complexion the color of something that lives under a rock .  people were always telling him to make something of his life  and that   s what he wanted to do .  he wanted to make a bed of it .      but  archchancellor     said the lecturer in recent runes     it   s still too damn far .         nonsense     said ridcully .     they   ve got that new turnpike open all the way to sto helit now .  coaches every wednesday  reg   lar .  bursaaar .  oh  give him a dried frog pill  someone   mr .  stibbons  if you could happen to find yourself in this universe for five minutes  go and arrange some tickets .  there .  all sorted out  right .         magrat woke up .   and knew she wasn   t a witch anymore .  the feeling just crept over her  as part of the normal stock taking that any body automatically does in the first seconds of emergence from the pit of dreams  arms     legs     existential dread       randomized guilt       witchcraft level     .    .   the point was  she couldn   t remember ever being anything else .  she   d always been a witch .  magrat garlick  third witch  that was what she was .  the soft one .   she knew she   d never been much good at it .  oh  she could do some spells and do them quite well  and she was good at herbs  but she wasn   t a witch in the bone like the old ones .  they made sure she knew it .   well  she   d just have to learn queening .  at least she was the only one in lancre .  no one   d be looking over her shoulder the whole time  saying things like     you ain   t holding that scepter right .      right     someone had stolen her clothes in the night .   she got up in her nightshirt and hopped over the cold flagstones to the door .  she was halfway there when it opened of its own accord .   she recognized the small dark girl that came in  barely visible behind a stack of linen .  most people in lancre knew everyone else .      millie chillum .      the linen bobbed a curtsy .      yes   m .      magrat lifted up part of the stack .      it   s me  magrat     she said .     hello .         yes   m .     another bob .      what   s up with you  millie .         yes   m .     bob  bob .      i said it   s me .  you don   t have to look at me like that .         yes   m .      the nervous bobbing continued .  magrat found her own knees beginning to jerk in sympathy but as it were behind the beat  so that as she was bobbing down she overtook the girl bobbing up .      if you say    yes   m    again  it will go very hard with you     she managed  as she went past .      y   right  your majesty  m   m .      faint light began to dawn .      i   m not queen yet  millie .  and you   ve known me for twenty years     panted magrat  on the way up .      yes   m .  but you   re going to be queen .  so me mam told me i was to be respectful     said millie  still curtsying nervously .      oh .  well .  all right  then .  where are my clothes .         got    em here  your pre majesty .         they   re not mine .  and please stop going up and down all the time .  i feel a bit sick .         the king ordered    em from sto helit special  m   m .         did he  eh .  how long ago .         dunno  m   m .      he knew i was coming home  thought magrat .  how .  what   s going on here .   there was a good deal more lace than magrat was used to  but that was  as it were  the icing on the cake .  magrat normally wore a simple dress with not much underneath it except magrat .  ladies of quality couldn   t get away with that kind of thing .  millie had been provided with a sort of technical diagram  but it wasn   t much help .   they studied it for some time .      this is a standard queen outfit  then .         couldn   t say  m   m .  i think his majesty just sent    em a lot of money and said to send you everything .      they spread out the bits on the floor .      is this the pantoffle .      outside  on the battlements  the guard changed .  in fact he changed into his gardening apron and went off to hoe the beans .  inside  there was considerable sartorial discussion .      i think you   ve got it up the wrong way  m   m .  which bit   s the farthingale .         says here insert tabbe a into slotte b .  can   t find slotte b .         these   re like saddlebags .  i   m not wearing these .  and this thing .         a ruff  m   m .  um .  they   re all the rage in sto helit  my brother says .         you mean they make people angry .  and what   s this .         brocade  i think .         it   s like cardboard .  do i have to wear this sort of thing everyday .         don   t know  i   m sure  m   m .         but verence just trots around in leather gaiters and an old jacket .         ah  but you   re queen .  queens can   t do that sort of thing .  everyone knows that  m   m .  it   s all right for kings to go wandering around with their arse half out their trous        she rammed her hand over her mouth .      it   s all right     said magrat .     i   m sure even kings have   tops to their legs just like everyone else .  just go on with what you were saying .      millie had gone bright red .      i mean  i mean  i mean  queens has got to be ladylike     she managed .     the king got books about it .  ettiquetty and stuff .      magrat surveyed herself critically in the mirror .      it really suits you  your soon going to be majesty     said millie .   magrat turned this way and that .      my hair   s a mess     she said  after a while .      please m   m  the king said he   s having a hairdresser come all the way from ankh morpork  m   m .  for the wedding .      magrat patted a tress into place .  it was beginning to dawn on her that being a queen was a whole new life .      my word     she said .     and what happens now .         dunno  m   m .         what   s the king doing .         oh  he had breakfast early and buggered off over to slice to show old muckloe how to breed his pigs out of a book .         so what do i do .  what   s my job .      millie looked puzzled although this did not involve much of a change in her general expression .      dunno  m   m .  reigning  i suppose .  walking around in the garden .  holding court .  doin    tapestry .  that   s very popular among queens .  and then   er   later on there   s the royal succession           at the moment     said magrat firmly     we   ll have a go at the tapestry .         ridcully was having difficulty with the librarian .      i happen to be your archchancellor  sir .         oook .         you   ll like it up there .  fresh air .  bags of trees .  more woods than you can shake a stick at .         oook .         come down this minute .         oook .         the books   ll be quite safe here during the holidays .  good grief  it   s hard enough to get students to come in here at the best of times           oook .      ridcully glared at the librarian  who was hanging by his toes from the top shelf of parazoology ba to mn .      oh  well     he said  his voice suddenly low and cunning     it   s a great shame  in the circumstances .  they   ve got a pretty good library in lancre castle  i heard .  well  they call it a library   it   s just a lot of old books .  never had a catalogue near    em  apparently .         oook .         thousands of books .  someone told me there   s incunibles  too .  shame  really  you not wanting to see them .      ridcully   s voice could have greased axles .      oook .         but i can see your mind is quite made up .  so i shall be going .  farewell .      ridcully paused outside the library door  counting under his breath .  he   d reached    three    when the librarian knuckled through at high speed  caught by the incunibles .      so that   ll be four tickets  then .     said ridcully .      granny weatherwax set about finding out what had been happening around the stones in her own distinctive way .   people underestimate bees .   granny weatherwax didn   t .  she had half a dozen hives of them and knew  for example  there is no such creature as an individual bee .  but there is such a creature as a swarm  whose component cells are just a bit more mobile than those of  say  the common whelk .  swarms see everything and sense a lot more  and they can remember things for years  although their memory tends to be external and built out of wax .  a honeycomb is a hive   s memory   the placement of egg cells  pollen cells  queen cells  honey cells  different types of honey  are all part of the memory array .   and then there are the big fat drones .  people think all they do is hang around the hive all year  waiting for those few brief minutes when the queen even notices their existence  but that doesn   t explain why they   ve got more sense organs than the roof of the ciabuilding .   granny didn   t really keep bees .  she took some old wax every year  for candles  and the occasional pound of honey that the hives felt they could spare  but mainly she had them for someone to talk to .   for the first time since she   d returned home  she went to the hives .   and stared .   bees were boiling out of the entrances .  the thrum of wings filled the normally calm little patch behind the raspberry bushes .  brown bodies zipped through the air like horizontal hail .   she wished she knew why .   bees were her one failure .  there wasn   t a mind in lancre she couldn   t borrow .  she could even see the world through the eyes of earthworms .   but a swarm  a mind made up of thousands of mobile parts  was beyond her .  it was the toughest test of all .  she   d tried over and over again to ride on one  to see the world through ten thousand pairs of multifaceted eyes all at once  and all she   d ever got was a migraine and an inclination to make love to flowers .   but you could tell a lot from just watching bees .  the activity  the direction  the way the guard bees acted     they were acting extremely worried .   so she went for a lie down  as only granny weatherwax knew how .      nanny ogg tried a different way  which didn   t have much to do with witchcraft but did have a lot to do with her general oggishness .   she sat for a while in her spotless kitchen  drinking rum and smoking her foul pipe and staring at the paintings on the wall .  they had been done by her youngest grandchildren in a dozen shades of mud  most of them of blobby stick figures with the word gran blobbily blobbed in underneath in muddy blobby letters .   in front of her the cat greebo  glad to be home again  lay on his back with all four paws in the air  doing his celebrated something found in the gutter impersonation .   finally nanny got up and ambled thoughtfully down to jason ogg   s smithy .   a smithy always occupied an important position in the villages  doing the duty of town hall  meeting room  and general clearing house for gossip .  several men were lounging around in it now  filling in time between the normal lancre occupations of poaching and watching the women do the work .      jason ogg  i wants a word with you .      the smithy emptied like magic .  it was probably something in nanny ogg   s tone of voice .  but nanny reached out and grabbed one man by the arm as he tried to go past at a sort of stumbling crouch .      i   m glad i   ve run into you  mr .  quarney     she said .     don   t rush off .  store doing all right  is it .      lancre   s only storekeeper gave her the look a three legged mouse gives an athletic cat .  nevertheless  he tried .      oh  terrible bad  terrible bad business is right now  mrs .  ogg .         same as normal  eh .      mr .  quarney   s expression was pleading .  he knew he wasn   t going to get out without something  he just wanted to know what it was .      well  now     said nanny     you know the widow scrope  lives over in slice .      quarney   s mouth opened .      she   s not a widow     he said .     she           bet you half a dollar .     said nanny .   quarney   s mouth stayed open  and around it the rest of his face recomposed itself in an expression of fascinated horror .      so she   s to be allowed credit  right  until she gets the farm on its feet     said nanny  in the silence .  quarney nodded mutely .      that goes for the rest of you men listening outside the door     said nanny  raising her voice .     dropping a cut of meat on her doorstep once a week wouldn   t come amiss  eh .  and she   ll probably want extra help come harvest .  i knows i can depend on you all .  now  off you go        they ran for it  leaving nanny ogg standing triumphantly in the doorway .   jason ogg looked at her hopelessly  a fifteen stone man reduced to a four year old boy .      jason .         i got to do this bit of brazing for old           so     said nanny  ignoring him     what   s been happening in these parts while we   ve been away  my lad .      jason poked at the fire distractedly with an iron bar .      oh  well  us had a big whirlwind on hogswatchnight and one of mother peason   s hens laid the same egg three times  and old poorchick   s cow gave birth to a seven headed snake  and there was a rain of frogs over in slice           been pretty normal  then     said nanny ogg .  she refilled her pipe in a casual but meaningful way .      all very quiet  really     said jason .  he pulled the bar out of the fire  laid it on the anvil  and raised his hammer .      i   ll find out sooner or later  you know     said nanny ogg .   jason didn   t turn his head  but his hammer stopped in mid air .      i always does  you know     said nanny ogg .   the iron cooled from the color of fresh straw to bright red .      you knows you always feels better for telling your old mum     said nanny ogg .   the iron cooled from red to spitting black .  but jason  used all day to the searing heat of a forge  seemed to be uncomfortably warm .      i should beat it up before it gets cold     said nanny ogg .      weren   t my fault  mum .  how could i stop    em .      nanny sat back in the chair  smiling happily .      what them would these be  my son .         that young diamanda and that perdita and that girl with the red hair from over in bad ass and them others .  i says to old peason  i says you   d have something to say  i tole    em mistress weatherwax   d get her knic   would definitely be sarcastic when she found out     said jason .     but they just laughs .  they said they could teach    emselves witching .      nanny nodded .  actually  they were quite right .  you could teach yourself witchcraft .  but both the teacher and the pupil had to be the right kind of person .      diamanda .     she said .     don   t recall the name .         really she   s lucy tockley     said jason .     she says diamanda is more   more witchy .         ah .  the one that wears the big floppy felt hat .         yes  mum .         she   s the one that paints her nails black  too .         yes  mum .         old tockley sent her off to school  didn   t he .         yes  mum .  she came back while you was gone .         ah .      nanny ogg lit her pipe from the forge .  floppy hat and black nails and education .  oh  dear .      how many of these gels are there  then .     she said .      bout half a dozen .  but they   m good at it  mum .         yeah .         and it ain   t as if they   ve been doing anything bad .      nanny ogg stared reflectively at the glow in the forge .   there was a bottomless quality to nanny ogg   s silences .  and also a certain directional component .  jason was quite clear that the silence was being aimed at him .   he always fell for it .  he tried to fill it up .      and that diamanda   s been properly educated     he said .     she knows some lovely words .      silence .      and i knows you   ve always said there weren   t enough young girls interested in learnin    witching these days     said jason .  he removed the iron bar and hit it a few times  for the look of the thing .   more silence flowed in jason   s direction .      they goes and dances up in the mountains every full moon .      nanny ogg removed her pipe and inspected the bowl carefully .      people do say     said jason  lowering his voice     that they dances in the altogether .         altogether what .     said nanny ogg .      you know  mum .  in the nudd .         cor .  there   s a thing .  anyone see where they go .         nah .  weaver the thatcher says they always gives him the slip .         jason .         yes  mum .         they bin dancin    around the stones .      jason hit his thumb .      there were a number of gods in the mountains and forests of lancre .  one of them was known as herne the hunted .  he was a god of the chase and the hunt .  more or less .   most gods are created and sustained by belief and hope .  hunters danced in animal skins and created gods of the chase  who tended to be hearty and boisterous with the tact of a tidal wave .  but they are not the only gods of hunting .  the prey has an occult voice too  as the blood pounds and the hounds bay .  herne was the god of the chased and the hunted and all small animals whose ultimate destiny is to be an abrupt damp squeak .   he was about three feet high with rabbit ears and very small horns .  but he did have an extremely good turn of speed  and was using it to the full as he tore madly through the woods .      they   re coming .  they   re coming .  they   re all coming back .            who are .     said jason ogg .  he was holding his thumb in the water trough .   nanny ogg sighed .      them     she said .     you know .  them .  we ain   t certain  but           who   s them .      nanny hesitated .  there were some things you didn   t tell ordinary people .  on the other hand  jason was a blacksmith  which meant he wasn   t ordinary .  blacksmiths had to keep secrets .  and he was family  nanny ogg had had an adventurous youth and wasn   t very good at counting  but she was pretty certain he was her son .      you see     she said  waving her hands vaguely     them stones   the dancers   see  in the old days   see  once upon a time        she stopped  and tried again to explain the essentially fractal nature of reality .      like   there   s some places that   re thinner than others  where the old doorways used to be  well  not doorways  never exactly understood it myself  not doorways as such  more places where the world is thinner   anyway  the thing is  the dancers   are a kind of fence   we  well  when i say we i mean thousands of years ago   i mean  but they   re not just stones  they   re some kind of thunderbolt iron but   there   s things like tides  only not with water  it   s when worlds get closer together   n you can nearly step between    em   anyway  if people   ve been hangin    around the stones  playin    around   then they   ll be back  if we   re not careful .         what they .         that   s the whole trouble     said nanny  miserably .     if i tells you  you   ll get it all wrong .  they lives on the other side of the dancers .      her son stared at her .  then a faint grin of realization wandered across his face .      ah     he said .     i knows .  i heard them wizards down in ankh is always accidentally rippin    holes in this fabric o    reality they got down there  and you get them horrible things coming out o    the dungeon dimensions .  huge buggers with dozens o    eyeballs and more legs   n a morris team .     he gripped his no .    hammer .     don   t you worry  mum .  if they starts poppin    out here  we   ll soon           no  it ain   t like that     said nanny .     those live outside .  but them lives   over there .      jason looked completely lost .   nanny shrugged .  she   d have to tell someone  sooner or later .      the lords and ladies     she said .      who   re they .      nanny looked around .  but  after all  this was a forge .  there had been a forge here long before there was a castle  long before there was even a kingdom .  there were horseshoes everywhere .  iron had entered the very walls .  it wasn   t just a place of iron  it was a place where iron died and was reborn .  if you couldn   t speak the words here  you couldn   t speak    em anywhere .   even so  she   d rather not .      you know     she said .     the fair folk .  the gentry .  the shining ones .  the star people .  you know .         what .      nanny put her hand on the anvil  just in case  and said the word .   jason   s frown very gently cleared  at about the same speed as a sunrise .      them .     he said .     but aren   t they nice and    .         see .     said nanny .     i told you you   d get it wrong .            how much .     said ridcully .   the coachman shrugged .      take it or leave it     he said .      i   m sorry  sir     said ponder stibbons .     it   s the only coach .         fifty dollars each is daylight robbery .         no     said the coachman patiently .     daylight robbery     he said  in the authoritative tones of the experienced     is when someone steps out into the road with an arrow pointing at us and then all his friends swings down from the rocks and trees and take away all our money and things .  and then there   s nighttime robbery  which is like daytime robbery except they set fire to the coach so   s they can see what they   re about .  twilight robbery  now  your basic twilight robbery is           are you saying     said ridcully     that getting robbed is included in the price .         bandits    guild     said the coachman .     forty dollars per head  see .  it   s a kind of flat rate .         what happens if we don   t pay it .     said ridcully .      you end up flat .      the wizards went into a huddle .      we   ve got a hundred and fifty dollars     said ridcully .     we can   t get any more out of the safe because the bursar ate the key yesterday .         can i try an idea  sir .     said ponder .      all right .      ponder gave the coachman a bright smile .      pets travel free .     he suggested .      oook .         nanny ogg   s broomstick skimmed a few feet above the forest paths  cornering so fast that her boots scraped through the leaves .  she leapt off at granny weatherwax   s cottage so quickly that she didn   t switch it off  and it kept going until it stuck in the privy .   the door was open .      cooee .      nanny glanced into the scullery  and then thumped up the small narrow staircase .   granny weatherwax was stretched rigid on her bed .  her face was gray  her skin was cold .   people had discovered her like this before  and it always caused embarrassment .  so now she reassured visitors but tempted fate by always holding  in her rigid hands  a small handwritten sign which read   i ate   nt dead .   the window was propped open with a piece of wood .      ah     said nanny  far more for her own benefit than for anyone else   s     i sees you   re out .  i   ll  i   ll  i   ll just put the kettle on  shall i  and wait    til you comes back .      esme   s skill at borrowing unnerved her .  it was all very well entering the minds of animals and such  but too many witches had never come back .  for several years nanny had put out lumps of fat and bacon rind for a bluetit that she was sure was old granny postalute  who   d gone out borrowing one day and never came back .  insofar as a witch could consider things uncanny  nanny ogg considered it uncanny .   she went back down to the scullery and lowered a bucket down the well  remembering to fish the newts out this time before she boiled the kettle .   then she watched the garden .   after a while a small shape flittered across it  heading for the upstairs window .   nanny poured out the tea .  she carefully took one spoonful of sugar out of the sugar basin  tipped the rest of the sugar into her cup  put the spoonful back in the basin  put both cups on a tray  and climbed the stairs .   granny weatherwax was sitting up in her bed .   nanny looked around .   there was a large bat hanging upside down from a beam .   granny weatherwax rubbed her ears .      shove the po under it  will you  gytha .     she mumbled .     they   re a devil for excusing themselves on the carpet .      nanny unearthed the shyest article of granny weatherwax   s bedroom crockery and moved it across the rug with her foot .      i brought you a cup of tea     she said .      good job  too .  mouth tastes of moths     said granny .      thought you did owls at night .     said nanny .      yeah  but you ends up for days trying to twist your head right round     said granny .     at least bats always faces the same way .  tried rabbits first off  but you know what they are for remembering things .  anyway  you know what they thinks about the whole time .  they   re famous for it .         grass .         right .         find out anything .     said nanny .      half a dozen people have been going up there .  every full moon .     said granny .     gels  by the shape of them .  you only see silhouettes  with bats .         you done well there     said nanny  carefully .     girls from round here  you reckon .         got to be .  they ain   t using broomsticks .      nanny ogg sighed .      there   s agnes nitt  old threepenny   s daughter     she said .     and the tockley girl .  and some others .      granny weatherwax looked at her with her mouth open .      i asked our jason     she said .     sorry .      the bat burped .  granny genteelly covered her hand with her mouth .      i   m a silly old fool  ain   t i .     she said  after a while .      no  no     said nanny .     borrowing   s a real skill .  you   re really good at it .         prideful  that   s what i am .  once upon a time i   d of thought of asking people  too  instead of fooling around being a bat .         our jason wouldn   t have told you .  he only told me    cos i would   ve made    is life a living hell if he didn   t     said nanny ogg .     that   s what a mother   s for .         i   m losing my touch  that   s what it is .  getting old  gytha .         you   re as old as you feel  that   s what i always say .         that   s what i mean .      nanny ogg looked worried .      supposing magrat   d been here     said granny .     she   d see me being daft .         well  she   s safe in the castle     said nanny .     learning how to be queen .         at least the thing about queening     said granny     is that no one notices if you   re doing it wrong .  it has to be right    cos it   s you doing it .         s   funny  royalty     said nanny .     it   s like magic .  you take some girl with a bum like two pigs in a blanket and a head full of air and then she marries a king or a prince or someone and suddenly she   s this radiant right royal princess .  it   s a funny old world .         i ain   t going to kowtow to her  mind     said granny .      you never kowtow to anyone anyway     said nanny ogg patiently .     you never bowed to the old king .  you barely gives young verence a nod .  you never kowtows to anyone ever  anyway .         that   s right .     said granny .     that   s part of being a witch  that is .      nanny relaxed a bit .  granny being an old woman made her uneasy .  granny in her normal state of barely controlled anger was far more her old self .   granny stood up .      old tockley   s girl  eh .         that   s right .         her mother was a keeble  wasn   t she .  fine woman  as i recall .         yeah  but when she died the old man sent her off to sto lat to school .         don   t hold with schools     said granny weatherwax .     they gets in the way of education .  all them books .  books .  what good are they .  there   s too much reading these days .  we never had time to read when we was young  i know that .         we were too busy makin    our own entertainment .         right .  come on   we ain   t got much time .         what d   you mean .         it   s not just the girls .  there   s something out there  too .  some kind of mind  movin    around .      granny shivered .  she   d been aware of it in the same way that a skilled hunter  moving through the hills  is aware of another hunter   by the silences where there should have been noise  by the trampling of a stem  by the anger of the bees .   nanny ogg had never liked the idea of borrowing  and magrat had always refused even to give it a try .  the old witches on the other side of the mountain had too much trouble with inconvenient in body experiences to cope with the out of body kind .  so granny was used to having the mental dimension to herself .   there was a mind moving around in the kingdom  and granny weatherwax didn   t understand it .   she borrowed .  you had to be careful .  it was like a drug .  you could ride the minds of animals and birds  but never bees  steering them gently  seeing through their eyes .  granny weatherwax had many times flicked through the channels of consciousness around her .  it was  to her  part of the heart of witchcraft .  to see through other eyes        through the eyes of gnats  seeing the slow patterns of time in the fast pattern of one day  their minds traveling rapidly as lightning        to listen with the body of a beetle  so that the world is a three dimensional pattern of vibrations        to see with the nose of a dog  all smells now colors     but there was a price .  no one asked you to pay it  but the very absence of demand was a moral obligation .  you tended not to swat .  you dug lightly .  you fed the dog .  you paid .  you cared  not because it was kind or good  but because it was right .  you left nothing but memories  you took nothing but experience .   but this other roving intelligence   it   d go in and out of another mind like a chainsaw  taking  taking  taking .  she could sense the shape of it  the predatory shape  all cruelty and cool unkindness  a mind full of intelligence  that   d use other living things and hurt them because it was fun .   she could put a name to a mind like that .   elf .      branches thrashed high in the trees .   granny and nanny strode through the forest .  at least  granny weatherwax strode .  nanny ogg scurried .      the lords and ladies are trying to find a way     said granny .     and there   s something else .  something   s already come through .  some kind of animal from the other side .  scrope chased a deer into the circle and the thing must have been there  and they always used to say something can come through if something goes the other way           what thing .         you know what a bat   s eyesight is like .  just a big shape is all it saw .  something killed old scrope .  it   s still around .  not an   not one o    the lords and ladies     said granny     but something from el   that place .      nanny looked at the shadows .  there are a lot of shadows in a forest at night .      ain   t you scared .     she said .   granny cracked her knuckles .      no .  but i hope it is .         ooo  it   s true what they say .  you   re a prideful one  esmerelda weatherwax .         who says that .         well  you did .  just now .         i wasn   t feeling well .      other people would probably say  i wasn   t myself .  but granny weatherwax didn   t have anyone else to be .   the two witches hurried on through the gale .   from the shelter of a thorn thicket  the unicorn watched them go .      diamanda tockley did indeed wear a floppy black velvet hat .  it had a veil  too .   perdita nitt  who had once been merely agnes nitt before she got witchcraft  wore a black hat with a veil too  because diamanda did .  both of them were seventeen .  and she wished she was naturally skinny  like diamanda  but if you can   t be skinny you can at least look unhealthy .  so she wore so much thick white makeup in order to conceal her naturally rosy complexion that if she turned around suddenly her face would probably end up on the back of her head .   they   d done the raising of the cone of power  and some candle magic  and some scrying .  now diamanda was showing them how to do the cards .   she said they contained the distilled wisdom of the ancients .  perdita had found herself treacherously wondering who these ancients were   they clearly weren   t the same as old people  who were stupid  diamanda said  but she wasn   t quite clear why they were wiser than  say  modern people .   also  she didn   t understand what the feminine principle was .  and she wasn   t too clear about this inner self business .  she was coming to suspect that she didn   t have one .   and she wished she could do her eyes like diamanda did .   and she wished she could wear heels like diamanda did .   amanita device had told her that diamanda slept in a real coffin .   she wished she had the nerve to have a dagger and skull tattoo on her arm like amanita did  even if it was only in ordinary ink and she had to wash it off every night in case her mother saw it .   a tiny  nasty voice from perdita   s inner self suggested that amanita wasn   t a good choice of name .   or perdita  for that matter .   and it said that maybe perdita shouldn   t meddle with things she didn   t understand .   the trouble was  she knew  that this meant nearly everything .   she wished she could wear black lace like diamanda did .   diamanda got results .   perdita wouldn   t have believed it .  she   d always known about witches  of course .  they were old women who dressed like crows  except for magrat garlick  who was frankly mental and always looked as if she was going to burst into tears .  perdita remembered magrat bringing a guitar to a hogswatchnight party once and singing wobbly folk songs with her eyes shut in a way that suggested that she really believed in them .  she hadn   t been able to play  but this was all right because she couldn   t sing  either .  people had applauded because  well  what else could you do .   but diamanda had read books .  she knew about stuff .  raising power at the stones  for one thing .  it really worked .   currently she was showing them the cards .   the wind had got up again tonight .  it rattled the shutters and made soot fall down the chimney .  it seemed to perdita that it had blown all the shadows into the corners of the room        are you paying attention  sister .     said diamanda coldly .   that was another thing .  you had to call one another    sister     out of fraternity .      yes  diamanda     she said  meekly .      this is the moon     diamanda repeated     for those who weren   t paying attention .     she held up the card .     and what do we see here   you  muscara .         um   it   s got a picture of the moon on it .     said muscara  n  e susan  in a hopeful voice .      of course it   s not the moon .  it   s a nonmimetic convention  not tied to a conventional referencing system  actually     said diamanda .      ah .      a gust rocked the cottage .  the door burst open and slammed back against the wall  giving a glimpse of cloud wracked sky in which a nonmimetic convention was showing a crescent .   diamanda waved a hand .  there was a brief flash of octarine light .  the door jerked shut .  diamanda smiled in what perdita thought of as her cool  knowing way .   she placed the card on the black velvet cloth in front of her .   perdita looked at it gloomily .  it was all very pretty  the cards were colored like little pasteboard jewels  and they had interesting names .  but that little traitor voice whispered  how the hell can they know what the future holds .  cardboard isn   t very bright .   on the other hand  the coven was helping people   more or less .  raising power and all that sort of thing .  oh dear  supposing she asks me .   perdita realized that she was feeling worried .  something was wrong .  it had just gone wrong .  she didn   t know what it was  but it had gone wrong now .  she looked up .      blessings be upon this house     said granny weatherwax .   in much the same tone of voice have people said     eat hot lead  kincaid     and     i expect you   re wondering after all that excitement whether i   ve got any balloons and lampshades left .      diamanda   s mouth dropped open .         ere  you   re doing that wrong .  you don   t want to muck about with a hand like that     said nanny ogg helpfully  looking over her shoulder .     you   ve got a double onion there .         who are you .      suddenly they were there .  perdita thought  one minute there   s shadows  the next minute they were there  solid as anything .      what   s all the chalk on the floor  then .     said nanny ogg .     you   ve got all chalk on the floor .  and heathen writing .  not that i   ve got anything against heathens     she added .  she appeared to think about it .     i   m practic   ly one     she added further     but i don   t write on the floor .  what   d you want to write all on the floor for .     she nudged perdita .     you   ll never get the chalk out     she said     it gets right into the grain .         um  it   s a magic circle     said perdita .     um  hello  mrs .  ogg .  um .  it   s to keep bad influences away        granny weatherwax leaned forward slightly .      tell me  my dear     she said to diamanda     do you think it   s working .      she leaned forward further .   diamanda leaned backward .   and then slowly leaned forward again .   they ended up nose to nose .      who   s this .     said diamanda  out of the corner of her mouth .      um  it   s granny weatherwax     said perdita .     um .  she   s a witch  um           what level .     said diamanda .   nanny ogg looked around for something to hide behind .  granny weatherwax   s eyebrow twitched .      levels  eh .     she said .     well  i suppose i   m level one .         just starting .     said diamanda .      oh dear .  tell you what     said nanny ogg quietly to perdita     if we was to turn the table over  we could probably hide behind it  no problem .      but to herself she was thinking  esme can never resist a challenge .  none of us can .  you ain   t a witch if you ain   t got self confidence .  but we   re not getting any younger .  it   s like being a hired swordfighter  being a top witch .  you think you   re good  but you know there   s got to be someone younger  practicing every day  polishing up their craft  and one day you   re walkin    down the road and you hears this voice behind you sayin     go for your toad  or similar .   even for esme .  sooner or later  she   ll come up against someone faster on the craftiness than she is .      oh  yes     said granny  quietly .     just starting .  every day  just starting .      nanny ogg thought  but it won   t be today .      you stupid old woman     said diamanda     you don   t frighten me .  oh  yes .  i know all about the way you old ones frighten superstitious peasants  actually .  muttering and squinting .  it   s all in the mind .  simple psychology .  it   s not real witchcraft .         i   ll  er  i   ll just go into the scullery and  er  see if i can fill any buckets with water  shall i .     said nanny ogg  to no one in particular .      i    spect you   d know all about witchcraft     said granny weatherwax .      i   m studying  yes     said diamanda .   nanny ogg realized that she had removed her own hat and was biting nervously at the brim .      i    spect you   re really good at it     said granny weatherwax .      quite good     said diamanda .      show me .      she is good  thought nanny ogg .  she   s been facing down esme   s stare for more   n a minute .  even snakes generally give up after a minute .   if a fly had darted through the few inches of space between their stares it would have flashed into flame in the air .      i learned my craft from nanny gripes     said granny weatherwax     who learned it from goody heggety  who got it from nanna plumb  who was taught it by black aliss  who           so what you   re saying is     said diamanda  loading the words into the sentence like cartridges in a chamber     that no one has actually learned anything new .      the silence that followed was broken by nanny ogg saying     bugger  i   ve bitten right through the brim .  right through .         i see     said granny weatherwax .      look     said nanny ogg hurriedly  nudging the trembling perdita     right through the lining and everything .  two dollars and curing his pig that hat cost me .  that   s two dollars and a pig cure i shan   t see again in a hurry .         so you can just go away  old woman     said diamanda .      but we ought to meet again     said granny weatherwax .   the old witch and the young witch weighed one another up .      midnight .     said diamanda .      midnight .  nothing special about midnight .  practic   ly anyone can be a witch at midnight     said granny weatherwax .     how about noon .         certainly .  what are we fighting for .     said diamanda .      fighting .  we ain   t fighting .  we   re just showing each other what we can do .  friendly like     said granny weatherwax .   she stood up .      i   d better be goin        she said .     us old people need our sleep  you know how it is .         and what does the winner get .     said diamanda .  there was just a trace of uncertainty in her voice now .  it was very faint  on the richter scale of doubt it was probably no more than a plastic teacup five miles away falling off a low shelf onto a carpet  but it was there .      oh  the winner gets to win     said granny weatherwax .     that   s what it   s all about .  don   t bother to see us out .  you didn   t see us in .      the door slammed back .      simple psychokinesis     said diamanda .      oh  well .  that   s all right then     said granny weatherwax  disappearing into the night .     explains it all  that does .         there used to be such simple directions  back in the days before they invented parallel universes   up and down  right and left  backward and forward  past and future     but normal directions don   t work in the multiverse  which has far too many dimensions for anyone to find their way .  so new ones have to be invented so that the way can be found .   like  east of the sun  west of the moon .   or  behind the north wind .   or  at the back of beyond .   or  there and back again .   or  beyond the fields we know .   and sometimes there   s a short cut .  a door or a gate .  some standing stones  a tree cleft by lightning  a filing cabinet .   maybe just a spot on some moorland somewhere     a place where there is very nearly here .   nearly  but not quite .  there   s enough leakage to make pendulums swing and psychics get nasty headaches  to give a house a reputation for being haunted  to make the occasional pot hurl across a room .  there   s enough leakage to make the drones fly guard .   oh  yes .  the drones .   there are things called drone assemblies .  sometimes  on fine summer days  the drones from hives for miles around will congregate in some spot  and fly circles in the air  buzzing like tiny early warning systems  which is what they are .   bees are sensible .  it   s a human word .  but bees are creatures of order  and programmed into their very genes is a hatred of chaos .   if some people once knew where such a spot was  if they had experience of what happens when here and there become entangled  then they might   if they knew how   mark such a spot with certain stones .   in the hope that enough daft buggers would take it as a warning  and keep away .         well  what   d you think .     said granny  as the witches hurried home .      the little fat quiet one   s got a bit of natural talent     said nanny ogg .     i could feel it .  the rest of    em are just along for the excitement  to my mind .  playing at witches .  you know  ooh jar boards and cards and wearing black lace gloves with no fingers to    em and paddlin    with the occult .         i don   t hold with paddlin    with the occult     said granny firmly .     once you start paddlin    with the occult you start believing in spirits  and when you start believing in spirits you start believing in demons  and then before you know where you are you   re believing in gods .  and then you   re in trouble .         but all them things exist     said nanny ogg .      that   s no call to go around believing in them .  it only encourages    em .      granny weatherwax slowed to a walk .      what about her .     she said .      what exactly about her do you mean .         you felt the power there .         oh  yeah .  made my hair stand on end .         someone gave it to her  and i know who .  just a slip of a gel with a head full of wet ideas out of books  and suddenly she   s got the power and don   t know how to deal with it .  cards .  candles .  that   s not witchcraft  that   s just party games .  paddlin    with the occult .  did you see she   d got black fingernails .         well  mine ain   t so clean           i mean painted .         i used to paint my toenails red when i was young     said nanny  wistfully .      toenails is different .  so   s red .  anyway     said granny     you only did it to appear allurin    .         it worked  too .         hah .      they walked along in silence for a bit .      i felt a lot of power there     nanny ogg said  eventually .      yes .  i know .         a lot .         yes .         i   m not saying you couldn   t beat her     said nanny quickly .     i   m not saying that .  but i don   t reckon i could  and it seemed to me it   d raise a bit of a sweat even on you .  you   ll have to hurt her to beat her .         i   m losin    my judgment  aren   t i .         oh  i           she riled me  gytha .  couldn   t help myself .  now i   ve got to duel with a gel of seventeen  and if i wins i   m a wicked bullyin    old witch  and if i loses        she kicked up a drift of old leaves .      can   t stop myself  that   s my trouble .      nanny ogg said nothing .      and i loses my temper over the least little           yes  but           i hadn   t finished talkin    .         sorry  esme .      a bat fluttered by .  granny nodded to it .      heard how magrat   s getting along .     she said  in a tone of voice which forced casualness embraced like a corset .      settling in fine  our shawn says .         right .      they reached a crossroads  the white dust glowed very faintly in the moonlight .  one way led into lancre  where nanny ogg lived .  another eventually got lost in the forest  became a footpath  then a track  and eventually reached granny weatherwax   s cottage .      when shall we   two   meet again .     said nanny ogg .      listen     said granny weatherwax .     she   s well out of it  d   you hear .  she   ll be a lot happier as a queen .         i never said nothing     said nanny ogg mildly .      i know you never .  i could hear you not saying anything .  you   ve got the loudest silences i ever did hear from anyone who wasn   t dead .         see you about eleven o   clock  then .         right .      the wind got up again as granny walked along the track to her cottage .   she knew she was on edge .  there was just too much to do .  she   d got magrat sorted out  and nanny could look after herself  but the lords and the ladies   she hadn   t counted on them .   the point was     the point was that granny weatherwax had a feeling she was going to die .  this was beginning to get on her nerves .      knowing the time of your death is one of those strange bonuses that comes with being a true magic user .  and  on the whole  it is a bonus .   many a wizard has passed away happily drinking the last of his wine cellar and incidentally owing very large sums of money .   granny weatherwax had always wondered how it felt  what it was that you suddenly saw looming up .  and what it turned out to be was a blankness .   people think that they live life as a moving dot traveling from the past into the future  with memory streaming out behind them like some kind of mental cometary tail .  but memory spreads out in front as well as behind .  it   s just that most humans aren   t good at dealing with it  and so it arrives as premonitions  forebodings  intuitions  and hunches .  witches are good at dealing with it  and to suddenly find a blank where these tendrils of the future should be has much the same effect on a witch as emerging from a cloud bank and seeing a team of sherpas looking down on him does on an airline pilot .   she   d got a few days  and then that was it .  she   d always expected to have a bit of time to herself  get the garden in order  have a good clean up around the place so that whatever witch took over wouldn   t think she   d been a sloven  pick out a decent burial plot  and then spend some time sitting out in the rocking chair  doing nothing at all except looking at the trees and thinking about the past .  now   no chance .   and other things were happening .  her memory seemed to be playing up .  perhaps this is what happened .  perhaps you just drained away toward the end  like old nanny gripes  who ended up putting the cat on the stove and the kettle out for the night .   granny shut the door behind her and lit a candle .   there was a box in the dresser drawer .  she opened it on the kitchen table and took out the carefully folded piece of paper .  there was a pen and ink in there  too .   after some thought  she picked up where she had left off      and to my friend gytha ogg i leave my bedde and the rag rugge the smith in bad ass made for me  and the matchin jug and basin and wosfname sett she always had her eye on  and my broomstick what will be right as rain with a bit of work .   to magrat garlick i leave the contentes elsewhere in this box  my silver tea service with the milk jug in the shape of a humerous cow what is an heir loom  also the clocke what belonged to my mother  but i charge her alwayes to keep it wound  for when the clocke stops     there was a noise outside .   if anyone else had been in the room with her granny weatherwax would have thrown open the door boldly  but she was by herself .  she picked up the poker very carefully  moved surprisingly soundlessly to the door given the nature of her boots  and listened intently .   there was something in the garden .   it wasn   t much of a garden .  there were the herbs  and the soft fruit bushes  a bit of lawn and  of course  the beehives .  and it was open to the woods .  the local wildlife knew better than to invade a witch   s garden .   granny opened the door carefully .   the moon was setting .  pale silver light turned the world into monochrome .   there was a unicorn on the lawn .  the stink of it hit her .   granny advanced  holding the poker in front of her .  the unicorn backed away  and pawed at the ground .   granny saw the future plain .  she already knew the when .  now she was beginning to apprehend the how .      so     she said  under her breath     i knows where you came from .  and you can damn well get back there .      the thing made a feint at her  but the poker swung toward it .      can   t stand the iron  eh .  well  just you trot back to your mistress and tell her that we know all about iron in lancre .  and i knows about her .  she   s to keep away  understand .  this is my place .         then it was moonlight .  now it was day .   there was quite a crowd in what passed for lancre   s main square .  not much happened in lancre anyway  and a duel between witches was a sight worth seeing .   granny weatherwax arrived at a quarter to noon .  nanny ogg was waiting on a bench by the tavern .  she had a towel around her neck  and was carrying a bucket of water in which floated a sponge .      what   s that for .     said granny .      half time .  and i done you a plate of oranges .      she held up the plate .  granny snorted .      you look as if you could do with eating something  anyway     said nanny .     you don   t look as if you   ve had anything today        she glanced down at granny   s boots  and the grubby hem of her long black dress .  there were scraps of bracken and bits of heather caught on it .      you daft old besom .     she hissed .     what   ve you been doing .         i had to           you   ve been up at the stones  haven   t you .  trying to hold back the gentry .         of course     said granny .  her voice wasn   t faint .  she wasn   t swaying .  but her voice wasn   t faint and she wasn   t swaying  nanny ogg could see  because granny weatherwax   s body was in the grip of granny weatherwax   s mind .      someone   s got to     she added .      you could have come and asked me .         you   d have talked me out of it .      nanny ogg leaned forward .      you all right  esme .         fine .  i   m fine .  nothing wrong with me  all right .         have you had any sleep at all .     she said .      well           you haven   t  have you .  and then you think you can just stroll down here and confound this girl  just like that .         i don   t know     said granny weatherwax .   nanny ogg looked hard at her .      you don   t  do you .     she said  in a softer tone of voice .     oh  well   you better sit down here  before you fall down .  suck an orange .  they   ll be here in a few minutes .         no she won   t     said granny .     she   ll be late .         how d   you know .         no good making an entrance if everyone isn   t there to see you  is it .  that   s headology .      in fact the young coven arrived at twenty past twelve  and took up station on the steps of the market pentangle on the other side of the square .      look at    em     said granny weatherwax .     all in black  again .         well  we wear black too     said nanny ogg the reasonable .      only    cos it   s respectable and serviceable     said granny morosely .     not because it   s romantic .  hah .  the lords and ladies might as well be here already .      after some eye contact  nanny ogg ambled across the square and met perdita in the middle .  the young would be witch looked worried under her makeup .  she held a black lace handkerchief in her hands  and was twisting it nervously .      morning  mrs .  ogg     she said .      afternoon  agnes .         um .  what happens now .      nanny ogg took out her pipe and scratched her ear with it .      dunno .  up to you  i suppose .         diamanda says why does it have to be here and now .         so   s everyone can see     said nanny ogg .     that   s the point  ain   t it .  nothing hole and corner about it .  everyone   s got to know who   s best at witchcraft .  the whole town .  everyone sees the winner win and the loser lose .  that way there   s no argument  eh .      perdita glanced toward the tavern .  granny weatherwax had dozed off .      quietly confident     said nanny ogg  crossing her fingers behind her back .      um  what happens to the loser .     said perdita .      nothing  really     said nanny ogg .     generally she leaves the place .  you can   t be a witch if people   ve seen you beat .         diamanda says she doesn   t want to hurt the old lady too much     said perdita .     just teach her a lesson .         that   s nice .  esme   s a quick learner .         um .  i wish this wasn   t happening  mrs .  ogg .         that   s nice .         diamanda says mistress weatherwax has got a very impressive stare  mrs .  ogg .         that   s nice .         so the test is   just staring  mrs .  ogg .      nanny put her pipe in her mouth .      you mean the old first one to blink or look away challenge .         um  yes .         right .     nanny thought about it  and shrugged .         right .  but we   d better do a magic circle first .  don   t want anyone else getting hurt  do we .         do you mean using skorhian runes or the triple invocation octogram .     said perdita .   nanny ogg put her head on one side .      never heard of them things  dear     she said .     i always does a magic circle like this        she sidled crabwise away from the fat girl  dragging one toe in the dust .  she edged around in a rough circle about fifteen feet across  still dragging her boot  until she backed into perdita .      sorry .  there .  done it .         that   s a magic circle .         right .  people can come to harm else .  all kinds of magic zipping around the place when witches fight .         but you didn   t chant or anything .         no .         there has to be a chant  doesn   t there .         dunno .  never done one .         oh .         i could sing you a comic song if you likes     said nanny helpfully .      um  no .  um .     perdita had never heard nanny sing  but news gets around .      i like your black lace hanky     said nanny  not a bit abashed .     very good for not showing the bogies .      perdita stared at the circle as though hypnotized .     um .  shall we start  then .         right .      nanny ogg scurried back to the bench and elbowed granny in the ribs .      wake up .      granny opened an eye .      i weren   t asleep  i was just resting me eyes .         all you   ve got to do is stare her down .         at least she knows about the importance of the stare  then .  hah .  who does she think she is .  i   ve been staring at people all my life .         yes  that   s what   s bothering me   aaahh   who   s nana   s little boy  then .      the rest of the ogg clan had arrived .   granny weatherwax personally disliked young pewsey .  she disliked all small children  which is why she got on with them so well .  in pewsey   s case  she felt that no one should be allowed to wander around in just a vest even if they were four years old .  and the child had a permanently runny nose and ought to be provided with a handkerchief or  failing that  a cork .   nanny ogg  on the other hand  was instant putty in the hands of any grandchild  even one as sticky as pewsey .      want sweetie     growled pewsey  in that curiously deep voice some young children have .      just in a moment  my duck  i   m talking to the lady     nanny ogg fluted .      want sweetie now .         bugger off  my precious  nana   s busy right this minute .      pewsey pulled hard on nanny ogg   s skirts .      now sweetie now .      granny weatherwax leaned down until her impressive nose was about level with pewsey   s gushing one .      if you don   t go away     she said gravely     i will personally rip your head off and fill it with snakes .         there .     said nanny ogg .     there   s lots of poor children in klatch that   d be grateful for a curse like that .      pewsey   s little face  after a second or two of uncertainty  split into a pumpkin grin .      funny lady     he said .      tell you what     said nanny  patting pewsey on the head and then absentmindedly wiping her hand on her dress     you see them young ladies on the other side of the square .  they   ve got lots of sweeties .      pewsey waddled off .      that   s germ warfare  that is     said granny weatherwax .      come on     said nanny .     our jason   s put a couple of chairs in the circle .  you sure you   re all right .         i   ll do .      perdita nitt traipsed across the road again .      er   mrs .  ogg .         yes  dear .         er .  diamanda says you don   t understand  she says they won   t be trying to outstare one another           magrat was bored .  she   d never been bored when she was a witch .  permanently bewildered and overworked yes  but not bored .   she kept telling herself it   d probably be better when she really was queen  although she couldn   t quite see how .  in the meantime she wandered aimlessly through the castle   s many rooms  the swishing of her dress almost unheard above the background roar of the turbines of tedium      humdrumhumdrumhumdrum     she   d spent the whole morning trying to learn to do tapestry  because millie assured her that   s what queens did  and the sampler with its message    gods bless this hosue    was even now lying forlornly on her chair .   in the long gallery were huge tapestries of ancient battles  done by previous bored regal incumbents  it was amazing how all the fighters had been persuaded to stay still long enough .  and she   d looked at the many  many paintings of the queens themselves  all of them pretty  all of them well dressed according to the fashion of their times  and all of them bored out of their tiny well shaped skulls .   finally she went back to the solar .  this was the big room on top of the main tower .  in theory  it was there to catch the sun .  it did .  it also caught the wind and the rain .  it was a sort of drift net for anything the sky happened to throw .   she yanked on the bellpull that in theory summoned a servant .  nothing happened .  after a couple of further pulls  and secretly glad of the exercise  she went down to the kitchen .  she would have liked to spend more time there .  it was always warm and there was generally someone to talk to .  but nobblyess obligay   queens had to live above stairs .   below stairs there was only shawn ogg  who was cleaning the oven of the huge iron stove and reflecting that this was no job for a military man .      where   s everyone gone .      shawn leapt up  banging his head on the stove .      ow .  sorry  miss .  um .  everyone   s   everyone   s down in the square  miss .  i   m only here because mrs .  scorbic said she   d have my hide if i didn   t get all the yuk off .         what   s happening in the square  then .         they say there   s a couple of witches having a real set to  miss .         what .  not your mother and granny weatherwax .         oh no  miss .  some new witch .         in lancre .  a new witch .         i think that   s what mum said .         i   m going to have a look .         oh  i don   t think that   d be a good idea  miss     said shawn .   magrat drew herself up regally .      we happen to be queen     she said .     nearly .  so you don   t tell one one can   t do things  or one   ll have you cleaning the privies .         but i does clean the privies     said shawn  in a reasonable voice .     even the garderobe           and that   s going to go  for a start     said magrat  shuddering .     one   s seen it .         doesn   t bother me  miss  it   ll give me wednesday afternoons free     said shawn     but what i meant was  you   ll have to wait till i   ve gone down to the armory to fetch my horn for the fanfare .         one won   t need a fanfare  thank you very much .         but you got to have a fanfare  miss .         one can blow my own trumpet  thank you .         yes  miss .         miss what .         miss queen .         and don   t you forget it .         magrat arrived at as near to a run as was possible in the queen outfit  which ought to have had castors .   she found a circle of several hundred people and  near the edge  a very pensive nanny ogg .      what   s happening  nanny .      nanny turned .      oops  sorry .  didn   t hear no fanfare     she said .     i   d curtsy  only it   s my legs .      magrat looked past her at the two seated figures in the circle .      what   re they doing .         staring contest .         but they   re looking at the sky .         bugger that diamanda girl .  she   s got esme trying to outstare the sun     said nanny ogg .     no looking away  no blinking           how long have they been doing it .         about an hour     said nanny gloomily .      that   s terrible .         it   s bloody stupid is what it is     said nanny .     can   t think what   s got into esme .  as if power   s all there is to witching .  she knows that .  witching   s not power  it   s how you harness it .      there was a pale gold haze over the circle  from magical fallout .      they   ll have to stop at sunset     said magrat .      esme won   t last until sunset     said nanny .     look at her .  all slumped up .         i suppose you couldn   t use some magic to       magrat began .      talk sense     said nanny .     if esme found out  she   d kick me round the kingdom .  anyway  the others   d spot it .         perhaps we could create a small cloud or something .     said magrat .      no .  that   s cheating .         well  you always cheat .         i cheat for myself .  you can   t cheat for other people .      granny weatherwax slumped again .      i could have it stopped     said magrat .      you   d make an enemy for life .         i thought granny was my enemy for life .         if you think that  my girl  you   ve got no understanding     said nanny .     one day you   ll find out esme weatherwax is the best friend you ever had .         but we   ve got to do something .  can   t you think of anything .      nanny ogg looked thoughtfully at the circle .  occasionally a little wisp of smoke curled up from her pipe .      the magical duel was subsequently recorded in bird whistle   s book legendes and antiquities of the ramptops and went as follows      the duel beinge ninety minutes advanced  a small boy child upon a sudden ran across the square and stept within the magic circle  whereup he fell down with a terrible scream also a flash .  the olde witche looked around  got out of her chair  picked him up  and carried him to his grandmother  then went back to her seat  whilom the young witch never averted her eyes from the sunne .  but the other young witches stopped the duel averring  look  diamanda has wonne  the reason being  weatherwax looked away .  whereupon the child   s grandmother said in a loude voice  oh yes .  pulle the other onne  it have got bells on .  this is not a conteft about power  you stupid girls  it is a contest about witchcraft  do you not even begin to know what being a witch is .      is a witch someone who would look round when she heard a child scream .      and the townspeople said  yess .            that was wonderful     said mrs .  quarney  the storekeeper   s wife .     the whole town cheered .  a true miffic quality .      they were in the tavern   s back room .  granny weatherwax was lying on a bench with a damp towel over her face .      yes  it was  wasn   t it .     said magrat .      that girl was left without a leg to stand on  everyone says .         yes     said magrat .      strutted off with her nose in a sling  as they say .         yes     said magrat .      is the little boy all right .      they all looked at pewsey  who was sitting in a suspicious puddle on the floor in the corner with a bag of sweets and a sticky ring around his mouth .      right as rain     said nanny ogg .     nothing worse   n a bit of sunburn .  he screams his head off at the least little thing  bless him     she said proudly  as if this was some kind of rare talent .      gytha .     said granny  from under the towel .      yes .         you knows i don   t normally touch strong licker  but i   ve heard you mention the use of brandy for medicinal purposes .         coming right up .      granny raised her towel and focused one eye on magrat .      good afternoon  your pre majesty     she said .     come to be gracious at me  have you .         well done     said magrat  coldly .     can one have a word with you  na   mrs .  ogg .  outside .         right you are  your queen     said nanny .   in the alley outside magrat spun around with her mouth open .      you        nanny held up her hand .      i know what you   re going to say     she said .     but there wasn   t any danger to the little mite .         but you           me .     said nanny .     i hardly did anything .  they didn   t know he was going to run into the circle  did they .  they both reacted just like they normally would  didn   t they .  fair   s fair .         well  in a way  but           no one cheated     said nanny .   margrat sagged into silence .  nanny patted her on the shoulder .      so you won   t be telling anyone you saw me wave the bag of sweets at him  will you .     she said .      no  nanny .         there   s a good going to be queen .         nanny .         yes  dear .      magrat took a deep breath .      how did verence know when we were coming back .      it seemed to magrat that nanny thought for just a few seconds too long .      couldn   t say     she said at last .     kings are a bit magical  mind .  they can cure dandruff and that .  probably he woke up one morning and his royal prerogative gave him a tickle .      the trouble with nanny ogg was that she always looked as if she was lying .  nanny ogg had a pragmatic attitude to the truth  she told it if it was convenient and she couldn   t be bothered to make up something more interesting .      keeping busy up there  are you .     she said .      one   s doing very well  thank you     said magrat  with what she hoped was queenly hauteur .      which one .     said nanny .      which one what .         which one   s doing very well .         me .         you should have said     said nanny  her face poker straight .     so long as you   re keeping busy  that   s the important thing .         he knew we were coming back     said magrat firmly .     he   d even got the invitations sorted out .  oh  by the way   there   s one for you           i know  one got it this morning     said nanny .     got all that fancy nibbling on the edges and gold and everything .  who   s ruservup .      magrat had long ago got a handle on nanny ogg   s world view .      rsvp     she said .     it means you ought to say if you   re coming .         oh  one   ll be along all right  catch one staying away     said nanny .     has one   s jason sent one his invite yet .  thought not .  not a skilled man with a pen  our jason .         invitation to what .     said magrat .  she was getting fed up with ones .      didn   t verence tell one .     said nanny .     it   s a special play that   s been written special for you .         oh  yes     said magrat .     the entertainment .         right     said nanny .     it   s going to be on midsummer   s eve .            it   s got to be special  on midsummer   s eve     said jason ogg .   the door to the smithy had been bolted shut .  within were the eight members of the lancre morris men  six times winners of the fifteen mountains all comers morris championship   now getting to grips with a new art form .      i feel a right twit     said bestiality carter  lancre   s only baker .     a dress on .  i just hope my wife doesn   t see me .         says here     said jason ogg  his enormous forefinger hesitantly tracing its way along the page     that it   s a beaut i ful story of the love of the queen of the fairies   that   s you  bestiality              thank you very much              for a mortal man .  plus a hum our rus int ter lude with comic artisans           what   s an artisan .     said weaver the thatcher .      dunno .  type of well  i reckon .     jason scratched his head .     yeah .  they   ve got    em down on the plains .  i repaired a pump for one once .  artisan wells .         what   s comic about them .         maybe people fall down    em in a funny way .         why can   t we do a morris like normal .     said obidiah carpenter the tailor .       morris is for every day     said jason .     we got to do something cultural .  this come all the way from ankh morpork .         we could do the stick and bucket dance     volunteered baker the weaver .      no one is to do the stick and bucket dance ever again     said jason .     old mr .  thrum still walks with a limp  and it were three months ago .      weaver the thatcher squinted at his copy of the script .      who   s this bugger exeunt omnes .     he said .      i don   t think much of my part     said carpenter     it   s too small .         it   s his poor wife i feel sorry for     said weaver  automatically .      why .     said jason .         and why   s there got to be a lion in it .     said baker the weaver .         cos it   s a play .     said jason .     no one   d want to see it if it had a   a donkey in it .  oi can just see people comin    to see a play    cos it had a donkey in it .  this play was written by a real playsmith .  hah  i can just see a real playsmith putting donkeys in a play .  he says he   ll be very interested to hear how we get on .  now just you all shut up .         i don   t feel like the queen of the fairies     moaned bestiality carter .       you   ll grow into it     said weaver .      i hope not .         and you   ve got to rehearse     said jason .      there   s no room     said thatcher the carter .      well  i ain   t doin    it where anyone else can see     said bestiality .     even if we go out in the woods somewhere  people   ll be bound to see .  me in a dress .         they won   t recognize you in your makeup     said weaver .      makeup .         yeah  and your wig     said tailor the other weaver .      he   s right  though     said weaver .     if we   re going to make fools of ourselves  i don   t want no one to see me until we   re good at it .         somewhere off the beaten track  like     said thatcher the carter .      out in the country     said tinker the tinker .      where no one goes     said carter .   jason scratched his cheese grater chin .  he was bound to think of somewhere .      and who   s going to play exeunt omnes .     said weaver .     he doesn   t have much to say  does he .         the coach rattled across the featureless plains .  the land between ankh morpork and the ramtops was fertile  well cultivated and dull  dull  dull .  travel broadens the mind .  this landscape broadened the mind because the mind just flowed out from the ears like porridge .  it was the kind of landscape where  if you saw a distant figure cutting cabbages  you   d watch him until he was out of sight because there was simply nothing else for the eye to do .      i spy     said the bursar     with my little eye  something beginning with   h .         oook .         no .         horizon     said ponder .      you guessed .         of course i guessed .  i   m supposed to guess .  we   ve had s for sky  c for cabbage  o for   for ook  and there   s nothing else .         i   m not going to play anymore if you   re going to guess .     the bursar pulled his hat down over his ears and tried to curl up on the hard seat .      there   ll be lots to see in lancre     said the archchancellor .     the only piece of flat land they   ve got up there is in a museum .      ponder said nothing .      used to spend whole summers up there     said ridcully .  he sighed .     you know   things could have been very different .      ridcully looked around .  if you   re going to relate an intimate piece of personal history  you want to be sure it   s going to be heard .   the librarian looked out at the jolting scenery .  he was sulking .  this had a lot to do with the new bright blue collar around his neck with the word    pongo    on it .  someone was going to suffer for this .   the bursar was trying to use his hat like a limpet uses its shell .      there was this girl .      ponder stibbons  chosen by a cruel fate to be the only one listening  looked surprised .  he was aware that  technically  even the archchancellor had been young once .  after all  it was just a matter of time .  common sense suggested that wizards didn   t flash into existence aged seventy and weighing nineteen stone .  but common sense needed reminding .   he felt he ought to say something .      pretty  was she  sir .     he said .      no .  no  i can   t say she was .  striking .  that   s the word .  tall .  hair so blond it was nearly white .  and eyes like gimlets  i tell you .      ponder tried to work this out .      you don   t mean that dwarf who runs the delicatessen in       he began .      i mean you always got the impression she could see right through you     said ridcully  slightly more sharply than he had intended .     and she could run        he lapsed into silence again  staring at the newsreels of memory .      i would   ve married her  you know     he said .   ponder said nothing .  when you   re a cork in someone else   s stream of consciousness  all you can do is spin and bob in the eddies .      what a summer     murmured ridcully .     very like this one  really .  crop circles were bursting like raindrops .  and   well  i was having doubts  you know .  magic didn   t seem to be enough .  i was a bit   lost .  i   d have given it all up for her .  every blasted octogram and magic spell .  without a second thought .  you know when they say things like    she had a laugh like a mountain stream    .         i   m not personally familiar with it     said ponder     but i have read poetry that           load of cobblers  poetry     said ridcully .     i   ve listened to mountain streams and they just go trickle  trickle  gurgle .  and you get them things in them  you know  insect things with little   anyway .  doesn   t sound like laughter at all  is my point .  poets always get it wrong .     s   like    she had lips like cherries .     small  round  and got a stone in the middle .  hah .      he shut his eyes .  after a while ponder said     so what happened  sir .         what .         the girl you were telling me about .         what girl .         this girl .         oh  that girl .  oh  she turned me down .  said there were things she wanted to do .  said there   d be time enough .      there was another pause .      what happened then .     ponder prompted .      happened .  what d   you think happened .  i went off and studied .  term started .  wrote her a lot of letters but she never answered    em .  probably never got    em  they probably eat the mail up there .  next year i was studying all summer and never had time to go back .  never did go back .  exams and so on .  expect she   s dead now  or some fat old granny with a dozen kids .  would   ve wed her like a shot .  like a shot .     ridcully scratched his head .     hah   just wish i could remember her name        he stretched out with his feet on the bursar .         s   funny  that     he said .     can   t even remember her name .  hah .  she could outrun a horse           kneel and deliver .      the coach rattled to a halt .   ridcully opened an eye .      what   s that .     he said .   ponder jerked awake from a reverie of lips like mountain streams and looked out of the window .      i think     he said     it   s a very small highwayman .         the coachman peered down at the figure in the road .  it was hard to see much from this angle  because of the short body and the wide hat .  it was like looking at a well dressed mushroom with a feather in it .      i do apologize for this     said the very small highwayman .     i find myself a little short .      the coachman sighed and put down the reins .  properly arranged holdups by the bandits    guild were one thing  but he was blowed if he was going to be threatened by an outlaw that came up to his waist and didn   t even have a crossbow .      you little bastard     he said .     i   m going to knock your block off .      he peered closer .      what   s that on your back .  a hump .         ah  you   ve noticed the stepladder     said the low highwayman .     let me demonstrate           what   s happening .     said ridcully  back in the coach .      um  a dwarf has just climbed up a small stepladder and kicked the coachman in the middle of the road     said ponder .      that   s something you don   t see every day     said ridcully .  he looked happy .  up to now  the journey had been quite uneventful .      now he   s coming toward us .         oh  good .      the highwayman stepped over the groaning body of the driver and marched toward the door of the coach  dragging his stepladder behind him .   he opened the door .      your money or  i   m sorry to say  your        a blast of octarine fire blew his hat off .   the dwarf   s expression did not change .      i wonder if i might be allowed to rephrase my demands .      ridcully looked the elegantly dressed stranger up and down or  rather  down and further down .      you don   t look like a dwarf     he said     apart from the height  that is .         don   t look like a dwarf apart from the height .         i mean  the helmet and iron boots department is among those you are lacking in     said ridcully .   the dwarf bowed and produced a slip of pasteboard from one grubby but lace clad sleeve .      my card     he said .   it read       ponder peered over ridcully   s shoulder .      are you really an outrageous liar .         no .         why are you trying to rob coaches  then .         i am afraid i was waylaid by bandits .         but it says here     said ridcully     that you are a finest swordsman .         i was outnumbered .         how many of them were there .         three million .         hop in     said ridcully .   casanunda threw his stepladder into the coach and then peered into the gloom .      is that an ape asleep in there .         yes .      the librarian opened one eye .      what about the smell .         he won   t mind .         hadn   t you better apologize to the coachman .     said ponder .      no  but i could kick him again harder if he likes .         and that   s the bursar     said ridcully  pointing to exhibit b  who was sleeping the sleep of the near terminally overdosed on dried frog pills .     hey  bursar .  bursssaaar .  no  he   s out like a light .  just push him under the seat .  can you play cripple mr .  onion .         not very well .         capital .      half an hour later ridcully owed the dwarf        .      but i put it on my visiting card     casanunda pointed out .     outrageous liar .  right there .         yes  but i thought you were lying .      ridcully sighed and  to ponder   s amazement  produced a bag of coins from some inner recess .  they were large coins and looked suspiciously realistic and golden .   casanunda might have been a libidinous soldier of fortune by profession but he was a dwarf by genetics  and there are some things dwarfs know .      hmm     he said .     you don   t have    outrageous liar    on your visiting card  by any chance .         no .     said ridcully excitedly .      it   s just that i can recognize chocolate money when i see it .         you know     said ponder  as the coach jolted along a canyon     this reminds me of that famous logical puzzle .         what logical puzzle .     said the archchancellor .      well     said ponder  gratified at the attention     it appears that there was this man  right  who had to choose between going through two doors  apparently  and the guard on one door always told the truth and the guard on the other door always told a lie  and the thing was  behind one door was certain death  and behind the other door was freedom  and he didn   t know which guard was which  and he could only ask them one question and so  what did he ask .      the coach bounced over a pothole .  the librarian turned over in his sleep .      sounds like psychotic lord hargon of quirm to me     said ridcully  after a while .      that   s right     said casanunda .     he was a devil for jokes like that .  how many students can you get in an iron maiden  that kind of thing .         so this was at his place  then  was it .     said ridcully .      what .  i don   t know     said ponder .      why not .  you seem to know all about it .         i don   t think it was anywhere .  it   s a puzzle .         hang on     said casanunda     i think i   ve worked it out .  one question  right .         yes     said ponder  relieved .      and he can ask either guard .         yes .         oh  right .  well  in that case he goes up to the smallest guard and says     tell me which is the door to freedom if you don   t want to see the color of your kidneys and incidentally i   m walking through it behind you  so if you   re trying for the mr .  clever award just remember who   s going through it first .            no  no  no .         sounds logical to me     said ridcully .     very good thinking .         but you haven   t got a weapon .         yes i have .  i wrested it from the guard while he was considering the question     said casanunda .      clever     said ridcully .     now that  mr .  stibbons  is logical thought .  you could learn a lot from this man              dwarf              sorry  dwarf .  he doesn   t go on about parasite universes all the time .         parallel .     snapped ponder  who had developed a very strong suspicion that ridcully was getting it wrong on purpose .      which ones are the parasite ones  then .         there aren   t any .  i mean  there aren   t any  archchancellor .   parallel universes  i said .  universes where things didn   t happen like       he hesitated .     well  you know that girl .         what girl .         the girl you wanted to marry .         how   d you know that .         you were talking about her just after lunch .         was i .  more fool me .  well  what about her .         well   in a way  you did marry her     said ponder .   ridcully shook his head .     nope .  pretty certain i didn   t .  you remember that sort of thing .         ah  but not in this universe        the librarian opened one eye .      you suggestin    i nipped into some other universe to get married .     said ridcully .      no .  i mean  you got married in that universe and not in this universe     said ponder .      did i .  what .  a proper ceremony and everything .         yes .         hmm .     ridcully stroked his beard .     you sure .         certain  archchancellor .         my word .  i never knew that .      ponder felt he was getting somewhere .      so           yes .         why don   t i remember it .      ponder had been ready for this .      because the you in the other universe is different from the you here     he said .     it was a different you that got married .  he   s probably settled down somewhere .  he   s probably a great grandad by now .         he never writes  i know that     said ridcully .     and the bastard never invited me to the wedding .         who .         him .         but he   s you .         is he .  huh .  you   d think i   d think of me  wouldn   t you .  what a bastard .      it wasn   t that ridcully was stupid .  truly stupid wizards have the life expectancy of a glass hammer .  he had quite a powerful intellect  but it was powerful like a locomotive  and ran on rails and was therefore almost impossible to steer .   there are indeed such things as parallel universes  although parallel is hardly the right word   universes swoop and spiral around one another like some mad weaving machine or a squadron of yossarians with middle ear trouble .   and they branch .  but  and this is important  not all the time .  the universe doesn   t much care if you tread on a butterfly .  there are plenty more butterflies .  gods might note the fall of a sparrow but they don   t make any effort to catch them .   shoot the dictator and prevent the war .  but the dictator is merely the tip of the whole festering boil of social pus from which dictators emerge  shoot one  and there   ll be another one along in a minute .  shoot him too .  why not shoot everyone and invade poland .  in fifty years     thirty years     ten years    time the world will be very nearly back on its old course .  history always has a great weight of inertia .   almost always     at circle time  when the walls between this and that are thinner  when there are all sorts of strange leakages   ah  then choices are made  then the universe can be sent careening down a different leg of the well known trousers of time .   but there are also stagnant pools  universes cut off from past and future .  they have to steal pasts and futures from other universes  their only hope is to batten on to the dynamic universes as they pass through the fragile period  as remora fish hang on to a passing shark .  these are the parasite universes and  when the crop circles burst like raindrops  they have their chance        lancre castle was far bigger than it needed to be .  it wasn   t as if lancre could have been bigger at one time  inhospitable mountains crowded it on three sides  and a more or less sheer drop occupied where the fourth side would have been if a sheer drop hadn   t been there .  as far as anyone knew  the mountains didn   t belong to anyone .  they were just mountains .   the castle rambled everywhere .  no one even knew how far the cellars went .   these days everyone lived in the turrets and halls near the gate .      i mean  look at the crenellations     said magrat .      what  m   m .         the cut out bits on top of the walls .  you could hold off an army here .         that   s what a castle   s for  isn   t it  m   m .      magrat sighed .     can we stop the    m   m     please .  it makes you sound uncertain .         mm  m   m .         i mean  who is there to fight up here .  not even trolls could come over the mountains  and anyone coming up the road is asking for a rock on the head .  besides  you only have to cut down lancre bridge .         dunno  m   m .  kings   ve got to have castles  i s   pose .         don   t you ever wonder about anything  you stupid girl .         what good does that do  m   m .      i called her a stupid girl  thought magrat .  royalty is rubbing off on me .      oh  well     she said     where   ve we got to .         we   re going to need two thousand yards of the blue chintz material with the little white flowers     said millie .      and we haven   t even measured half the windows yet     said magrat  rolling up the tape measure .   she looked down the length of the long gallery .  the thing about it  the thing that made it so noticeable  the first thing anyone noticed about it  was that it was very long .  it shared certain distinctive traits with the great hall and the deep dungeons .  its name was a perfectly accurate description .  and it would be  as nanny ogg would say  a bugger to carpet .      why .  why a castle in lancre .     she said  mainly to herself  because talking to millie was like talking to yourself .     we   ve never fought anyone .  apart from outside the tavern on a saturday night .         couldn   t say  i   m sure  m   m     said millie .   magrat sighed .      where   s the king today .         he   s opening parliament  m   m .         hah .  parliament .      which had been another of verence   s ideas .  he   d tried to introduce ephebian democracy to lancre  giving the vote to everyone  or at least everyone    who be of good report and who be male and hath forty years and owneth a hosue  worth more than three and a half goats a year     because there   s no sense in being stupid about things and giving the vote to people who were poor or criminal or insane or female  who   d only use it irresponsibly .  it worked  more or less  although the members of parliament only turned up when they felt like it and in any case no one ever wrote anything down and  besides  no one ever disagreed with whatever verence said because he was king .  what   s the point of having a king  they thought  if you have to rule yourself .  he should do his job  even if he couldn   t spell properly .  no one was asking him to thatch roofs or milk cows  were they .      i   m bored  millie .  bored  bored  bored .  i   m going for a walk in the gardens .         shall i fetch shawn with the trumpet .         not if you want to live .      not all the gardens had been dug up for agricultural experiments .  there was  for example  the herb garden .  to magrat   s expert eye it was a pretty poor herb garden  since it just contained plants that flavored food .  and at that mrs .  scorbic   s repertoire stopped short at mint and sage .  there wasn   t a sprig of vervain or yarrow or old man   s trousers anywhere in it .   and there was the famous maze or  at least  it would be a famous maze .  verence had planted it because he   d heard that stately castles should have a maze and everyone agreed that  once the bushes were a bit higher than their current height of about one foot  it would indeed be a very famous maze and people would be able to get lost in it without having to shut their eyes and bend down .   magrat drifted disconsolately along the gravel path  her huge wide dress leaving a smooth trail .   there was a scream from the other side of the hedge  but magrat recognized the voice .  there were certain traditions in lancre castle which she had learned .      good morning  hodgesaargh     she said .   the castle falconer appeared around the corner  dab bing at his face with a handkerchief .  on his other arm  claws gripping like a torture instrument  was a bird .  evil red eyes glared at magrat over a razor sharp beak .      i   ve got a new hawk     said hodgesaargh proudly .     it   s a lancre crowhawk .  they   ve never been tamed before .  i   m taming it .  i   ve already stopped it pecking myooooow        he flailed the hawk madly against the wall until it let go of his nose .   strictly speaking  hodgesaargh wasn   t his real name .  on the other hand  on the basis that someone   s real name is the name they introduce themselves to you by  he was definitely hodgesaargh .   this was because the hawks and falcons in the castle mews were all lancre birds and therefore naturally possessed of a certain    sod you    independence of mind .  after much patient breeding and training hodgesaargh had managed to get them to let go of someone   s wrist  and now he was working on stopping them viciously attacking the person who had just been holding them  i . e .   invariably hodgesaargh .  he was nevertheless a remarkably optimistic and good natured man who lived for the day when his hawks would be the finest in the world .  the hawks lived for the day when they could eat his other ear .      i can see you   re doing very well     said magrat .     you don   t think  do you  that they might respond better to cruelty .         oh  no  miss     said hodgesaargh     you have to be kind .  you have to build up a bond  you see .  if they don   t trust you theyaaaagh           i   ll just leave you to get on with it then  shall i .     said magrat  as feathers filled the air .   magrat had been gloomily unsurprised to learn that there was a precise class and gender distinction in falconry   verence  being king  was allowed a gyrfalcon  whatever the hell that was  any earls in the vicinity could fly a peregrine  and priests were allowed sparrowhawks .  commoners were just about allowed a stick to throw .   magrat found herself wondering what nanny ogg would be allowed   a small chicken on a spring  probably .   there was no specific falcon for a witch but  as a queen  the lancre rules of falconry allowed her to fly the wowhawk or lappet faced worrier .  it was small and shortsighted and preferred to walk everywhere .  it fainted at the sight of blood .  and about twenty wowhawks could kill a pigeon  if it was a sick pigeon .  she   d spent an hour with one on her wrist .  it had wheezed at her  and eventually it had dozed off upside down .   but at least hodgesaargh had a job to do .  the castle was full of people doing jobs .  everyone had something useful to do except magrat .  she just had to exist .  of course  everyone would talk to her  provided she talked to them first .  but she was always interrupting something important .  apart from ensuring the royal succession  which verence had sent off for a book about  she        you just keep back there  girl .  you don   t want to come no further     said a voice .   magrat bridled .      girl .  one happens to be very nearly of the royal blood by marriage .         maybe  but the bees don   t know that     said the voice .   magrat stopped .   she   d stepped out beyond what were the gardens from the point of view of the royal family and into what were the gardens from the point of view of everyone else   beyond the world of hedges and topiary and herb gardens and into the world of old sheds  piles of flowerpots  compost and  just here  beehives .   one of the hives had the lid off .  beside it  in the middle of a brown cloud  smoking his special bee pipe  was mr .  brooks .      oh     she said     it   s you  mr .  brooks .      technically  mr .  brooks was the royal beekeeper .  but the relationship was a careful one .  for one thing  although most of the staff were called by their last names mr .  brooks shared with the cook and the butler the privilege of an honorific .  because mr .  brooks had secret powers .  he knew all about honey flows and the mating of queens .  he knew about swarms  and how to destroy wasps    nests .  he got the general respect shown to those  like witches and blacksmiths  whose responsibilities are not entirely to the world of the humdrum and everyday   people who  in fact  know things that others don   t about things that others can   t fathom .  and he was generally found doing something fiddly with the hives  ambling across the kingdom in pursuit of a swarm  or smoking his pipe in his secret shed which smelled of old honey and wasp poison .  you didn   t offend mr .  brooks  not unless you wanted swarms in your privy while he sat cackling in his shed .   he carefully replaced the lid on the hive and walked away .  a few bees escaped from the gaping holes in his beekeeping veil .      afternoon  your ladyship     he conceded .      hello  mr .  brooks .  what   ve you been doing .      mr .  brooks opened the door of his secret shed  and rummaged about inside .      they   re late swarming     said the beekeeper .     i was just checking up on    em .  fancy a cup of tea  girl .      you couldn   t stand on ceremony with mr .  brooks .  he treated everyone as an equal  or more often as a slight inferior  it probably came of ruling thousands  every day .  and at least she could talk to him .  mr .  brooks had always seemed to her as close to a witch as it was possible to be while still being male .   the shed was stuffed full of bits of hive  mysterious torture instruments for extracting honey  old jars  and a small stove on which a grubby teapot steamed next to a huge saucepan .   he took her silence for acceptance  and poured out two mugs .      is it herbal .     she quavered .      buggered if i know .  it   s just brown leaves out of a tin .      magrat looked uncertainly into a mug which pure tannin was staining brown .  but she rallied .  one thing you had to do when you were queen  she knew  was put commoners at their ease .  she cast around for some easeful question .      it must be very interesting  being a beekeeper     she said .      yes .  it is .         one   s often wondered           what .         how do you actually milk them .          the unicorn prowled through the forest .  it felt blind  and out of place .  this wasn   t a proper land .  the sky was blue  not flaming with all the colors of the aurora .  and time was passing .  to a creature not born subject to time  it was a sensation not unakin to falling .   it could feel its mistress inside its head  too .  that was worse even than the passing of time .   in short  it was mad .      magrat sat with her mouth open .      i thought queens were born     she said .      oh  no     said mr .  brooks .     there ain   t no such thing as a queen egg .  the bees just decides to feed one of    em up as a queen .  feeds    em royal jelly .         what happens if they don   t .         then it just becomes an ordinary worker  your ladyship     said mr .  brooks  with a suspiciously republican grin .   lucky for it  magrat thought .      so they have a new queen  and then what happens to the old one .         usually the old girl swarms     said mr .  brooks .     pushes off and takes some of the colony with her .  i must   ve seen a thousand swarms  me .  never seen a royal swarm  though .         what   s a royal swarm .         can   t say for sure .  it   s in some of the old bee books .  a swarm of swarms .  it   s something to see  they say .     the old beekeeper looked wistful for a moment .         course     he went on  righting himself     the real fun starts if the weather   s bad and the ole queen can   t swarm  right .     he moved his hand in a sly circular motion .     what happens then is  the two queens   that   s the old queen  right .  and the new queen   the two queens start astalkin    one another among the combs  with the rain adrummin    on the roof of the hive  and the business of the hive agoin    on all around them     mr .  brooks moved his hands graphically  and magrat leaned forward     all among the combs  the drones all hummin     and all the time they can sense one another     cos they can tell  see  and then they spots one another and           yes .  yes .     said magrat  leaning forward .      slash .  stab .      magrat hit her head on the wall of the hut .      can   t have more   n one queen in a hive     said mr .  brooks calmly .   magrat looked out at the hives .  she   d always liked the look of beehives  up until now .      many   s the time i   ve found a dead queen in front of the hive after a spell of wet weather     said mr .  brooks  happily .     can   t abide another queen around the place  you know .  and it   s a right old battle  too .  the old queen   s more cunnin    .  but the new queen  she   s really got everything to fight for .         sorry .         if she wants to be mated .         oh .         but it gets really interestin    in the autumn     said mr .  brooks .     hive don   t need any dead weight in the winter  see  and there   s all these drones hangin    around not doing anything  so the workers drag all the drones down to the hive entrance  see  and they bite their           stop .  this is horrible .     said magrat .     i thought beekeeping was  well  nice .         of course  that   s around the time of year when the bees wear out     said mr .  brooks .     what happens is  see  your basic bee  why  it works    til it can   t work no more  and you   ll see a lot of old workers acrawlin    around in front of the hive    cos           stop it .  honestly  this is too much .  i   m queen  you know .  almost .         sorry  miss     said mr .  brooks .     i thought you wanted to know a bit about beekeeping .         yes  but not this .      magrat swept out .      oh  i dunno     said mr .  brooks .     does you good to get close to nature .      he shook his head cheerfully as she disappeared among the hedges .      can   t have more than one queen in a hive     he said .     slash .  stab .  hehheh .      from somewhere in the distance came the scream of hodgesaargh as nature got close to him .      crop circles opened everywhere .   now the universes swung into line .  they ceased their boiling spaghetti dance and  to pass through this chicane of history  charged forward neck and neck in their race across the rubber sheet of incontinent time .   at such time  as ponder stibbons dimly perceived  they had an effect on one another   shafts of reality crackled back and forward as the universes jostled for position .   if you were someone who had trained their mind to be the finest of receivers  and were running it at the moment with the gain turned up until the knob broke  you might pick up some very strange signals indeed        the clock ticked .   granny weatherwax sat in front of the open box  reading .  occasionally she stopped and closed her eyes and pinched her nose .   not knowing the future was bad enough  but at least she understood why .  now she was getting flashes of d  j   vu .  it had been going on all week .  but they weren   t her d  j   vus .  she was getting them for the first time  as it were   flashes of memory that couldn   t have existed .  couldn   t have existed .  she was esme weatherwax  sane as a brick  always had been  she   d never been     there was a knock at the door .   she blinked  glad to be free of those thoughts .  it took her a second or two to focus on the present .  then she folded up the paper  slipped it into its envelope  pushed the envelope back into its bundle  put the bundle into the box  locked the box with a small key which she hung over the fireplace  and walked to the door .  she did a last minute check to make sure she hadn   t absentmindedly taken all her clothes off  or something  and opened it .      evenin        said nanny ogg  holding out a bowl with a cloth over it     i   ve brung you some        granny weatherwax was looking past her .      who   re these people .     she said .   the three girls looked embarrassed .      see  they came round my house and said       nanny ogg began .      don   t tell me .  let me guess     said granny .  she strode out  and inspected the trio .      well  well  well     she said .     my word .  my word .  three girls who want to be witches  am i right .     her voice went falsetto .        oh  please  mrs .  ogg  we has seen the error of our ways  we want to learn proper witchcraft .     yes .         yes .  something like that     said nanny .     but           this is witchcraft     said granny weatherwax .     it   s not   it   s not a game of conkers .  oh  deary  deary me .      she walked along the very short row of trembling girls .      what   s your name  girl .         magenta frottidge  ma   am .         i bet that   s not what your mum calls you .      magenta looked at her feet .      she calls me violet  ma   am .         well  it   s a better color than magenta     said granny .     want to be a bit mysterious  eh .  want to make folks feel you got a grip on the occult .  can you do magic .  your friend taught you anything  did she .  knock my hat off .         what  ma   am .      granny weatherwax stood back  and turned around .      knock it off .  i ain   t trying to stop you .  go on .      magenta shading to violet shaded to pink .      er   in ever got the hang of the psycho thingy           oh  dear .  well  just let   s see what the rest can do   who   re you  girl .         amanita  ma   am .         such a pretty name .  let   s see what you can do .      amanita looked around nervously .      i  er  don   t think i can while you   re watching me       she began .      that   s a shame .  what about you  on the end .         agnes nitt     said agnes  who was much faster on the uptake than the other two and saw that there was no point in pushing perdita .      go on  then .  try .      agnes concentrated .      oh  deary  deary me     said granny .     and my hat   s still on .  show them  gytha .      nanny ogg sighed  picked up a piece of fallen branch  and hurled it at granny   s hat .  granny caught the stick in mid air .      but  but   you said we had to use magic       amanita began .      no  i didn   t     said granny .      but anyone could have done that     said magenta .      yes  but that   s not the point     said granny .     the point is that you didn   t .     she smiled  which was unusual for her .     look  i don   t want to be nasty to you .  you   re young .  the world   s full of things you could be doing .  you don   t want to be witches .  not if you knew what it means .  now just go away .  go home .  don   t try the paranormal until you know what   s normal .  go on .  run along .         but that   s just trickery .  that   s what diamanda said .  you just use words and trickery       magenta protested .   granny raised a hand .   in the trees  the birds stopped singing .      gytha .      nanny ogg gripped her own hat brim defensively .      esme  listen  this hat cost me two whole dollars        the boom echoed through the woods .   bits of hat lining zigzagged gently out of the sky .   granny pointed her finger at the girls  who tried to lean out of the way .      now     she said     why don   t you go and see to your friend .  she was beat .  she probably ain   t very happy .  that   s no time to go leaving people .      they still stared at her .  her finger seemed to fascinate them .      i just asked you to go home .  perfectly reasonable voice .  do you want me to shout .      they turned and ran .   nanny ogg glumly pushed her hand through the stricken hat brim .      it took me ages to get that pig cure together     she mumbled .     you need eight types of leaves .  willow leaves  tansy leaves  old man   s trousers leaves   i was collecting    em all day .  it   s not as though leaves grow on trees        granny weatherwax watched the disappearing girls .   nanny ogg paused .  then she said     takes you back  eh .  i remember when i was fifteen  standing in front of old biddy spective  and she said in that voice of hers     you want to be a what .     and i was that frightened i near widd           i never stood in front of no one     said granny weatherwax distantly .     i camped on old nanny gripes    garden until she promised to tell me everything she knew .  hah .  that took her a week and i had the afternoons free .         you mean you weren   t chosen .         me .  no .  i chose     said granny .  the face she turned to nanny ogg was one she wouldn   t forget in a hurry  although she might try .     i chose  gytha ogg .  and i want that you should know this right now .  whatever happens .  i ain   t never regretted anything .  never regretted one single thing .  right .         if you say so  esme .         what is magic .   there is the wizards    explanation  which comes in two forms  depending on the age of the wizard .  older wizards talk about candles  circles  planets  stars  bananas  chants  runes  and the importance of having at least four good meals every day .  younger wizards  particularly the pale ones who spend most of their time in the high energy magic building   chatter at length about fluxes in the morphic nature of the universe  the essentially impermanent quality of even the most apparently rigid time space framework  the implausibility of reality  and so on  what this means is that they have got hold of something hot and are gabbling the physics as they go along        it was almost midnight .  diamanda ran up the hill toward the dancers  the briars and heather tearing at her dress .   the humiliation banged back and forth in her skull .  stupid malicious old women .  and stupid people  too .  she   d won .  according to the rules  she   d won .  but everyone had laughed at her .   that stung .  the recollection of those stupid faces  all grinning .  and everyone supporting those horrible old women  who had no idea about the meaning of witchcraft and what it could become .   she   d show them .   ahead of her  the dancers were dark against the moonlit clouds .      nanny ogg looked under her bed in case there was a man there .  well  you never knew your luck .   she was going to have an early night .  it had been a busy day .   there was a jar of boiled sweets by her bed  and a thick glass bottle of the clear fluid from her complicated still out behind the woodshed .  it wasn   t exactly whiskey  and it wasn   t exactly gin  but it was exactly      proof  and a great comfort during those worrying moments that sometimes occurred around   a . m .  when you woke up and forgot who you were .  after a glass of the clear liquid you still didn   t remember who you were  but that was all right now because you were someone else anyway .   she plumped up the four pillows  kicked her fluffy slippers into the corner  and pulled the blankets over her head  creating a small  warm  and slightly rank cave .  she sucked a boiled sweet  nanny had only one tooth left  and that had taken all she could throw at it for many years  so a sweet at bedtime wasn   t going to worry it much .   after a few seconds a sense of pressure on her feet indicated that the cat greebo had taken up his accustomed place on the end of the bed .  greebo always slept on nanny   s bed  the way he   d affectionately try to claw your eyeballs out in the morning was as good as an alarm clock .  but she always left a window open all night in case he wanted to go out and disembowel something  bless him .   well  well .  elves .   they couldn   t hear you say the word inside your head  anyway .  at least  not unless they were real close .   she really thought they   d seen the last of them .  how long was it  now .  must be hundreds and hundreds of years  maybe thousands .  witches didn   t like to talk about it  because they   d made a big mistake about the elves .  they   d seen through the buggers in the end  of course  but it had been a close thing .  and there   d been a lot of witches in those days .  they   d been able to stop them at every turn  make life in this world too hot for them .  fought them with iron .  nothing elvish could stand iron .  it blinded them  or something .  blinded them all over .   there weren   t many witches now .  not proper witches .  more of a problem  though  was that people didn   t seem to be able to remember what it was like with the elves around .  life was certainly more interesting then  but usually because it was shorter .  and it was more colorful  if you liked the color of blood .  it got so people didn   t even dare talk openly about the bastards .   you said  the shining ones .  you said  the fair folk .  and you spat  and touched iron .  but generations later  you forgot about the spitting and the iron  and you forgot why you used those names for them  and you remembered only that they were beautiful .   yes  there   d been a lot of witches in them days .  too many women found an empty cradle  or a husband that never came home from the hunt .  had been the hunt .   elves .  the bastards   and yet   and yet   somehow  yes  they did things to memory .   nanny ogg turned over in bed .  greebo growled in protest .   take dwarfs and trolls  for e . g .  people said  oh  you can   t trust    em  trolls are ok if you   ve got    em in front of you  and some of    em are decent enough in their way  but they   re cowardly and stupid  and as for dwarfs  well  they   re greedy and devious devils  all right  fair enough  sometimes you meet one of the clever little sods that   s not too bad  but overall they   re no better   n trolls  in fact        they   re just like us .   but they ain   t any prettier to look at and they   ve got no style .  and we   re stupid  and the memory plays tricks  and we remember the elves for their beauty and the way they move  and forget what they were .  we   re like mice saying     say what you like  cats have got real style .      people never quaked in their beds for fear of dwarfs .  they never hid under the stairs from trolls .  they might have chased    em out of the henhouse  but trolls and dwarfs were never any more than a bloody nuisance .  they were never a terror in the night .   we only remembers that the elves sang .  we forgets what it was they were singing about .   nanny ogg turned over again .  there was a slithering noise from the end of the bed  and a muffled yowl as greebo hit the floor .   and nanny sat up .      get your walking paws on  young fella me lad .  we   re going out .      as she passed through the midnight kitchen she paused  took one of the big black flatirons from the hob by the fire  and attached it to a length of clothesline .   for all her life she   d walked at night through lancre with no thought of carrying a weapon of any sort .  of course  for most of that time she   d recognizably been a witch  and any importunate prowler would   ve ended up taking his essentials away in a paper bag  but even so it was generally true of any woman in lancre .  man too  come to that .   now she could sense her own fear .   the elves were coming back all right  casting their shadows before them .      diamanda reached the crest of the hill .   she paused .  she wouldn   t put it past that old weatherwax woman to have followed her .  she felt sure there had been something tracking her in the woods .   there was no one else around .   she turned .      evenin     miss .         you .  you did follow me .      granny got to her feet from the shadow of the piper  where she had been sitting quite invisibly in the blackness .      learned that from my dad     she said .     when he went hunting .  he always used to say a bad hunter chases  a good hunter waits .         oh .  so you   re hunting me now .         no .  i was just waiting .  i knew you   d come up here .  you haven   t got anywhere else to go .  you   ve come to call her  haven   t you .  let me see your hands .      it wasn   t a request  it was a command .  diamanda found her hands moving of their own accord .  before she could pull them back the old woman had grabbed them and held them firmly  her skin felt like sacking .      never done a hard day   s work in your life  have you .     said granny  pleasantly .     never picked cabbages with the ice on    em  or dug a grave  or milked a cow  or laid out a corpse .         you don   t have to do all that to be a witch .     diamanda snapped .      did i say so .  and let me tell you something .  about beautiful women in red with stars in their hair .  and probably moons  too .  and voices in your head when you slept .  and power when you came up here .  she offered you lots of power  i expect .  all you wanted .  for free .      diamanda was silent .      because it happened before .  there   s always someone who   ll listen .     granny weatherwax   s eyes seemed to lose their focus .      when you   re lonely  and people around you seem too stupid for words  and the world is full of secrets that no one   ll tell you           are you reading my mind .         yours .     granny   s attention snapped back  and her voice lost its distant quality .     hah .  flowers and suchlike .  dancing about without yer drawers on .  mucking about with cards and bits of string .  and it worked  i expect .  she gave you power  for a while .  oh  she must have laughed .  and then there is less power and more price .  and then no power  and you   re payin    every day .  they always take more than they give .  and what they give has less than no value .  and they end up taking everything .  what they like to get from us is our fear .  what they want from us most of all is our belief .  if you call them  they will come .  you   ll give them a channel if you call them here  at circle time  where the world   s thin enough to hear .  the power in the dancers is weak enough now as it is .  and i   m not having the   the lords and ladies back .      diamanda opened her mouth .      i ain   t finished yet .  you   re a bright girl .  lots of things you could be doing .  but you don   t want to be a witch .  it   s not an easy life .         you mad old woman  you   ve got it all wrong .  elves aren   t like that           don   t say the word .  don   t say the word .  they come when called .         good .  elf  elf  elf .  elf        granny slapped her face  hard .      even you knows that   s stupid and childish     she said .     now you listen to me .  if you stay here  there   s to be none of this stuff anymore .  or you can go somewhere else and find a future  be a great lady  you   ve got the mind for it .  and maybe you   ll come back in ten years loaded down with jewels and stuff  and lord it over all us stay at homes  and that will be fine .  but if you stay here and keep trying to call the   lords and ladies  then you   ll be up against me again .  not playing stupid games in the daylight  but real witchcraft .  not messing around with moons and circles  but the true stuff  out of the blood and the bone and out of the head .  and you don   t know nothin    about that .  right .  and it don   t allow for mercy .      diamanda looked up .  her face was red where the slap had landed .      go .     she said .   granny reacted a second too late .   diamanda darted between the stones .      you stupid child .  not that way .      the figure was already getting smaller  even though it appeared to be only a few feet away .      oh  drat .      granny dived after her  and heard her skirt rip as the pocket tore .  the poker she   d brought along whirred away and clanked against one of the dancers .   there was a series of jerks and tings as the hobnails tore out of her boots and sped toward the stones .   no iron could go through the stones  no iron at all .   granny was already racing over the turf when she realized what that meant .  but it didn   t matter .  she   d made a choice .   there was a feeling of dislocation  as directions danced and twirled around .  and then snow underfoot .  it was white .  it had to be white  because it was snow .  but patterns of color moved across it  reflecting the wild dance of the permanent aurora in the sky .   diamanda was struggling .  her footwear was barely suitable for a city summer  and certainly not for a foot of snow .  whereas granny weatherwax   s boots  even without their hobnails  could have survived a trot across lava .   even so  the muscles that were propelling them had been doing it for too long .  diamanda was outrunning her .   more snow was falling  out of a night sky .  there was a ring of riders waiting a little way from the stones  with the queen slightly ahead .  every witch knew her  or the shape of her .   diamanda tripped and fell  and then managed to bring herself up to a kneeling position .   granny stopped .   the queen   s horse whinnied .      kneel before your queen  you     said the elf .  she was wearing red  with a copper crown in her hair .      shan   t .  won   t     said granny weatherwax .      you are in my kingdom  woman     said the queen .     you do not come or go without the leave of me .  you will kneel .         i come and go without the leave of anyone     said granny weatherwax .     never done it before  ain   t starting now .      she put a hand on diamanda   s shoulder .      these are your elves     she said .     beautiful  ain   t they .      the warriors must have been more than two meters tall .  they did not wear clothes so much as items strung together   scraps of fur  bronze plates  strings of brightly colored feathers .  blue and green tattoos covered most of their exposed skin .  several of them held drawn bows  the tips of their arrows following granny   s every move .   their hair massed around their heads like a halo  thick with grease .  and although their faces were indeed the most beautiful diamanda had ever seen  it was beginning to creep over her that there was something subtly wrong  some quirk of expression that did not quite fit .      the only reason we   re still alive now is that we   re more fun alive than dead     said granny   s voice behind her .      you know you shouldn   t listen to the crabbed old woman     said the queen .     what can she offer .         more than snow in summertime     said granny .     look at their eyes .  look at their eyes .      the queen dismounted .      take my hand  child     she said .   diamanda stuck out a hand gingerly .   there was something about the eyes .  it wasn   t the shape or the color .  there was no evil glint .  but there was        a look .  it was such a look that a microbe might encounter if it could see up from the bottom end of the microscope .  it said  you are nothing .  it said  you are flawed  you have no value .  it said  you are animal .  it said  perhaps you may be a pet  or perhaps you may be a quarry .  it said  and the choice is not yours .   she tried to pull her hand away .      get out of her mind  old crone .      granny   s face was running with sweat .      i ain   t in her mind  elf .  i   m keeping you out .      the queen smiled .  it was the most beautiful smile diamanda had ever seen .      and you have some power  too .  amazing .  i never thought you   d amount to anything  esmerelda weatherwax .  but it   s no good here .  kill them both .  but not at the same time .  let the other one watch .      she climbed on to her horse again  turned it around  and galloped off .   two of the elves dismounted  drawing thin bronze daggers from their belts .      well  that   s about it  then     said granny weatherwax  as the warriors approached .  she dropped her voice .      when the time comes     she said     run .         what time .         you   ll know .      granny fell to her knees as the elves approached .      oh  deary me  oh spare my life  i am but a poor old woman and skinny also     she said .     oh spare my life  young sir .  oh lawks .      she curled up  sobbing .  diamanda looked at her in astonishment  not least at how anyone could expect to get away with something like that .   elves had been away from humans for a long time .  the first elf reached her  hauled her up by her shoulder  and got a doubled handed  bony knuckled punch in an area that nanny ogg would be surprised that esme weatherwax even knew about .   diamanda was already running .  granny   s elbow caught the other elf in the chest as she set off after her .   behind her  she heard the merry laughter of the elves .   diamanda had been surprised at granny   s old lady act .  she was far more surprised when granny drew level .  but granny had more to run away from .      they   ve got horses .      granny nodded .  and it   s true that horses go faster than people  but it   s not instantly obvious to everyone that this is only true over moderate distances .  over short distances a determined human can outrun a horse  because they   ve only got half as many legs to sort out .   granny reached over and gripped diamanda   s arm .      head for the gap between the piper and the drummer .         which ones are they .         you don   t even know that .      humans can outrun a horse  indeed .  it was preying on granny weatherwax   s mind that no one can outrun an arrow .   something whined past her ear .   the circle of stones seemed as far away as ever .   nothing for it .  it oughtn   t to be possible .  she   d only ever tried it seriously when she was lying down  or at least when she had something to lean against .   she tried it now     there were four elves chasing them .  she didn   t even think about looking into their minds .  but the horses   ah  the horses     they were carnivores  minds like an arrowhead .   the rules of borrowing were  you didn   t hurt  you just rode inside their heads  you didn   t involve the subject in any way     well  not so much a rule  as such  more of a general guideline .   a stone tipped arrow went through her hat .   hardly really a guideline  even .   in fact  not even     oh  drat .   she plunged into the lead horse   s mind  down through the layers of barely controlled madness which is what is inside even a normal horse   s brain .  for a moment she looked out through its bloodshot eyes at her own figure  staggering through the snow .  for a moment she was trying to control six legs at once  two of them in a separate body .   in terms of difficulty  playing one tune on a musical instrument and singing a totally different one  was a stroll in the country by comparison .   she knew she couldn   t do it for more than a few seconds before total confusion overwhelmed mind and body .  but a second was all she needed .  she let the confusion arise  dumped it in its entirety in the horse   s mind  and withdrew sharply  picking up control of her own body as it began to fall .   there was one horrible moment in the horse   s head .   it wasn   t sure what it was  or how it had got there .  more importantly  it didn   t know how many legs it had .  there was a choice of two or four  or possibly even six .  it compromised on three .   granny heard it scream and collapse noisily  by the sound of things taking a couple of others with it .      hah .      she risked a look sideways at diamanda .   who wasn   t there .   she was in the snow some way back  trying with difficulty to get to her feet .  the face she turned to granny was as pale as the snow .   there was an arrow sticking out of her shoulder .   granny darted back  grabbed the girl and hauled her upright .      come on .  nearly there .         can   t r   n   c   ld        diamanda slumped forward .  granny caught her before she hit the snow and  with a grunt of effort  slung her over her shoulder .   a few more steps  and all she had to do was fall forwar     a clawed hand snatched at her dress     and three figures fell  rolling over and over in the summer bracken .   the elf was first to its feet  looking around in dazed triumph .  it already had a long copper knife in its hand .   it focused on granny  who had landed on her back .  she could smell the rankness of it as it raised the knife  and she sought desperately for a way into its head     something flashed past her vision .   a length of rope had caught the elf   s neck  and went tight as something swished through the air .  the creature stared in horror as a flatiron whirred a few feet away from its face and swung past its ear  winding around and around with increasing speed but a decreasing orbital radius until it connected heavily with the back of the elf   s head  lifting it off its feet and dropping it heavily on the turf .   nanny ogg appeared in granny   s vision .      cor  it doesn   t half whiff  don   t it .     she said .     you can smell elves a mile off .      granny scrambled upright .   there was nothing but grass inside the circle .  no snow  no elves .   she turned to diamanda .  so did nanny .  the girl was lying unconscious .      elf shot     said granny .      oh  bugger .         the point   s still in there .      nanny scratched her head .      i could probably get the point out  no problem     she said     but i don   t know about the poison   we could tie a tourniquet around the affected part .         hah .  her neck   d be favorite  then .      granny sat down with her chin on her knees .  her shoulders ached .      got to get me breath back     she said .   images swam in the forefront of her mind .  here it came again .  she knew there were such things as alternative futures  after all  that   s what the future meant .  but she   d never heard of alternative pasts .  she could remember having just gone through the stones  if she concentrated .  but she could remember other things .  she could remember being in bed in her own house  but that was it  it was a house  not a cottage  but she was her  they were her own memories   she had a nagging feeling that she was asleep  right now     dully  she tried to focus on nanny ogg .  there was something comfortingly solid about gytha ogg .   nanny had produced a penknife .      what the hell are you doing .         going to put it out of its misery  esme .         doesn   t look miserable to me .      nanny ogg   s eyes gleamed speculatively .      could soon arrange that  esme .         don   t go torturing it just because it   s lying down  gytha .         damn well ain   t waiting for it to stand up again  esme .         gytha .         well  they used to carry off babies .  i ain   t having that again .  the thought of someone carrying off our pewsey           even elves ain   t that daft .  never seen such a sticky child in all my life .      granny pulled gently at diamanda   s eyelid .      out cold     she said .     off playing with the fairies .      she picked the girl up .     come on .  i   ll carry her  you bring mr .  tinkerbell .         that was brave of you  carrying her over your shoulder     said nanny .     with them elves firing arrows  too .         and it meant less chance of one hitting me  too     said granny .   nanny ogg was shocked .      what .  you never thought that  did you .         well  she   d been hit already .  if i   d been hit too  neither of us   d get out     said granny  simply .      but that   s   that   s a bit heartless  esme .         heartless it may be  but headless it ain   t .  i   ve never claimed to be nice  just to be sensible .  no need to look like that .  now  are you coming or are you going to stand there with your mouth open all day .      nanny closed her mouth  and then opened it again to say      what   re you going to do .         well  do you know how to cure her .         me .  no .         right .  me neither .  but i know someone who might know     she said .     and we can shove him in the dungeons for now .  lots of iron bars down there .  that should keep him quiet .         how   d he get through .         he was holding on to me .  i don   t know how it works .  maybe the stone   force opens to let humans through  or something .  just so long as his friends stay inside  that   s all i   m bothered about .      nanny heaved the unconscious elf on to her shoulders without much effort .       smells worse than the bottom of a goat   s bed     she said .     it   s a bath for me when i get home .         oh  dear     said granny .     it gets worse  don   t it .         what is magic .   then there is the witches    explanation  which comes in two forms  depending on the age of the witch .  older witches hardly put words to it at all  but may suspect in their hearts that the universe really doesn   t know what the hell is going on and consists of a zillion trillion billion possibilities  and could become any one of them if a trained mind rigid with quantum certainty was inserted in the crack and twisted  that  if you really had to make someone   s hat explode  all you needed to do was twist into that universe where a large number of hat molecules all decide at the same time to bounce off in different directions .   younger witches  on the other hand  talk about it all the time and believe it involves crystals  mystic forces  and dancing about without yer drawers on .   everyone may be right  all at the same time .  that   s the thing about quantum .      it was early morning .  shawn ogg was on guard on the battlements of lancre castle  all that stood between the inmates and any mighty barbarian hordes that might be in the area .   he enjoyed the military life .  sometimes he wished a small horde would attack  just so   s he could save the day .  he daydreamed of leading an army into battle  and wished the king would get one .   a brief scream indicated that hodgesaargh was giving his charges their morning finger .   shawn ignored the noise .  it was part of the background hum of the castle .  he was passing the time by seeing how long he could hold his breath .   he had any amount of ways of passing the time  since guard duty in lancre involved such an awful lot of it .  there was getting the nostrils really clean  that was a good one .  or farting tunes .  or standing on one leg .  holding his breath and counting was something he fell back on when he couldn   t think of anything else and his meals hadn   t been too rich in carbohydrates .   there were a couple of loud creaks from the door knocker  far below .  there was so much rust on it now that the only way it could be coaxed into making any sound was to lift it up  which made it squeak  and then force it mightily downward  which caused another squeak and  if the visitor was lucky  a faint thud .   shawn took a deep breath and leaned over the battlements .      halt .  who goes there .     he said .   a ringing voice came up from below .      it   s me  shawn .  your mum .         oh  hello  mum .  hello  mistress weatherwax .         let us in  there   s a good boy .         friend or foe .         what .         it   s what i   ve got to say  mum .  it   s official .  and then you   ve got to say friend .         i   m your mum .         you   ve got to do it properly  mum     said shawn  in the wretched tones of one who knows he   s going to lose no matter what happens next     otherwise what   s the point .         it   s going to be foe in a minute  my lad .         oooaaaww  mum .         oh  all right .  friend  then .         yes  but you could just be saying that           let us in right now  shawn ogg .      shawn saluted  slightly stunning himself with the butt of his spear .      right you are  mistress weatherwax .      his round  honest face disappeared from view .  after a minute or two they heard the creaking of the portcullis .      how did you do that .     said nanny ogg .      simple     said granny .     he knows you wouldn   t make his daft head explode .         well  i know you wouldn   t  too .         no you don   t .  you just know i ain   t done it up to now .         magrat had thought this sort of thing was just a joke  but it was true .  the castle   s great hall had one long  one very long dining table  and she and verence sat at either end of it .   it was all to do with etiquette .   the king had to sit at the head of the table .  that was obvious .  but if she sat on one side of him it made them both uneasy  because they had to keep turning to talk to each other .  opposite ends and shouting was the only way .   then there was the logistics of the sideboard .  again  the easy option   them just going over and helping themselves   was out of the question .  if kings went round putting their own food on their own plate  the whole system of monarchy would come crashing down .   unfortunately  this meant that service had to be by means of mr .  spriggins the butler  who had a bad memory  a nervous twitch and a rubber knee  and a sort of medieval elevator system that connected with the kitchen and sounded like the rattle of a tumbril .  the elevator shaft was a kind of heat sink .  hot food was cold by the time it arrived .  cold food got colder .  no one knew what would happen to ice cream  but it would probably involve some rewriting of the laws of thermodynamics .   also  the cook couldn   t get the hang of vegetarianism .  the traditional palace cuisine was heavy in artery clogging dishes so full of saturated fats that they oozed out in great wobbly globules .  vegetables existed as things to soak up spare gravy  and were generally boiled to a uniform shade of yellow in any case .  magrat had tried explaining things to mrs .  scorbic the cook  but the woman   s three chins wobbled so menacingly at words like    vitamins    that she   d made an excuse to back out of the kitchen .   at the moment she was making do with an apple .  the cook knew about apples .  they were big roasted floury things scooped out and filled with raisins and cream .  so magrat had resorted to stealing a raw one from the apple loft .  she was also plotting to find out where the carrots were kept .   verence was distantly visible behind the silver candlesticks and a pile of account books .   occasionally they looked up and smiled at each other .  at least  it looked like a smile but it was a little hard to be sure at this distance .   apparently he   d just said something .   magrat cupped her hands around her mouth .      pardon .         we need a           sorry .         what .         what .      finally magrat got up and waited while spriggins  purple in the face with the effort  moved her chair down toward verence .  she could have done it herself  but it wasn   t what queens did .      we ought to have a poet laureate     said verence  marking his place in a book .     kingdoms have to have one .  they write poems for special celebrations .         yes .         i thought perhaps mrs .  ogg .  i hear she   s quite an amusing songstress .      magrat kept a straight face .      i   er   i think she knows lots of rhymes for certain words     she said .      apparently the going rate is fourpence a year and a butt of sack     said verence  peering at the page .     or it may be a sack of butt .         what exactly will she have to do .     said magrat .      it says here the role of the poet laureate is to recite poems on state occasions     said verence .   magrat had witnessed some of nanny ogg   s humorous recitations  especially the ones with the gestures .  she nodded gravely .      provided     she said     and i want to be absolutely sure you understand me on this  provided she takes up her post after the wedding .         oh  dear .  really .         after the wedding .         oh .         trust me .         well  of course  if it makes you happy        there was a commotion outside the double doors  which were flung back .  nanny ogg and granny weatherwax stamped in  with shawn trying to overtake them .      oooaaww  mum .  i   m supposed to go in first to say who it is .         we   ll tell them who we are .  wotcha  your majesties     said nanny .      blessing be upon this castle     said granny .     magrat  there   s some doctorin    needs doing .  here .      granny swept a candlestick and some crockery on to the floor with a dramatic motion and laid diamanda on the table .  in fact there were several acres of table totally devoid of any obstruction  but there   s no sense in making an entrance unless you   re prepared to make a mess .      but i thought she was fighting you yesterday .     said magrat .      makes no difference     said granny .     morning  your majesty .      king verence nodded .  some kings would have shouted for the guards at this point but verence did not because he was sensible  this was granny weatherwax and in any case the only available guard was shawn ogg  who was trying to straighten out his trumpet .   nanny ogg had drifted over to the sideboard .  it wasn   t that she was callous  but it had been a busy few hours and there was a lot of breakfast that no one seemed to be interested in .      what happened to her .     said magrat  inspecting the girl carefully .   granny looked around the room .  suits of armor  shields hanging on the walls  rusty old swords and pikes   probably enough iron here        she was shot by an elf           but       said magrat and verence at the same time .      don   t ask questions now  got no time .  shot by an elf .  them horrible arrows of theirs .  they make the mind go wandering off all by itself .  now   can you do anything .      despite her better nature  magrat felt a spark of righteous ire .      oh  so suddenly i   m a witch again when you        granny weatherwax sighed .      no time for that  either     she said .     i   m just askin    .  all you have to do is say no .  then i   ll take her away and won   t bother you again .      the quietness of her voice was so unexpected that magrat tripped over her own anger  and tried to right herself .      i wasn   t saying i wouldn   t  i was just           good .      there was a series of clangs as nanny ogg lifted the silver tureen lids .      hey  they   ve got three kinds of eggs .         well  there   s no fever     said magrat .     slow pulse .  eyes unfocused .  shawn .         yes  miss queen .         boiled  scrambled  and fried .  that   s what i call posh .         run down to my cottage and bring back all the books you can find .  i   m sure i read something about this once  granny .  shawn .      shawn paused halfway to the door .      yes  miss queen .         on your way out  stop off in the kitchens and ask them to boil up a lot of water .  we can start by getting the wound clean  at any rate .  but look  elves           i   ll let you get on with it  then     said granny  turning away .     can i have a word with you  your majesty .  there   s something downstairs you ought to see .         i shall need some help     said magrat .      nanny   ll do it .         that   s me     said nanny indistinctly  spraying crumbs .      what are you eating .         fried egg and ketchup sandwich     said nanny happily .      you better get the cook to boil you  too     said magrat  rolling up her sleeves .     go and see her .     she looked at the wound .     and see if she   s got any mouldy bread    .         the basic unit of wizardry is the order or the college or  of course  the university .   the basic unit of witchcraft is the witch  but the basic continuous unit  as has already been indicated  is the cottage .   a witch   s cottage is a very specific architectural item .  it is not exactly built  but put together over the years as the areas of repair join up  like a sock made entirely of darns .  the chimney twists like a corkscrew .  the roof is thatch so old that small but flourishing trees are growing in it  the floors are switchbacks  it creaks at night like a tea clipper in a gale .  if at least two walls aren   t shored up with balks of timber then it   s not a true witch   s cottage at all  but merely the home of some daft old bat who reads tea leaves and talks to her cat .   cottages tend to attract similar kinds of witches .  it   s natural .  every witch trains up one or two young witches in their life  and when in the course of mortal time the cottage becomes vacant it   s only sense for one of them to move in .   magrat   s cottage traditionally housed thoughtful witches who noticed things and wrote things down .  which herbs were better than others for headaches  fragments of old stories  odds and ends like that .   there were a dozen books of tiny handwriting and drawings  the occasional interesting flower or unusual frog pressed carefully between the pages .   it was a cottage of questioning witches  research witches .  eye of what newt .  what species of ravined salt sea shark .  it   s all very well a potion calling for love in idleness  but which of the thirty seven common plants called by that name in various parts of the continent was actually meant .   the reason that granny weatherwax was a better witch than magrat was that she knew that in witchcraft it didn   t matter a damn which one it was  or even if it was a piece of grass .   the reason that magrat was a better doctor than granny was that she thought it did .      the coach slowed to a halt in front of the barricade across the road .   the bandit chieftain adjusted his eyepatch .  he had two good eyes  but people respect uniforms .  then he strolled toward the coach .      morning  jim .  what   ve we got today  then .         uh .  this could be difficult     said the coachman .     uh  there   s a handful of wizards .  and a dwarf .  and an ape .     he rubbed his head  and winced .     yes .  definitely an ape .  not  and i think i should make this clear  any other kind of man shaped thing with hair on .         you all right  jim .         i   ve had this lot ever since ankh morpork .  don   t talk to me about dried frog pills .      the bandit chief raised his eyebrows .      all right .  i won   t .      he knocked on the coach door .  the window slid down .      i wouldn   t like you to think of this as a robbery     he said .     i   d like you to think of it more as a colorful anecdote you might enjoy telling your grandchildren about .      a voice from within said     that   s him .  he stole my horse .      a wizard   s staff poked out .  the chieftain saw the knob on the end .      now  then     he said  pleasantly .     i know the rules .  wizards aren   t allowed to use magic against civilians except in genuine life threatening situa        there was a burst of octarine light .      actually  it   s not a rule     said ridcully .     it   s more a guideline .     he turned to ponder stibbons .     interestin    use of stacklady   s morphic resonator here  i hope you noticed .      ponder looked down .   the chieftain had been turned into a pumpkin although  in accordance with the rules of universal humor  he still had his hat on .      and now     said ridcully     i   d be obliged if all you fellows hidin    behind the rocks and things would just step out where i can see you .  very good .  mr .  stibbons  you and the librarian just pass around with the hat  please .         but this is robbery .     said the coachman .     and you   ve turned him into a fruit .         a vegetable     said ridcully .     anyway  it   ll wear off in a couple of hours .         and i   m owed a horse     said casanunda .   the bandits paid up  reluctantly handing over money to ponder and reluctantly but very quickly handing over money to the librarian .      there   s almost three hundred dollars  sir     said ponder .      and a horse  remember .  in fact  there were two horses .  i   d forgotten about the other horse until now .         capital .  we   re in pocket on the trip .  so if these gentlemen would just remove the roadblock  we   ll be on our way .         in fact  there was a third horse i   ve just remembered about .         this isn   t what you   re supposed to do .  you   re supposed to be robbed .     shouted the coachman .   ridcully pushed him off the board .      we   re on holiday     he said .   the coach rattled away .  there was a distant cry of    and four horses  don   t forget    before it rounded a bend .   the pumpkin developed a mouth .      have they gone .         yes  boss .         roll me into the shade  will you .  and no one say anything about this ever again .  has anyone got any dried frog pills .         verence ii respected witches .  they   d put him on the throne .  he was pretty certain of that  although he couldn   t quite work out how it had happened .  and he was in awe of granny weatherwax .   he followed her meekly toward the dungeons  hurrying to keep up with her long stride .      what   s happening  mistress weatherwax .         got something to show you .         you mentioned elves .         that   s right .         i thought they were a fairy story .         well .         i mean   you know   an old wives    tale .         so .      granny weatherwax seemed to generate a gyroscopic field   if you started out off balance  she saw to it that you remained there .   he tried again .      don   t exist  is what i   m trying to say .      granny reached a dungeon door .  it was mainly age blackened oak  but with a large barred grille occupying some of the top half .      in there .      verence peered inside .      good grief .         i got shawn to unlock it .  i don   t reckon anyone else saw us come in .  don   t tell anyone .  if the dwarfs and the trolls find out  they   ll tear the walls apart to get him out .         why .  to kill him .         of course .  they   ve got better memories than humans .         what am i supposed to do with it .         just keep it locked up .  how should i know .  i   ve got to think .      verence peered in again at the elf .  it was lying curled up in the center of the floor .      that   s an elf .  but it   s   just a long  thin human with a foxy face .  more or less .  i thought they were supposed to be beautiful .         oh  they are when they   re conscious     said granny  waving a hand vaguely .     they project this   this   when people look at them  they see beauty  they see something they want to please .  they can look just like you want them to look .     s   called glamour .  you can tell when elves are around .  people act funny .  they stop thinking clear .  don   t you know anything .         i thought   elves were just stories   like the tooth fairy           nothing funny about the tooth fairy     said granny .     very hard working woman .  i   ll never know how she manages with the ladder and everything .  no .  elves are real .  oh  drat .  listen        she turned  and held up a finger .      feudal system  right .         what .         feudal system .  pay attention .  feudal system .  king on top  then barons and whatnot  then everyone else   witches off to one side a bit     granny added diplomatically .  she steepled her fingers .     feudal system .  like them pointy buildings heathen kings get buried in .  understand .         yes .         right .  that   s how the elves see things  yes .  when they get into a world  everyone else is on the bottom .  slaves .  worse than slaves .  worse than animals  even .  they take what they want  and they want everything .  but worst of all  the worst bit is   they read your mind .  they hear what you think  and in self defense you think what they want .  glamour .  and it   s barred windows at night  and food out for the fairies  and turning around three times before you talks about    em  and horseshoes over the door .         i thought that sort of thing was  you know     the king grinned sickly     folklore .         of course it   s folklore  you stupid man .         i do happen to be king  you know     said verence reproachfully .      you stupid king  your majesty .         thank you .         i mean it doesn   t mean it   s not true .  maybe it gets a little muddled over the years  folks forget details  they forget why they do things .  like the horseshoe thing .         i know my granny had one over the door     said the king .      there you are .  nothing to do with its shape .  but if you lives in an old cottage and you   re poor  it   s probably the nearest bit of iron with holes in it that you can find .         ah .         the thing about elves is they   ve got no   begins with m     granny snapped her fingers irritably .      manners .         hah .  right  but no .         muscle .  mucus .  mystery .         no .  no .  no .  means like   seein    the other person   s point of view .      verence tried to see the world from a granny weatherwax perspective  and suspicion dawned .      empathy .         right .  none at all .  even a hunter  a good hunter  can feel for the quarry .  that   s what makes    em a good hunter .  elves aren   t like that .  they   re cruel for fun  and they can   t understand things like mercy .  they can   t understand that anything apart from themselves might have feelings .  they laugh a lot  especially if they   ve caught a lonely human or a dwarf or a troll .  trolls might be made out of rock  your majesty  but i   m telling you that a troll is your brother compared to elves .  in the head  i mean .         but why don   t i know all this .         glamour .  elves are beautiful .  they   ve got     she spat the word     style .  beauty .  grace .  that   s what matters .  if cats looked like frogs we   d realize what nasty  cruel little bastards they are .  style .  that   s what people remember .  they remember the glamour .  all the rest of it  all the truth of it  becomes   old wives    tales .         magrat   s never said anything about them .      granny hesitated .      magrat doesn   t know too much about elves     she said .     hah .  she ain   t even a young wife yet .  they   re not something that gets talked about a lot these days .  it   s not good to talk about them .  it   s better if everyone forgets about them .  they   come when they   re called .  not called like    cooee .     called inside people   s heads .  it   s enough for people just to want them to be here .      verence waved his hands in the air .      i   m still learning about monarchy     he said .     i don   t understand this stuff .         you don   t have to understand .  you   re a king .  listen .  you know about weak places in the world .  where it joins other worlds .         no .         there   s one up on the moor .  that   s why the dancers were put up around it .  they   re a kind of wall .         ah .         but sometimes the barriers between worlds is weaker  see .  like tides .  at circle time .         ah .         and if people act stupidly then  even the dancers can   t keep the gateway shut .     cos where the world   s thin  even the wrong thought can make the link .         ah .      verence felt the conversation had orbited back to that area where he could make a contribution .      stupidly .     he said .      calling them .  attracting them .         ah .  so what do i do .         just go on reigning .  i think we   re safe .  they can   t get through .  i   ve stopped the girls  so there   ll be no more channeling .  you keep this one firmly under lock and key  and don   t tell magrat .  no sense in worrying her  is there .  something came through  but i   m keeping an eye on it .      granny rubbed her hands together in grim satisfaction .      i think i   ve got it sorted     she said .   she blinked .   she pinched the bridge of her nose .      what did i just say .     she said .      uh .  you said you thought you   d got it sorted     said the king .   granny weatherwax blinked .      that   s right     she said .     i said that .  yes .  and i   m in the castle  aren   t i .  yes .         are you all right  mistress weatherwax .     said the king  his voice taut with sudden worry .      fine  fine .  fine .  in the castle .  and the children are all right  too .         sorry .      she blinked again .      what .         you don   t look well        granny screwed up her face and shook her head .      yes .  the castle .  i   m me  you   re you  gytha   s upstairs with magrat .  that   s right .     she focused on the king .     just a bit of   of overtiredness there .  nothing to worry about .  nothing to worry about at all .         nanny ogg looked doubtfully at magrat   s preparation .      a mouldy bread poultice doesn   t sound very magical to me     she said .      goodie whemper used to swear by it .  but i don   t know what we can do about the coma .      magrat thumbed hopefully through the crackling  ancient pages .  her ancestral witches had written things down pretty much as they occurred to them  so that quite important spells and observations would be interspersed with comments about the state of their feet .      it says here     the smalle pointy stones sometimes found are knowne as elf shot  beinge the heads of elf arrows from times past .     that   s all i can find .  and there   s a drawing .  but i   ve seen these little stones around  too .         oh  there   s lots of them     said nanny  bandaging diamanda   s shoulder .     dig    em up all the time  in my garden .         but elves don   t shoot people .  elves are good .         they probably just fired at esme and the girl in fun  like .         but           look  dear  you   re going to be queen .  it   s an important job .  you look after the king now  and let me and esme look after   other stuff .         being queen .  it   s all tapestry and walking around in unsuitable dresses .  i know granny .  she doesn   t like anything that   s   that   s got style and grace .  she   s so sour .         i daresay she   s got her reasons     said nanny amiably .     well  that   s got the girl patched up .  what shall we do with her now .         we   ve got dozens of spare bedrooms     said magrat     and they   re all ready for the guests .  we can put her in one of them .  um .  nanny .         yes .         would you like to be a bridesmaid .         not really  dear .  bit old for that sort of thing .     nanny hovered .     there isn   t anything you need to ask me  though  is there .         what do you mean .         what with your mum being dead and you having no female relatives and everything        magrat still looked puzzled .      after the wedding  is what i   m hinting about     said nanny .      oh  that .  no  most of that   s being done by a caterer .  the cook here isn   t much good at canapes and things .      nanny looked carefully at the ceiling .      and what about after that .     she said .     if you catch my meaning .         i   m getting a lot of girls in to do the clearing up .  look  don   t worry .  i   ve thought of everything .  i wish you and granny wouldn   t treat me as if i don   t know anything .      nanny coughed .     your man     she said .     been around a bit  i expect .  been walking out with dozens of young women  i   ve no doubt .         why do you say that .  i don   t think he has .  fools don   t have much of a private life and  of course  he   s been very busy since he   s been king .  he   s a bit shy with girls .      nanny gave up .      oh  well     she said     i   m sure you   ll work it all out as you        granny and the king reappeared .      how   s the girl .     said granny .      we took out the arrow and cleaned up the wound  anyway     said magrat .     but she won   t wake up .  best if she stays here .         you sure .     said granny .     she needs keeping an eye on .  i   ve got a spare bedroom .         she shouldn   t be moved     said magrat  briskly .      they   ve put their mark on her     said granny .     you sure you know how to deal with it .         i do know it   s quite a nasty wound     said magrat  briskly .      i ain   t exactly thinking about the wound     said granny .     she   s been touched by them is what i mean .  she   s           i   m sure i know how to deal with a sick person     said magrat .     i   m not totally stupid  you know .         she   s not to be left alone     granny persisted .      there   ll be plenty of people around     said verence .     the guests start arriving tomorrow .         being alone isn   t the same as not having other people around     said granny .      this is a castle  granny .         right .  well .  we won   t keep you  then     said granny .     come  gytha .      nanny ogg helped herself to an elderly lamb chop from under one of the silver covers  and waved it vaguely at the royal pair .      have fun     she said .     insofar as that   s possible .         gytha .         coming .         elves are wonderful .  they provoke wonder .   elves are marvelous .  they cause marvels .   elves are fantastic .  they create fantasies .   elves are glamorous .  they project glamour .   elves are enchanting .  they weave enchantment .   elves are terrific .  they beget terror .   the thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake  and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning .   no one ever said elves are nice .   elves are bad .         well  that   s it     said nanny ogg  as the witches walked out over the castle   s drawbridge .     well done  esme .         it ain   t over     said granny weatherwax .      you said yourself they can   t get through now .  no one else round here   s going to try any magic at the stones  that   s sure enough .         yes  but it   ll be circle time for another day or so yet .  anything could happen .         that diamanda girl   s out of it  and you   ve put the wind up the others     said nanny ogg  tossing the lamb bone into the dry moat .     ain   t no one else going to call    em  i know that .         there   s still the one in the dungeon .         you want to get rid of it .     said nanny .     i   ll send our shawn to king ironfoundersson up at copperhead  if you like .  or i could hop on the old broomstick meself and go and drop the word to the mountain king .  the dwarfs and trolls   ll take it off our hands like a shot .  no more problem .      granny ignored this .      there   s something else     she said .     something we haven   t thought of .  she   ll still be looking for a way .      they   d reached the town square now .  she surveyed it .  of course  verence was king and that was right and proper  and this was his kingdom and that was right and proper too .  but in a deeper sense the kingdom belonged to her .  and to gytha ogg  of course .  verence   s writ only ran to the doings of mankind  even the dwarfs and trolls didn   t acknowledge him as king  although they were very polite about it .  but when it came to the trees and the rocks and the soil  granny weatherwax saw it as hers .  she was sensitive to its moods .   it was still being watched .  she could sense the watchfulness .  sufficiently close examination changes the thing being observed  and what was being observed was the whole country .  the whole country was under attack  and here she was  her mind unraveling        funny thing     said nanny ogg  to no one in particular     while i was sitting up there at the dancers this morning i thought  funny thing           what   re you going on about now .         i remember when i was young there was a girl like diamanda .  bad tempered and impatient and talented and a real pain in the bum to the old witches .  i don   t know if you happen to remember her  by any chance .      they passed jason   s forge  which rang to the sound of his hammer .      i never forgot her     said granny  quietly .      funny thing  how things go round in circles           no they don   t     said granny weatherwax firmly .     i wasn   t like her .  you know what the old witches round here were like .  set in their ways .  no more than a bunch of old wart charmers .  and i wasn   t rude to them .  i was just   firm .  forthright .  i stood up for meself .  part of being a witch is standing up for yourself   you   re grinning .         just wind  i promise .         it   s completely different with her .  no one   s ever been able to say i wasn   t open to new ideas .         well known for being open to new ideas  you are     said nanny ogg .     i   m always saying  that esme weatherwax  she   s always open to new ideas .         right .     granny weatherwax looked up at the forested hills around the town  and frowned .      the thing is     she said     girls these days don   t know how to think with a clear mind .  you   ve got to think clearly and not be distracted .  that   s magrat for you  always being distracted .  it gets in the way of doing the proper thing .     she stopped .     i can feel her  gytha .  the queen of the fairies .  she can get her mind past the stones .  blast that girl .  she   s got a way in .  she   s everywhere .  everywhere i look with my mind  i can smell her .         everything   s going to be all right     said nanny  patting her on the shoulder .     you   ll see .         she   s looking for a way     granny repeated .         good morrow  brothers  and wherehap do we whist this merry day .     said carter the baker .   the rest of the lancre morris men looked at him .      you on some kind of medication or what .     said weaver the thatcher .      just trying to enter into the spirit of the thing     said carter .      that   s how rude mechanicals talk .         who   re rude mechanicals .     said baker the weaver .      they   re the same as comic artisans  i think     said carter the baker .      i asked my mum what artisans are     said jason .      yeah .         they   re us .         and we   re rude mechanicals as well .     said baker the weaver .      i reckon .         bum .         well  we certainly don   t talk like these buggers in the writing     said carter the baker .     i never said    folde rol    in my life .  and i can   t understand any of the jokes .         you ain   t supposed to understand the jokes  this is a play     said jason .      drawers .     said baker the weaver .      oh  shut up .  and push the cart .         don   t see why we couldn   t do the stick and bucket dance       mumbled tailor the other weaver .      we   re not doing the stick and bucket dance .  i never want to hear any more ever about the stick and bucket dance .  i still get twinges in my knee .  so shut up about the stick and bucket dance .         belly .     shouted baker  who wasn   t a man to let go of an idea .   the cart containing the props bumped and skidded on the rutted track .   jason had to admit that morris dancing was a lot easier than acting .  people didn   t keep turning up to watch and giggle .  small children didn   t stand around jeering .  weaver and thatcher were in almost open rebellion now  and mucking up the words .  the evenings were becoming a constant search for somewhere to rehearse .   even the forest wasn   t private enough .  it was amazing how people would just happen to be passing .   weaver stopped pushing  and wiped his brow .      you   d have thought the blasted oak would   ve been safe     he said .     half a mile from the nearest path  and damn me if after five minutes you can   t move for charcoal burners  hermits  trappers  tree tappers  hunters  trolls  bird limers  hurdle makers  swine herds  truffle hunters  dwarfs  bodgers and suspicious buggers with big coats on .  i   m surprised there   s room in the forest for the bloody trees .  where to now .      they   d reached a crossroads  if such it could be called .      don   t remember this one     said carpenter the poacher .     thought i knew all the paths around here .         that   s    cos you only ever sees    em in the dark     said jason .      yeah  everyone knows    tis your delight on a shining night     said thatcher the carter .         tis his delight every night     said jason .      hey     said baker the weaver     we   re getting really good at this rude mechanism  ain   t we .         let   s go right     said jason .      nah  it   s all briars and thorns that way .         all right  then  left then .         it   s all winding     said weaver .      what about the middle road .     said carter .   jason peered ahead .   there was a middle track  hardly more than an animal path  which wound away under shady trees .  ferns grew thickly alongside it .  there was a general green  rich  dark feel to it  suggested by the word    bosky .       his blacksmith   s senses stood up and screamed .      not that way     he said .      ah  come on     said weaver .     what   s wrong with it .         goes up to the dancers  that path does     said jason .     me mam said no one was to go up to the dancers    cos of them young women dancing round    em in the nudd .         yeah  but they   ve been stopped from that     said thatcher .     old granny weatherwax put her foot down hard and made    em put their drawers on .         and they ain   t to go there anymore  neither     said carter .     so it   ll be nice and quiet for the rehearsing .         me mam said no one was to go there     said jason  a shade uncertainly .      yeah  but she probably meant   you know   with magical intent     said carter .     nothing magical about prancing around in wigs and stuff .         right     said thatcher .     and it   ll be really private .         and     said weaver     if any young women fancies sneaking back up there to dance around without their drawers on  we   ll be sure to see    em .      there was a moment of absolute  introspective silence .      i reckon     said thatcher  voicing the unspoken views of nearly all of them     we owes it to the community .         we ell     said jason     me mam said           anyway  your mum   s a fine one to talk     said weaver .     my dad said that when he was young  your mum hardly ever had           oh  all right     said jason  clearly outnumbered .     can   t see it can do any harm .  we   re only actin    .  it   s   it   s make believe .  it   s not as if it   s anything real .  but no one   s to do any dancing .  especially  and i want everyone to be absolutely def   nite about this  the stick and bucket dance .         oh  we   ll be acting all right     said weaver .     and keeping watch as well  o   course .         it   s our duty to the community     said thatcher  again .      make believe is bound to be all right     said jason  uncertainly .      clang boinng clang ding     the sound echoed around lancre .   grown men  digging in their gardens  flung down their spades and hurried for the safety of their cottages     clang boinnng goinng ding     women appeared in doorways and yelled desperately for their children to come in at once        bang buggrit dong boinng     shutters thundered shut .  some men  watched by their frightened families  poured water on the fire and tried to stuff sacks up the chimney     nanny ogg lived alone  because she said old people needed their pride and independence .  besides  jason lived on one side  and he or his wife whatshername could easily be roused by means of a boot applied heavily to the wall  and shawn lived on the other side and nanny had got him to fix up a long length of string with some tin cans on it in case his presence was required .  but this was only for emergencies  such as when she wanted a cup of tea or felt bored .   bond drat clang     nanny ogg had no bathroom but she did have a tin bath  which normally hung on a nail on the back of the privy .  now she was dragging it indoors .  it was almost up the garden  after being bounced off various trees  walls  and garden gnomes on the way .   three large black kettles steamed by her fireside .  beside them were half a dozen towels  the loofah  the pumice stone  the soap  the soap for when the first soap got lost  the ladle for fishing spiders out  the waterlogged rubber duck with the prolapsed squeaker  the bunion chisel  the big scrubbing brush  the small scrubbing brush  the scrubbing brush on a stick for difficult crevices  the banjo  the thing with the pipes and spigots that no one ever really knew the purpose of  and a bottle of klatchian nights bath essence  one drop of which could crinkle paint .   bong clang slam     everyone in lancre had learned to recognize nanny   s pre ablutive activities  out of self defense .      but it ain   t april .     neighbors told themselves  as they drew the curtains .   in the house just up the hill from nanny ogg   s cottage mrs .  skindle grabbed her husband   s arm .      the goat   s still outside .         are you mad .  i ain   t going out there .  not now .         you know what happened last time .  it was paralyzed all down one side for three days  man  and we couldn   t get it down off the roof .      mr .  skindle poked his head out of the door .  it had all gone quiet .  too quiet .      she   s probably pouring the water in     he said .      you   ve got a minute or two     said his wife .     go on  or we   ll be drinking yogurt for weeks .      mr .  skindle took down a halter from behind the door  and crept out to where his goat was tethered near the hedge .  it too had learned to recognize the bathtime ritual  and was rigid with apprehension .   there was no point in trying to drag it .  eventually he picked it up bodily .   there was a distant but insistent sloshing noise  and the bonging sound of a floating pumice stone bouncing on the side of a tin bath .   mr .  skindle started to run .   then there was the distant tinkle of a banjo being tuned .   the world held its breath .   then it came  like a tornado sweeping across a prairie .      aaaaaaeeeeeee        three flowerpots outside the door cracked  one after the other .  shrapnel whizzed past mr .  skindle   s ear .         wizzaaardsah staaafff has a knobontheend  knobontheend        he threw the goat through the doorway and leapt after it .  his wife was waiting  and slammed the door shut behind him .   the whole family  including the goat  got under the table .   it wasn   t that nanny ogg sang badly .  it was just that she could hit notes which  when amplified by a tin bath half full of water  ceased to be sound and became some sort of invasive presence .   there had been plenty of singers whose high notes could smash a glass  but nanny   s high c could clean it .      the lancre morris men sat glumly on the turf  passing an earthenware jug between them .  it had not been a good rehearsal .      don   t work  does it .     said thatcher .         s   not funny  that i do know     said weaver .     can   t see the king killing himself laughing at us playing a bunch of mechanical artisans not being very good at doin    a play .         you   re just no good at it     said jason .      we   re sposed to be no good at it     said weaver .      yeah  but you   re no good at acting like someone who   s no good at acting     said tinker .     i don   t know how  but you ain   t .  you can   t expect all the fine lords and ladies        a breeze blew over the moor  tasting of ice at midsummer .         to laugh at us not being any good at being no good at acting .         i don   t see what   s funny about a bunch of rude artisans trying to do a play anyway     said weaver .   jason shrugged .      it says all the gentry        a tang on the wind  the sharp tin taste of snow           in ankh morpork laughed at it for weeks and weeks     he said .     it was on broad way for three months .         what   s broad way .         that   s where all the theaters are .  the dysk  lord wynkin   s men  the bearpit           they   d laugh at any damn thing down there     said weaver .     anyway  they all think we   m all simpletons up here .  they all think we say oo aah and sings daft folk songs and has three brain cells huddlin    together for warmth    cos of drinking scumble all the time .         yeah .  pass that jug .         swish city bastards .         they don   t know what it   s like to be up to the armpit in a cow   s backside on a snowy night .  hah .         and there ain   t one of    em that   what   re you talking about .  you ain   t got a cow .         no  but i know what it   s like .         they don   t know what it   s like to get one wellie sucked off in a farmyard full of gyppoe and that horrible moment where you waves the foot around knowin    that wherever you puts it down it   s going to go through the crust .      the stoneware jug glugged gently as it was passed from hand to unsteady hand .      true .  that   s very true .  and you ever seen    em morris dancing .     nuff to make you hang up your hanky .         what  morris dancing in a city .         well  down in sto helit  anyway .  bunch o    soft wizards and merchants .  i watched    em a whole hour and there wasn   t even a groinin    .         swish city bastards .  comin    up here  takin    our jobs           don   t be daft .  they don   t know what a proper job is .      the jug glugged  but with a deeper tone  suggesting that it contained a lot of emptiness .      bet they   ve never been up to the armpit           the point is .  the point is .  the point .  the point is .  hah .  all laughin    at decent rude artisans  eh .  i mean .  i mean .  i mean .  what   s it all about .  i mean .  i mean .  i mean .  play   s all about some mechanical   rude buggers makin    a pig   s ear out of doin    a play about a bunch of lords and ladies        a chill in the air  sharp as icicles        it needs something else .         right .  right .         a mythic element .         right .  my point .  my point .  my point .  needs a plot they can go home whistlin    .  exactly .         so it should be done here  in the open air .  open to the sky and the hills .      jason ogg wrinkled his brows .  they were always pretty wrinkled anyway  whenever he was dealing with the complexities of the world .  only when it came to iron did he know exactly what to do .  but he held up a wavering finger and tried to count his fellow thespians .  given that the jug was now empty  this was an effort .  there seemed  on average  to be seven other people .  but he had a vague  nagging feeling that something wasn   t right .      out here     he said  uncertainly .      good idea     said weaver .      wasn   t it your idea .     said jason .      i thought you said it .         i thought you did .         who cares who said it .     said thatcher .        s   a good idea .  seems   right .         what was that about the miffic quality .         what   s miffic .         something you   ve got to have     said weaver  theatrical expert .     very important  your miffics .         me mam said no one was to go       jason began .      we shan   t be doing any dancing or anything     said carter .     i can see you don   t want people skulking around up here by    emselves  doin    magic .  but it can   t be wrong if everyone comes here .  i mean  the king and everyone .  your mam  too .  hah  i   d like to see any girls with no drawers on get past her .         i don   t think it   s just       jason began .      and the other one   ll be there  too     said weaver .   they considered granny weatherwax .      cor  she frightens the life out of me  her     said thatcher  eventually .     the way she looks right through you .  i wouldn   t say a word against her  mark you  a fine figure of a woman     he said loudly  and then added rather more quietly     but they do say she creeps around the place o   nights  as a hare or a bat or something .  changes her shape and all .  not that i believes a word of it     he raised his voice  then let it sink again     but old weezen over in slice told me once he shot a hare in the leg one night and next day she passed him on the lane and said    ouch    and gave him a right ding across the back of his head .         my dad said     said weaver     that one day he was leading our old cow to market and it took ill and fell down in the lane near her cottage and he couldn   t get it to move and he went up to her place and he knocked on the door and she opened it and before he could open his mouth she said     yer cow   s ill  weaver      just like that   and then she said           was that the old brindled cow what your dad had .     said carter .      no  it were my uncle had the brindled cow  we had the one with the crumpled horn     said weaver .     anyway           could have sworn it was brindled     said carter .     i remember my dad looking at it over the hedge one day and saying     that   s fine brindling on that cow  you don   t get brindling like that these days .     that was when you had that old field alongside cabb   s well .         we never had that field  it was my cousin had that field     said weaver .     anyway           you sure .         anyway     said weaver     she said     you wait there  i   ll give you something for it     and she goes out into her back kitchen and comes back with a couple of big red pills  and she           how   d it get crumpled  then .     said carter .         and she gave him one of the pills and said     what you do  you raise the old cow   s tail and shove this pill where the sun don   t shine  and in half a minute she   ll be up and running as fast as she can     and he thanked her  and then as he was going out of the door he said     what   s the other pill for .     and she gave him a look and said     well  you want to catch her  don   t you .            that   d be that deep valley up near slice     said carter .   they looked at him .      what  exactly  are you talking about .     said weaver .      it   s right behind the mountain     said carter  nodding knowingly .     very shady there .  that   s what she meant  i expect .  the place where the sun doesn   t shine .  long way to go for a pill  but i suppose that   s witches for you .      weaver winked at the others .      listen     he said     i   m telling you she meant   well  where the monkey put his nut .      carter shook his head .      no monkeys in slice     he said .  his face became suffused with a slow grin .     oh  i get it .  she was daft .         them playwriters down in ankh     said baker     boy  they certainly know about us .  pass me the jug .      jason turned his head again .  he was getting more and more uneasy .  his hands  which were always in daily contact with iron  were itching .      reckon we ought to be getting along home now  lads     he managed .         s   nice night     said baker  staying put .     look at them stars a twinklin    .         turned a bit cold  though     said jason .      smells like snow     said carter .      oh  yeah     said baker .     that   s right .  snow at midsummer .  that   s what they get where the sun don   t shine .         shutup  shutup  shutup     said jason .      what   s up with you .         it   s wrong .  we shouldn   t be up here .  can   t you feel it .         oh  sit down  man     said weaver .     it   s fine .  can   t feel nothing but the air .  and there   s still more scumble in the jug .      baker leaned back .      i remember an old story about this place     he said .     some man went to sleep up here once  when he was out hunting .      the bottle glugged in the dusk .      so what .  i can do that     said carter .     i go to sleep every night  reg   lar .         ah  but this man  when he woke up and went home  his wife was carrying on with someone else and all his children had grown up and didn   t know who he was .         happens to me just about every day     said weaver gloomily .   baker sniffed .      you know  it does smell a bit like snow .  you know .  that kind of sharp smell .      thatcher leaned back  cradling his head on his arm .      tell you what     he said     if i thought my old woman   d marry someone else and my hulking great kids   d bugger off and stop eating up the larder every day i   d come up here with a blanket like a shot .  who   s got that jug .      jason took a pull out of nervousness  and found that he felt better as the alcohol dissolved his synapses .   but he made an effort .      hey  lads     he slurred        ve got    nother jug coolin    in the water trough down in the forge  what d   you say .  we could all go down there now .  lads .  lads .      there was the soft sound of snoring .      oh  lads .      jason stood up .   the stars wheeled .   jason fell down  very gently .  the jug rolled out of his hands and bounced across the grass .   the stars twinkled  the breeze was cold  and it smelled of snow .      the king dined alone  which is to say  he dined at one end of the big table and magrat dined at the other .   but they managed to meet up for a last glass of wine in front of the fire .   they always found it difficult to know what to say at moments like this .  neither of them was used to spending what might be called quality time in the company of another person .  the conversation tended toward the cryptic .   and mostly it was about the wedding .  it   s different  for royalty .  for one thing  you   ve already got everything .  the traditional wedding list with the complete set of tupperware and the twelve piece dining set looks a bit out of place when you   ve already got a castle with so many furnished rooms that have been closed up for so long that the spiders have evolved into distinct species in accordance with strict evolutionary principles .  and you can   t simply multiply it all up and ask for an army in a red and white motif to match the kitchen wallpaper .  royalty  when they marry  either get very small things  like exquisitely constructed clockwork eggs  or large bulky items  like duchesses .   and then there   s the guest list .  it   s bad enough at an ordinary wedding  what with old relatives who dribble and swear  brothers who get belligerent after one drink  and various people who aren   t talking to other people because of what they said about our sharon .  royalty has to deal with entire countries who get belligerent after one drink  and entire kingdoms who have broken off diplomatic relations after what the crown prince said about our sharon .  verence had managed to work that all out  but then there were the species to consider .  trolls and dwarfs got on all right in lancre by the simple expedient of having nothing to do with one another  but too many of them under one roof  especially if drink was flowing  and especially if it was flowing in the direction of the dwarfs  and people would be breaking people   s arms off because of what  more or less  their ancestors said about our sharon .   and then there   s other things        how   s the girl they brought in .         i   ve told millie to keep an eye on her .  what are they doing  those two .         i don   t know .         you   re king  aren   t you .      verence shifted uneasily .      but they   re witches .  i don   t like to ask them questions .         why not .         they might give me answers .  and then what would i do .         what did granny want to talk to you about .         oh   you know   things           it wasn   t about   sex  was it .      verence suddenly looked like a man who had been expecting a frontal attack and suddenly finds nasty things happening behind him .      no .  why .         nanny was trying to give me motherly advice .  it was all i could do to keep a straight face .  honestly  they both treat me as if i   m a big child .         oh  no .  nothing like that .      they sat on either side of the huge fireplace  both crimson with embarrassment .   then magrat said     er   you did send off for that book  did you .  you know   the one with the woodcuts .         oh  yes .  yes  i did .         it ought to have arrived by now .         well  we only get a mail coach once a week .  i expect it   ll come tomorrow .  i   m fed up with running down there every week in case shawn gets there first .         you are king .  you could tell him not to .         don   t like to  really .  he   s so keen .      a large log crackled into two across the iron dogs .      can you really get books about   that .         you can get books about anything .      they both stared at the fire .  verence thought  she doesn   t like being a queen  i can see that  but that   s what you are when you marry a king  all the books say so     and magrat thought  he was much nicer when he was a man with silver bells on his hat and slept every night on the floor in front of his master   s door .  i could talk to him then     verence clapped his hands together .      well  that   s about it  then .  busy day tomorrow  what with all the guests coming and everything .         yes .  it   s going to be a long day .         very nearly the longest day .  haha .         yes .         i expect they   ve put warming pans in our beds .         has shawn got the hang of it now .         i hope so .  i can   t afford any more mattresses .      it was a great hall .  shadows piled up in the corners  clustered at either end .      i suppose     said magrat  very slowly  as they stared at the fire     they haven   t really had many books here in lancre .  up until now .         literacy is a great thing .         they got along without them  i suppose .         yes  but not properly .  their husbandry is really very primitive .      magrat looked at the fire .  their wifery wasn   t up to much either  she thought .      so we   d better be off to bed  then  do you think .         i suppose so .      verence took down two silver candlesticks  and lit the candles with a taper .  he handed one to magrat .      goodnight  then .         goodnight .      they kissed  and turned away  and headed for their own rooms .   the sheets on magrat   s bed were just beginning to turn brown .  she pulled out the warming pan and dropped it out of the window .   she glared at the garderobe .   magrat was probably the only person in lancre who worried about things being biodegradable .  everyone else just hoped things would last and knew that damn near everything went rotten if you left it long enough .   at home   correction  at the cottage where she used to live   there had been a privy at the bottom of the garden .   she   d approved of it .  with a regular bucket of ashes and a copy of last year   s almanack on a nail and a bunch of grapes cutout on the door it functioned quite effectively .  about once every few months she   d have to dig a big hole and get someone to help her move the shed itself .   the garderobe was this  a sort of small roofed in room inside the wall  with a wooden seat positioned over a large square hole that went down all the way to the foot of the castle wall far below  where there was an opening from which biodegradability took place once a week by means of an organo dynamic process known as shawn ogg and his wheelbarrow .  that much magrat understood .  it kind of fitted in with the whole idea of royalty and commonality .  what shocked her were the hooks .   they were for storing clothes in the garderobe .  millie had explained that the more expensive furs and things were hung there .  moths were kept away by the draught from the hole and   the smell .    magrat had put her foot down about that  at least .   now she lay in bed and stared at the ceiling .   of course she wanted to marry verence  even with his weak chin and slightly runny eyes .  in the pit of the night magrat knew that she was in no position to be choosy  and getting a king in the circumstances was a stroke of luck .   it was just that she had preferred him when he   d been a fool .  there   s something about a man who tinkles gently as he moves .   it was just that she could see a future of bad tapestry and sitting looking wistfully out of the window .   it was just that she was fed up with books of etiquette and lineage and twurp   s peerage of the fifteen mountains and the sto plains .   you had to know this kind of thing  to be a queen .  there were books full of the stuff in the long gallery  and she hadn   t even explored the far end .  how to address the third cousin of an earl .  what the pictures on shields meant  all those lions passant and regardant .  and the clothes weren   t getting any better .  magrat had drawn the line at a wimple  and she wasn   t at all happy about the big pointy hat with the scarf dangling from it .  it probably looked beautiful on the lady of shallot  but on magrat it looked as though someone had dropped a big ice cream on her neck .      nanny ogg sat in front of her fire in her dressing gown  smoking her pipe and idly cutting her toenails .  there was the occasional ping and ricochet from distant parts of the room  and a small tinkle as an oil lamp was smashed .      granny weatherwax lay on her bed  still and cold .  in her blue veined hands  the words  i ate   nt dead     her mind drifted across the forest  searching  searching     the trouble was  she could not go where there were no eyes to see or ears to hear .   so she never noticed the hollow near the stones  where eight men slept .   and dreamed        lancre is cut off from the rest of the lands of mankind by a bridge over lancre gorge  above the shallow but poisonously fast and treacherous lancre river .    the coach pulled up at the far end .   there was a badly painted red  black  and white post across the road .   the coachman sounded his horn .      what   s up .     said ridcully  leaning out of the window .      troll bridge .         whoops .      after a while there was a booming sound under the bridge  and a troll clambered over the parapet .  it was quite overdressed  for a troll .  in addition to the statutory loincloth  it was wearing a helmet .  admittedly it had been designed for a human head  and was attached to the much larger troll head by string  but there probably wasn   t a better word than    wearing .         what   s up .     said the bursar  waking up .      there   s a troll on the bridge     said ridcully     but it   s underneath a helmet  so it   s probably official and will get into serious trouble if it eats people .   nothing to worry about .      the bursar giggled  because he was on the upcurve of whatever switchback his mind was currently riding .   the troll appeared at the coach window .      afternoon  your lordships     it said .     customs inspection .         i don   t think we have any     babbled the bursar happily .     i mean  we used to have a tradition of rolling boiled eggs downhill on soul cake tuesday  but           i means     said the troll     do you have any beer  spirits  wines  liquors  hallucinogenic herbage  or books of a lewd or licentious nature .      ridcully pulled the bursar back from the window .      no     he said .      no .         no .         sure .         yes .         would you like some .         we haven   t even got     said the bursar  despite ridcully   s efforts to sit on his head     any billygoats .      there are some people that would whistle    yankee doodle    in a crowded bar in atlanta .   even these people would consider it tactless to mention the word    billygoat    to a troll .   the troll   s expression changed very slowly  like a glacier eroding half a mountain .  ponder tried to get under the seat .      so we   ll just trit trot along  shall we .     said the bursar  his voice by now slightly muffled .      he doesn   t mean it     said the archchancellor quickly .     it   s the dried frog talking .         you don   t want to eat me     said the bursar .     you want to eat my brother  he   s much mfmfph mfmfph           well  now     said the troll     seems to me that       he spotted casanunda .      oh ho     he said     dwarf smuggling  eh .         don   t be ridiculous  man     said ridcully     there   s no such thing as dwarf smuggling .         yeah .  then what   s that you   ve got there .         i   m a giant     said casanunda .      giants are a lot bigger .         i   ve been ill .      the troll looked perplexed .  this was post graduate thinking for a troll .  but he was looking for trouble .  he found it on the roof of the coach  where the librarian had been sunbathing .      what   s in that sack up there .         that   s not a sack .  that   s the librarian .      the troll prodded the large mass of red hair .      ook           what .  a monkey .         oook .      several minutes later  the travelers leaned on the parapet  looking down reflectively at the river far below .      happen often  does it .     said casanunda .      not so much these days     said ridcully .     it   s like   what   s that word  stibbons .  about breedin    and passin    on stuff to yer kids .         evolution     said ponder .  the ripples were still sloshing against the banks .      right .  like  my father had a waistcoat with embroidered peacocks on it  and he left it to me  and now i   ve got it .  they call it hereditarery           no  that   s not       ponder began  with no hope whatsoever that ridcully would listen .         so anyway  most people left back home know the difference between apes and monkeys now     said ridcully .     evolution  that is .  it   s hard to breed when you   ve got a headache from being bounced up and down on the pavement .      the ripples had stopped now .      do you think trolls can swim .     said casanunda .      no .  they just sink and walk ashore     said ridcully .  he turned  and leaned back on his elbows .     this really takes me back  you know .  the old lancre river .  there   s trout down there that   d take your arm off .         not just trout     said ponder  watching a helmet emerge from the water .      and limpid pools further up     said ridcully .     full of  of  of   limpids  stuff like that .  and you can bathe naked and no one   d see .  and water meadows full of   water  don   tyerknow  and flowers and stuff .     he sighed .     you know  it was on this very bridge that she told me she           he   s got out of the river     said ponder .  but the troll wasn   t moving very fast  because the librarian was nonchalantly levering one of the big stones out of the parapet .      on this very bridge i asked           that   s a big club he   s got     said casanunda .      this bridge  i may say  was where i nearly           could you stop holding that rock in such a provocative way .     said ponder .      oook .         it   d be a help .         the actual bridge  if anyone   s interested  is where my whole life took a diff           why don   t we just go on .     said ponder .     he   s got a steep climb .         good thing for him he hasn   t got up here  eh .     said casanunda .  ponder swiveled the librarian around and pushed him toward the coach .      this is the bridge  in fact  where        ridcully turned around .      are you coming or not .     said casanunda  with the reins in his hand .      i was actually having a quality moment of misty nostalgic remembrance     said ridcully .     not that any of you buggers noticed  of course .      ponder held the door open .      well  you know what they say .  you can   t cross the same river twice  archchancellor     he said .   ridcully stared at him .      why not .  this is a bridge .         on the roof of the coach the librarian picked up the coach horn  bit the end of it reflectively   well  you never knew   and then blew it so hard that it uncurled .   it was early morning in lancre town  and it was more or less deserted .  farmers had got up hours before to curse and swear and throw a bucket at the cows and had then gone back to bed .   the sound of the horn bounced off the houses .   ridcully leapt out of the coach and took a deep  theatrical breath .      can   t you smell that .     he said .     that   s real fresh mountain air  that is .     he thumped his chest .      i   ve just trodden in something rural     said ponder .     where is the castle  sir .         i think it could be that huge black towering thing looming over the town     said casanunda .   the archchancellor stood in the middle of the square and turned slowly with his arms spread wide .      see that tavern .     he said .     hah .  if i had a penny for every time they threw me out of there  i   d have   five dollars and thirty eight pence .  and over there is the old forge  and there   s mrs .  persifleur   s  where i had lodgings .  see that peak up there .  that   s copperhead  that is .  i climbed that one day with old carbonaceous the troll .  oh  great days  great days .  and see that wood down there  on the hill .  that   s where she        his voice trailed into a mumble .     oh  my word .  it all comes back to me   what a summer that was .  they don   t make    em like that anymore .     he sighed .     you know     he said     i   d give anything to walk through those woods with her again .  there were so many things we never   oh  well .  come on .      ponder looked around at lancre .  he   d been born and raised in ankh morpork .  as far as he was concerned  the countryside was something that happened to other people  and most of them had four legs .  as far as he was concerned  the countryside was like raw chaos before the universe  which was to say something with cobbles and walls  something civilized  was created .      this is the capital city .     he said .      more or less     said casanunda  who tended to feel the same way about places that weren   t paved .      i bet there   s not a single delicatessen anywhere     said ponder .      and the beer here     said ridcully     the beer here   well  you   d just better taste the beer here .  and there   s stuff called scumble  they make it from apples and   and damned if i know what else they put in it  except you daren   t pour it into metal mugs .  you ought to try it  mr .  stibbons .  it   d put hair on your chest .  and yours       he turned to the next one down from the coach  who turned out to be the librarian .      oook .         well  i  er  i should just drink anything you like  in your case     said ridcully .   he hauled the mail sack down from the roof .      what do we do with this .     he said .   there were ambling footsteps behind him  and he turned to see a short  red faced youth in ill fitting and baggy chain mail  which made him look like a lizard that had lost a lot of weight very quickly .      where   s the coach driver .     said shawn ogg .      he   s ill     said ridcully .     he had a sudden attack of bandits .  what do we do with the mail .         i take the palace stuff  and we generally leave the sack hanging up on a nail outside the tavern so that people can help themselves     said shawn .      isn   t that dangerous .     said ponder .      don   t think so .  it   s a strong nail     said shawn  rummaging in the sack .      i meant  don   t people steal letters .         oh  they wouldn   t do that  they wouldn   t do that .  one of the witches   d go and stare at    em if they did that .     shawn stuffed a few packages under his arm and hung the sack on the aforesaid nail .      yes  that   s another thing they used to have round here     said ridcully .     witches .  let me tell you about the witches round here           our mum   s a witch     said shawn conversationally  rummaging in the sack .      as fine a body of women as you could hope to meet     said ridcully  with barely a hint of mental gear clashing .     and not a bunch of interfering power mad old crones at all  whatever anyone might say .         are you here for the wedding .         that   s right .  i   m the archchancellor of unseen university  this is mr .  stibbons  a wizard  this   where are you .  oh  there you are   this is mr .  casanunda           count     said casanunda .     i   m a count .         really .  you never said .         well  you don   t  do you .  it   s not the first thing you say .      ridcully   s eyes narrowed .      but i thought dwarfs didn   t have titles     he said .      i performed a small service for queen agantia of skund     said casanunda .      did you .  my word .  how small .         not that small .         my word .  and that   s the bursar  and this is the librarian .     ridcully took a step backward  waved his hands in the air  and silently mouthed the words  don   t say monkey .      pleased to meet you     said shawn  politely .   ridcully felt moved to investigate .      the librarian     he repeated .      yes .  you said .     shawn nodded at the orang utan .     how d   you do .         ook .         you might be wondering why he looks like that     ridcully prompted .      no  sir .         no .         my mum says none of us can help how we   re made     said shawn .      what a singular lady .  and what is her name .     said ridcully .      mrs .  ogg  sir .         ogg .  ogg .  name rings a bell .  any relation to sobriety ogg .         he was my dad  sir .         good grief .  old sobriety   s son .  how is the old devil .         dunno  sir  what with him being dead .         oh dear .  how long ago .         these past thirty years     said shawn .      but you don   t look any older than twen       ponder began .  ridcully elbowed him sharply in the ribcage .      this is the countryside     he hissed .     people do things differently here .  and more often .     he turned back to shawn   s pink and helpful face .      things seem to be waking up a bit     he said  and indeed shutters were coming down around the square .     we   ll get some breakfast in the tavern .  they used to do wonderful breakfasts .     he sniffed again  and beamed .      now that     he said     is what i call fresh air .      shawn looked around carefully .      yes  sir     he said .     that   s what we call it  too .      there was the sound of someone frantically running  and then a pause  and king verence ii appeared around the corner  walking slowly and calmly with a very red face .      certainly gives people a rosy complexion     said ridcully cheerfully .      it   s the king .     hissed shawn .     and me without my trumpet .         um     said verence .     post been yet  shawn .         oh  yes  sire .     said shawn  almost as flustered as the king .     got it right here .  don   t you worry about it .  i   ll open it all up and have it on your desk right away  sire .         um           something the matter  sire .         um   i think perhaps        shawn was already tearing at the wrappers .      here   s that book on etiquette you   ve been waiting for  sire  and the pig stockbook  and   what   s this one    .      verence made a grab for it .  shawn automatically tried to hang on to it .  the wrapping split  and the large bulky book thumped on to the cobbles .  its fluttering pages played their woodcuts to the breeze .   they looked down .      wow .     said shawn .      my word     said ridcully .      um     said the king .      oook .      shawn picked up the book very  very carefully  and turned a few pages .      hey  look at this one .  he   s doing it with his feet .  i didn   t know you could do it with your feet .     he nudged ponder stibbons .     look  sir .      ridcully peered at the king .      you all right  your majesty .     he said .   verence squirmed .      um           and  look  here   s one where both chaps are doing it with sticks           what .     said verence .      wow     said shawn .     thank you  sire .  this is going to really come in handy  i can tell you .  i mean  i   ve picked up bits and pieces here and there  but        verence snatched the book from shawn   s hands and looked at the title page .         martial arts    .  martial arts .  but i   m sure i wrote marit           sire .      there was one exquisite moment while verence fought for mental balance  but he won .      ah .  yes .  right .  uh .  well  yes .  uh .  of course .  yes .  well  you see  a well trained army is   is essential to the security of any kingdom .  that   s right .  yes .  fine .  magrat and me  we thought   yes .  it   s for you  shawn .         i   ll start practicing right away  sire .         um .  good .         jason ogg awoke  and wished he hadn   t .   let   s be clear .  many authorities have tried to describe a hangover .  dancing elephants and so on are often employed for this purpose .  the descriptions never work .  they always smack of  hoho  here   s one for the lads  let   s have some hangover machismo  hoho  landlord  another nineteen pints of lager  hey  we supped some stuff last night  hoho     anyway  you can   t describe a scumble hangover .  the best bit of it is a feeling that your teeth have dissolved and coated themselves on your tongue .   eventually the blacksmith sat up and opened his eyes .    his clothes were soaked with dew .   his head felt full of wisps and whispers .   he stared at the stones .   the scumble jar was lying in the leather .  after a moment or two he picked it up  and took an experimental swig .  it was empty .   he nudged weaver in the ribs with his boot .      wake up  you old bugger .  we   ve been up here all night .      one by one  the morris men made the short but painful journey into consciousness .      i   m going to get some stick from our eva when i get home     moaned carter .      you might not     said thatcher  who was on his hands and knees looking for his hat .     maybe when you gets    ome she   ll have married someone else  eh .         maybe a hundred years   ll have gone past     said carter  hopefully .      cor  i hope so     said weaver  brightening up .     i had sevenpence invested in the thrift bank down in ohulan .  i   ll be a millionaire at complicated interest .  i   ll be as rich as creosote .         who   s creosote .     said thatcher .      famous rich bugger     said baker  fishing one of his boots out of a peat pool .     foreign .         wasn   t he the one  everything he touched turned to gold .     said carter .      nah  that was someone else .  some king or other .  that   s what happens in foreign parts .  one minute you   re all right  next minute  everything you touch turns to gold .  he was plagued with it .      carter looked puzzled .      how did he manage when he had to           let that be a lesson to you  young carter     said baker .     you stay here where folks are sensible  not go gadding off abroad where you might suddenly be holding a fortune in your hands and not have anything to spend it on .         we   ve slept out here all night     said jason uncertainly .     that   s dangerous  that is .         you   re right there  mr .  ogg     said carter .     i think something went to the toilet in my ear .         i mean strange things can enter your head .         that   s what i mean  too .      jason blinked .  he was certain he   d dreamed .  he could remember dreaming .  but he couldn   t remember what the dream had been about .  but there was still the feeling in his head of voices talking to him  but too far away to be heard .      oh  well     he said  managing to stand up at the third attempt     probably no harm done .  let   s get on home and see what century it is .         what century is it  anyway .     said thatcher .      century of the fruitbat  isn   t it .     said baker .      might not be anymore     said carter hopefully .   it turned out that it was  indeed  the century of the fruitbat .  lancre didn   t have much use for units of time any smaller than an hour or larger than a year  but people were clearly putting up bunting in the town square and a gang of men were erecting the maypole .  someone was nailing up a very badly painted picture of verence and magrat under which was the slogan  god bles their majestieys .   with hardly a word exchanged  the men parted and staggered their separate ways .      a hare lolloped through the morning mist until it reached the drunken  ancient cottage in its clearing in the woods .   it reached a tree stump between the privy and the herbs .  most woodland animals avoided the herbs .  this was because animals that didn   t avoid the herbs over the past fifty years had tended not to have descendants .  a few tendrils waved in the breeze and this was odd because there wasn   t any breeze .   it sat on the stump .   and then there was a sensation of movement .  something left the hare and moved across the air to an open upstairs window .  it was invisible  at least to normal eyesight .   the hare changed .  before  it had moved with purpose .  now it flopped down and began to wash its ears .   after a while the back door opened and granny weatherwax walked out stiffly  holding a bowl of bread and milk .  she put it down on the step and turned back without a second glance  closing the door again behind her .   the hare hopped closer .   it   s hard to know if animals understand obligations  or the nature of transactions .  but that doesn   t matter .  they   re built into witchcraft .  if you want to really upset a witch  do her a favor which she has no means of repaying .  the unfulfilled obligation will nag at her like a hangnail .   granny weatherwax had been riding the hare   s mind all night .  now she owed it something .  there   d be bread and milk left outside for a few days .   you had to repay  good or bad .  there was more than one type of obligation .  that   s what people never really understood  she told herself as she stepped back into the kitchen .  magrat hadn   t understood it  nor that new girl .  things had to balance .  you couldn   t set out to be a good witch or a bad witch .  it never worked for long .  all you could try to be was a witch  as hard as you could .   she sat down by the cold hearth  and resisted a temptation to comb her ears .   they had broken in somewhere .  she could feel it in the trees  in the minds of tiny animals .  she was planning something .  something soon .  there was of course nothing special about midsummer in the occult sense  but there was in the minds of people .  and the minds of people was where elves were strong .   granny knew that sooner or later she   d have to face the queen .  not magrat  but the real queen .   and she would lose .   she   d worked all her life on controlling the insides of her own head .  she   d prided herself on being the best there was .   but no longer .  just when she needed all her self reliance  she couldn   t rely on her mind .  she could sense the probing of the queen   she could remember the feel of that mind  from all those decades ago .  and she seemed to have her usual skill at borrowing .  but herself   if she didn   t leave little notes for herself  she   d be totally at sea .  being a witch meant knowing exactly who you were and where you were  and she was losing the ability to know both .  last night she   d found herself setting the table for two people .  she   d tried to walk into a room she didn   t have .  and soon she   d have to fight an elf .   if you fought an elf and lost   then  if you were lucky  you would die .      magrat was brought breakfast in bed by a giggling millie chillum .      guests are arriving already  ma   am .  and there   s flags and everything down in the square .  and shawn has found the coronation coach .         how can you lose a coach .     said magrat .      it was locked up in one of the old stables  ma   am .  he   s giving it a fresh coat of gold paint right now .         but we   re going to be married here     said magrat .     we don   t have to go anywhere .         the king said perhaps you could both ride around a bit .  maybe as far as bad ass  he said .  with shawn ogg as a military escort .  so people can wave and shout hooray .  and then come back here .      magrat put on her dressing gown and crossed to the tower window .  she could see down over the outer walls and into lancre town square  which was already quite full of people .  it would have been a market day in any case  but people were erecting benches as well and the maypole was already up .  there were even a few dwarfs and trolls  politely maintaining a distance from one another .      i just saw a monkey walk across the square     said magrat .      the whole world   s coming to lancre .     said millie  who had once been as far as slice .   magrat caught sight of the distant picture of herself and her fianc   .      this is stupid     she said to herself  but millie heard her and was shocked .      what can you mean  ma   am .      magrat spun around .      all this .  for me .      millie backed away in sudden fright .      i   m just magrat garlick .  kings ought to marry princesses and duchesses and people like that .  people who are used to it .  i don   t want people shouting hooray just because i   ve gone by in a coach .  and especially not people who   ve known me all my life .  all this   this     her frantic gesture took in the hated garderobe  the huge four poster bed  and the dressing room full of stiff and expensive clothes     this stuff   it   s not for me .  it   s for some kind of idea .  didn   t you ever get those cutouts  those dolls  you know  when you were a girl   dolls you cutout  and there were cut out clothes as well .  and you could make her anything you wanted .  that   s me .  it   s   it   s like the bees .  i   m being turned into a queen whether i want to or not .  that   s what   s happening to me .         i   m sure the king bought you all those nice clothes because           i don   t mean just clothes .  i mean people   d be shouting hooray if   if anyone went past in the coach .         but you were the one who fell in love with the king  ma   am     said millie  bravely .   magrat hesitated for a moment .  she   d never quite analyzed that emotion .  eventually she said     no .  he wasn   t king then .  no one knew he was going to be king .  he was just a sad  nice little man in a cap and bells who everyone ignored .      millie backed away a bit more .      i expect it   s nerves  ma   am     she gabbled .     everyone feels nervous on the day before their wedding .  shall i   shall i see if i can make you some herbal           i   m not nervous .  and i can do my own herbal tea if i happen to want any .         cook   s very particular who goes into the herb garden  ma   am     said millie .      i   ve seen that herb garden .  it   s all leggy sage and yellowy parsley .  if you can   t stuff it up a chicken   s bum  she doesn   t think it   s an herb .  anyway   who   s queen in this vicinity .         i thought you didn   t want to be  ma   am .     said millie .   magrat stared at her .  for a moment she looked as if she was arguing with herself .   millie might not have been the best informed girl in the world  but she wasn   t stupid .  she was at the door and through it just as the breakfast tray hit the wall .      magrat sat down on the bed with her head in her hands .   she didn   t want to be queen .  being a queen was like being an actor  and magrat had never been any good at acting .  she   d always felt she wasn   t very good at being magrat  if it came to that .   the bustle of the pre nuptial activities rose up from the town .  there   d be folkdancing  of course   there seemed to be no way of preventing it   and probably folksinging would be perpetrated .  and there   d be dancing bears and comic jugglers and the greasy pole competition  which for some reason nanny ogg always won .  and bowling with a pig .  and the bran tub  which nanny ogg usually ran  it was a brave man who plunged his hand into a bran tub stocked by a witch with a broad sense of humor .  magrat had always liked the fairs .  up until now .   well  there were still some things she could do .   she dressed herself in her commoner   s clothes for the last time  and let herself out and down the back stairs to the widdershins tower and the room where diamanda lay .   magrat had instructed shawn to keep a good fire going in the grate  and diamanda was still sleeping  peacefully  the unwakeable sleep .   magrat couldn   t help noticing that diamanda was strikingly good looking and  from what she   d heard  quite brave enough to stand up to granny weatherwax .  she could hardly wait to get her better so that she could envy her properly .   the wound seemed to be healing up nicely  but there seemed to be     magrat strode to the bellpull in the corner and hauled on it .   after a minute or two shawn ogg arrived  panting .  there was gold paint on his hands .      what     said magrat     are all these things .         um .  don   t like to say  ma   am           one happens to be   very nearly   the queen     said magrat .      yes  but the king said   well  granny said           granny weatherwax does not happen to rule the kingdom     said magrat .  she hated herself when she spoke like this  but it seemed to work .     and anyway she   s not here .  one is here  however  and if you don   t tell one what   s going on i   ll see to it that you do all the dirty jobs around the palace .         but i do all the dirty jobs anyway     said shawn .      i shall see to it that there are dirtier ones .      magrat picked up one of the bundles .  it was made up of strips of sheet wrapped around what turned out to be an iron bar .      they   re all around her     she said .     why .      shawn looked at his feet .  there was gold paint on his boots  too .      well  our mum said           yes .         our mum said i was to see to it that there was iron round her .  so me and millie got some bars from down the smithy and wrapped    em up like this and millie packed    em round her .         why .         to keep away the   the lords and ladies  ma   am .         what .  that   s just old superstition .  anyway  everyone knows elves were good  whatever granny weatherwax says .      behind her  shawn flinched .  magrat pulled the wrapped iron lumps out of the bed and tossed them into the corner .      no old wives    tales here  thank you very much .  is there anything else people haven   t been telling me  by any chance .      shawn shook his head  guiltily aware of the thing in the dungeon .      huh .  well  go away .  verence wants the kingdom to be modern and efficient  and that means no horseshoes and stuff around the place .  go on  go away .         yes  miss queen .      at least i can do something positive around here  magrat told herself .   yes .  be sensible .  go and see him .  talk .  magrat clung to the idea that practically anything could be sorted out if only people talked to one another .      shawn .      he paused at the door .      yes  ma   am .         has the king gone down to the great hall yet .         i think he   s still dressing  miss queen .  he hasn   t rung for me to do the trumpet  i know that .      in fact  verence  who didn   t like going everywhere preceded by shawn   s idea of a fanfare  had already gone downstairs incognito .  but magrat slipped along to his room  and knocked on the door .   why be bashful .  it   d be her room as well from tomorrow  wouldn   t it .  she tried the handle .  it turned .  without quite willing it  magrat went in .   rooms in the castle could hardly be said to belong to anyone in any case .  they   d had too many occupants over the centuries .  the very atmosphere was the equivalent of those walls scattered with outbreaks of drawing pin holes where last term   s occupants hung the posters of rock groups long disbanded .  you couldn   t stamp your personality on that stone .  it stamped back harder .   for magrat  stepping into a man   s bedroom was like an explorer stepping on to that part of the map marked here be dragons .    and it wasn   t exactly what it ought to have been .   verence had arrived at the bedroom concept fairly late in life .  when he was a boy  the entire family slept on straw in the cottage attic .  as an apprentice in the guild of joculators  he   d slept on a pallet in a long dormitory of other sad  beaten young men .  when he was a fully fledged fool he   d slept  by tradition  curled up in front of his master   s door .  suddenly  at a later age than is usual  he   d been introduced to the notion of soft mattresses .   and now magrat was privy to the big secret .   it hadn   t worked .   there was the great bed of lancre  which was said to be able to sleep a dozen people  although in what circumstances and why it should be necessary history had never made clear .  it was huge and made of oak .   it was also  very clearly  unslept in .   magrat pulled back the sheets  and smelled the scorched smell of linen .  but it also smelled unaired  as if it hadn   t been slept in .   she stared around the room until her eye lit on the little still life by the door .  there was a folded nightshirt  a candlestick  and a small pillow .   as far as verence had been concerned  a crown merely changed which side of the door you slept .   oh  gods .  he   d always slept in front of the door of his master .  and now he was king  he slept in front of the door to his kingdom .   magrat felt her eyes fill with tears .   you couldn   t help loving someone as soppy as that .   fascinated  and aware that she was where she technically shouldn   t be  magrat blew her nose and explored further .  a heap of discarded garments by the bed suggested that verence had mastered the art of hanging up clothes as practiced by half the population of the world  and also that he had equally had difficulty with the complex topological maneuvers necessary to turn his socks the right way out .   there was a tiny dressing table and a mirror .  stuck to the mirror frame was a dried and faded flower that looked  to magrat  very like the ones she habitually wore in her hair .   she shouldn   t have gone on looking .  she admitted that to herself  afterward .  but she seemed to have no self control .   there was a wooden bowl in the middle of the dresser table  full of odd coins  bits of string  and the general detritus of the nightly emptied pocket .   and a folded paper .  much folded  as if it had stayed in said pocket for some time .   she picked it up  and unfolded it .      there were little kingdoms all over the hubward slopes of the ramtops .  every narrow valley  every ledge that something other than a goat could stand on  was a kingdom .  there were kingdoms in the ramtops so small that  if they were ravaged by a dragon  and that dragon had been killed by a young hero  and the king had given him half his kingdom as per section three of the heroic code  then there wouldn   t have been any kingdom left .  there were wars of annexation that went on for years just because someone wanted a place to keep the coal .   lancre was one of the biggest kingdoms .  it could actually afford a standing army .    kings and queens and various sub orders of aristocracy were even now streaming over lancre bridge  watched by a sulking and soaking wet troll who had given up on bridge keeping for the day .   the great hall had been thrown open .  jugglers and fire eaters strolled among the crowd .  up in the minstrels gallery a small orchestra was playing the lancre one string fiddle and famed ramtop bagpipes  but fortunately they were more or less drowned out by the noise of the crowd .   nanny ogg and granny weatherwax moved through said crowd .  in deference to this being a festive occasion  nanny ogg had exchanged her normal black pointy hat for one the same shape but in red  with wax cherries on it .      all the hort mond are here     nanny observed  taking a drink off a passing tray .     even some wizards from ankh morpork  our shawn said .  one of them said i had a fine body  he said .  been tryin    to remember all morning who that could have been .         spoiled for choice     said granny  but it was automatic nastiness  with no real heart to it .  it worried nanny ogg .  her friend seemed preoccupied .      there   s some gentry we don   t want to see here     said granny .     i won   t be happy until all this is over .      nanny ogg craned to try and see over the head of a small emperor .      can   t see magrat around     she said .     there   s verence talking to some other kings  but can   t see our magrat at all .  our shawn said millie chillum said she was just a bag of nerves this morning .         all these high born folks     said granny  looking around at the crowned heads .     i feel like a fish out of water .         well  the way i see it  it   s up to you to make your own water     said nanny  picking up a cold roast chicken leg from the buffet and stuffing it up a sleeve .      don   t drink too much .  we   ve got to keep alert  gytha .  remember what i said .  don   t let yourself get distracted           that   s never the delectable mrs .  ogg  is it .      nanny turned .   there was no one behind her .      down here     said the voice .   she looked down  into a wide grin .      oh  blast     she said .      it   s me  casanunda     said casanunda  who was dwarfed still further by an enormous  powdered wig .     you remember .  we danced the night away in genua .         no we didn   t .         well  we could have done .         fancy you turning up here     said nanny  weakly .  the thing about casanunda  she recalled  was that the harder you slapped him down the faster he bounced back  often in an unexpected direction .      our stars are entwined     said casanunda .     we   re fated for one another .  i wants your body  mrs .  ogg .         i   m still using it .      and while she suspected  quite accurately  that this was an approach the world   s second greatest lover used on anything that appeared to be even vaguely female  nanny ogg had to admit that she was flattered .  she   d had many admirers in her younger days  but time had left her with a body that could only be called comfortable and a face like mr .  grape the happy raisin .  long banked fires gave off a little smoke .   besides  she   d rather liked casanunda .  most men were oblique in their approach  whereas his direct attack was refreshing .      it   d never work     she said .     we   re basically incompatible .  when i   m       you   ll still only be       .  anyway  i   m old enough to be your mother .         you can   t be .  my mother   s nearly      and she   s got a better beard than you .      and of course that was another point .  by dwarf standards  nanny ogg was hardly more than a teenager .      la  sir     she said  giving him a playful tap that made his ears ring     you do know how to turn a simple country girl   s head and no mistake .      casanunda picked himself up and adjusted his wig happily .      i like a girl with spirit     he said .     how about you and me having a little t  te    t  te when this is over .      nanny ogg   s face went blank .  her cosmopolitan grip of language had momentarily let her down .      excuse me a minute     she said .  she put her drink down on his head and pushed through the crowd until she found a likely looking duchess  and prodded her in the bustle regions .      hey  your grace  what   s a tater tate .         i beg your pardon .         a tater tate .  do you do it with your clothes on or what .         it means an intimate meeting  my good woman .         is that all .  oh .  ta .      nanny ogg elbowed her way back to the vibrating dwarf .      you   re on     she said .      i thought we could have a little private dinner  just you and me     said casanunda .     in one of the taverns .      never  in a long history of romance  had nanny ogg ever been taken out for an intimate dinner .  her courtships had been more noted for their quantity than their quality .      ok     was all she could think of to say .      dodge your chaperone and meet me at six o   clock .      nanny ogg glanced at granny weatherwax  who was watching them disapprovingly from a distance .      she   s not my       she began .   then it dawned on her that casanunda couldn   t possibly have really thought that granny weatherwax was chaperoning her .   compliments and flattery had also been very minor components in the machinery of nanny ogg   s courtships .      yes  all right     she said .      and now i shall circulate  so that people don   t talk and ruin your reputation     said casanunda  bowing and kissing nanny ogg   s hand .   her mouth dropped open .  no one had ever kissed her hand before  either  and certainly no one had ever worried about her reputation  least of all nanny ogg .   as the world   s second greatest lover bustled off to accost a countess  granny weatherwax   who had been watching from a discreet distance     said  in an amiable voice     you haven   t got the morals of a cat  gytha ogg .         now  esme  you know that   s not true .         all right .  you have got the morals of a cat  then .         that   s better .      nanny ogg patted her mass of white curls and wondered if she had time to go home and put her corsets on .      we must stay on our guard  gytha .         yes  yes .         can   t let other considerations turn our heads .         no  no .         you   re not listening to a word i say  are you .         what .         you could at least find out why magrat isn   t down here .         all right .      nanny ogg wandered off  dreamily .   granny weatherwax turned        there should have been violins .  the murmur of the crowd should have faded away  and the crowd itself should have parted in a quite natural movement to leave an empty path between her and ridcully .   there should have been violins .  there should have been something .   there shouldn   t have been the librarian accidentally knuckling her on the toe on his way to the buffet  but this  in fact  there was .   she hardly noticed .      esme .     said ridcully .      mustrum .     said granny weatherwax .   nanny ogg bustled up .      esme  i saw millie chillum and she said        granny weatherwax   s vicious elbow jab winded her .  nanny took in the scene .      ah     she said     i   ll just  i   ll just   i   ll just go away  then .      the gazes locked again .   the librarian knuckled past again with an entire display of fruit .   granny weatherwax paid him no heed .   the bursar  who was currently on the median point of his cycle  tapped ridcully on the shoulder .      i say  archchancellor  these quails    eggs are amazingly go           drop dead .  mr .  stibbons  fish out the frog pills and keep knives away from him  please .      the gazes locked again .      well  well     said granny  after a year or so .      this must be some enchanted evening     said ridcully .      yes .  that   s what i   m afraid of .         that really is you  isn   t it .         it   s really me     said granny .      you haven   t changed a bit  esme .         nor have you  then .  you   re still a rotten liar  mustrum ridcully .      they walked toward one another .  the librarian shuttled between them with a tray of meringues .  behind them  ponder stibbons groveled on the floor for a spilled bottle of dried frog pills .      well  well     said ridcully .      fancy that .         small world .         yes indeed .         you   re you and i   m me .  amazing .  and it   s here and now .         yes  but then was then .         i sent you a lot of letters     said ridcully .      never got    em .      there was a glint in ridcully   s eye .      that   s odd .  and there was me putting all those destination spells on them too     he said .  he gave her a critical up and down glance .     how much do you weigh  esme .  not a spare ounce on you  i   ll be bound .         what do you want to know for .         indulge an old man .         nine stones  then .         hmm   should be about right   three miles hubward   you   ll feel a slight lurch to the left  nothing to worry about        in a lightning movement  he grabbed her hand .  he felt young and light headed .  the wizards back at the university would have been astonished .      let me take you away from all this .      he snapped his fingers .   there has to be at least an approximate conservation of mass .  it   s a fundamental magical rule .  if something is moved from a to b  something that was at b has got to find itself at a .   and then there   s momentum .  slow as the disc spins  various points of its radii are moving at different speeds relative to the hub  and a wizard projecting himself any distance toward the rim had better be prepared to land jogging .   the three miles to lancre bridge merely involved a faint tug  which ridcully had been ready for  and he landed up leaning against the parapet with esme weatherwax in his arms .   the customs troll who had until a fraction of a second previously been sitting there ended up lying full length on the floor of the great hall  coincidentally on top of the bursar .   granny weatherwax looked over at the rushing water  and then at ridcully .      take me back this instant     she said .     you   ve got no right to do that .         dear me  i seem to have run out of power .  can   t understand it  very embarrassing  fingers gone all limp     said ridcully .     of course  we could walk .  it   s a lovely evening .  you always did get lovely evenings here .         it was all fifty or sixty years ago .     said granny .     you can   t suddenly turn up and say all those years haven   t happened .         oh  i know they   ve happened all right     said ridcully .     i   m the head wizard now .  i   ve only got to give an order and a thousand wizards will   uh   disobey  come to think of it  or say    what .      or start to argue .  but they have to take notice .         i   ve been to that university a few times     said granny .     a bunch of fat old men in beards .         that   s right .  that   s them .         a lot of    em come from the ramtops     said granny .     i knew a few boys from lancre who became wizards .         very magical area     ridcully agreed .     something in the air .      below them  the cold black waters raced  always dancing to gravity  never flowing uphill .      there was even a weatherwax as archchancellor  years ago     said ridcully .      so i understand .  distant cousin .  never knew him     said granny .   they both stared down at the river for a moment .  occasionally a twig or a branch would whirl along in the current .      do you remember           i have a   very good memory  thank you .         do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you   d said yes .     said ridcully .      no .         i suppose we   d have settled down  had children  grandchildren  that sort of thing        granny shrugged .  it was the sort of thing romantic idiots said .  but there was something in the air tonight        what about the fire .     she said .      what fire .         swept through our house just after we were married .  killed us both .         what fire .  i don   t know anything about any fire .      granny turned around .      of course not .  it didn   t happen .  but the point is  it might have happened .  you can   t say    if this didn   t happen then that would have happened    because you don   t know everything that might have happened .  you might think something   d be good  but for all you know it could have turned out horrible .  you can   t say    if only i   d       because you could be wishing for anything .  the point is  you   ll never know .  you   ve gone past .  so there   s no use thinking about it .  so i don   t .         the trousers of time     said ridcully  moodily .  he picked a fragment off the crumbling stonework and dropped it into the water .  it went plunk  as is so often the case .      what .         that   s the sort of thing they go on about in the high energy magic building .  and they call themselves wizards .  you should hear them talk .  the buggers wouldn   t know a magic sword if it bit them on the knee .  that   s young wizards today .  think they bloody invented magic .         yes .  you should see the girls that want to be witches these days     said granny weatherwax .     velvet hats and black lipstick and lacy gloves with no fingers to    em .  cheeky  too .      they were side by side now  watching the river .      trousers of time     said ridcully .     one of you goes down one leg  one of you goes down the other .  and there   s all these continuinuinuums all over the place .  when i was a lad there was just one decent universe and this was it  and all you had to worry about was creatures breaking through from the dungeon dimensions  but at least there was this actual damn universe and you knew where you stood .  now it turns out there   s millions of the damn things .  and there   s this damn cat they   ve discovered that you can put in a box and it   s dead and alive at the same time .  or something .  and they all run around saying marvelous  marvelous  hooray  here comes another quantum .  ask    em to do a decent levitation spell and they look at you as if you   ve started to dribble .  you should hear young stibbons talk .  went on about me not inviting me to my own wedding .  me .      from the side of the gorge a kingfisher flashed  hit the water with barely a ripple  and ricocheted away with something silver and wriggly in its beak .      kept going on about everything happening at the same time     ridcully went on morosely .     like there   s no such thing as a choice .  you just decide which leg you   re heading for .  he says that we did get married  see .  he says all the things that might have been have to be .  so there   s thousands of me out there who never became a wizard  just like there   s thousands of you who  oh  answered letters .  hah .  to them  we   re something that might have been .  now  d   you call that proper thinking for a growing lad .  when i started wizarding  old    tudgy    spold was archchancellor  and if any young wizard   d even mentioned that sort of daft thing  he   d feel a staff across his backside .  hah .      somewhere far below  a frog plopped off a stone .      mind you  i suppose we   ve all passed a lot of water since then .      it dawned gently on ridcully that the dialogue had become a monologue .  he turned to granny  who was staring round eyed at the river as if she   d never seen water before .      stupid  stupid  stupid     she said .      i beg your pardon .  i was only           not you .  i wasn   t talking to you .  stupid .  i   ve been stupid .  but i ain   t been daft .  hah .  and i thought it was my memory going .  and it was  too .  it was going and fetching .         what .         i was getting scared .  me .  and not thinking clear .  except i was thinking clear .         what .         never mind .  well  i won   t say this hasn   t been   nice     said granny .     but i   ve got to get back .  do the thing with the fingers again .  and hurry .      ridcully deflated a little .      can   t     he said .      you did it just now .         that   s the point .  i wasn   t joking when i said i couldn   t do it again .  it takes a lot out of you  transmigration .         you used to be able to do it all the time  as i recall     said granny .  she risked a smile .     our feet hardly touched the ground .         i was younger then .  now  once is enough .      granny   s boots creaked as she turned and started to walk quickly back toward the town .  ridcully lumbered after her .      what   s the hurry .         got important things to do     said granny  without turning around .     been letting everyone down .         some people might say this is important .         no .  it   s just personal .  personal   s not the same as important .  people just think it is .         you   re doing it again .         what .         i don   t know what the other future would have been like     said ridcully     but i for one would have liked to give it a try .      granny paused .  her mind was crackling with relief .  should she tell him about the memories .  she opened her mouth to do so  and then thought again .  no .  he   d get soppy .      i   d have been crabby and bad tempered     she said  instead .      that goes without saying .         hah .  and what about you .  i   d have put up with all your womanizing and drunkenness  would i .      ridcully looked bewildered .      what womanizing .         we   re talking about what might have been .         but i   m a wizard .  we hardly ever womanize .  there   s laws about it .  well   rules .  guidelines  anyway .         but you wouldn   t have been a wizard then .         and i   m hardly ever drunk .         you would have been if you   d been wedded to me .      he caught up with her .      even young ponder doesn   t think like this     he said .     you   ve made up your mind that it would have been dreadful  have you .         yes .         why .         why   d you think .         i asked you .         i   m too busy for this     said granny .     like i said  personal ain   t the same as important .  make yourself useful  mr .  wizard .  you know it   s circle time  don   t you .      ridcully   s hand touched the brim of his hat .      oh  yes .         and you know what that means .         they tell me it means that the walls between realities get weaker .  the circles are   what   s the word stibbons uses .  isoresons .  they connect levels of  oh  something daft   similar levels of reality .  which is bloody stupid .  you   d be able to walk from one universe to another .         ever tried it .         no .         a circle is a door half open .  it doesn   t need much to open it up all the way .  even belief   ll do it .  that   s why they put the dancers up  years ago .  we got the dwarfs to do it .  thunderbolt iron  those stones .  there   s something special about    em .  they   ve got the love of iron .  don   t ask me how it works .  elves hate it even more than ordinary iron .  it   upsets their senses  or something .  but minds can get through           elves .  everyone knows elves don   t exist anymore .  not proper elves .  i mean  there   s a few folk who say they   re elves           oh  yeah .  elvish ancestry .  elves and humans breed all right  as if that   s anything to be proud of .  but you just get a race o   skinny types with pointy ears and a tendency to giggle and burn easily in sunshine .  i ain   t talking about them .  there   s no harm in them .  i   m talking about real wild elves  what we ain   t seen here for        the road from the bridge to the town curved between high banks  with the forest crowding in on either side and in places even meeting overhead .  thick ferns  already curling like green breakers  lined the clay banks .   they rustled .   the unicorn leapt on the road .      thousands of universes  twisting together like a rope being plaited from threads     there   s bound to be leakages  a sort of mental equivalent of the channel breakthrough on a cheap hi fi that gets you the news in swedish during quiet bits in the music .  especially if you   ve spent your life using your mind as a receiver .   picking up the thoughts of another human being is very hard  because no two minds are on the same  er  wavelength .   but somewhere out there  at the point where the parallel universes tangle  are a million minds just like yours .  for a very obvious reason .   granny weatherwax smiled .      millie chillum and the king and one or two hangers on were clustered around the door to magrat   s room when nanny ogg arrived .      what   s happening .         i know she   s in there     said verence  holding his crown in his hands in the famous ai se  or mexican bandits have raided our village position .     millie heard her shout go away and i think she threw something at the door .      nanny ogg nodded sagely .      wedding nerves     she said .     bound to happen .         but we   re all going to attend the entertainment     said verence .     she really ought to attend the entertainment .         well  i dunno     said nanny .     seeing our jason and the rest of    em prancing about in straw wigs   i mean  they mean well  but it   s not something a young   a fairly young   girl has to see on the night before her nuptials .  you asked her to unlock the door .         i did better than that     said verence .     i instructed her to .  that was right  wasn   t it .  if even magrat won   t obey me  i   m a poor lookout as king .         ah     said nanny  after a moment   s slow consideration .     you   ve not entirely spent a lot of time in female company  have you .  in a generalized sort of way .         well  i        the crown spun in verence   s nervous fingers .  not only had the bandits invaded the village  but the magnificent seven had decided to go bowling instead .      tell you what     said nanny  patting him on the back     you go and preside over the entertainment and hobnob with the other nobs .  i   ll see to magrat  don   t you worry .  i   ve been a bride three times  and that   s only the official score .         yes  but she should           i think if we go easy on the    shoulds        said nanny     we might all make it to the wedding .  now  off you all go .         someone ought to stay here     said verence .     shawn will be on guard  but           no one   s going to invade  are they .     said nanny .     let me sort this out .         well   if you   re sure           go on .      nanny ogg waited until she heard them go down the main staircase .  after a while a rattle of coaches and general shouting suggested that the wedding party was leaving  minus the bride to be .   she counted to a hundred  under her breath .   then      magrat .         go away .         i know how it is     said nanny .     i was a bit worried on the night before my wedding .     she refrained from adding  because there was a reasonable chance jason would turn up as an extra guest .      i am not worried .  i am angry .         why .         you know .      nanny took off her hat and scratched her head .      you   ve got me there     she said .      and he knew .  i know he knew  and i know who told him     said the muffled voice behind the door .     it was all arranged .  you must all have been laughing .      nanny frowned at the impassive woodwork .      nope     she said .     still all at sea this end .         well  i   m not saying any more .         everyone   s gone to the entertainment     said nanny ogg .  no reply .      and later they   ll be back .      a further absence of dialogue .      then there   ll be carousing and jugglers and fellas that put weasels down their trousers     said nanny .   silence .      and then it   ll be tomorrow  and then what   re you going to do .      silence .      you can always go back to your cottage .  no one   s moved in .  or you can stop along of me  if you like .  but you   ll have to decide  d   you see  because you can   t stay locked in there .      nanny leaned against the wall .      i remember years ago my granny telling me about queen amonia  well  i say queen  but she never was queen except for about three hours because of what i   m about to unfold  on account of them playing hide and seek at the wedding party and her hiding in a big heavy old chest in some attic and the lid slamming shut and no one finding her for seven months  by which time you could definitely say the wedding cake was getting a bit stale .      silence .      well  if you ain   t telling me  i can   t hang around all night     said nanny .     it   ll all be better in the morning  you   ll see .      silence .      why don   t you have an early night .     said nanny .     our shawn   ll do you a hot drink if you ring down .  it   s a bit nippy out here  to tell you the truth .  it   s amazing how these old stone places hang on to the chill .      silence .      so i   ll be off then  shall i .     said nanny  to the unyielding silence .     not doing much good here  i can see that .  sure you don   t want to talk .      silence .      stand before your god  bow before your king  and kneel before your man .  recipe for a happy life  that is     said nanny  to the world in general .     well  i   m going away now .  tell you what  i   ll come back early tomorrow  help you get ready  that sort of thing .  how about it .      silence .      so that   s all sorted out then     said nanny .     cheerio .      she waited a full minute .  by rights  by the human mechanics of situations like this  the bolts should have been drawn back and magrat should have peeped out into the corridor  or possibly even called out to her .  she did not .   nanny shook her head .  she could think of at least three ways of getting into the room  and only one of them involved going through the door .  but there was a time and a place for witchcraft  and this wasn   t it .  nanny ogg had led a long and generally happy life by knowing when not to be a witch  and this was one of those times .   she went down the stairs and out of the castle .  shawn was standing guard at the main gate  surreptitiously practicing karate chops on the evening air .  he stopped and looked embarrassed as nanny ogg approached .      wish i was going to the entertainment  mum .         i daresay the king will be very generous to you come payday on account of your duty     said nanny ogg .     remind me to remind him .         aren   t you going .         well  i   m   i   m just going for a stroll into town     said nanny .     i expect esme went with    em  did she .         couldn   t say  mum .         just a few things i got to do .      she hadn   t gone much further before a voice behind her said     ello  oh moon of my delight .         you do sneak up on people  casanunda .         i   ve arranged for us to have dinner at the goat and bush     said the dwarf count .      ooo  that   s a horrible expensive place     said nanny ogg .     never eaten there .         they   ve got some special provisions in  what with the wedding and all the gentry here     said casanunda .     i   ve made special arrangements .         these had been quite difficult .   food as an aphrodisiac was not a concept that had ever caught on in lancre  apart from nanny ogg   s famous carrot and oyster pie .   as far as the cook at the goat and bush was concerned  food and sex were only linked in certain humorous gestures involving things like cucumbers .  he   d never heard of chocolate  banana skins  avocado and ginger  marshmallow  and the thousand other foods people had occasionally employed to drive an a to b freeway through the rambling pathways of romance .  casanunda had spent a busy ten minutes sketching out a detailed menu  and quite a lot of money had changed hands .   he   d arranged a careful romantic candlelit supper .  casanunda had always believed in the art of seduction .   many tall women accessible by stepladder across the continent had reflected how odd it was that the dwarfs  a race to whom the aforesaid art of seduction consisted in the main part of tactfully finding out what sex  underneath all that leather and chain mail  another dwarf was  had generated someone like casanunda .   it was as if eskimos had produced a natural expert in the care and attention of rare tropical plants .  the great pent up waters of dwarfish sexuality had found a leak at the bottom of the dam   small  but with enough power to drive a dynamo .   everything that his fellow dwarfs did very occasionally as nature demanded he did all the time  sometimes in the back of a sedan chair and once upside down in a tree   but  and this is important  with care and attention to detail that was typically dwarfish .  dwarfs would spend months working on an exquisite piece of jewelry  and for broadly similar reasons casanunda was a popular visitor to many courts and palaces  for some strange reason generally while the local lord was away .  he also had a dwarfish ability with locks  always a useful talent for those awkward moments sur la boudoir .   and nanny ogg was an attractive lady  which is not the same as being beautiful .  she fascinated casanunda .  she was an incredibly comfortable person to be around  partly because she had a mind so broad it could accommodate three football fields and a bowling alley .         i wish i had my crossbow     muttered ridcully .     with that head on my wall i   d always have a place to hang my hat .      the unicorn tossed its head and pawed the ground .  steam rose from its flanks .      i ain   t sure that would work     said granny .     you sure you   ve got no whoosh left in them fingers of yours .         i could create an illusion     said the wizard .     that   s not hard .         it wouldn   t work .  the unicorn is an elvish creature .  magic don   t work on    em .  they see through illusions .  they ought to  they   re good enough at    em .  how about the bank .  reckon you could scramble up it .      they both glanced at the banks .  they were red clay  slippery as priests .      let   s walk backward     said granny .     slowly .         how about its mind .  can you get in .         there   s someone in there already .  the poor thing   s her pet .  it obeys only her .      the unicorn walked after them  trying to watch both of them at the same time .      what shall we do when we come to the bridge .         you can still swim  can   t you .         the river   s a long way down .         but there   s a deep pool there .  don   t you remember .  you dived in there once .  one moonlit night           i was young and foolish then .         well .  you   re old and foolish now .         i thought unicorns were more   fluffy .         see clear .  don   t let the glamour get you .  see what   s in front of your eyes .  it   s a damn great horse with a horn on the end .     said granny .   the unicorn pawed the ground .   granny   s feet scraped the bridge .      got here by accident  can   t get back     she said .     if   n there   d been one of us it   d be charging by now .  we   re about halfway across the bridge           lot of snow runoff in that river     said ridcully  doubtfully .      oh  yes     said granny .     see you at the weir .      and she was gone .   the unicorn  which had been trying to decide between targets  was left with ridcully .   it could count up to one .   it lowered its head .   ridcully had never liked horses  animals which seemed to him to have only the weakest possible grip on sanity .   as the unicorn charged  he vaulted the parapet and dropped  without much aerodynamic grace  into the icy waters of the lancre .      the librarian liked the stage .  he was always in the front seat on the first night of a new production at any of ankh   s theaters  his prehensile abilities allowing him to clap twice as hard as anyone else or  if necessary  hurl peanut shells .   and he was feeling let down .  there were hardly any books in the castle  except for serious volumes on etiquette and animal breeding and estate management .  as a rule  royalty doesn   t read much .   he wasn   t expecting to be amazed at the entertainment .  he   d peered behind the bit of sacking that was doing service as a dressing room  and seen half a dozen heavily built men arguing with one another .  this did not bode well for an evening of thespianic splendor  although there was always the possibility that one of them might hit another one in the face with a custard pie .    he had managed to get the three of them seats in the front row .  this wasn   t according to the rules of precedence  but it was amazing how everyone squeezed up to make room .  he   d also found some peanuts .  no one ever knew how he managed that .      oook .         no  thank you     said ponder stibbons .     they give me wind .         oook .         i like to listen to a man who likes to talk .  whoops .  sawdust and treacle .  put that in your herring and smoke it .         i don   t think he wants one     said ponder .   the curtain went up  or at least was pulled aside by carter the baker .   the entertainment began .   the librarian watched in deepening gloom .  it was amazing .  normally he quite liked a badly acted play  provided enough confectionery stayed airborne  but these people weren   t even good at bad acting .  also  no one seemed to be on the point of throwing anything .   he fished a peanut out of the bag and rolled it in his fingers  while staring intently at the left ear of tailor the other weaver .   and felt his hair rise .  this is very noticeable on an orang utan .   he glanced up at the hill behind the erratic actors  and growled under his breath .      oook .      ponder nudged him .      quiet .     he hissed .     they   re getting the hang of it        there was an echo to the voice of the one in the straw wig .      what   d she say .     said ponder .      oook .         how   d she do that .  that   s good makeup  that        ponder fell silent .   suddenly the librarian felt very alone .   everyone else in the audience had their gaze fastened firmly on the turf stage .   he moved a hand up and down in front of stibbons   s face .   the air was wavering over the hill  and the grass on its side moved in a way that made the ape   s eyes ache .      oook .      over the hill  between the little stones  it began to snow .      oook .         alone in her room  magrat unpacked the wedding dress .   and that was another thing .   she ought to have been involved in the dress  at least .  she was going to   would have been the one wearing it  after all .  there should have been weeks of choosing the material  and fittings  and changing her mind  and changing the material  and changing the pattern  and more fittings        although of course she was her own woman and didn   t need that kind of thing at all        but she should have had the choice .   it was white silk  with a tasteful amount of lace .  magrat knew she wasn   t much up on the language of dressmaking .  she knew what things were  she just didn   t know the names .  all those ruches and pleats and gores and things .   she held the dress against her and gave it a critical examination .   there was a small mirror against the wall .   after a certain amount of internal tussling magrat gave in and tried the dress on .  it wasn   t as if she   d be wearing it tomorrow .  if she never did try it on  she   d always wonder if it had fitted .   it fitted .  or  rather  it didn   t fit but in a flattering way .  whatever verence had paid  it had been worth it .  the dressmaker had done cunning things with the material  so that it went in where magrat went straight up and down and billowed out where magrat didn   t .   the veil had silk flowers on the headband .   i   m not going to start crying again  magrat told herself .  i   m going to stay angry .  i   m going to wind up the anger until it   s thick enough to become rage  and when they come back i shall        what .   she could try being icy .  she could sweep majestically past them   this was a good dress for that   and that   d teach them .   and then what .  she couldn   t stay here  not with everyone knowing .  and they   d find out .  about the letter .  news went around lancre faster than turpentine through a sick donkey .   she   d have to go away .  perhaps find somewhere where there were no witches and start up again  although at the moment her feelings about witches were such that she   d prefer practically any other profession  insofar as there were other professions for an ex witch .   magrat stuck out her chin .  the way she felt now  with the bile bubbling like a hot spring  she   d create a new profession .  one that with any luck didn   t involve men and meddling old women .   and she   d keep that damn letter  just to remind her .   all the time she   d wondered how verence was able to have things arranged weeks before she got back  and it was as simple as this .  how they must have laughed        it occurred briefly to nanny ogg that she really should be somewhere else  but at her time of life invitations to intimate candlelit suppers were not a daily occurrence .  there had to be a time when you stopped worrying about the rest of the world and cared a little for yourself .  there had to be a time for a quiet  inner moment .      this is damn good wine     she said  picking up another bottle .     what did you say it   s called .     she peered at the label .     chateau maison .  chat eau   that   s foreign for cat   s water  you know  but that   s only their way  i know it ain   t real cat   s water .  real cat   s water is sharper .     she hammered the cork into the bottle with the end of her knife  then stuck her finger over the neck and gave it a vigorous shaking    to mix the goodness in .         but i don   t hold with drinking it out of ladies    boots     she said .     i know it   s supposed to be the thing to do  but i can   t see what   s so wonderful about walking home with your boots full of wine .  ain   t you hungry .  if you don   t want that bit of gristle  i   ll eat it .  any more of them lobsters .  never had lobster before .  and that mayonnaise .  and them little eggs stuffed with stuff .  mind you  that bramble jam tasted of fish  to my mind .            s caviar     murmured casanunda .   he was sitting with his chin on his hand  watching her in rapt infatuation .   he was  he was surprised to find  enjoying himself immensely while not horizontal .   he knew how this sort of dinner was supposed to go .  it was one of the basic weapons in the seducer   s armory .  the amoratrix was plied with fine wines and expensive yet light dishes .  there was much knowing eye contact across the table  and tangling of feet underneath it .  there was much pointed eating of pears and bananas and so on .  and thus the ship of temptation steered  gently yet inexorably  to a good docking .   and then there was nanny ogg .   nanny ogg appreciated fine wine in her very own way .  it would never have occurred to casanunda that anyone would top up white wine with port merely because she   d reached the end of the bottle .   as for the food   well  she enjoyed that  too .  casanunda had never seen that elbow action before .  show nanny ogg a good dinner and she went at it with knife  fork  and rammer .  watching her eat a lobster was a particular experience he would not forget in a hurry .  they   d be picking bits of claw out of the woodwork for weeks .   and the asparagus   he might actually try to forget nanny ogg putting away asparagus  but he suspected the memory would come creeping back .   it must be a witch thing  he told himself .  they   re always very clear about what they want .  if you climbed cliffs and braved rivers and ski   d down mountains to bring a box of chocolates to gytha ogg  she   d have the nougat centers out of the bottom layer even before you got your crampons off .  that   s it .  whatever a witch does  she does one hundred percent .   hubba  hubba .      ain   t you going to eat all those prawns .  just push the plate this way  then .      he had tried a little footsie to keep his hand in  as it were  but an accidental blow on the ankle from one of nanny   s heavy iron nailed boots had put a stop to that .   and then there had been the gypsy violinist .  at first nanny had complained about people playin    the fiddle while she was trying to concentrate on her eatin     but between courses she   d snatched it off the man  thrown the bow into a bowl of camellias  retuned the instrument to something approaching a banjo  and had given casanunda three rousing verses of what  him being foreign  she chose to call il porcupino nil sodomy est .   then she   d drunk more wine .   what also captivated casanunda was the way nanny ogg   s face became a mass of cheerful horizontal lines when she laughed  and nanny ogg laughed a lot .   in fact casanunda was finding  through the faint haze of wine  that he was actually having fun .      i take it there is no mr .  ogg .     he said  eventually .      oh  yes  there   s a mr .  ogg     said nanny .     we buried him years ago .  well  we had to .  he was dead .         it must be very hard for a woman living all alone .         dreadful     said nanny ogg  who had never prepared a meal or wielded a duster since her eldest daughter had been old enough to do it for her  and who had at least four meals cooked for her every day by various terrified daughters in law .      it must be especially lonely at night     said casanunda  out of habit as much as anything else .      well  there   s greebo     said nanny .     he keeps my feet warm .         greebo           the cat .  i say  do you think there   s any pudding .      later  she asked for a doggy bottle .      mr .  brooks the beekeeper ladled some greenish  foul smelling liquid out of the saucepan that was always simmering in his secret hut  and filled his squirter .   there was a wasps    nest in the garden wall .  it   d be a mortuary by morning .   that was the thing about bees .  they always guarded the entrance to the hive  with their lives if necessary .  but wasps were adept at finding the odd chink in the woodwork around the back somewhere and the sleek little devils   d be in and robbing the hive before you knew it .  funny .  the bees in the hive   d let them do it  too .  they guarded the entrance  but if a wasp found another way in  they didn   t know what to do .   he gave the plunger a push .  a stream of liquid bubbled out and left a smoking streak on the floor .   wasps looked pretty enough .  but if you were for bees  you had to be against wasps .   there seemed to be some sort of party going on in the hall .  he vaguely remembered getting an invitation but  on the whole  that sort of thing never really caught his imagination .  and especially now .  things were wrong .  none of the hives showed any signs of swarming .  not one .   as he passed the hives in the dusk he heard the humming .  you got that  on a warm night .  battalions of bees stood at the hive entrance  fanning the air with their wings to keep the brood cool .  but there was also the roar of bees circling the hive .   they were angry  and on guard .      there was a series of small weirs just on the borders of lancre .  granny weatherwax hauled herself up on to the damp woodwork  and squelched to the bank where she emptied her boots .   after a while a pointy wizard   s hat drifted downriver  and rose to reveal a pointy wizard underneath it .  granny lent a hand to help ridcully out of the water .      there     she said     bracing  wasn   t it .  seemed to me you could do with a cold bath .      ridcully tried to clean some mud out of his ear .  he glared at granny .      why aren   t you wet .         i am .         no you   re not .  you   re just damp .  i   m wet through .  how can you float down a river and just be damp .         i dries out quick .      granny weatherwax glared up the rocks .  a short distance away the steep road ran on to lancre  but there were other  more private ways known to her among the trees .      so     she said  more or less to herself .     she wants to stop me going there  does she .  well  we   ll see about that .         going where .     said ridcully .      ain   t sure     said granny .     all i know is  if she don   t want me to go there  that   s where i   m going .  but i hadn   t bargained on you turnin    up and having a rush of blood to the heart .  come on .      ridcully wrung out his robe .  a lot of the sequins had come off .  he removed his hat and unscrewed the point .   headgear picks up morphic vibrations .  quite a lot of trouble had once been caused in unseen university by a former archchancellor   s hat  which had picked up too many magical vibrations after spending so much time on wizardly heads and had developed a personality of its very own .  ridcully had put a stop to this by having his own hat made to particular specifications by an ankh morpork firm of completely insane hatters .   it was not a normal wizard hat .  few wizards have ever made much use of the pointy bit  except maybe to keep the odd pair of socks in it .  but ridcully   s hat had small cupboards .  it had surprises .  it had four telescopic legs and a roll of oiled silk in the brim that extended downward to make a small but serviceable tent  and a patent spirit stove just above it .  it had inner pockets with three days    supply of iron rations .  and the tip unscrewed to dispense an adequate supply of spirituous liquors for use in emergencies  such as when ridcully was thirsty .   ridcully waved the small pointed cup at granny .      brandy .     he said .      what have you got on your head .      ridcully felt his pate gingerly .      um           smells like honey and horse apples to me .  and what   s that thing .      ridcully lifted the small cage off his head .  there was a small treadmill in it  in a complex network of glass rods .  a couple of feeding bowls were visible .  and there was a small  hairy and currently quite wet mouse .      oh  it   s something some of the young wizards came up with     said ridcully diffidently .     i said i   d   try it out for them .  the mouse hair rubs against the glass rods and there   s sparks  don   t   y   know  and   and        granny weatherwax looked at the archchancellor   s somewhat grubby hair and raised an eyebrow .      my word     she said .     what will they think of next .         don   t really understand how it works  stibbons is the man for this sort of thing  i thought i   d help them out           lucky you were going bald  eh .         in the darkness of her sickroom diamanda opened her eyes  if they were her eyes .  there was a pearly sheen to them .   the song was as yet only on the threshold of hearing .   and the world was different .  a small part of her mind was still diamanda  and looked out through the mists of enchantment .  the world was a pattern of fine silver lines  constantly moving  as though everything was coated with filigree .  except where there was iron .  there the lines were crushed and tight and bent .  there  the whole world was invisible .  iron distorted the world .  keep away from iron .   she slipped out of bed  using the edge of the blanket to grasp the door handle  and opened the door .      shawn ogg was standing very nearly to attention .   currently he was guarding the castle and seeing how long he could stand on one leg .   then it occurred to him that this wasn   t a proper activity for a martial artist  and he turned it into no .      the flying chrysanthemum double drop kick .   after a while he realized that he had been hearing something .  it was vaguely rhythmical  and put him in mind of a grasshopper chirruping .  it was coming from inside the castle .   he turned carefully  keeping alert in case the massed armies of foreign parts tried to invade while his back was turned .   this needed working out .  he wasn   t on guard from things inside the castle  was he .     on guard    meant things outside .  that was the point of castles .  that   s why you had all the walls and things .  he   d got the big poster they gave away free with jane   s all the world   s siege weapons .  he knew what he was talking about .   shawn was not the quickest of thinkers  but his thoughts turned inexorably to the elf in the dungeon .  but that was locked up .  he   d locked the door himself .  and there was iron all over the place  and mum had been very definite about the iron .   nevertheless     he was methodical about it .  he raised the drawbridge and dropped the portcullis and peered over the wall for good measure  but there was just the dusk and the night breeze .   he could feel the sound now .  it seemed to be coming out of the stone  and had a saw toothed edge to it that grated on his nerves .   it couldn   t have got out  could it .  no  it stood to reason .  people hadn   t gone around building dungeons you could get out of .   the sound swung back and forth across the scale .   shawn leaned his rusty pike against the wall and drew his sword .  he knew how to use it .  he practiced for ten minutes every day  and it was one sorry hanging sack of straw when he   d finished with it .   he slipped into the keep by the back door and sidled along the passages toward the dungeon .  there was no one else around .  of course  everyone was at the entertainment .  and they   d be back any time now  carousing all over the place .   the castle felt big  and old  and cold .   any time now .   bound to .   the noise stopped .   shawn peered around the corner .  there were the steps  there was the open doorway to the dungeons .      stop .     shouted shawn  just in case .   the sound echoed off the stones .      stop .  or   or   or   stop .      he eased his way down the steps and looked through the archway .      i warn you .  i   m learning the path of the happy jade lotus .      there was the door to the cell  standing ajar .  and a white clad figure next to it .   shawn blinked .      aren   t you miss tockley .      she smiled at him .  her eyes glowed in the dim light .      you   re wearing chain mail  shawn     she said .      what  miss .     he glanced at the open door again .      that   s terrible .  you must take it off  shawn .  how can you hear with all that stuff around your ears .      shawn was aware of the empty space behind him .  but he daren   t look around .      i can hear fine  miss     he said  trying to ease himself around so that his back was against a wall .      but you can   t hear truly     said diamanda  drifting forward .     the iron makes you deaf .      shawn was not yet used to thinly clad young women approaching him with a dreamy look on their faces .  he fervently wished he could take the path of the retreating back .   he glanced sideways .   there was a tall skinny shape outlined in the open cell doorway .  it was standing very carefully  as if it wanted to keep as far away from its surroundings as possible .   diamanda was smiling at him in a funny way .   he ran .      somehow  the woods had changed .  ridcully was certain that in his youth they   d been full of bluebells and primroses and   and bluebells and whatnot and so on .  not bloody great briars all over the place .  they snagged at his robe and once or twice some tree climbing equivalent knocked his hat off .   what made it worse was that esme weatherwax seemed to avoid all of them .      how do you manage that .         i just know where i am all the time     said granny .      well .  i know where i am  too .         no you don   t .  you just happen to be present .  that   s not the same .         well  do you happen to know where a proper path is .         this is a short cut .         between two places where you   re not lost  d   you mean .         i keep tellin    you  i ain   t lost .  i   m   directionally challenged .         hah .      but it was a fact about esme weatherwax  he had to admit .  she might be lost  and he had reason to suspect this was the case now  unless there were in this forest two trees with exactly the same arrangement of branches and a strip of his robe caught on one of them  but she did have a quality that in anyone not wearing a battered pointy hat and an antique black dress might have been called poise .  absolute poise .  it would be hard to imagine her making an awkward movement unless she wanted to .   he   d seen that years ago  although of course at the time he   d just been amazed at the way her shape fitted perfectly into the space around it .  and     he   d got caught up again .      wait a minute .         entirely the wrong sort of clothes for the country .         i wasn   t expecting a hike through the woods .  this is a ceremonial damn costume .         take it off  then .         then how will anyone know i   m a wizard .         i   ll be sure to tell them .      granny weatherwax was getting rattled .  she was also  despite everything that she   d said  getting lost .  but the point was that you couldn   t get lost between the weir at the bottom of the lancre rapids and lancre town itself .  it was uphill all the way .  besides  she   d walked through the local forests all her life .  they were her forests .   she was pretty sure they   d passed the same tree twice .  there was a bit of ridcully   s robe hanging on it .   it was like getting lost in her own garden .   she was also sure she   d seen the unicorn a couple of times .  it was tracking them .  she   d tried to get into its mind .  she might as well have tried to climb an ice wall .   it wasn   t as if her own mind was tranquil .  but now at least she knew she was sane .   when the walls between the universes are thin  when the parallel strands of if bunch together to pass through the now  then certain things leak across .  tiny signals  perhaps  but audible to a receiver skilled enough .   in her head were the faint  insistent thoughts of a thousand esme weatherwaxes .      magrat wasn   t sure what to pack .  most of her original clothes seemed to have evaporated since she   d been in the castle  and it was hardly good manners to take the ones verence had bought for her .  the same applied to the engagement ring .  she wasn   t sure if you were allowed to keep it .   she glared at herself in the mirror .   she   d have to stop thinking like this .  she seemed to have spent her whole life trying to make herself small  trying to be polite  apologizing when people walked over her  trying to be good mannered .  and what had happened .  people had treated her as if she was small and polite and good mannered .   she   d stick the  the  the damn letter on the mirror  so they   d all know why she   d gone .   she   d a damn good mind to go off to one of the cities and become a courtesan .   whatever that was .   and then she heard the singing .   it was  without a doubt  the most beautiful sound magrat had ever heard .  it flowed straight through the ears and into the hindbrain  into the blood  into the bone     a silk camisole dropped from her fingers on to the floor .   she wrenched at the door  and a tiny part of her mind still capable of rational thought remembered about the key .   the song filled the passageway .  she gripped some folds of the wedding dress to make running easier and hurried toward the stairs     something bulleted out of another doorway and bore her to the floor .   it was shawn ogg .  through the chromatic haze she could see his worried face peering out from its hood of rusty        iron .   the song changed while staying the same .  the complex harmonies  the fascinating rhythm did not alter but suddenly grated  as if she was hearing the song through different ears .   she was dragged into the doorway .      are you all right  miss queen .         what   s happening .         dunno  miss queen .  but i think we   ve got elves .         elves .         and they   ve got miss tockley .  um .  you know you took the iron away           what are you talking about  shawn .      shawn   s face was white .      that one down the dungeons started singing  and they   d put their mark on her  so she   s doing what they want           shawn .         and mum said they don   t kill you  if they can help it .  not right away .  you   re much more fun if you   re not dead .      magrat stared at him .      i had to run away .  she was trying to get my hood off .  i had to leave her  miss .  you understand  miss .         elves .         you got to hold on to something iron  miss .  they hate iron .      she slapped his face  hurting her fingers on the mail .      you   re gabbling  shawn .         they   re out there  miss .  i heard the drawbridge go down .  they   re out there and we   re in here and they don   t kill you  they keep you alive           stand to attention  soldier .      it was all she could think of .  it seemed to work .  shawn pulled himself together .      look     said magrat     everyone knows there really aren   t any elves any mo       her voice faded .  her eyes narrowed .     everyone but magrat garlick knows different  yes .      shawn shook .  magrat grabbed his shoulders .      me mum and mistress weatherwax said you wasn   t to know .     shawn wailed .     they said it was witch business .         and where are they now  when they   ve got some witch business to mind .     said magrat .     i don   t see them  do you .  are they behind the door .  no .  are they under the bed .  how strange  they   re not   there   s just me  shawn ogg .  and if you don   t tell me everything you know right now i   ll make you regret the day i was born .      shawn   s adam   s apple bobbed up and down as he considered this .  then he shook himself free of magrat   s grasp and listened at the door .   the singing had stopped .  for a moment magrat thought she heard footsteps outside the door  hurrying away .      well  miss queen  our mum and mistress weatherwax was up at the dancers        magrat listened .   finally she said     and where   s everyone now .         dunno  miss .  all gone to the entertainment   but they ought to   ve been back by now .         where   s the entertainment .         dunno  miss .  miss .         yes .         why   ve you got your wedding dress on .         never you mind .         it   s unlucky for the groom to see the bride in her dress before the wedding     said shawn  taking refuge in run of the mill idiocies to relieve his terror .      it will be for him if i see him first     snarled magrat .      miss .         yes .         i   m feared about what   s happened to everyone .  our jason said they   d be back in an hour or so  and that was hours ago .         but there   s almost a hundred guests and everyone from the town  practically .  elves couldn   t do anything to them .         they wouldn   t have to  miss .     shawn went to the unglazed window .     look  miss .  i can drop down on to the granary in the stable yard from here .  it   s thatch  i   ll be all right .  then i can sneak around the kitchens and out by the little gate by the hubward tower with military precision .         what for .         to get help  miss .         but you don   t know if there   s any help to get .         can you think of anything else  miss .      she couldn   t .      it   s very   brave of you  shawn     said magrat .      you stay here and you   ll be right as rain     said shawn .     tell you what   how about if i lock the door and take the key with me .  then even if they sing at you they can   t get you to open the door .      magrat nodded .   shawn tried to smile .     wish we had another suit of mail     he said .     but it   s all in the armory .         i   ll be fine     said magrat .     off you go  then .      shawn nodded .  he waited for a moment on the window ledge  and then dropped into the darkness .   magrat pushed the bed against the door and sat on it .   it occurred to her that she should have gone as well .  but that would mean leaving the castle empty  and that didn   t feel right .   besides  she was scared .   there was one candle in the room  and that was half burned down .  when it was gone  there   d be nothing but the moonlight .  magrat had always liked moonlight .  up to now .   it was quiet outside .  there should be the noises of the town .   it crept over her that letting shawn go away with a key to the door was not a wholly sensible thing  because if they caught him they could open     there was a scream  which went on for a long time .   and then the night rolled back in again .   after a few minutes there was a scrabbling at the lock  such as might be made by someone trying to manipulate a key held in several thicknesses of cloth  so as not to come into contact with the iron .   the door began to open  and wedged up against the bed .      will you not step outside  lady .      the door creaked again .      will you not come dance with us  pretty lady .      the voice had strange harmonics and an echo that buzzed around the inside of the head for several seconds after the last word had been spoken .   the door burst open .   three figures slid into the room .  one looked up the bed  and the others poked into dark corners .  then one of them crossed to the window and looked out .   the crumbling wall stretched down to the thatched roof entirely unoccupied .   the figure nodded to two more shapes in the courtyard  its blond hair glowing in the moonlight .   one of them pointed up  to where a figure  its long white dress billowing in the breeze  was climbing up the wall of the keep .   the elf laughed .  this was going to be more enjoyable than it   d suspected .       magrat pulled herself over the windowsill and collapsed  panting  on the floor .  then she staggered across to the door  which was missing its key .  but there were two heavy wooden bars  which she slotted into place .   there was a wooden shutter for the window .   they   d never let her get away with it again .  she   d been expecting an arrow but   no  something as simple as that wouldn   t have been enough fun .   she glared at the darkness .  so   there was this room .  she didn   t even know which one it was .  she found a candlestick and a bundle of matches and  after some scrabbling  got it lit .   there were some boxes and cases piled by the bed .  so   a guest room .   the thoughts trickled through the silence of her brain  one after another .   she wondered if they   d sing to her  and if she could stand it again .  maybe if you knew what to expect     there was a gentle tap at the door .      we have your friends downstairs  lady .  come dance with me .      magrat stared desperately around the room .   it was as featureless as guest bedrooms everywhere .  jug and basin on a stand  the horrible garderobe alcove inadequately concealed behind a curtain  the bed which had a few bags and bundles tossed on it  a battered chair with all the varnish gone and a small square of carpet made gray with age and ground in dust .   the door rattled .     let me in  sweet lady .      the window was no escape this time .  there was the bed to hide under  and that   d work for all of two seconds  wouldn   t it .   her eye was drawn by some kind of horrible magic back to the room   s garderobe  lurking behind its curtain .   magrat lifted the lid .  the shaft was definitely wide enough to admit a body .  garderobes were notorious in that respect .  several unpopular kings had met their end  as it were  in the garderobe  at the hands of an assassin with good climbing ability  a spear  and a fundamental approach to politics .   something hit the door hard .      lady  shall i sing to you .      magrat reached a decision .   it was the hinges that gave way eventually  the rusty bolts finally losing their grip on the stone .   the alcove   s half drawn curtain moved in the breeze .   the elf smiled  strode to the curtain  and pulled it aside .   the oak lid was up .   the elf looked down .   magrat rose up behind it like a white ghost and hit it hard across the back of the neck with the chair  which shattered .   the elf tried to turn and keep its balance  but there was still enough chair left in magrat   s hands for her to catch it on the desperate upswing .  it toppled backward  flailed at the lid  and only succeeded in pulling it shut behind it .  magrat heard a thump and a scream of rage as it dropped into the noisome darkness .  it   d be too much to hope that the fall would kill it .  after all  it   d land in something soft .      not just high     said magrat to herself     but stinking .      hiding under the bed is only good for about two seconds  but sometimes two seconds is enough .   she let go of the chair .  she was shaking .  but she was still alive  and that felt good .  that   s the thing about being alive .  you   re alive to enjoy it .   magrat peered out into the passage .   she had to move .  she picked up a stricken chair leg for the little comfort that it gave  and ventured out .   there was a scream again  from the direction of the great hall .   magrat looked the other way  toward the long gallery .  she ran .  there had to be a way out  somewhere  some gate  some window     some enterprising monarch had glazed the windows some time ago .  the moonlight shone through in big silver blocks  interspersed with squares of deep shadow .   magrat ran from light to shade  light to shade  down the endless room .  monarch after monarch flashed past  like a speeded up film .  king after king  all whiskers and crowns and beards .  queen after queen  all corsages and stiff bodices and lappet faced wowhawks and small dogs and     some shape  some trick of moonlight  some expression on a painted face somehow cut through her terror and caught her eye .   that was a portrait she   d never seen before .  she   d never walked down this far .  the idiot vapidity of the assembled queens had depressed her .  but this one     this one  somehow  reached out to her .   she stopped .   it couldn   t have been done from life .  in the days of this queen  the only paint known locally was a sort of blue  and generally used on the body .  but a few generations ago king lully i had been a bit of a historian and a romantic .  he   d researched what was known of the early days of lancre  and where actual evidence had been a bit sparse he had  in the best traditions of the keen ethnic historian  inferred from revealed self evident wisdom  and extrapolated from associated sources .  he   d commissioned the portrait of queen ynci the short tempered  one of the founders of the kingdom .   she had a helmet with wings and a spike on it and a mass of black hair plaited into dreadlocks with blood as a setting lotion .  she was heavily made up in the woad and blood and spirals school of barbarian cosmetics .  she had a    d cup breastplate and shoulder pads with spikes .  she had knee pads with spikes on  and spikes on her sandals  and a rather short skirt in the fashionable tartan and blood motif .  one hand rested nonchalantly on a double headed battle axe with a spike on it  the other caressed the hand of a captured enemy warrior .  the rest of the captured enemy warrior was hanging from various pine trees in the background .  also in the picture was spike  her favorite war pony  of the now extinct lancre hill breed which was the same general shape and disposition as a barrel of gunpowder  and her war chariot  which picked up the popular spiky theme .  it had wheels you could shave with .   magrat stared .   they   d never mentioned this .   they   d told her about tapestries  and embroidery  and farthingales  and how to shake hands with lords .  they   d never told her about spikes .   there was a sound at the end of the gallery  from back the way she   d come .  she grabbed her skirts and ran .   there were footsteps behind her  and laughter .   left down the cloisters  then along the dark passage above the kitchens  and past the     a shape moved in the shadows .  teeth flashed .  magrat raised the chair leg  and stopped in mid strike .      greebo .      nanny ogg   s cat rubbed against her legs .  his hair was flat against his body .  this unnerved magrat even more .  this was greebo  undisputed king of lancre   s cat population and father of most of it  in whose presence wolves trod softly and bears climbed trees .  he was frightened .      come here  you bloody idiot .      she grabbed him by the scruff of his scarred neck and ran on  while greebo gratefully sank his claws into her arm to the bone  and scrambled up to her shoulder .   she must be somewhere near the kitchen now  because that was greebo   s territory .  this was an unknown and shadowy area  terror incognita  where the flesh of carpets and the plaster pillars ran out and the stone bone of the castle showed through .   she was sure there were footsteps behind her  very fast and light .   if she hurried around the next corner     in her arms  greebo tensed like a spring .  magrat stopped .   around the next corner     without her apparently willing it  the hand holding the broken wood came up  moving slowly back .   she stepped to the corner and stabbed in one movement .  there was a triumphant hiss which turned into a screech as the wood scraped down the side of the waiting elf   s neck .  it reeled away .  magrat bolted for the nearest doorway  weeping in panic  and wrenched at the handle .  it swung open .  she darted through  slammed the door  flailed in the dark for the bars  felt them clonk home  and collapsed on to her knees .   something hit the door outside .   after a while magrat opened her eyes  and then wondered if she really had opened her eyes  because the darkness was no less dark .  there was a feeling of space in front of her .  there were all sorts of things in the castle  old hidden rooms  anything   there could be a pit there  there could be anything .  she fumbled for the doorframe  guided herself upright  and then groped cautiously in the general direction of the wall .   there was a shelf .  this was a candle .  and this was a bundle of matches .   so  she insisted above her own heartbeat  this was a room that got used recently .  most people in lancre still used tinderboxes .  only the king could afford matches all the way from ankh morpork .  granny weatherwax and nanny ogg got them too  but they didn   t buy them .  they got given them .  it was easy to get given things  if you were a witch .   magrat lit the stub of candle  and turned to see what kind of room she   d scuttled into .   oh  no           well  well     said ridcully .     there   s a familiar tree .         shut up .         i thought someone said we just had to walk uphill     said ridcully .      shut up .         i remember once when we were in these woods you let me           shut up .      granny weatherwax sat down on a stump .      we   re being mazed     she said .     someone   s playing tricks on us .         i remember a story once     said ridcully     where these two children were lost in the woods and a lot of birds came and covered them with leaves .     hope showed in his voice like a toe peeking out from under a crinoline .      yes  that   s just the sort of bloody stupid thing a bird would think of     said granny .  she rubbed her head .      she   s doing it     she said .     it   s an elvish trick .  leading travelers astray .  she   s mucking up my head .  my actual head .  oh  she   s good .  making us go where she wants .  making us go round in circles .  doing it to me .         maybe you   ve got your mind on other things     said ridcully  not quite giving up hope .      course i   ve got my mind on other things  with you falling over all the time and gabbling a lot of nonsense     said granny .     if mr .  cleverdick wizard hadn   t wanted to dredge up things that never existed in the first place i wouldn   t be here  i   d be in the center of things  knowing what   s going on .     she clenched her fists .      well  you don   t have to be     said ridcully .     it   s a fine night .  we could sit here and           you   re falling for it too     said granny .     all that dreamy weamy  eyes across a crowded room stuff .  can   t imagine how you keep your job as head wizard .         mainly by checking my bed carefully and makin    sure someone else has already had a slice of whatever it is i   m eating     said ridcully  with disarming honesty .     there   s not much to it  really .  mainly it   s signin    things and having a good shout        ridcully gave up .      anyway  you looked pretty surprised when you saw me     he said .     your face went white .         anyone   d go white  seeing a full grown man standing there looking like a sheep about to choke     said granny .      you really don   t let up  do you .     said ridcully .     amazing .  you don   t give an inch .      another leaf drifted past .   ridcully didn   t move his head .      you know     he said  his voice staying quite level     either autumn comes really early in these parts  or the birds here are the ones out of that story i mentioned  or someone   s in the tree above us .         i know .         you know .         yes  because i   ve been paying attention while you were dodging the traffic in memory lane     said granny .     there   s at least five of    em  and they   re right above us .  how   s those magic fingers of yours .         i could probably manage a fireball .         wouldn   t work .  can you carry us out of here .         not both of us .         just you .         probably  but i   m not going to leave you .      granny rolled her eyes .     it   s true  you know     she said .     all men are swains .  push off  you soft old bugger .  they   re not intending to kill me .  at least  not yet .  but they don   t hardly know nothing about wizards and they   ll chop you down without thinking .         now who   s being soft .         i don   t want to see you dead when you could be doin    something useful .         running away isn   t useful .         it   s going to be a lot more useful than staying here .         i   d never forgive myself if i went .         and i   d never forgive you if you stayed  and i   m a lot more unforgiving than you are     said granny .     when it   s all over  try to find gytha ogg .  tell her to look in my old box .  she   ll know what   s in there .  and if you don   t go now        an arrow hit the stump beside ridcully .      the buggers are firing at me .     he shouted .     if i had my crossbow           i should go and get it  then     said granny .      right .  i   ll be back instantly .      ridcully vanished .  a moment later several lumps of castle masonry dropped out of the space he had just occupied .      that   s him out of the way  then     said granny  to no one in particular .   she stood up  and gazed around at the trees .      all right     she said     here i am .  i ain   t running .  come and get me .  here i am .  all of me .         magrat calmed down .  of course it existed .  every castle had one .  and of course this one was used .  there was a trodden path through the dust to the rack a few feet away from the door  where a few suits of unraveling chain mail hung on a rack  next to the pikes .   shawn probably came in here every day .   it was the armory .   greebo hopped down from magrat   s shoulders and wandered off down the cobwebbed avenues  in his endless search for anything small and squeaky .   magrat followed him  in a daze .   the kings of lancre had never thrown anything away .  at least  they   d never thrown anything away if it was possible to kill someone with it .   there was armor for men .  there was armor for horses .  there was armor for fighting dogs .  there was even armor for ravens  although king gurnt the stupid   s plan for an aerial attack force had never really got off the ground .  there were more pikes  and swords  cutlasses  rapiers  epees  broadswords  flails  morningstars  maces  clubs  and huge knobs with spikes .  they were all piled together and  in those places where the roof had leaked  were rusted into a lump .  there were longbows  short bows  pistol bows  stirrup bows  and crossbows  piled like firewood and stacked with the same lack of care .  odd bits of armor were piled in more heaps  and were red with rust .  in fact rust was everywhere .  the whole huge room was full of the death of iron .   magrat went on  like some clockwork toy that won   t change direction until it bumps into something .   the candlelight was reflected dully in helmets and breastplates .  the sets of horse armor in particular were terrible  on their rotting wooden frames   they stood like exterior skeletons  and  like skeletons  nudged the mind into thoughts of mortality .  empty eye sockets stared sightlessly down at the little candlelit figure .      lady .      the voice came from outside the door  far behind magrat .  but it echoed around her  bouncing off the centuries of moldering armaments .   they can   t come in here  magrat thought .  too much iron .  in here  i   m safe .      if lady wants to play  we will fetch her friends .      as magrat turned  the light caught the edge of something  and gleamed .   magrat pulled aside a huge shield .      lady .      magrat reached out .      lady .      magrat   s hands held a rusty iron helmet  with wings .      come dance at the wedding  lady .      magrat   s hands closed on a well endowed breastplate  with spikes .   greebo  who had been tracking mice through a prone suit of armor  stuck his head out of a leg .   a change had come over magrat .  it showed in her breathing .  she   d been panting  with fear and exhaustion .  then  for a few seconds  there was no sound of her breathing at all .  and finally it returned .  slowly .  deeply .  deliberately .   greebo saw magrat  who he   d always put down as basically a kind of mouse in human shape  lift the hat with the wings on it and put it on her head .   magrat knew all about the power of hats .   in her mind   s ear she could hear the rattle of the chariots .      lady .  we will bring your friends to sing to you .      she turned .   the candlelight sparkled off her eyes .   greebo drew back into the safety of his armor .  he recalled a particular time when he   d leapt out on a vixen .  normally greebo could take on a fox without raising a sweat but  as it turned out  this one had cubs .  he hadn   t found out until he chased her into her den .  he   d lost a bit of one ear and quite a lot of fur before he   d got away .   the vixen had a very similar expression to the one magrat had now .      greebo .  come here .      the cat turned and tried to find a place of safety in the suit   s breastplate .  he was beginning to doubt he   d make it through the knight .      elves prowled the castle gardens .  they   d killed the fish in the ornamental pond  eventually .   mr .  brooks was perched on a kitchen chair  working at a crevice in the stable wall .   he   d been aware of some sort of excitement  but it was involving humans and therefore of secondary importance .  but he did notice the change in the sound from the hives  and the splintering of wood .   a hive had already been tipped over .  angry bees clouded around three figures as feet ripped through comb and honey and brood .   the laughter stopped as a white coated  veiled figure appeared over the hedge .  it raised a long metal tube .   no one ever knew what mr .  brooks put in his squirter .  there was old tobacco in it  and boiled up roots  and bark scrapings  and herbs that even magrat had never heard of .  it shot a glistening stream over the hedge which hit the middle elf between the eyes  and sprayed over the other two .   mr .  brooks watched dispassionately until their struggles stopped .      wasps     he said .   then he went and found a box  lit a lantern and  with great care and delicacy  oblivious to the stings  began to repair the damaged combs .      shawn couldn   t feel much in his arm anymore  except in the hot dull way that indicated at least one broken bone  and he knew that two of his fingers shouldn   t be looking like that .  he was sweating  despite being only in his vest and drawers .  he should never have taken his chain mail off  but it   s hard to say no when an elf is pointing a bow at you .  shawn knew what  fortunately  many people didn   t   chain mail isn   t much defense against an arrow .  it certainly isn   t when the arrow is being aimed between your eyes .   he   d been dragged along the corridors to the armory .  there were at least four elves  but it was hard to see their faces .  shawn remembered when the traveling magic lanthorn show had come to lancre .  he   d watched entranced as different pictures had been projected on to one of nanny ogg   s bedsheets .  the elf faces put him in mind of that .  there were eyes and a mouth in there somewhere  but everything else seemed to be temporary  the elves    features passing across their faces like the pictures on the screen .   they didn   t say much .  they just laughed a lot .  they were a merry folk  especially when they were twisting your arm to see how far it could go .   the elves spoke to one another in their own language .  then one of them turned to shawn  and indicated the armory door .      we wish the lady to come out     it said .     you must say to her  if she does not come out  we will play with you some more .         what will you do to us if she does come out .     said shawn .      oh  we shall still play with you     said the elf .     that   s what makes it so much fun .  but she must hope  must she not .  talk to her now .      he was pushed up to the door .  he knocked on it  in what he hoped was a respectful way .      um .  miss queen .      magrat   s voice was muffled .      yes .         it   s me  shawn .         i know .         i   m out here .  um .  i think they   ve hurt miss tockley .  um .  they say they   ll hurt me some more if you don   t come out .  but you don   t have to come out because they daren   t come in there because of all the iron .  so i shouldn   t listen to them if i was you .      there were some distant clankings  and then a twang .      miss magrat .         ask her     said the elf     if there is any food and water in there .         miss  they say        one of the elves jerked him away .  two of them took up station either side of the doorway  and one put his pointed ear to it .   then it knelt down and peered through the keyhole  taking care not to come too near the metal of the lock .   there was a sound no louder than a click .  the elf remained motionless for a moment  and then keeled over gently  without a sound .   shawn blinked .   there was about an inch of crossbow bolt sticking out of its eye .  the feathers had been sheared off by its passage through the keyhole .      wow     he said .   the armory door swung open  revealing nothing but darkness .   one of the elves started to laugh .      so much for him     it said .     how stupid   lady .  will you listen to your warrior .      he gripped shawn   s broken arm  and twisted .   shawn tried not to scream .  purple lights flashed in front of his eyes .  he wondered what would happen if he passed out .   he wished his mum was here .      lady     said the elf     if you           all right     said magrat   s voice  from somewhere in the darkness .     i   m going to come out .  you must promise not to hurt me .         oh  indeed i do  lady .         and you   ll let shawn go .         yes .      the elves on either side of the doorway nodded at each other .      please .     magrat pleaded .      yes .      shawn groaned .  if it had been mum or mistress weatherwax  they   d have fought to the death .  mum was right   magrat always was the nice soft one        who   d just fired a crossbow through a keyhole .   some eighth sense made shawn shift his weight .  if the elf relaxed his grip for just one second  shawn was ready to stagger .   magrat appeared in the doorway .  she was carrying an ancient wooden box with the word    candles    on the side in peeling paint .   shawn looked hopefully along the corridor .   magrat smiled brightly at the elf beside him .     this is for you     she said  handing over the box .  the elf took it automatically .     but you mustn   t open it .  and remember you promised not to hurt me .      the elves closed in behind magrat .  one of them raised a hand  with a stone knife in it .      lady .     said the elf holding the box  which was rocking gently in its hands .      yes .     said magrat  meekly .      i lied to you .      the knife plunged toward her back .   and shattered .   the elf looked at magrat   s innocent expression  and opened the box .   greebo had spent an irritating two minutes in that box .  technically  a cat locked in a box may be alive or it may be dead .  you never know until you look .  in fact  the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat  although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in  these being alive  dead  and bloody furious .   shawn dived sideways as greebo went off like a claymore mine .      don   t worry about him     said magrat dreamily  as the elf flailed at the maddened cat .     he   s just a big softy .      she drew a knife out of the folds of her dress  turned  and stabbed the elf behind her .  it wasn   t an accurate thrust  but it didn   t have to be .  not with an iron blade .   she completed the movement by daintily raising the hem of her dress and kicking the third elf just under the knee .   shawn saw a flash of metal as her foot retreated under the silk again .   she elbowed the screaming elf aside  trotted into the doorway  and came back with a crossbow .      shawn     she said     which one hurt you .         all of them     said shawn  weakly .     but the one fighting greebo stabbed diamanda .      the elf pulled greebo off his face .  green blue blood was streaming from a dozen wounds and greebo hung on to its arm as he was flailed against the wall .      stop it     said magrat .   the elf looked down at the bow  and froze .      i will not beg for mercy     it said .      good     said magrat  and fired .   that left one elf rolling in circles on the flagstones  clutching at its knee .   magrat stepped daintily over the body of another elf  vanished into the armory for a moment  and came back with an axe .   the elf stopped moving  and focused all its attention on her .      now     said magrat  conversationally     i   m not going to lie to you about your chances  because you haven   t got any .  i   m going to ask you some questions .  but first of all  i   m going to get your attention .      the elf was expecting it  and managed to roll aside as the axe splintered the stones .      miss .     said shawn weakly  as magrat raised the axe again .      yes .         mum says they don   t feel pain  miss .         no .  but they can certainly be put to inconvenience .      magrat lowered the axe .      of course  there   s armor     she said .     we could put this one in a suit of armor .  how about it .         no .      the elf tried to pull away across the floor .      why not .     said magrat .     better than axes  yes .         no .         why not .         it is like being buried in the earth     hissed the elf .     no eyes  no ears  no mouth .         chain mail  then     said magrat .      no .         where is the king .  where is everyone .         i will not say .         all right .      magrat vanished into the armory again  and came back dragging a suit of chain mail .   the elf tried to scramble away .      you won   t get it on     said shawn  from where he lay .     you   ll never get it over its arms        magrat picked up the axe .      oh  no     said shawn .     miss .         you will never get him back     said the elf .     she has him .         we shall see     said magrat .     all right  shawn .  what shall we do with it .      in the end they dragged it into a storeroom next to the dungeon and manacled it to the bars of the window .  it was still whimpering at the touch of the iron as magrat slammed the door .   shawn was trying to keep at a respectful distance .  it was the way magrat kept smiling all the time .      now let   s have a look at that arm of yours     she said .      i   m all right     said shawn     but they stabbed diamanda in the kitchen .         was it her i heard screaming .         uh .  partly .  uh .     shawn stared down in fascination at the dead elves as magrat stepped over them .      you killed them     he said .      did i do it wrong .         um .  no     said shawn cautiously .     no  you did it   quite well  really .         and there   s one in the pit     said magrat .     you know   the pit .  what day is it .         tuesday .         and you clean it out on    .         wednesdays .  only i missed last wednesday because i had           then we probably don   t need to worry about it .  are there any more around .         i   don   t think so .  uh .  miss queen .         yes  shawn .         could you put the axe down  please .  i   d feel a lot better if you put the axe down .  the axe  miss queen .  you keep swinging it about .  it could go off at any second .         what axe .         the one you   re holding .         oh  this axe .     magrat appeared to notice it for the first time .     that arm looks bad .  let   s get down to the kitchen and i   ll splint it .  those fingers don   t look good  either .  did they kill diamanda .         i don   t know .  and i don   t know why .  i mean  she was helping them .         yes .  wait a moment .     magrat disappeared one more time into the armory  and came back carrying a sack .     come on .  greebo .      greebo gave her a sly look  and stopped washing himself .      d   you know a funny thing about lancre .     said magrat  as they sidled down the stairs .      what   s that  miss .         we never throw anything away .  and you know another thing .         no  miss .         they couldn   t have painted her from life  of course .  i mean  people didn   t paint portraits in those days .  but the armor   hah .  all they had to do was look .  and you know what .      shawn suddenly felt frightened .  he   d been scared before  but it had been immediate and physical .  but magrat  like this  frightened him more than the elves .  it was like being charged by a sheep .      no  miss .     he said .      no one told me about her .  you   d think it   s all tapestry and walking around in long dresses .         what  miss .      magrat waved an arm expressively .      all this .         miss .     said shawn  from knee level .   magrat looked down .      what .         please put the axe down .         oh .  sorry .         hodgesaargh spent his nights in a little shed adjoining the mews .  he too had received an invitation to the wedding  but it had been snatched from his hand and eaten in mistake for one of his fingers by lady jane  an ancient and evil tempered gyrfalcon .  so he   d gone through his usual nightly routine  bathing his wounds and eating a meal of stale bread and ancient cheese and going to bed early to bleed gently by candlelight over a copy of beaks and talons .   he looked up at a sound from the mews  picked up the candlestick  and wandered out .   an elf was looking at the birds .  it had lady jane perched on its arm .   hodgesaargh  like mr .  brooks  didn   t take much interest in events beyond his immediate passion .  he was aware that there were a lot of visitors in the castle and  as far as he was concerned  anyone looking at the hawks was a fellow enthusiast .      that   s my best bird     he said proudly .     i   ve nearly got her trained .  she   s very good .  i   m training her .  she   s very intelligent .  she knows eleven words of command .      the elf nodded solemnly .  then it slipped the hood off the bird   s head  and nodded toward hodgesaargh .      kill     it commanded .   lady jane   s eyes glittered in the torchlight .  then she leapt  and hit the elf full in the throat with two sets of talons and a beak .      she does that with me  too     said hodgesaargh .     sorry about that .  she   s very intelligent .         diamanda was lying on the kitchen floor  in a pool of blood .  magrat knelt beside her .      she   s still alive .  just .     she grabbed the hem of her dress  and tried to rip it .      damn the thing .  help me  shawn .         miss .         we need bandages .         but           oh  stop gawping .      the skirt tore .  a dozen lace roses unraveled .   shawn had never been privy to what queens wore under their clothes  but even starting with certain observations concerning millie chillum and working his way up  he   d never considered metal underwear .   magrat thumped the breastplate .      fairly good fit     she said  defying shawn to point out that in certain areas there was quite a lot of air between the metal and magrat .     not that a few tucks and a rivet here and there wouldn   t help .  don   t you think it looks good .         oh  yes     said shawn .     uh .  sheet iron is really you .         you really think so .         oh  yes     said shawn  inventing madly .     you   ve got the figure for it .      she set and splinted his arm and fingers  working methodically  using strips of silk as bandages .  diamanda was less easy .  magrat cleaned and stitched and bandaged  while shawn sat and watched  trying to ignore the insistent hot ice pain from his arm .   he kept repeating     they just laughed and stabbed her .  she didn   t even try to run away .  it was like they were playing .      for some reason magrat shot a glance at greebo  who had the decency to look embarrassed .      pointy ears and hair you want to stroke     she said  vaguely .     and they can fascinate you .  and when they   re happy they make a pleasing noise .         what .         just thinking to myself .     magrat stood up .     ok .  i   ll build up the fire and fetch a couple of crossbows and load them up for you .  and you keep the door shut and let no one in  d   you hear .  and if i don   t come back   try and go somewhere where there   s people .  get up to the dwarfs at copperhead .  or the trolls .         what are you going to do .         i   m going to see what   s happened to everyone .      magrat opened the sack she   d brought down from the armory .  there was a helmet in it .  it had wings on  and to shawn   s mind was quite impractical .   there was also a pair of mail gloves and a choice assortment of rusty weaponry .      but there   s probably more of those things out there .         better out there than in here .         can you fight .         don   t know .  never tried     said magrat .      but if we wait here  someone   s bound to come .         yes .  i   m afraid they will .         what i mean is  you don   t have to do this .         yes i do .  i   m getting married tomorrow .  one way or the other .         but           shut up .      she   s going to get killed  shawn thought .  it   s enough to be able to pick up a sword .  you have to know which end to poke into the enemy .  i   m supposed to be on guard and she   s going to get killed     but     but     she shot one of them in the eye  right through the keyhole .  i couldn   t have done that .  i   d have said something like    hands up .     first .  but they were in the way and she just   got them out of her way .   she   s still going to die .  she   s just probably going to die bravely .   i wish my mum was here .   magrat finished rolling up the stained remnant of the wedding dress and stowed it in the sack .      have we got any horses .         there   s   elf horses in the courtyard  miss .  but i don   t think you   ll be able to ride one .      it struck shawn immediately that this wasn   t the right thing to say .      it was black  and larger than what magrat had to think of as a human horse .  it rolled red eyes at her  and tried to get into position to kick .   magrat managed to mount only by practically tethering every leg to the rings in the stable wall  but when she was on  the horse changed .  it had the docility of the severely whipped  and seemed to have no mind of its own .      it   s the iron     said shawn .      what does it do to them .  it can   t hurt .         don   t know  miss .  seems they just freeze up  kind of thing .         drop the portcullis after i   m through .         miss           are you going to tell me not to go .         but           shut up  then .         but           i remember a folksong about a situation just like this     said magrat .     this girl had her fianc   stolen by the queen of the elves and she didn   t hang around whining  she jolly well got on her horse and went and rescued him .  well  i   m going to do that too .      shawn tried to grin .      you   re going to sing .     he said .      i   m going to fight .  i   ve got everything to fight for  haven   t i .  and i   ve tried everything else .      shawn wanted to say  but that   s not the same .  going and fighting when you   re a real person isn   t like folksongs .  in real life you die .  in folksongs you just have to remember to keep one finger in your ear and how to get to the next chorus .  in real life no one goes wack fol a diddle di do sing too rah li ay .   but he said      but  miss  if you don   t come back        magrat turned in the saddle .      i   ll be back .      shawn watched her urge the sluggish horse into a trot and disappear over the drawbridge .      good luck .     he shouted .   then he lowered the portcullis and went back into the keep  where there were three loaded crossbows on the kitchen table .   there was also the book on martial arts that the king had sent for specially .   he pumped up the fire  turned a chair to face the door  and turned to the advanced section .      magrat was halfway down the road to the square when the adrenaline wore off and her past life caught up with her .   she looked down at the armor  and the horse  and thought  i   m out of my mind .   it was that bloody letter .  and i was frightened .  i thought i   d show everyone what i   m made of .  and now they   ll probably find out  i   m made of lots of tubes and greeny purple wobbly bits .   i was just lucky with those elves .  and i didn   t think .  as soon as i think  i get things wrong .  i don   t think i   ll be that lucky again     luck .   she thought wistfully of her bags of charms and talismans at the bottom of the river .  they   d never really worked  if her life was anything to go by  but maybe   it was a horrible thought   maybe they   d just stopped it getting worse .   there were hardly any lights in the town  and a lot of the houses had their shutters up .   the horse   s hooves clattered loudly on the cobbles .  magrat peered into the shadows .  once  they   d just been shadows .  now they could be gateways to anything .   clouds were pressing in from the hub .  magrat shivered .   this was something she   d never seen before .   it was true night .   night had fallen in lancre  and it was an old night .  it was not the simple absence of day  patrolled by the moon and stars  but an extension of something that had existed long before there was any light to define it by absence .  it was unfolding itself from under tree roots and inside stones  crawling back across the land .   magrat   s sack of what she considered to be essential props might be at the bottom of the river but she had been a witch for more than ten years  and she could feel the terror in the air .   people remember badly .  but societies remember well  the swarm remembers  encoding the information to slip it past the censors of the mind  passing it on from grandmother to grandchild in little bits of nonsense they won   t bother to forget .  sometimes the truth keeps itself alive in devious ways despite the best efforts of the official keepers of information .  ancient fragments chimed together now in magrat   s head .   up the airy mountain  down the rushy glen     from ghosties and bogles and long leggity beasties     my mother said i never should     we dare not go a hunting  for fear     and things that go bump     play with the fairies in the wood     magrat sat on the horse she didn   t trust and gripped the sword she didn   t know how to use while the ciphers crept out of memory and climbed into a shape .   they steal cattle and babies     they steal milk     they love music  and steal away musicians     in fact they steal everything .   we   ll never be as free as them  as beautiful as them  as clever as them  as light as them  we are animals .   chilly wind soughed in the forest beyond the town .  it had always been a pleasant forest to walk in at nights but now  she knew  it would not be so again .  the trees would have eyes .  there would be distant laughter in the wind .   what they take is everything .   magrat spurred the horse into a walk .  somewhere in the town a door slammed shut .   and what they give you is fear .   there was the sound of hammering from across the street .  a man was nailing something on his door .  he glanced around in terror  saw magrat  and darted inside .   what he had been nailing on the door was a horseshoe .   magrat tied the horse firmly to a tree and slid off its back .  there was no reply to her knocking .   who was it who lived here .  carter the weaver  wasn   t it  or weaver the baker .      open up  man .  it   s me  magrat garlick .      there was something white beside the doorstep .   it turned out to be a bowl of cream .   again  magrat thought of the cat greebo .  smelly  unreliable  cruel  and vindictive   but who purred nicely  and had a bowl of milk every night .      come on .  open up .      after a while the bolts slid back  and an eye was applied to a very narrow crack .      yes .         you   re carter the baker  aren   t you .         i   m weaver the thatcher .         and you know who i am .         miss garlick .         come on  let me in .         are you alone  miss .         yes .      the crack widened to a magrat width .   there was one candle alight in the room .  weaver backed away from magrat until he was leaning awkwardly over the table .  magrat peered around him .   the rest of the weaver family were hiding under the table .  four pairs of frightened eyes peered up at magrat .      what   s going on .     she said .      er       said weaver .     didn   t recognize you in your flying hat  miss           i thought you were doing the entertainment .  what   s happened .  where is everyone .  where is my going to be husband .         er        yes  it was probably the helmet .  that   s what magrat decided afterward .  there are certain items  such as swords and wizards    hats and crowns and rings  which pick up something of the nature of their owners .  queen ynci had probably never sewn a tapestry in her life and undoubtedly had a temper shorter than a wet cowpat .   it was better to think that something of her had rubbed off on the helmet and was being transmitted to magrat like some kind of royal scalp disease .  it was better to let ynci take over .   she grabbed weaver by his collar .      if you say    er    one more time     she said     i   ll chop your ears off .         er   aargh   i mean  miss   it   s the lords and ladies  miss .         it really is the elves .         miss .     said weaver  his eyes full of pleading .     don   t say it .  we heard    em go down the street .  dozens of    em .  and they   ve stolen old thatcher   s cow and skindle   s goat and they broke down the door of           why   d you put a bowl of milk out .     magrat demanded .   weaver   s mouth opened and shut a few times .  then he managed     you see  my eva said her granny always put a bowl of milk out for them  to keep them hap           i see     said magrat  icily .     and the king .         the king  miss .     said weaver  buying time .      the king     said magrat .     short man  runny eyes  ears that stick out a bit  unlike other ears in this vicinity very shortly .      weaver   s fingers wove around one another like tormented snakes .      well   well   well        he caught the look on magrat   s face  and sagged .      we done the play     he said .     i told    em  let   s do the stick and bucket dance instead  but they were set on this play .  and it all started all right and then  and then  and then   suddenly they were there  hundreds of    em  and everyone was runnin     and someone bashed into me  and i rolled into the stream  and then there was all this noise  and i saw jason ogg hitting four elves with the first thing he could get hold of           another elf .         right  and then i found eva and the kids  and then lots of people were running like hell for home  and there were these   gentry on horseback  and i could hear    em laughing  and we got home and eva said to put a horseshoe on the door and           what about the king .         dunno  miss .  last i remember  he was laughin    at thatcher in his straw wig .         and nanny ogg and granny weatherwax .  what happened to them .         dunno  miss .  don   t remember seein       em  but there was people runnin    everywhere           and where was all this .         miss .         where did it happen .     said magrat  trying to speak slowly and distinctly .      up at the dancers  miss .  you know .  them old stones .      magrat let him go .      oh  yes     she said .     don   t tell magrat  magrat   s not to know about this sort of thing .  the dancers .  right .         it wasn   t us  miss .  it was only make believe .         hah .      she unbolted the door again .      where   re you going  miss .     said weaver  who was not a competitor in the all lancre uptake stakes .      where d   you think .         but  miss  you can   t take iron        magrat slammed the door .  then she kicked the bowl of milk so hard that it sprayed across the street .      jason ogg crawled cautiously through the dripping bracken .  there was a figure a few feet away .  he hefted the stone in his hand        jason .         is that you  weaver .         no  it   s me   tailor .         where   s everyone else .         tinker   n baker found carpenter just now .  have you seen weaver .         no  but i saw carter and thatcher .      mist curled up as the rain drummed into the warm earth .  the seven surviving morris men crawled under a dripping bush .      there   s going to be hell to pay in the morning .     moaned carter .     when she finds us we   re done for .         we   ll be all right if we can find some iron     said jason .      iron don   t have no effect on her .  she   ll tan our hides for us .      carter clutched his knees to his chest in terror .      who .         mistress weatherwax .      thatcher jabbed him in the ribs .  water cascaded off the leaves above them and funneled down every neck .      don   t be so daft .  you saw them things .  what   re you worrying about that old baggage for .         she   ll tan our hides for us  right enough .     twas all our fault  she   ll say .         i just hopes she gets a chance     muttered tinker .      we are     said thatcher     between a rock and a hard place .         no we ain   t     sobbed carter .     i been there .  that   s that gorge just above bad ass .  we ain   t there .  i wish we was there .  we   re under this bush .  and they   ll be looking for us .  and so shall she .         what happened when we was doing the ent       carpenter began .      i ain   t asking that question right now     said jason .     the question i   m asking right now is  how do we get home tonight .         she   ll be waiting for us .     carter wailed .   there was a tinkle in the darkness .      what   ve you got there .     said jason .      it   s the props sack     said carter .     you said as how it was my job to look after the props sack .         you dragged that all the way down here .         i ain   t about to get into more trouble    cos of losing the props sack .      carter started to shiver .      if we gets back home     said jason     i   m going to talk to our mam about getting you some of these new dried frog pills .      he pulled the sack toward him and undid the top .      there   s our bells in here     he said     and the sticks .  and who told you to pack the accordion .         i thought we might want to do the stick and           no one   s ever to do the stick and        there was a laugh  away on the rain soaked hill  and a crackling in the bracken .  jason suddenly felt the focus of attention .      they   re out there .     said carter .      and we ain   t got any weapons     said tinker .   a set of heavy brass bells hit him in the chest .      shut up     said jason     and put your bells on .  carter .         they   re waiting for us .         i   ll say this just once     said jason .     after tonight no one   s ever to talk about the stick and bucket dance ever again .  all right .         the lancre morris men faced one another  rain plastering their clothes to their bodies .   carter  tears of terror mingling with makeup and the rain  squeezed the accordion .  there was the long drawn out chord that by law must precede all folk music to give bystanders time to get away .   jason held up his hand and counted his fingers .      one  two       his forehead wrinkled .     one  two  three              four       hissed tinker .         four     said jason .     dance  lads .      six heavy ash sticks clashed in mid air .         one  two  forward  one  back  spin        slowly  as the leaky strains of mrs .  widgery   s lodger wound around the mist  the dancers leapt and squelched their way slowly through the night           two  back  jump        the sticks clashed again .      they   re watching us .     panted tailor  as he bounced past jason     i can see    em .            one   two   they won   t do nothing    til the music stops .    back  two  spin   they loves music .    forward  hop  turn   one and six  beetle crushers .    hop  back  spin           they   re coming out of the bracken .     shouted carpenter  as the sticks met again .      i see    em   two  three  forward  turn   carter   back  spin   you do a double   two  back   wandering angus down the middle           i   m losing it  jason .         play .    two  three  spin           they   re all round us .         dance .         they   re watching us .  they   re closing in .            spin  back   jump   we   re nearly at the road           jason .         remember when   three  turn   we won the cup against ohulan casuals .    spin        the sticks met  with a thump of wood against wood .  clods of earth were kicked into the night .      jason  you don   t mean              back  two   do it           carter   s getting   one  two   out of wind              two  spin           the accordion   s melting  jason     sobbed carter .         one  two  forward   bean setting .      the accordion wheezed .  the elves pressed in .  out of the corner of his eye jason saw a dozen grinning  fascinated faces .      jason .            one  two   carter into the middle   one  two  spin        seven pairs of boots thudded down        jason .            one  two   spin   ready   one  two   back   back   one  two   turn   kill   and back  one  two           the inn was a wreck .  the elves had stripped it of everything edible and rolled out every barrel  although a couple of rogue cheeses in the cellar had put up quite a fight .   the table had collapsed .  lobster claws and candlesticks lay among the ruined meal .   nothing moved .   then someone sneezed  and some soot fell into the empty grate  followed by nanny ogg and  eventually  by the small  black  and irate figure of casanunda .      yuk     said nanny  looking around at the debris .     this really is the pips .         you should have let me fight them .         there were too many of them  my lad .      casanunda threw his sword on the floor in disgust .      we were just getting to know one another properly and fifty elves burst into the place .  damn .  this kind of thing happens to me all the time .         that   s the best thing about black  it doesn   t show the soot     said nanny ogg vaguely  dusting herself off .     they managed it  then .  esme was right .  wonder where she is .  oh  well .  come on .         where   re we going .     said the dwarf .      down to my cottage .         ah .         to get my broomstick     said nanny ogg firmly .     i ain   t having the queen of the fairies ruling my children .  so we   d better get some help .  this has gone too far .         we could go up into the mountains     said casanunda  as they crept down the stairs .     there   s thousands of dwarfs up there .         no     said nanny ogg .     esme won   t thank me for this  but i   m the one who has to wave the bag o    sweets when she overreaches herself   and i   m thinking about someone who really hates the queen .         you won   t find anyone who hates her worse than dwarfs do     said casanunda .      oh  you will     said nanny ogg     if you knows where to look .         the elves had been into nanny ogg   s cottage  too .  there weren   t two pieces of furniture left whole .      what they don   t take they smash     said nanny ogg .   she stirred the debris with her foot .  glass tinkled .      that vase was a present from esme     she said  to the unfeeling world in general .     never liked it much .         why   d they do it .     said casanunda  looking around .      oh  they   d smash the world if they thought it   d make a pretty noise     said nanny .  she stepped outside again and felt around under the eaves of the low thatched roof  and pulled out her broomstick with a small grunt of triumph .      i always shove it up there     she said     otherwise the kids nick it and go joy riding .  you ride behind me  and i say this against my better judgement .      casanunda shuddered .  dwarfs are generally scared of heights  since they don   t often have the opportunity to get used to them .   nanny scratched her chin  making a sandpapery sound .      and we   ll need a crowbar     she said .     there   ll be one in jason   s forge .  hop on  my lad .         i really wasn   t expecting this     said casanunda  feeling his way on to the broomstick with his eyes shut .     i was looking forward to a convivial evening  just me and you .         it is just me and you .         yes  but i hadn   t assumed there   d be a broomstick involved .      the stick left the ground slowly .  casanunda clung miserably to the bristles .      where   re we going .     he said weakly .      place i know  up in the hills     said nanny .     ages since i   ve been there .  esme won   t go near it  and magrat   s too young to be tole .  i used to go there a lot  though .  when i was a girl .  girls used to go up there if they wanted to get   oh  bugger           what .         thought i saw something fly across the moon  and i   m damn sure it wasn   t esme .      casanunda tried to look around while keeping his eyes shut .      elves can   t fly     he muttered .      that   s all you know     said nanny .     they ride yarrow stalks .         yarrow stalks .         yep .  tried it meself  once .  you can get some lift out of    em  but it plays merry hell with the gussets .  give me a nice bundle of bristles every time .  anyway     she nudged casanunda     you should be right at home on one of these .  magrat says a broomstick is one of them sexual metaphor things .       casanunda had opened one eye just long enough to see a rooftop drift silently below him .  he felt sick .      the difference being     said nanny ogg     that a broomstick stays up longer .  and you can use it to keep the house clean  which is more than you can say for   are you all right .         i really don   t like this at all  mrs .  ogg .         just trying to cheer you up  mr .  casanunda .            cheer    i like  mrs .  ogg     said the dwarf     but can we avoid the    up    .         soon be down .         that i like .      nanny ogg   s boots scraped along the hard packed mud of the smithy   s yard .      i   ll leave the magic running  won   t be a mo     she said .  ignoring the dwarf   s bleat for help  she hopped off the stick and disappeared through the back door .   the elves hadn   t been there  at least .  too much iron .  she pulled a crowbar from the toolbench and hurried out again .      you can hold this     she said to casanunda .  she hesitated .     can   t have too much luck  can we .     she said  and scurried back into the forge .  this time she was out again much faster  slipping something into her pocket .      ready .     she said .      no .         then let   s go .  and keep a look out .  with your eyes open .         i   m looking for elves .     said casanunda  as the stick rose into the moonlight .      could be .  it wasn   t esme  and the only other one ever flying around here is mr .  ixolite the banshee  and he   s very good about slipping us a note under the door when he   s going to be about .  for air traffic control  see .      most of the town was dark .  the moonlight made a black and silver checkerboard across the country .  after a while  casanunda began to feel better about things .  the motion of the broomstick was actually quite soothing .      carried lots of passengers  have you .     he said .      on and off  yes     said nanny .   casanunda appeared to be thinking about things .  and then he said  in a voice dripping with scientific inquiry     tell me  has anyone ever tried to mak           no     said nanny ogg firmly .     you   d fall off .         you don   t know what i was going to ask .         bet you half a dollar .      they flew in silence for a couple of minutes  and then casanunda tapped nanny ogg on the shoulder .      elves at three o   clock .         that   s all right  then .  that   s hours away .         i mean they   re over there .      nanny squinted at the stars .  something ragged moved across the night .      oh  blast .         can   t you outfly them .         nope .  they can put a girdle round the world in forty minutes .         why .  it   s not that fat     said casanunda  who was feeling in the mood for a handful of dried frog pills .      i mean they   re fast .  we can   t outrun    em  even if we lost some weight .         i think i   m losing a tiny bit     said casanunda  as the broomstick dived toward the trees .   leaves scraped on nanny ogg   s boots .  moonlight glinted briefly off ash blond hair  away to her left .      bugger  bugger  bugger .      three elves were keeping station with the broomstick .  that was the thing about elves .  they chased you till you dropped  until your blood was curdling with dread  if a dwarf wanted you dead  on the other hand  they   d simply cut you in half with an axe first chance they got .  but that was because dwarfs were a lot nicer than elves .      they   re gaining on us .     said casanunda .      got the crowbar .         yes .         right        the broomstick zigzagged over the silent forest .  one of the elves drew its sword and swung down .  knock them down into the trees  leave them alive as long as possible     the broomstick went into reverse .  nanny ogg   s head and legs went forward  so that partly she was sitting on her hands but mainly she was sitting on nothing .  the elf swooped toward her  laughing     casanunda stuck out the crowbar .   there was a sound very like doioinng .   the broomstick jerked ahead again  dumping nanny ogg in casanunda   s lap .      sorry .         don   t mention it .  in fact  do it again if you like .         get him  did you .         took his breath away .         good .  where   re the others .         can   t see them .      casanunda grinned madly .      we showed them  eh .      something went zip and stuck into nanny ogg   s hat .      they know we   ve got iron     she said .     they won   t come close again .  they don   t need to     she added bitterly .   the broomstick swerved around a tree and plowed through some bracken .  then it swung out on to an overgrown path .      they aren   t following us anymore     said casanunda  after a while .     we   ve frightened them off  yes .         not us .  they   re nervy of going close to the long man .  it   s not their turf .  huh  look at the state of this path .  there   s trees growing in it now .  when i was a girl  you wouldn   t find a blade of grass growing on the path .     she smiled at a distant memory .     very popular place on a summer night  the long man was .      there was a change in the texture of the forest now .  it was old even by the standards of lancre forestry .  beards of moss hung from gnarled low branches .  ancient leaves crackled underfoot as the witch and the dwarf flew between the trees .  something heard them and crashed away through the thick undergrowth .  by the sound of it  it was something with horns .   nanny let the broomstick glide to a halt .      there     she said  pushing aside a bracken frond     the long man .         casanunda peered under her elbow .      is that all .  it   s just an old burial mound .         three old burial mounds     said nanny .   casanunda took in the overgrown landscape .      yes  i see them     he said .     two round ones and a long one .  well .         the first time i saw    em from the air     said nanny     i nearly fell off the bloody broomstick for laughin    .      there was one of those pauses known as the delayed drop while the dwarf worked out the topography of the situation .   then      blimey     said casanunda .     i thought the people who built burial mounds and earthworks and things were serious druids and people like that  not   not people who drew on privy walls with         tons of earth  in a manner of speaking .         doesn   t sound like you to be shocked by that sort of thing .      she could have sworn the dwarf was blushing under his wig .      well  there   s such a thing as style     said casanunda .     there   s such a thing as subtlety .  you don   t just shout  i   ve got a great big tonker .         it   s a bit more complicated than that     said nanny  pushing through the bushes .     here it   s the landscape saying  i   ve got a great big tonker .  that   s a dwarf word  is it .         yes .         it   s a good word .      casanunda tried to untangle himself from a briar .      esme doesn   t ever come up here     said nanny  from somewhere up ahead .     she says it   s bad enough about folksongs and maypoles and suchlike  without the whole scenery getting suggestive .     course     she went on     this was never intended as a women   s place .  my great gran said in the real old days the men used to come up for strange rites what no women ever saw .         except your great grandmother  who hid in the bushes     said casanunda .   nanny stopped dead .      how did you know that .         let   s just say i   m developing a bit of an insight into ogg womanhood as well  mrs .  ogg     said the dwarf .  a thorn bush had ripped his coat .      she said they just used to build sweat lodges and smell like a blacksmith   s armpit and drink scumble and dance around the fire with horns on and piss in the trees any old how     said nanny .     she said it was a bit sissy  to be honest .  but i always reckon a man   s got to be a man  even if it is sissy .  what happened to your wig .         i think it   s on that tree back there .         still got the crowbar .         yes  mrs .  ogg .         here we are  then .      they had arrived at the foot of the long mound .  there were three large irregular stones there  forming a low cave .  nanny ogg ducked under the lintel into the fusty and somewhat ammonia scented darkness .      about here   d do     she said .     got a match .      the sulfurous glow revealed a flat rock with a crude drawing scratched on it .  ochre had been rubbed into the lines .  they showed a figure of an owl eyed man wearing an animal skin and horns .   in the flickering light he seemed to dance .   there was a runic inscription underneath .      anyone ever worked out what that says .     said casanunda .   nanny ogg nodded .      it   s a variant of oggham     she said .     basically  it means    i   ve got a great big tonker .            oggham .     said the dwarf .      my family has been in these  how shall i put it  in these parts for a very long time     said nanny .      knowing you is a real education  mrs .  ogg     said casanunda .      everyone says that .  just shove the crowbar down the side of the stone  will you .  i   ve always wanted an excuse to go down there .         what is down there .         well  it leads into lancre caves .  they run everywhere  i   ve heard .  even up to copperhead .  there   s supposed to be an entrance in the castle  but i   ve never found it .  but mainly they lead to the world of the elves .         i thought the dancers led to the world of the elves .         this is the other world of the elves .         i thought they only had one .         they don   t talk about this one .         and you want to go into it .         yes .         you want to find elves .         that   s right .  now  are you going to stand here all night  or are you going to crowbar that stone .     she gave him a nudge .     there   s gold down there  you know .         oh  yes  thanks very much     said casanunda sarcastically .     that   s speciesist  that is .  just because i am   vertically disadvantaged  you   re trying to get round me with gold  yes .  dwarfs are just a lot of appetites on legs  that   s what you think .  hah .      nanny sighed .      oh  all right     she said .     tell you what   when we get back home  i   ll bake you some proper dwarf bread  how about that .      casanunda   s face split into a disbelieving grin .      real dwarf bread .         yes .  i reckon i   ve still got the recipe  and anyway it   s been weeks since i emptied out the cat box .          well  all right    .      casanunda rammed one end of the crowbar under the stone and pulled on it with dwarfish strength .  after a moment   s resistance the stone swung up .   there were steps below  thick with earth and old roots .   nanny started down them without a look back  and then realized that the dwarf wasn   t following .      what   s the matter .         never liked dark and enclosed spaces much .         what .  you   re a dwarf .         born a dwarf  born a dwarf .  but i even get nervous when i   m hiding in wardrobes .  that   s a bit of a drawback in my line of work .         don   t be daft .  i   m not scared .         you   re not me .         tell you what   i   ll bake    em with extra gravel .         ooh   you   re a temptress  mrs .  ogg .         and bring the torches .      the caves were dry  and warm .  casanunda trotted along after nanny  anxious to stay in the torchlight .      you haven   t been down here before .         no  but i know the way .      after a while casanunda began to feel better .  the caves were better than wardrobes .  for one thing  you weren   t tripping over shoes all the time  and there probably wasn   t much chance of a sword wielding husband opening the door .   in fact  he began to feel happy .   the words rose unbidden into his head  from somewhere in the back pocket of his genes .      hiho  hiho        nanny ogg grinned in the darkness .   the tunnel opened into a cavern .  the torchlight picked up the suggestion of distant walls .      this it .     said casanunda  gripping the crowbar .      no .  this is something else .  we   know about this place .  it   s mythical .         it   s not real .         oh  it   s real .  and mythical .      the torch flared .  there were hundreds of dustcovered slabs ranged around the cavern in a spiral  at the center of the spiral was a huge bell  suspended from a rope that disappeared into the darkness of the ceiling .  just under the hanging bell was one pile of silver coins and one pile of gold coins .      don   t touch the money     said nanny .        ere  watch this  my dad told me about this  it   s a good trick .      she reached out and tapped the bell very gently  causing a faint ting .   dust cascaded off the nearest slab .  what casanunda had thought was just a carving sat up  in a creaky way .  it was an armed warrior .  since he   d sat up he almost certainly was alive  but he looked as though he   d gone from life to rigor mortis without passing through death on the way .   he focused deepset eyes on nanny ogg .      what bloody tyme d   you call thys  then .         not time yet     said nanny .      what did you goe and bang the bell for .  i don   t know  i haven   t had a wynke of sleep for two hundred years  some sodde alwayes bangs the bell .  go awaye .      the warrior lay back .      it   s some old king and his warriors     whispered nanny  as they hurried away .     some kind of magical sleep  i   m told .  some old wizard did it .  they   re supposed to wake up for some final battle when a wolf eats the sun .         those wizards  always smoking something     said casanunda .      could be .  go right here .  always go right .         we   re walking in a circle .         a spiral .  we   re right under the long man now .         no  that can   t be right     said casanunda .     we climbed down a hole under the long man   hold on   you mean we   re in the place where we started and it   s a different place .         you   re getting the hang of this  i can see that .      they followed the spiral .   which  at length  brought them to a door  of sorts .   the air was hotter here .  red light glowed from side passages .   two massive stones had been set up against a rock wall  with a third stone across them .  animal skins hung across the crude entrance thus formed  wisps of steam curled around them .      they got put up at the same time as the dancers     said nanny  conversationally .     only the hole here   s vertical  so they only needed three .  might as well leave your crowbar here and take your boots off if they   ve got nails in    em .         these boots were stitched by the finest shoemaker in ankh morpork     said casanunda     and one day i shall pay him .      nanny pulled aside the skins .   steam billowed out .   there was darkness inside  thick and hot as treacle and smelling of a fox   s locker room .  as casanunda followed nanny ogg he sensed unseen figures in the reeking air  and heard the silence of murmured conversations suddenly curtailed .  at one point he thought he saw a bowl of red hot stones  and then a shadowy hand moved across them and upturned a ladle  hiding them in steam .   this can   t be inside the long man  he told himself .  that   s an earthworks  this is a long tent of skins .   they can   t both be the same thing .   he realized he was dripping with sweat .   two torches became visible as the steam swirled  their light hardly more than a red tint to the darkness .  but they were enough to show a huge sprawled figure lying by another bowl of hot stones .   it looked up .  antlers moved in the damp  clinging heat .      ah .  mrs .  ogg .      the voice was like chocolate .      y   lordship     said nanny .      i suppose it is too much to expect you to kneel .         yes indeed  y   honor     said nanny  grinning .      you know  mrs .  ogg  you have a way of showing respect to your god that would make the average atheist green with envy     said the dark figure .  it yawned .      thank you  y   grace .         no one even dances for me now .  is that too much to ask .         just as you say  y   lordship .         you witches don   t believe in me anymore .         right again  your hornishness .         ah  little mrs .  ogg   and how  having got in here  do you possibly think you are going to get out .     said the slumped one .      because i have iron     said nanny  her voice suddenly sharp .      of course you have not  little mrs .  ogg .  no iron can enter this realm .         i have the iron that goes everywhere     said nanny .   she took her hand out of her apron pocket  and held up a horseshoe .   casanunda heard scuffles around him  as the hidden elves fought to get out of the way .  more steam hissed up as a brazier of hot stones was overturned .      take it away .         i   ll take it away when i go     said nanny .     now you listen to me .  she   s making trouble again .  you   ve got to put a stop to it .  fair   s fair .  we   re not having all the old trouble again .         why should i do that .         you want her to be powerful  then .      there was a snort .      you can   t ever rule again  back in the world     said nanny .     there   s too much music .  there   s too much iron .         iron rusts .         not the iron in the head .      the king snorted .      nevertheless   even that   one day           one day .     nanny nodded .     yes .  i   ll drink to that .  one day .  who knows .  one day .  everyone needs    one day .     but it ain   t today .  d   you see .  so you come on out and balance things up .  otherwise  this is what i   ll do .  i   ll get    em to dig into the long man with iron shovels  y   see  and they   ll say  why  it   s just an old earthworks  and pensioned off wizards and priests with nothin    better to do will pick over the heaps and write dull old books about burial traditions and suchlike  and that   ll be another iron nail in your coffin .  and i   d be a little bit sorry about that     cos you know i   ve always had a soft spot for you .  but i   ve got kiddies  y   see  and they don   t hide under the stairs because they   re frit of the thunder  and they don   t put milk out for the elves  and they don   t hurry home because of the night  and before we go back to them dark old ways i   ll see you nailed .      the words sliced through the air .   the horned man stood up .  and further up .  his antlers touched the roof .   casanunda   s mouth dropped open .      so you see     said nanny  subsiding     not today .  one day  maybe .  you just stay down here and sweat it out    til one day .  but not today .         i   will decide .         very good .  you decide .  and i   ll be getting along .      the horned man looked down at casanunda .      what are you staring at  dwarf .      nanny ogg nudged casanunda .      go on  answer the nice gentleman .      casanunda swallowed .      blimey     he said     you don   t half look like your picture .         in a narrow little valley a few miles away a party of elves had found a nest of young rabbits which  in conjunction with a nearby antheap  kept them amused for a while .   even the meek and blind and voiceless have gods .   herne the hunted  god of the chased  crept through the bushes and wished fervently that gods had gods .   the elves had their backs to him as they hunkered down to watch closely .   herne the hunted crawled under a clump of bramble  tensed  and sprang .   he sank his teeth in an elf   s calf until they met  and was flung away as it screamed and turned .   he dropped and ran .   that was the problem .  he wasn   t built to fight  there was not an ounce of predator in him .  attack and run  that was the only option .   and elves could run faster .   he bounced over logs and skidded through drifts of leaves  aware even as his vision fogged that elves were overtaking him on either side  pacing him  waiting for him to     the leaves exploded .  the little god was briefly aware of a fanged shape  all arms and vengeance .  then there were a couple of disheveled humans  one of them waving an iron bar around its head .   herne didn   t wait to see what happened next .  he dived through the apparition   s legs and ran on  but a distant warcry echoed in his long  floppy ears      why  certainly  i   ll have your whelk .  how do we do it .  volume .         nanny ogg and casanunda walked in silence back to the cave entrance and the flight of steps .  finally  as they stepped out into the night air  the dwarf said     wow .         it leaks out even up here     said nanny .     very mackko place  this .         but i mean  good grief           he   s brighter than she is .  or more lazy     said nanny .     he   s going to wait it out .         but he was           they can look like whatever they want  to us     said nanny .     we see the shape we   ve given    em .     she let the rock drop back  and dusted off her hands .      but why should he want to stop her .         well  he   s her husband  after all .  he can   t stand her .  it   s what you might call an open marriage .         wait what out .     said casanunda  looking around to see if there were anymore elves .      oh  you know     said nanny  waving a hand .     all this iron and books and clockwork and universities and reading and suchlike .  he reckons it   ll all pass  see .  and one day it   ll all be over  and people   ll look up at the skyline at sunset and there he   ll be .      casanunda found himself turning to look at the sunset beyond the mound  half imagining the huge figure outlined against the afterglow .      one day he   ll be back     said nanny softly .     when even the iron in the head is rusty .      casanunda put his head on one side .  you don   t move around among a different species for most of your life without learning to read a lot of their body language  especially since it   s in such large print .      you won   t entirely be sorry  eh .     he said .      me .  i don   t want    em back .  they   re untrustworthy and cruel and arrogant parasites and we don   t need    em one bit .         bet you half a dollar .      nanny was suddenly flustered .      don   t you look at me like that .  esme   s right .  of course she   s right .  we don   t want elves anymore .  stands to reason .         esme   s the short one  is she .         hah  no  esme   s the tall one with the nose .  you know her .         right  yes .         the short one is magrat .  she   s a kind hearted soul and a bit soft .  wears flowers in her hair and believes in songs .  i reckon she   d be off dancing with the elves quick as a wink  her .         more doubts were entering magrat   s life .  they concerned crossbows  for one thing .  a crossbow is a very useful and usable weapon designed for speed and convenience and deadliness in the hands of the inexperienced  like a faster version of an out of code tv dinner .  but it is designed to be used once  by someone who has somewhere safe to duck while they reload .  otherwise it is just so much metal and wood with a piece of string on it .   then there was the sword .  despite shawn   s misgivings  magrat did in theory know what you did with a sword .  you tried to stick it into the enemy by a vigorous arm motion  and the enemy tried to stop you .  she was a little uncertain about what happened next .  she hoped you were allowed another go .   she was also having doubts about her armor .  the helmet and the breastplate were ok  but the rest of it was chain mail .  and  as shawn ogg knew  chain mail from the point of view of an arrow can be thought of as a series of loosely connected holes .   the rage was still there  the pure fury still gripped her at the core .  but there was no getting away from the fact that the heart it gripped was surrounded by the rest of magrat garlick  spinster of this parish and likely to remain so .   there were no elves visible in the town  but she could see where they had been .  doors hung off their hinges .  the place looked as though it had been visited by genghiz cohen .    now she was on the track that led to the stones .  it was wider than it had been  the horses and carriages had churned it on the way up  and the fleeing people had turned it into a mire on the way down .   she knew she was being watched  and it almost came as a relief when three elves stepped out from under the trees before she   d even lost sight of the castle .   the middle one grinned .      good evening  girl     it said .     my name is lord lankin  and you will curtsy when you talk to me .      the tone suggested that there was absolutely no possibility that she would disobey .  she felt her muscles strain to comply .   queen ynci wouldn   t have obeyed        i happen to be practically the queen     she said .   it was the first time she   d looked an elf in the face when she was in any condition to notice details .  this one was currently wearing high cheekbones and hair tied in a ponytail  it wore odds and ends of rags and lace and fur  confident in the knowledge that anything would look good on an elf .   it wrinkled its perfect nose at her .      there is only one queen in lancre     it said .     and you are  most definitely  not her .      magrat tried to concentrate .      where is she  then .     she said .   the other two raised their bows .      you are looking for the queen .  then we will take you to her     lankin stated .     and  lady  should you be inclined to make use of that nasty iron bow there are more archers hidden in the trees .      there was indeed a rustling in the trees on one side of the track  but it was followed by a thump .  the elves looked disconcerted .      get out of my way     said magrat .      i think you have a very wrong idea     said the elf .  its smile widened  but vanished when there was another sylvan crash from the other side of the track .      we felt you coming all the way up the track     said the elf .     the brave girl off to rescue her lover .  oh  the romance .  take her .      a shadow rose up behind the two armed elves  took a head in either hand  and banged them together .   the shadow stepped forward over their bodies and  as lankin turned  caught it with one roundarm punch that picked it up and slammed it into a tree .   magrat drew her sword .   whatever this was  it looked worse than elves .  it was muddy and hairy and almost troll like in its build  and it reached out for the bridle with an arm that seemed to extend forever .  she raised the sword        oook .         put the sword down  please  miss .      the voice came from somewhere behind her  but it sounded human and worried .  elves never sounded worried .      who are you .     she said  without turning around .  the monster in front of her gave her a big  yellow toothed grin .      um  i   m ponder stibbons .  a wizard .  and he   s a wizard  too .         he   s got no clothes on .         i could get him to have a bath  if you like     said ponder  slightly hysterically .     he always puts on an old green dressing gown when he   s had a bath .      magrat relaxed a bit .  no one who sounded like that could be much of a threat  except to themselves .      whose side are you on  mr .  wizard .         how many are there .         oook .         when i get off this horse     said magrat     it   ll bolt .  so can you ask your   friend to let go of the bridle .  he   ll be hurt .         oook .         um .  probably not .      magrat slid off .  the horse  relieved of the presence of iron  bolted .  for about two yards .      oook .      the horse was struggling to get back on its feet .   magrat blinked .      um  he   s just a bit annoyed at the moment     said ponder .     one of the   elves   shot him with an arrow .         but they do that to control people .         um .  he   s not a person .         oook .         genetically  i mean .      magrat had met wizards before .  occasionally one visited lancre  although they didn   t stay very long .  there was something about the presence of granny weatherwax that made them move on .   they didn   t look like ponder stibbons .  he   d lost most of his robe and  of his hat  only the brim remained .  most of his face was covered in mud  and there was a multicolored bruise over one eye .      did they do that to you .         well  the mud and the torn clothes is just from  you know  the forest .  and we   ve run into           ook .            over elves a few times .  but this is when the librarian hit me .         oook .         thank goodness     ponder added .     knocked me cold .  otherwise i   d be like the others .      a foreboding of a conversation to come swept over magrat .      what others .     she snapped .      are you alone .         what others .         have you any idea what   s been happening .      magrat thought about the castle  and the town .      i might be able to hazard a guess     she said .   ponder shook his head .      it   s worse than that     he said .      what others .     said magrat .      i think there   s definitely been a cross continuum breakthrough  and i   m sure there   s a difference in energy levels .         but what others .     magrat insisted .   ponder stibbons glanced nervously at the surrounding forest .      let   s get off the path .  there   s a lot more elves back there .      ponder disappeared into the undergrowth .  magrat followed him  and found a second wizard propped against a tree like a ladder .  he had a huge smile creasing his face .      the bursar     said ponder .     i think we may have overdone the dried frog pills a bit .     he raised his voice .     how   are   you   doing   sir .         why  i   ll have a little of the roast weasel  if you would be so good     said the bursar  beaming happily at nothing .      why   s he gone so stiff .     said magrat .      we think it   s some kind of side effect     said ponder .      can   t you do anything about it .         what  and have nothing to cross streams on .         call again tomorrow  baker  and we   ll have a crusty one .     said the bursar .      besides  he seems quite happy     said ponder .     are you a warrior  miss .         what .     said magrat .      well  i mean  the armor and everything        magrat looked down .  she was still holding the sword .  the helmet kept falling over her eyes  but she   d padded it a bit with a scrap of wedding dress .      i   er   yes .  yes  that   s right .  that   s what i am     she said .     absolutely .  yes .         here for the wedding  i expect .  like us .         that   s right .  definitely here for the wedding .  that   s true .     she changed her grip on the sword .     now tell me what happened     she said .     paying particular attention to what happened to the others .         well       ponder absentmindedly picked up a corner of his torn robe and began to screw it up in his fingers .     we all went to see this entertainment  you see .  a play .  you know .  acting .  and  and it was very funny .  there were all these yokels in their big boots and everything  straw wigs and everything  clumping around pretending to be lords and ladies and everything  and getting it all wrong .  it was very funny .  the bursar laughed at them a lot .  mind you  he   s been laughing at trees and rocks  too .  but everyone was having fun .  and then   and then           i want to know everything     said magrat .      well   well   then there was this bit i can   t really remember .  it was something to do with the acting  i think .  i mean  suddenly   suddenly it all seemed real .  do you know what i mean .         no .         there was this chap with a red nose and bandy legs and he was playing the queen of the fairies or something and suddenly he was still him but   everything felt   everything round me just vanished  there was just the actors   and there was this hill   i mean  they must have been good  because i really believed   i think at some point i remember someone asking us to clap our hands   and everyone was looking very strange and there was this singing and it was wonderful and   and           oook .         then the librarian hit me     said ponder simply .      why .         best if he tells it in his own words     said ponder .      oook ook eek .  ook .  ook .         cough  julia .  over the bender .     said the bursar .      i didn   t understand what the librarian said     said magrat .      um .  we were all present at an interdimensional rip     said ponder .     caused by belief .  the play was the last little thing that opened it up .  there must have been a very delicate area of instability very close .  it   s hard to describe  but if you had a rubber sheet and some lead weights i could demonstrate           you   re trying to tell me those   things exist because people believe in them .         oh  no .  i imagine they exist anyway .  they   re here because people believe in them here .         ook .         he ran off with us .  they shot an arrow at him .         eeek .         but it just made him itch .         ook .         normally he   s as gentle as a lamb .  really he is .         ook .         but he can   t abide elves .  they smell wrong to him .      the librarian flared his nostrils .   magrat didn   t know much about jungles  but she thought about apes in trees  smelling the rank of the tiger .  apes never admired the sleek of the fur and the burn of the eye  because they were too well aware of the teeth of the mouth .      yes     she said     i expect they would .  dwarfs and trolls hate them  too .  but i think they don   t hate them as much as i do .         you can   t fight them all     said ponder .     they   re swarming like bees up there .  there   s flying ones  too .  the librarian says they made people get fallen trees and things and push those  you know  those stones down .  there were some stones on the hill .  they attacked them .  don   t know why .         did you see any witches at the entertainment .     said magrat .      witches  witches       muttered ponder .      you couldn   t have missed them     said magrat .     there   d be a thin one glaring at everyone and a small fat one cracking nuts and laughing a lot .  and they   d be talking to each other very loudly .  and they   d both have tall pointy hats .         can   t say i noticed them     said ponder .      then they couldn   t have been there     said magrat .     being noticed is what being a witch is all about .     she was about to add that she   d never been good at it  but didn   t .  instead she said     i   m going on up there .         you   ll need an army  miss .  i mean  you   d have been in trouble just now if the librarian hadn   t been up in the trees .         but i haven   t got an army .  so i   m going to have to try by myself  aren   t i .      this time magrat managed to spur the horse into a gallop .   ponder watched her go .      you know  folksongs have got a lot to answer for     he said to the night air .      oook .         she   s going to get utterly killed .         oook .         hello  mr .  flowerpot  two pints of eels if you would be so good .         of course  it could be her destiny  or one of those sort of things .         oook .         millennium hand and shrimp .      ponder stibbons looked embarrassed .      anyone want to follow her .         oook .         whoops  there he goes with his big clock .         was that a    yes    .         oook .         not yours  his .         flobby wobbly  here comes our jelly .         i think that probably counts as a    yes        said ponder  reluctantly .      oook .         i   ve got a lovely new vest .         but look     said ponder     the graveyards are full of people who rushed in bravely but unwisely .         ook .         what   d he say .     said the bursar  passing briefly through reality on his way somewhere else .      i think he said     sooner or later the graveyards are full of everybody        said ponder .     oh  blast .  come on .         yes indeedy     said the bursar     hands up the mittens  mr .  bosun .         oh  shut up .         magrat dismounted and let the horse go .   she knew she was near the dancers now .  colored light flickered in the sky .   she wished she could go home .   the air was colder here  far too cold for a midsummer night .  as she plodded onward  flakes of snow swirled in the breeze and turned to rain .      ridcully materialized inside the castle  and then clung on to a pillar for support until he got his breath back .  transmigration always made blue spots appear in front of his eyes .   no one noticed him .  the castle was in turmoil .   not everyone had run home .  armies had marched across lancre many times over the last few thousand years  and the recollection of the castle   s thick safe walls had been practically engraved in the folk memory .  run to the castle .  and now it held most of the little country   s population .   ridcully blinked .  people were milling around and being harangued by a small young man in loose fitting chain mail and one arm in a sling  who seemed to be the only person with any grip on things .   when he was certain he could walk straight  ridcully headed toward him .      what   s going on  young       he began  and then stopped .  shawn ogg looked around .      the scheming minx .     said ridcully  to the air in general .        oh  go back and get it then     she said  and i fell right for it .  even if i could cut the mustard again i don   t know where we were .         sir .     said shawn .   ridcully shook himself .     what   s happening .     he said .      i don   t know .     said shawn  who was almost in tears .     i think we   re being attacked by elves .  nothing anyone   s telling me   s making any sense .  somehow they arrived during the entertainment .  or something .      ridcully looked around at the frightened  bewildered people .      and miss magrat   s gone out to fight them alone .      ridcully looked perplexed .      who   s miss magrat .         she   s going to be queen .  the bride .  you know .  magrat garlick .      ridcully   s mind could digest one fact at a time .      what   s she gone out for .         they captured the king .         did you know they   ve got esme weatherwax as well .         what  granny weatherwax .         i came back to rescue her     said ridcully  and then realized that this sounded either nonsense or cowardly .   shawn was too upset to notice .     i just hope they   re not collecting witches     he said .     they   ll need our mum to get the complete set .         they ain   t got me  then     said nanny ogg  behind him .      mum .  how did you get in .         broomstick .  you   d better get some people with bows up on the roof .  i came down that way .  so can others .         what   re we going to do  mum .         there   s bands of elves all over the place     said nanny     and there   s a big glow over the dancers           we must attack them .     shouted casanunda .     give    em a taste of cold steel .         good man  that dwarf .     said ridcully .     that   s right .  i   ll get my crossbow .         there   s too many of them     said nanny flatly .      granny and miss magrat are out there  mum     said shawn .     miss magrat came over all strange and put on armor and went out to fight all of them .         but the hills are crawling with elves     said nanny .     it   s a double helping of hell with extra devils .  certain death .         it   s certain death anyway     said ridcully .     that   s the thing about death  certainty .         we   d have no chance at all     said nanny .      actually  we   d have one chance     said ridcully .     i don   t understand all this continuinuinuum stuff  but from what young stibbons says it means that everything has to happen somewhere  d   y   see  so that means it could happen here .  even if it   s a million to one chance  ma   am .         that   s all very well     said nanny     but what you   re saying is  for every mr .  ridcully that survives tonight   s work          are going to get killed .         yes  but i   m not bothered about those other buggers     said ridcully .     they can look after themselves .  serve    em right for not inviting me to their weddings .         what .         nothing .      shawn was hopping from one foot to the other .      we ought to be fighting    em  mum .         look at everyone .     said nanny .     they   re dog tired and wet and confused .  that   s not an army .         mum  mum  mum .         what .         i   ll pussike    em up  mum .  that   s what you have to do before troops go into battle  mum .  i read about that in books .  you can take a rabble of thingy and make the right kind of speech and pussike them up and turn    em into a terrible fighting force  mum .         they look terrible anyway .         i mean terrible like fierce  mum .      nanny ogg looked at the hundred or so lancre subjects .  the thought of them managing to fight anyone at all took some getting used to .      you been studyin    this  shawn .     she inquired .      i   ve got five years    worth of bows and ammo  mum     said shawn reproachfully .      give it a try  then .  if you think it   ll work .      trembling with excitement  shawn climbed on to a table  drew his sword with his good hand  and banged it on the planks until people were silent .   he made a speech .   he pointed out that their king had been captured and their prospective queen had gone out to save him .  he pointed out their responsibility as loyal subjects .  he pointed out that other people currently not here but at home hiding under the bed would  after the glorious victory  wish they   d been there too instead of under the aforesaid bed which they were hiding under  you know  the bed he   d just mentioned .  in fact it was better that there were so few here to face the enemy  because that meant that there would be a higher percentage of honor per surviving head .  he used the word    glory    three times .  he said that in times to come people would look back on this day  whatever the date was  and proudly show their scars  at least those who   d survived would show their scars  and be very proud and probably have drinks bought for them .  he advised people to imitate the action of the lancre reciprocating fox and stiffen some sinews while leaving them flexible enough so   s they could move their arms and legs  in fact  probably it   d be better to relax them a bit now and stiffen them properly when the time came .  he suggested that lancre expected everyone to do their duty .  and um .  and uh .  please .   the silence that followed was broken by nanny ogg  who said     they   re probably considering it a bit  shawn .  why don   t you take mr .  wizard here up to his room and help him with his crossbow .      she nodded meaningfully in the direction of the stairs .   shawn wavered  but not for long .  he   d seen the glint in his mother   s eye .   when he   d gone  nanny climbed up on the same table .      well     she said     it   s like this .  if you go out there you may have to face elves .  but if you stops here  you definitely have to face me .  now  elves is worse than me  i   ll admit .  but i   m persistent .      weaver put up a tentative hand .      please  mrs .  ogg .         yes  weaver .         what exactly is the action of the reciprocating fox .      nanny scratched her ear .      as i recall     she said     its back legs go like this but its front legs go like this .         no  no  no     said quarney the storekeeper .     it   s its tail that goes like that .  its legs go like this .         that   s not reciprocating  that   s just oscillating     said someone .     you   re thinking of the ring tailed ocelot .      nanny nodded .      that   s settled  then     she said .      hold on  i   m not sure           yes  mr .  quarney .         oh   well           good  good     said nanny  as shawn reappeared .     they was just saying  our shawn  how they was swayed by your speech .  really pussiked up .         cor .         they   re ready to follow you into the jaws of hell itself  i expect     said nanny .   someone put up their hand .      are you coming too  mrs .  ogg .         i   ll just stroll along behind     said nanny .      oh .  well .  maybe as far as the jaws of hell  then .         amazing     said casanunda to nanny  as the crowd filed reluctantly toward the armory .      you just got to know how to deal with people .         they   ll follow where an ogg leads .         not exactly     said nanny     but if they know what   s good for    em they   ll go where an ogg follows .         magrat stepped out from under the trees  and the moorland lay ahead of her .   a whirlpool of cloud swirled over the dancers  or at least  over the place where the dancers had been .  she could make out one or two stones by the flickering light  lying on their side or rolled down the slope of the hill .   the hill itself glowed .  something was wrong with the landscape .  it curved where it shouldn   t curve .  distances weren   t right .  magrat remembered a woodcut shoved in as a place marker in one of her old books .  it showed the face of an old crone but  if you stared at it  you saw it was also the head of a young woman  a nose became a neck  an eyebrow became a necklace .  the images seesawed back and forth .  and like everyone else  she   d squinted herself silly trying to see them both at the same time .   the landscape was doing pretty much the same thing .  what was a hill was also at the same time a vast snowbound panorama .  lancre and the land of the elves were trying to occupy the same space .   the intrusive country wasn   t having it all its own way .  lancre was fighting back .   there was a circle of tents just on the cusp of the warring landscapes  like a beachhead on an alien shore .  they were brightly colored .  everything about the elves was beautiful  until the image tilted  and you saw it from the other side     something was happening .  several elves were on horseback  and more horses were being led between the tents .   it looked as though they were breaking camp .      the queen sat on a makeshift throne in her tent .  she sat with her elbow resting on one arm of the throne and her fingers curling pensively around her mouth .   there were other elves seated in a semicircle  except that    seated    was a barely satisfactory word .  they lounged  elves could make themselves at home on a wire .  and here there was more lace and velvet and fewer feathers  although it was hard to know if it meant that these were aristocrats   elves seemed to wear whatever they felt like wearing  confident of looking absolutely stunning .    every one of them watched the queen  and was a mirror of her moods .  when she smiled  they smiled .  when she said something she thought was amusing  they laughed .   currently the object of her attention was granny weatherwax .      what is happening  old woman .     she said .      it ain   t easy  is it .     said granny .     thought it would be easy  didn   t you .         you   ve done some magic  haven   t you .  something is fighting us .         no magic     said granny .     no magic at all .  it   s just that you   ve been away too long .  things change .  the land belongs to humans now .         that can   t be the case     said the queen .     humans take .  they plough with iron .  they ravage the land .         some do  i   ll grant you that .  others put back more   n they take .  they put back love .  they   ve got soil in their bones .  they tell the land what it is .  that   s what humans are for .  without humans  lancre   d just be a bit of ground with green bits on it .  they wouldn   t even know they   re trees .  we   re all down here together  madam   us and the land .  it   s not just land anymore  it   s a country .  it   s like a horse that   s been broken and shod or a dog that   s been tamed .  every time people put a plough in the soil or planted a seed they took the land further away from you     said granny .     things change .      verence sat beside the queen .  his pupils were tiny pinpoints  he smiled faintly  permanently  in a way very reminiscent of the bursar .      ah .  but when we are married     said the queen     the land must accept me .  by your own rules .  i know how it works .  there   s more to being a king than wearing a crown .  the king and the land are one .  the king and the queen are one .  and i shall be queen .      she smiled at granny .  there was an elf on either side of her and  granny knew  at least one behind her .  elves were not given to introspection  if she moved without permission  she   d die .      what you shall be is something i have yet to decide     said the queen .  she held up an exquisitely thin hand and curled the thumb and forefinger into a ring  which she held up to her eye .      and now someone comes     she said     with armor that doesn   t fit and a sword she cannot use and an axe she can hardly even lift  because it is so romantic  is it not .  what is her name .         magrat garlick     said granny .      she is a mighty enchantress  is she .         she   s good with herbs .      the queen laughed .      i could kill her from here .         yes     said granny     but that wouldn   t be much fun  would it .  humiliation is the key .      the queen nodded .      you know  you think very much like an elf .         i think it will soon be dawn     said granny .     a fine day .  clear light .         not soon enough .     the queen stood up .  she glanced at king verence for a moment  and changed .  her dress went from red to silver  catching the torchlight like glittering fish scales .  her hair unraveled and reshaped itself  became corn blond .  and a subtle ripple of alterations flowed across her face before she said     what do you think .      she looked like magrat .  or  at least  like magrat wished she looked and maybe as verence always thought of her .  granny nodded .  as one expert to another  she recognized accomplished nastiness when she saw it .      and you   re going to face her like that     she said .      certainly .  eventually .  at the finish .  but don   t feel sorry for her .  she   s only going to die .  would you like me to show you what you might have been .         no .         i could do it easily .  there are other times than this .  i could show you grandmother weatherwax .         no .         it must be terrible  knowing that you have no friends .  that no one will care when you die .  that you never touched a heart .         yes .         and i   m sure you think about it   in those long evenings when there   s no company but the ticking of the clock and the coldness of the room and you open the box and look at        the queen waved a hand vaguely as granny tried to break free .      don   t kill her     she said .     she is much more fun alive .         magrat stuck the sword in the mud and hefted the battleaxe .   woods pressed in on either side .  the elves would have to come this way .  there looked like hundreds of them and there was only one magrat garlick .   she knew there was such a thing as heroic odds .  songs and ballads and stories and poems were full of stories about one person single handedly taking on and defeating a vast number of enemies .   only now was it dawning on her that the trouble was that they were songs and ballads and stories and poems because they dealt with things that were  not to put too fine a point on it  untrue .   she couldn   t  now she had time to think about it  ever remember an example from history .   in the woods to one side of her an elf raised its bow and took careful aim .   a twig snapped behind it .  it turned .   the bursar beamed .      whoopsy daisy  old trouser  my bean   s all runny .      the elf swung the bow .   a pair of prehensile feet dropped out of the greenery  gripped it by the shoulders  and pulled it upward sharply .  there was a crack as its head hit the underside of a branch .      oook .         move right along .      on the other side of the path another elf took aim .  and then its world flowed away from it     this is the inside of the mind of an elf   here are the normal five senses but they are all subordinate to the sixth sense .  there is no formal word for it on the discworld  because the force is so weak that it is only ever encountered by observant blacksmiths  who call it the love of iron .  navigators might have discovered it were it not that the disc   s standing magical field is much more reliable .  but bees sense it  because bees sense everything .  pigeons navigate by it .  and everywhere in the multiverse elves use it to know exactly where they are .   it must be hard for humans  forever floundering through inconvenient geography .  humans are always slightly lost .  it   s a basic characteristic .  it explains a lot about them .   elves are never lost at all .  it   s a basic characteristic .  it explains a lot about them .   elves have absolute position .  the flow of the silvery force dimly outlines the landscape .  creatures generate small amounts of it themselves  and become perceptible in the flux .  their muscles crackle with it  their minds buzz with it .  for those who learn how  even thoughts can be read by the tiny local changes in the flow .   for an elf  the world is something to reach out and take .  except for the terrible metal that drinks the force and deforms the flux universe like a heavy weight on a rubber sheet and blinds them and deafens them and leaves them rudderless and more alone than most humans could ever be     the elf toppled forward .   ponder stibbons lowered the sword .   almost everyone else would not have thought much about it .  but ponder   s wretched fate was to look for patterns in an uncaring world .      but i hardly touched him     he said  to no one except himself .            and i kissed her in the shrubbery where the nightingales      sing it  you bastards .  two  three .      they didn   t know where they were .  they didn   t know where they   d been .  they were not fully certain who they were .  but the lancre morris men had reached some sort of state now where it was easier to go on than stop .  singing attracted elves  but singing also fascinated them     the dancers whirled and hopped  gyrated and skipped along the paths .  they pranced through isolated hamlets  where elves left whoever they were torturing to draw closer in the light of the burning buildings           with a wack foladiddle di do  sing too rahli ay .         six sticks did their work  right on the beat .      where   re we goin     jason .         i reckon we   ve gone down slippery hollow and   re circling back toward the town     said jason  hopping past baker .     keep goin     carter .         the rain   s got in the keys  jason .         don   t matter .  they don   t know the difference .  it   s good enough for folk music .         i think i broke my stick on that last one  jason .         just you keep dancing  tinker .  now  lads   how about gathering peasecods .  we might as well get some practice in  since we   re here           there   s some people up ahead     said tailor  as he skipped past     i can see torches an    that .         human  two  three  or more elves .         dunno .      jason spun and danced back .      is that you  our jason .      jason cackled as the voice echoed among the dripping trees .      it   s our mam .  and our shawn .  and   and lots of people .  we   ve made it  lads .         jason     said carter .      yes .         i ain   t sure i can stop .         the queen examined her face in a mirror attached to the tent pole .      why .     said granny .     what is it you see .         whatever i want to see     said the queen .     you know that .  and now   let us ride to the castle .  tie her hands together .  but leave her legs free .         it rained again  gently  although around the stones it turned to sleet .  the water dripped off magrat   s hair and temporarily unraveled the tangles .   mist coiled out from among the trees where summer and winter fought .   magrat watched the elven court mount up .  she made out the figure of verence  moving like a puppet .  and granny weatherwax  tied behind the queen   s horse by a long length of rope .   the horses splashed through the mud .  they had silver bells on their harness  dozens of them .   the elves in the castle  the night of ghosts and shadows  all of this was just a hard knot in her memory .  but the jingling of the bells was like a nailfile rubbed across her teeth .   the queen halted the procession a few yards away .      ah  the brave girl     she said .     come to save her fianc    all alone .  how sweet .  someone kill her .      an elf spurred its horse forward  and raised its sword .  magrat gripped the battleaxe .   somewhere behind her a bowstring slammed against wood .  the elf jerked .  so did one behind it .  the arrow kept going  curving a little as it passed over one of the fallen dancers .   then shawn ogg   s ragbag army charged out from under the trees  except for ridcully  who was feverishly trying to rewind his crossbow .   the queen did not look surprised .      and there   s only about a hundred of them     she said .     what do you think  esme weatherwax .  a valiant last stand .  it   s so beautiful  isn   t it .  i love the way humans think .  they think like songs .         you get down off that horse .     magrat shouted .   the queen smiled at her .   shawn felt it .  ridcully felt it .  ponder felt it .  the glamour swept over them .   elves feared iron  but they didn   t need to go near it .   you couldn   t fight elves  because you were so much more worthless than them .  it was right that you should be so worthless .  and they were so beautiful .  and you weren   t .  you were always the one metaphorically picked last for any team  even after the fat kid with one permanently blocked runny nostril  you were always the one who wasn   t told the rules until you   d lost  and then wasn   t told the new rules  you were the one who always knew that everything interesting was happening to other people .  all those hot self consuming feelings were rolled together .  you couldn   t fight an elf .  someone as useless as you  as stolid as you  as human as you  could never win  the universe wasn   t built like that     hunters say that  just sometimes  an animal will step out of the bushes and stand there waiting for the spear     magrat managed to half raise the axe  and then her hand slumped to her side .  she looked down .  the correct attitude of a human before an elf was one of shame .  she had shouted so coarsely at something as beautiful as an elf     the queen dismounted and walked over to her .      don   t touch her     said granny .   the queen nodded .      you can resist     she said .     but you see  it doesn   t matter .  we can take lancre without a fight .  there is nothing you can do about it .  look at the brave little army  standing like sheep .  humans are so enthusiastic .      granny looked at her boots .      you can   t rule while i   m alive     she said .      there   s no trickery here     said the queen .     no silly women with bags of sweets .         you noticed that  did you .     said granny .     gytha meant well  i expect .  daft old biddy .  mind if i sit down .         of course you may     said the queen .     you are an old woman now  after all .      she nodded to the elves .  granny subsided gratefully on to a rock  her hands still tied behind her .      that   s the thing about witchcraft     she said .     it doesn   t exactly keep you young  but you do stay old for longer .  whereas you  of course  do not age     she added .      indeed  we do not .         but i suspect you may be capable of being reduced .      the queen   s smile didn   t vanish  but it did freeze  as smiles do when their owner is not certain about what has just been said and isn   t sure what to say next .      you meddled in a play     said granny .     i believe you don   t realize what you   ve done .  plays and books   you   ve got to keep an eye on the buggers .  they   ll turn on you .  i mean to see that they do .     she nodded amicably at an elf covered in woad and badly tanned skins .     ain   t that so  fairy peaseblossom .      the queen   s brows knotted .      but that is not his name     she said .   granny weatherwax gave the queen a bright smile .      we shall see     she said .     there   s a lot more humans these days  and lots of them live in cities  and they don   t know much about elves one way or another .  and they   ve got iron in their heads .  you   re too late .         no .  humans always need us     said the queen .      they don   t .  sometimes they want you .  that   s different .  but all you can give    em is gold that melts away in the morning .         there are those who would say that gold for one night is enough .         no .         better than iron  you stupid old hag  you stupid child who has grown older and done nothing and been nothing .         no .  it   s just soft and shiny .  pretty to look at and no damn use at all     said granny  her voice still quite calm and level .     but this is a real world  madam .  that   s what i had to learn .  and real people in it .  you got no right to    em .  people   ve got enough to cope with just being people .  they don   t need you swanking around with your shiny hair and shiny eyes and shiny gold  going sideways through life  always young  always singing  never learning .         you didn   t always think like this .         that was a long time ago .  and  my lady  old i may be  and hag i may be  but stupid i ain   t .  you   re no kind of goddess .  i ain   t against gods and goddesses  in their place .  but they   ve got to be the ones we make ourselves .  then we can take    em to bits for the parts when we don   t need    em anymore  see .  and elves far away in fairyland  well  maybe that   s something people need to get    emselves through the iron times .  but i ain   t having elves here .  you make us want what we can   t have and what you give us is worth nothing and what you take is everything and all there is left for us is the cold hillside  and emptiness  and the laughter of the elves .      she took a deep breath .     so bugger off .         make us  old woman .         i thought you   d say that .         we don   t want the world .  just this little kingdom will do .  and we will take it  whether it wants us or not .         over my dead body  madam .         if that is a condition .      the queen lashed out mentally  like a cat .   granny weatherwax winced  and leaned backward for a moment .      madam .         yes .     said the queen .      there aren   t any rules  are there .         rules .  what are rules .     said the queen .      i thought so     said granny .     gytha ogg .      nanny managed to turn her head .      yes  esme .         my box .  you know .  the one in the dresser .  you   ll know what to do .      granny weatherwax smiled .  the queen swayed sideways  as if she   d been slapped .      you have learned     she said .      oh  yes .  you know i never entered your circle .  i could see where it led .  so i had to learn .  all my life .  the hard way .  and the hard way   s pretty hard  but not so hard as the easy way .  i learned .  from the trolls and the dwarfs and from people .  even from pebbles .      the queen lowered her voice .      you will not be killed     she whispered .     i promise you that .  you   ll be left alive  to dribble and gibber and soil yourself and wander from door to door for scraps .  and they   ll say  there goes the mad old woman .         they say that now     said granny weatherwax .     they think i can   t hear .         but inside     said the queen  ignoring this     inside i   ll keep just a part of you which looks out through your eyes and knows what you   ve become .      and there will be none to help     said the queen .  she was closer now  her eyes pinpoints of hatred .     no charity for the mad old woman .  you   ll see what you have to eat to stay alive .  and we   ll be with you all the time inside your head  just to remind you .  you could have been the great one  there was so much you could have done .  and inside you   ll know it  and you   ll plead all the dark night long for the silence of the elves .      the queen wasn   t expecting it .  granny weatherwax   s hand shot out  pieces of rope falling away from it  and slapped her across the face .      you threaten me with that .     she said .     me .  who am becoming old .      the elf woman   s hand rose slowly to the livid mark across her cheek .  the elves raised their bows  waiting for an order .      go back     said granny .     you call yourself some kind of goddess and you know nothing  madam  nothing .  what don   t die can   t live .  what don   t live can   t change .  what don   t change can   t learn .  the smallest creature that dies in the grass knows more than you .  you   re right .  i   m older .  you   ve lived longer than me but i   m older than you .  and better   n you .  and  madam  that ain   t hard .      the queen struck wildly .   the rebounded force of the mental blow knocked nanny ogg to her knees .  granny weatherwax blinked .      a good one     she croaked .     but still i stand  and still i   ll not kneel .  and still i have strength        an elf keeled over .  this time the queen swayed .      oh  and i have no time for this     she said  and snapped her fingers .   there was a pause .  the queen glanced around at her elves .      they can   t fire     said granny .     and you wouldn   t want that  would you .  so simple an end .         you can   t be holding them .  you have not that much power .         do you want to find out how much power i have  madam .  here  on the grass of lancre .      she stepped forward .  power crackled in the air .  the queen had to step back .      my own turf .     said granny .   she slapped the queen again  almost gently .      what   s this .     said granny weatherwax .     can   t you resist me .  where   s your power now  madam .  gather your power  madam .         you foolish old crone .      it was felt by every living creature for a mile around .  small things died .  birds spiraled out of the sky .  elves and humans alike dropped to the ground  clutching their heads .   and in granny weatherwax   s garden the bees rose out of their hives .   they emerged like steam  colliding with one another in their rush to get airborne .  the deep gunship hum of the drones underpinned the frantic roars of the workers .   but  louder than the drones  was the piccolo piping of the queens .   the swarms spiraled up over the clearing  circled once  and then broke and headed away .  others joined them  out of backyard skeps and hollow trees  blackening the sky .   after a while  order became apparent in the great circling cloud .  the drones flew on the wings  throbbing like bombers .  the workers were a cone made up of thousands of tiny bodies .  and at its tip  a hundred queens flew .   the fields lay silent after the arrow shaped swarm of swarms had gone .   flowers stood alone and uncourted .  nectar flowed undrunk .  blossoms were left to go fertilize themselves .   the bees headed toward the dancers .      granny weatherwax dropped to her knees  clutching at her head .      no           oh  but yes     said the queen .   esme weatherwax raised her hands .  the fingers were curled tightly with effort and pain .   magrat found she could move her eyes .  the rest of her felt weak and useless  even with chain mail and the breastplates .  so this was it .  she could feel the ghost of queen ynci laughing scornfully from a thousand years ago .  she   d not give up .  magrat was just another one of those dozens of simpering stiff women who   d just hung around in long dresses  ensuring the royal succession     bees poured down out of the sky .   granny weatherwax turned her face toward magrat .   magrat heard the voice clearly in her head .      you want to be queen .      and she was free .   she felt the weariness drop away from her and it also felt as though pure queen ynci poured out of the helmet .   more bees rained down  covering the slumped figure of the old witch .   the queen turned  and her smile froze as magrat straightened up  stepped forward and  with hardly a thought in her head  raised the battleaxe and brought it around in one long sweep .   the queen moved faster .  her hand snaked out and gripped magrat   s wrist .      oh yes     she said  grinning into magrat   s face .     really .  you think so .      she twisted .  the axe dropped from magrat   s fingers .      and you wanted to be a witch .      bees were a brown fog  hiding the elves   too small to hit  impervious to glamour  but determined to kill .   magrat felt the bone scrape .      the old witch is finished     said the queen  forcing magrat down .     i won   t say she wasn   t good .  but she wasn   t good enough .  and you certainly aren   t .      slowly and inexorably  magrat was forced downward .      why don   t you try some magic .     said the queen .   magrat kicked .  her foot caught the queen on the knee  and she heard a crack .  as she staggered back magrat launched herself forward and caught her around the waist  bearing her to the ground .   she was amazed at the lightness .  magrat was skinny enough  but the queen seemed to have no weight at all .      why     she said  pulling herself up until the queen   s face was level with hers     you   re nothing .  it   s all in the mind  isn   t it .  without the glamour  you   re           an almost triangular face  a tiny mouth  the nose hardly existing at all  but eyes larger than human eyes and now focused on magrat in pinpoint terror .      iron     whispered the queen .  her hands gripped magrat   s arms .  there was no strength there .  an elf   s strength lay in persuading others they were weak .   magrat could feel her desperately trying to enter her mind  but it wasn   t working .  the helmet        was lying several feet away  in the mud .   she just had time to wish she hadn   t noticed that before the queen attacked again  exploding into her uncertainty like a nova .   she was nothing .  she was insignificant .  she was so worthless and unimportant that even something completely worthless and exhaustively unimportant would consider her beneath contempt .  in laying hands upon the queen she truly deserved an eternity of pain .  she had no control of her body .  she did not deserve any .  she did not deserve a thing .   the disdain sleeted over her  tearing the planetary body of magrat garlick to pieces .   she   d never be any good .  she   d never be beautiful  or intelligent  or strong .  she   d never be anything at all .   self confidence .  confidence in what .   the eyes of the queen were all she could see .  all she wanted to do was lose herself in them     and the ablation of magrat garlick roared on  tearing at the strata of her soul        exposing the core .   she bunched up a fist and hit the queen between the eyes .   there was a moment of terminal perplexity before the queen screamed  and magrat hit her again .   only one queen in a hive .  slash .  stab .   they rolled over  landing in the mud .  magrat felt something sting her leg  but she ignored it .  she took no notice of the noise around her  but she did find the battleaxe under her hand as the two of them landed in a peat puddle .  the elf scrabbled at her but this time without strength  and magrat managed to push herself to her knees and raise the axe        and then noticed the silence .   it flowed over the queen   s elves and shawn ogg   s makeshift army as the glamour faded .   there was a figure silhouetted against the setting moon .   its scent carried on the dawn breeze .   it smelled of lions    cages and leaf mold .      he   s back     said nanny ogg .  she glanced sideways and saw ridcully  his face glowing  raising his crossbow .      put it down     she said .      will you look at the horns on that thing           put it down .         but           it   d go right through him .  look  you can see that tree through him .  he   s not really here .  he can   t get past the doorway .  but he can send his thoughts .         but i can smell           if he was really here  we wouldn   t still be standing up .      the elves parted as the king walked through .  his hind legs hadn   t been designed for bipedal walking  the knees were the wrong way round and the hooves were over large .   it ignored them all and strutted slowly to the fallen queen .  magrat pulled herself to her feet and hefted the axe uncertainly .   the queen uncoiled  leaping up and raising her hands  her mouth framing the first words of some curse     the king held out a hand  and said nothing .   only magrat heard it .   something about meeting by moonlight  she said later .      and they awoke .   the sun was well over the rim .  people pulled themselves to their feet  staring at one another .   there was not an elf in sight .   nanny ogg was the first to speak .  witches can generally come to terms with what actually is  instead of insisting on what ought to be .   she looked up at the moors .     the first thing we do     she said     the first thing  is put back the stones .         the second thing     corrected magrat .   they both looked down at the still body of granny weatherwax .  a few stray bees were flying disconsolate circles in the grass near her head .   nanny ogg winked at magrat .      you did well there  girl .  didn   t think you had it in you to survive an attack like that .  it fairly had me widdling myself .         i   ve had practice     said magrat darkly .   nanny ogg raised her eyebrows  but made no further comment .  instead she nudged granny with her boot .      wake up  esme     she said .     well done .  we won .         esme .      ridcully knelt down stiffly and picked up one of granny   s arms .      it must have taken it out of her  all that effort     burbled nanny .     freeing magrat and everything        ridcully looked up .      she   s dead     he said .   he thrust both arms underneath the body and got unsteadily to his feet .      oh  she wouldn   t do a thing like that     said nanny  but in the voice of someone whose mouth is running on automatic because their brain has shut down .      she   s not breathing and there   s no pulse     said the wizard .      she   s probably just resting .         yes .      bees circled  high in the blue sky .      ponder and the librarian helped drag the stones back into position  occasionally using the bursar as a lever .  he was going through the rigid phase again .   they were unusual stones  ponder noticed   quite hard  and with a look about them that suggested that once  long ago  they had been melted and cooled .   jason ogg found him standing deep in thought by one of them .  he was holding a nail on a piece of string .  but  instead of hanging from the string  the nail was almost at right angles  and straining as if desperate to reach the stone .  the string thrummed .  ponder watched it as though mesmerized .   jason hesitated .  he seldom encountered wizards and wasn   t at all sure how you were supposed to treat them .   he heard the wizard say     it sucks .  but why does it suck .      jason kept quiet .   he heard ponder say     maybe there   s iron and   and iron that loves iron .  or male iron and female iron .  or common iron and royal iron .  some iron contains something else .  some iron makes a weight in the world and other iron rolls down the rubber sheet .      the bursar and the librarian joined him  and watched the swinging nail .      damn .     said ponder  and let go of the nail .  it hit the stone with a plink .   he turned to the others with the agonized expression of a man who has the whole great whirring machinery of the universe to dismantle and only a bent paper clip to do it with .      what ho  mr .  sunshine .     said the bursar  who was feeling almost cheerful with the fresh air and lack of shouting .      rocks .  why am i messing around with lumps of stone .  when did they ever tell anyone anything .     said ponder .     you know  sir  sometimes i think there   s a great ocean of truth out there and i   m just sitting on the beach playing with   with stones .      he kicked the stone .      but one day we   ll find a way to sail that ocean     he said .  he sighed .     come on .  i suppose we   d better get down to the castle .      the librarian watched them join the procession of tired men who were staggering down the valley .   then he pulled at the nail a few times  and watched it fly back to the stone .      oook .      he looked up into the eyes of jason ogg .   much to jason   s surprise  the orang utan winked .   sometimes  if you pay real close attention to the pebbles you find out about the ocean .      the clock ticked .   in the chilly morning gloom of granny weatherwax   s cottage  nanny ogg opened the box .   everyone in lancre knew about esme weatherwax   s mysterious box .  it was variously rumored to contain books of spells  a small private universe  cures for all ills  the deeds of lost lands and several tons of gold  which was pretty good going for something less than a foot across .  even nanny ogg had never been told about the contents  apart from the will .   she was a bit disappointed but not at all surprised to find that it contained nothing more than a couple of large envelopes  a bundle of letters  and a miscellaneous assortment of common items in the bottom .   nanny lifted out the paperwork .  the first envelope was addressed to her  and bore the legend  to gytha ogge  reade this nowe .   the second envelope was a bit smaller and said  the will of esmerelda weatherwax  died midsummer   s eve .   and then there was a bundle of letters with a bit of string round them .  they were very old  bits of yellowing paper crackled off them as magrat picked them up .      they   re all letters to her     she said .      nothing odd about that     said nanny .     anyone can get letters .         and there   s all this stuff at the bottom     said magrat .     it looks like pebbles .      she held one up .      this one   s got one of those curly fossil things in it     she said .     and this one   looks like that red rock the dancers were made of .  it   s got a darning needle stuck to it .  how strange .         she always paid attention to small details  did esme .  always tried to see inside to the real thing .      they were both silent for a moment  and the silence wound out around them and filled the kitchen  to be sliced into gentle pieces by the soft ticking of the clock .      i never thought we   d be doing this     said magrat  after a while .     i never thought we   d be reading her will .  i thought she   d keep on going forever .         well  there it is     said nanny .     tempus fuggit .         nanny .         yes  love .         i don   t understand .  she was your friend but you don   t seem   well   upset .         well  i   ve buried a few husbands and one or two kiddies .  you get the hang of it .  anyway  if she hasn   t gone to a better place she   ll damn well be setting out to improve it .         nanny .         yes  love .         did you know anything about the letter .         what letter .         the letter to verence .         don   t know anything about any letter to verence .         he must have got it weeks before we got back .  she must have sent it even before we got to ankh morpork .      nanny ogg looked  as far as magrat could tell  genuinely blank .      oh  hell     said magrat .     i mean this letter .      she fished it out of the breastplate .      see .      nanny ogg read      dear sire  this is to inform youe that magrate garlick will bee retouning to lancre on or aboute blind pig tuesday .  shee is a wet hen but

noone like magrat for getting in the way of her own life .  she does not knoe her own mind .  you aere kinge and you can doe what you like .  you muste present her with a fate accompli .  ps .  i hear there is talk aboute making witches pay tax  no kinges of lancre has tried this for many a year  you could profit from their example .  yrs .  in good health  at the moment .  a friend  mss  .      the ticking of the clock stitched the blanket of silence .   nanny ogg turned to look at it .      she arranged it all .     said magrat .     you know what verence is like .  i mean  she hardly disguised who she was  did she .  and i got back and it was all arranged           what would you have done if nothing had been arranged .     said nanny .   magrat looked momentarily taken aback .      well  i would   i mean  if he had   i   d           you   d be getting married today  would you .     said nanny  but in a distant voice  as if she was thinking about something else .      well  that depends on           you want to  don   t you .         well  yes  of course  but           that   s nice  then     said nanny  in what magrat thought of as her nursery voice .      yes  but she pushed me on one side and shut me up in the castle and i got so wound up           you were so angry that you actually stood up to the queen .  you actually laid hands on her     said nanny .     well done .  the old magrat wouldn   t have done that  would she .  esme could always see the real thing .  now nip out of the back door and look at the log pile  there   s a love .         but i hated her and hated her and now she   s dead .         yes  dear .  now go and tell nanny about the log pile .      magrat opened her mouth to frame the words    i happen to be very nearly queen    but decided not to .  instead she graciously went outside and looked at the log pile .      it   s quite high     she said  coming back and blowing her nose .     looks like it   s just been stacked .         and she wound up the clock yesterday     said nanny .     and the tea caddy   s half full  i just looked .         well .         she wasn   t sure     said nanny .     hmm .      she opened the envelope addressed to her .  it was larger and flatter than the one holding the will  and contained a single piece of card .   nanny read it  and let it drop on to the table .      come on     she said .     we ain   t got much time .         what   s the matter .         and bring the sugar bowl .      nanny wrenched open the door and hurried toward her broomstick .      come on .      magrat picked up the card .  the writing was familiar .  she   d seen it several times before  when calling on granny weatherwax unexpectedly .   it said  i ate   nt dead .         halt .  who goes there .         what   re you doing on guard with your arm in a sling  shawn .         duty calls  mum .         well  let us in right now .         are you friend or foe  mum .         shawn  this is almost queen magrat here with me  all right .         yes  but you   ve got to           right now .         oooaaaww  mum .         magrat tried to keep up with nanny as she scurried through the castle .      the wizard was right .  she was dead  you know .  i don   t blame you for hoping  but i can tell when people are dead .         no  you can   t .  i remember a few years ago you came running down to my house in tears and it turned out she was just off borrowing .  that   s when she started using the sign .         but           she wasn   t sure what was going to happen     said nanny .     that   s good enough for me .         nanny           you never know until you look     said nanny ogg  expounding her own uncertainty principle .   nanny kicked open the doors to the great hall .      what   s all this .      ridcully got up from his chair  looking embarrassed .      well  it didn   t seem right to leave her all alone           oh dear  oh dear     said nanny  gazing at the solemn tableau .      candles and lilies .  i bet you pinched    em yourself  out of the garden .  and then you all shut her away indoors like this .         well           and no one even thought to leave a damn window open .  can   t you hear them .         hear what .      nanny looked around hurriedly and picked up a silver candlestick .      no .      magrat snatched it out of her hand .      this happens to be     winding her arm back     very nearly     taking aim     my castle        the candlestick flew up  turning end over end  and hit a big stained glass window right in the center .   fresh sunlight extruded down to the table  visibly moving in the disc   s slow magical field .  and down it  like marbles down a chute  the bees cascaded .   the swarm settled on the witch   s head  giving the impression of a very dangerous wig .      what did you       ridcully began .      she   s going to swank about this for weeks     said nanny .     no one   s ever done it with bees .  their mind   s everywhere  see .  not just in one bee .  in the whole swarm .         what are you        granny weatherwax   s fingers twitched .   her eyes flickered .   very slowly  she sat up .  she focused on magrat and nanny ogg with some difficulty  and said      i wantzzz a bunzzch of flowerszz  a pot of honey  and someone to szzzting .         i brung the sugar bowl  esme     said nanny ogg .   granny eyed it hungrily  and then looked at the bees that were taking off from her head like planes from a stricken carrier .      pour a dzzrop of water on it  then  and tip it out on the table for them .      she stared triumphantly at their faces as nanny ogg bustled off .      i done it with beezzz .  no one can do it with beezzz  and i done it .  you endzzz up with your mind all flying in different directionzzz .  you got to be good to do it with beezzz .      nanny ogg sloshed the bowl of makeshift syrup across the table .  the swarm descended .      you   re alive .     ridcully managed .      that   s what a univerzzity education doezz for you     said granny  trying to massage some life into her arms .     you   ve only got to be sitting up and talking for five minutzz and they can work out you   re alive .      nanny ogg handed her a glass of water .  it hovered in the air for a moment and then crashed to the floor  because granny had tried to grasp it with her fifth leg .      zzorry .         i knew you wasn   t certain .     said nanny .      czertain .  of courze i waz certain .  never in any doubt whatsoever .      magrat thought about the will .      you never had a moment   s doubt .      granny weatherwax had the grace not to look her in the eye .  instead  she rubbed her hands together .      what   s been happening while i   ve been away .         well     said nanny     magrat stood up to the           oh  i knew she   d do that .  had the wedding  have you .         wedding .     the rest of them exchanged glances .      of course not .     said magrat .     brother perdore of the nine day wonderers was going to do it and he was knocked out cold by an elf  and anyway people are all           don   t let   s have any excuses     said granny briskly .     anyway  a senior wizard can conduct a service at a pinch  ain   t that right .         i  i  i think so     said ridcully  who was falling behind a bit in world events .      right .  a wizard   s only a priest without a god and a damp handshake     said granny .      but half the guests have run away .     said magrat .      we   ll round up some more     said granny .      mrs .  scorbic will never get the wedding feast done in time .         you   ll have to tell her to     said granny .      the bridesmaids aren   t here .         we   ll make do .         i haven   t got a dress .         what   s that you   ve got on .      magrat looked down at the stained chain mail  the mud encrusted breastplate  and the few damp remnants of white silk that hung over them like a ragged tabard .      looks good to me     said granny .     nanny   ll do your hair .      magrat reached up instinctively  removed the winged helmet  and patted her hair .  bits of twigs and fragments of heather had twisted themselves in it with comb breaking complexity .  it never looked good for five minutes together at the best of times  now it was a bird   s nest .      i think i   ll leave it     she said .   granny nodded approvingly .      that   s the way of it     she said .     it   s not what you   ve got that matters  it   s how you   ve got it .  well  we   re just about ready  then .      nanny leaned toward her and whispered .      what .  oh  yes .  where   s the groom .         he   s a bit muzzy .  not sure what happened     said magrat .      perfectly normal     said nanny     after a stag night .         there were difficulties to overcome         we need a best man .         ook .         well  at least put some clothes on .         mrs .  scorbic the cook folded her huge pink arms .      can   t be done     she said firmly .      i thought perhaps just some salad and quiche and some light       magrat said  imploringly .   the cook   s whiskery chin stuck out firmly .      them elves turned the whole kitchen upside down     she said .     it   s going to take me days to get it straight .  anyway  everyone knows raw vegetables are bad for you  and i can   t be having with them eggy pies .      magrat looked beseechingly at nanny ogg  granny weatherwax had wandered off into the gardens  where she was getting a tendency to stick her nose in flowers right out of her system .      nothin    to do with me     said nanny .     it   s not my kitchen  dear .         no  it   s mine .  i   ve been cook here for years     said mrs .  scorbic     and i knows how things should be done  and i   m not going to be ordered around in my own kitchen by some chit of a girl .      magrat sagged .  nanny tapped her on the shoulder .      you might need this at this point     she said  and handed magrat the winged helmet .      the king   s been very happy with       mrs .  scorbic began .   there was a click .  she looked down the length of a crossbow and met magrat   s steady gaze .      go ahead     said the queen of lancre softly     bake my quiche .         verence sat in his nightshirt with his head in his hands .  he could remember hardly anything about the night  except a feeling of coldness .  and no one seemed very inclined to tell him .   there was a faint creak as the door opened .   he looked up .      glad to see you   re up and about already     said granny weatherwax .     i   ve come to help you dress .         i   ve looked in the garderobe     said verence .     the   elves  was it .    they ransacked the place .  there   s nothing i can wear .      granny looked around the room .  then she went to a low chest and opened it .  there was a faint tinkling of bells  and a flash of red and yellow .      i thought you never threw them away     she said .     and you ain   t put on any weight  so they   ll still fit .  on with the motley .  magrat   ll appreciate it .         oh  no     said verence .     i   m very firm about this .  i   m king now .  it   d be demeaning for magrat to marry a fool .  i   ve got a position to maintain  for the sake of the kingdom .  besides  there is such a thing as pride .      granny stared at him for so long that he shifted uncomfortably .      well  there is     he said .   granny nodded  and walked toward the doorway .      why   re you leaving .     said verence nervously .      i ain   t leaving     said granny  quietly     i   m just shutting the door .         and then there was the incident with the crown .   ceremonies and protocols of the kingdom of lancre was eventually found after a hurried search of verence   s bedroom .  it was very clear about the procedure .  the new queen was crowned  by the king  as part of the ceremony .  it wasn   t technically difficult for any king who knew which end of a queen was which  which even the most inbred king figured out in two goes .   but it seemed to ponder stibbons that the ritual wobbled a bit at this point .   it seemed  in fact  that just as he was about to lower the crown on the bride   s head he glanced across the hall to where the skinny old witch was standing .  and nearly everyone else did too  including the bride .   the old witch nodded very slightly .   magrat was crowned .   wack fol a diddle  etc .      the bride and groom stood side by side  shaking hands with the long line of guests in that dazed fashion normal at this point in the ceremony .      i   m sure you   ll be very happy           thank you .         ook .         thank you .         nail it to the counter  lord ferguson  and damn the cheesemongers .         thank you .         can i kiss the bride .      it dawned on verence that he was being addressed by fresh air .  he looked down .      i   m sorry     he said     you are    .         my card     said casanunda .   verence read it .  his eyebrows rose .      ah     he said .     uh .  um .  well  well  well .  number two  eh .         i try harder     said casanunda .   verence looked around guiltily  and then bent down until his mouth was level with the dwarf   s ear .      could i have a word with you in a minute or two .         the lancre morris men got together again for the first time at the reception .  they found it hard to talk to one another .  several of them jigged up and down absentmindedly as they talked .      all right     said jason     anyone remember .  really remember .         i remember the start     said tailor the other weaver .     definitely remember the start .  and the dancing in the woods .  but the entertainment           there was elves in it     said tinker the tinker .      that   s why it all got buggered up     said thatcher the carter .     there was a lot of shouting  too .         there was someone with horns on     said carter     and a great big           it was all     said jason     a bit of a dream .         hey  look over there  carter     said weaver  winking at the others     there   s that monkey .  you   ve got something to ask it  ain   t you .      carter blinked .     coo  yes     he said .      shouldn   t waste a golden opportunity if i was you     said weaver  with the happy malice often shown by the clever to the simple .   the librarian was chatting to ponder and the bursar .  he looked around as carter prodded him .      you   ve been over to slice  then  have you .     he said  in his cheery open way .   the librarian gave him a look of polite incomprehension .      oook .      carter looked perplexed .      that   s where you put your nut  ain   t it .      the librarian gave him another odd look  and shook his head .      oook .         weaver .     carter shouted     the monkey says he didn   t put his nut where the sun don   t shine .  you said he did .  you didn   t  did you .  he said you did .     he turned to the librarian .     he didn   t  weaver .  see  i knew you   d got it wrong .  you   re daft .  there   s no monkeys in slice .      silence flowed outward from the two of them .   ponder stibbons held his breath .      this is a lovely party     said the bursar to a chair     i wish i was here .      the librarian picked up a large bottle from the table .  he tapped carter on the shoulder .  then he poured him a large drink and patted him on the head .   ponder relaxed and turned back to what he was doing .  he   d tied a knife to a bit of string and was gloomily watching it spin round and round     on his way home that night weaver was picked up by a mysterious assailant and dropped into the lancre .  no one ever found out why .  do not meddle in the affairs of wizards  especially simian ones .  they   re not all that subtle .      others went home that night .      she   ll be getting ideas above her station in life     said granny weatherwax  as the two witches strolled through the scented air .      she   s a queen .  that   s pretty high     said nanny ogg .     almost as high as witches .         yes   well   but you ain   t got to give yourself airs     said granny weatherwax .     we   re advantaged  yes  but we act with modesty and we don   t put ourselves forward .  no one could say i haven   t been decently modest all my life .         you   ve always been a bit of a shy violet  i   ve always said     said nanny ogg .     i   m always telling people  when it comes to humility you won   t find anyone more humile than esme weatherwax .         always keep myself to myself and minded my own business           barely known you were there half the time     said nanny ogg .      i was talking  gytha .         sorry .      they walked along in silence for a while .  it was a warm dry evening .  birds sang in the trees .   nanny said     funny to think of our magrat being married and everything .         what do you mean  everything .         well  you know   married     said nanny .     i gave her a few tips .  always wear something in bed .  keeps a man interested .         you always wore your hat .         right .      nanny waved a sausage on a stick .  she always believed in stocking up on any free food that was available .      i thought the wedding feast was very good  didn   t you .  and magrat looked radiant  i thought .         i thought she looked hot and flustered .         that is radiant  with brides .         you   re right  though     said granny weatherwax  who was walking a little way ahead .     it was a good dinner .  i never had this vegetarian option stuff before .         when i married mr .  ogg  we had three dozen oysters at our wedding feast .  mind you  they didn   t all work .         and i like the way they give us all a bit o    the wedding cake in a little bag     said granny .      right .  you know  they says  if you puts a bit under your pillow  you dream of your future husb       nanny ogg   s tongue tripped over itself .   she stopped  embarrassed  which was unusual in an ogg .      it   s all right     said granny .     i don   t mind .         sorry  esme .         everything happens somewhere .  i know .  i know .  everything happens somewhere .  so it   s all the same in the end .         that   s very continuinuinuum thinking  esme .         cake   s nice     said granny     but   right now   don   t know why   what i could really do with  gytha  right now   is a sweet .      the last word hung in the evening air like the echo of a gunshot .   nanny stopped .  her hand flew to her pocket  where the usual bag of fluff encrusted boiled sweets resided .  she stared at the back of esme weatherwax   s head  at the tight bun of gray hair under the brim of the pointy hat .      sweet .     she said .      i expect you   ve got another bag now     said granny  without looking around .      esme           you got anything to say  gytha .  about bags of sweets .      granny weatherwax still hadn   t turned around .   nanny looked at her boots .      no  esme     she said meekly .      i knew you   d go up to the long man  you know .  how   d you get in .         used one of the special horseshoes .      granny nodded .     you didn   t ought to have brung him into it  gytha .         yes  esme .         he   s as tricky as she is .         yes  esme .         you   re trying preemptive meekness on me .         yes  esme .      they walked a little further .      what was that dance your jason and his men did when they   d got drunk .     said granny .      it   s the lancre stick and bucket dance  esme .         it   s legal  is it .         technically they shouldn   t do it when there   s women present     said nanny .     otherwise it   s sexual morrisment .         and i thought magrat was very surprised when you recited that poem at the reception .         poem .         the one where you did the gestures .         oh  that poem .         i saw verence making notes on his napkin .      nanny reached again into the shapeless recesses of her clothing and produced an entire bottle of champagne you could have sworn there was no room for .      mind you  i thought she looked happy     she said .     standing there wearing about half of a torn muddy dress and chain mail underneath .  hey  d   you know what she told me .         what .         you know that ole painting of queen ynci .  you know  the one with the iron bodice .  her with all the spikes and knives on her chariot .  well  she said she was sure the   the spirit of ynci was helping her .  she said she wore the armor and she did things she   d never dare do .         my word     said granny  noncommittally .      funny ole world     agreed nanny .   they walked in silence for a while .      so you didn   t tell her that queen ynci never existed  then .         no point .         old king lully invented her entirely    cos he thought we needed a bit of romantic history .  he was a bit mad about that .  he even had the armor made .         i know .  my great grandma   s husband hammered it out of a tin bath and a couple of saucepans .         but you didn   t think you ought to tell her that .         no .      granny nodded .      funny thing     she said     even when magrat   s completely different  she   s just the same .      nanny ogg produced a wooden spoon from somewhere in her apron .  then she raised her hat and carefully lifted down a bowl of cream  custard  and jelly which she had secreted there .       huh .  i really don   t know why you pinches food the whole time     said granny .     verence   d give you a bathful of the stuff if you asked .  you know he don   t touch custard himself .         more fun this way     said nanny .     i deserve a bit of fun .      there was a rustling in the thick bushes and the unicorn burst through .   it was mad .  it was angry .  it was in a world where it did not belong .  and it was being driven .   it pawed the ground a hundred yards away  and lowered its horn .      whoops     said nanny  dropping her just desserts .     come on .  there   s a tree here  come on .      granny weatherwax shook her head .      no .  i ain   t runnin    this time .  she couldn   t get me before and she   s tryin    through an animal  eh .         will you look at the size of the horn on that thing .         i can see clear enough     said granny calmly .   the unicorn lowered its head and charged .  nanny ogg reached the nearest tree with low branches and leapt upward     granny weatherwax folded her arms .      come on  esme .         no .  i ain   t been thinking clear enough  but i am now .  there   s some things i don   t have to run from .      the white shape bulleted down the avenue of trees  a thousand pounds of muscle behind twelve inches of glistening horn .  steam swirled behind it .      esme .      circle time was ending .  besides  she knew now why her mind had felt so unravelled  and that was a help .  she couldn   t hear the ghostly thoughts of all the other esme weatherwaxes anymore .   perhaps some lived in a world ruled by elves .  or had died long ago .  or were living what they thought were happy lives .  granny weatherwax seldom wished for anything  because wishing was soppy  but she felt a tiny regret that she   d never be able to meet them .   perhaps some were going to die  now  here on this path .  everything you did meant that a million copies of you did something else .  some were going to die .  she   d sensed their future deaths   the deaths of esme weatherwax .  and couldn   t save them  because chance did not work like that .   on a million hillsides the girl ran  on a million bridges the girl chose  on a million paths the woman stood     all different  all one .   all she could do for all of them was be herself  here and now  as hard as she could .   she stuck out a hand .   a few yards away the unicorn hit an invisible wall .  its legs flailed as it tried to stop  its body contorted in pain  and it slid the rest of the way to granny   s feet on its back .      gytha     said granny  as the beast tried to get upright     you   ll take off your stockings and knot    em into a halter and pass it to me carefully .         esme           what .         ain   t got no stockings on  esme .         what about the lovely red and white pair i gave you on hogswatchnight .  i knitted    em myself .  you know how i hates knitting .         well  it   s a warm night .  i likes to  you know  let the air circulate .         i had the devil of a time with the heels .         sorry  esme .         at least you   ll be so good as to run up to my place and bring everything that   s in the bottom of the dresser .         yes  esme .         but before that you   ll call in at your jason   s and tell him to get the forge good and hot .      nanny ogg stared down at the struggling unicorn .  it seemed to be stuck  terrified of granny but at the same time quite unable to escape .      oh  esme  you   re never going to ask our jason to           i won   t ask him to do anything .  and i ain   t asking you  neither .      granny weatherwax removed her hat  skimming it into the bushes .  then  her eyes never leaving the animal  she reached up to the iron gray bun of her hair and removed a few crucial pins .   the bun uncoiled a waking snake of fine hair  which unwound down to her waist when she shook her head a couple of times .   nanny watched in paralyzed fascination as she reached up again and broke a single hair at its root .   granny weatherwax   s hands made a complicated motion in the air as she made a noose out of something almost too thin to see .  she ignored the thrashing horn and dropped it over the unicorn   s neck .  then she pulled .   struggling  its unshod hooves kicking up great clods of mud  the unicorn struggled to its feet .      that   ll never hold it     said nanny  sidling around the tree .      i could hold it with a cobweb  gytha ogg .  with a cobweb .  now go about your business .         yes  esme .      the unicorn threw back its head and screamed .      half the town was waiting as granny led the beast into lancre  hooves skidding on the cobbles  because when you tell nanny ogg you tell everyone .   it danced at the end of the impossibly thin tether  kicking out at the terminally unwary  but never quite managing to pull free .   jason ogg  still in his best clothes  was standing nervously at the open doorway to the forge .  superheated air vibrated over the chimney .      mister blacksmith     said granny weatherwax     i have a job for you .         er     said jason     that   s a unicorn  is that .         correct .      the unicorn screamed again  and rolled mad red eyes at jason .      no one   s ever put shoes on a unicorn     said jason .      think of this     said granny weatherwax     as your big moment .      the crowd clustered round  trying to see and hear while keeping out of the way of the hooves .   jason rubbed his chin with his hammer .      i don   t know           listen to me  jason ogg     said granny  hauling on the hair as the creature skittered around in a circle     you can shoe anything anyone brings you .  and there   s a price for that  ain   t there .      jason gave nanny ogg a panic stricken look .  she had the grace to look embarrassed .      she never told me about it     said granny  with her usual ability to read nanny   s expression through the back of her own head .   she leaned closer to jason  almost hanging from the plunging beast .     the price for being able to shoe anything  anything that anyone brings you   is having to shoe anything anyone brings you .  the price for being the best is always   having to be the best .  and you pays it  same as me .      the unicorn kicked several inches of timber out of the door frame .      but iron       said jason .     and nails           yes .         iron   ll kill it     said jason .     if i nail iron to    n  i   ll kill    n .  killing   s not part of it .  i   ve never killed anything .  i was up all night with that ant  it never felt a thing .  i won   t hurt a living thing that never done me no harm .         did you get that stuff from my dresser  gytha .         yes  esme .         bring it in here  then .  and you  jason  you just get that forge hot .         but if i nail iron to it i   ll           did i say anything about iron .      the horn took a stone out of the wall a foot from jason   s head .  he gave in .      you   ll have to come in to keep it calm  then     he said .     i   ve never shod a stallion like this   n without two men and a boy a hanging on to it .         it   ll do what it   s told     granny promised .     it can   t cross me .         it murdered old scrope     said nanny ogg .     i wouldn   t mind him killing it .         then shame on you  woman     said granny .     it   s an animal .  animals can   t murder .  only us superior races can murder .  that   s one of the things that sets us apart from animals .  give me that sack .      she towed the fighting animal through the big double doors and a couple of the villagers hurriedly swung them shut .  a moment later a hoof kicked a hole in the planking .   ridcully arrived at a run  his huge crossbow slung over his shoulder .      they told me the unicorn had turned up again .      another board splintered .      in there .      nanny nodded .      she dragged it all the way down from the woods     she said .      but the damn thing   s savage .      nanny ogg rubbed her nose .     yes  well   but she   s qualified  ain   t she .  when it comes to unicorn taming .  nothing to do with witchcraft .         what d   you mean .         i thought there was some things everyone knew about trapping unicorns     said nanny archly .     who could trap    em  is what i am delicately hintin    at .  she always could run faster   n you  could esme .  she could outdistance any man .      ridcully stood there with his mouth open .      now  me     said nanny     i   d always trip over first ole tree root i came to .  took me ages to find one  sometimes .         you mean after i went she never           don   t get soft ideas .  it   s all one at our time o   life anyway     said nanny .     it   d never have crossed her mind if you hadn   t turned up .     an associated thought seemed to strike her .     you haven   t seen casanunda  have you .            ello  my little rosebud     said a cheerful  hopeful voice .   nanny didn   t even turn around .      you do turn up where people aren   t looking     she said .      famed for it  mrs .  ogg .      there was silence from inside the forge .  then they could make out the tap tap tap of jason   s hammer .      what they doing in there .     said ridcully .      it   s stopping it kicking  whatever it is     said nanny .      what was in the sack  mrs .  ogg .     said casanunda .      what she told me to get     said nanny .     her old silver tea set .  family heirloom .  i   ve only ever seen it but twice  and once was just now when i put it in the sack .  i don   t think she   s ever used it .  it   s got a cream jug shaped like a humorous cow .      more people had arrived outside the forge .  the crowd stretched all the way across the square .   the hammering stopped .  jason   s voice  quite close  said      we   re coming out now .         they   re coming out now     said nanny .      what   d she say .         she said they   re coming out now .         they   re coming out now .      the crowd pulled back .  the doors swung open .   granny emerged  leading the unicorn .  it walked sedately  muscles moving under its white coat like frogs in oil .  and its hooves clattered on the cobbles .  ridcully couldn   t help noticing how they shone .   it walked politely alongside the witch until she reached the center of the square .  then she turned it loose  and gave it a light slap on the rump .   it whinnied softly  turned  and galloped down the street  toward the forest     nanny ogg appeared silently behind granny weatherwax as she watched it go .      silver shoes .     she said quietly .     they   ll last no time at all .         and silver nails .  they   ll last for long enough     said granny  speaking to the world in general .     and she   ll never get it back  though she calls it for a thousand years .         shoeing the unicorn     said nanny  shaking her head .     only you   d think of shoeing a unicorn  esme .         i   ve been doing it all my life     said granny .   now the unicorn was a speck on the moorland .  as they watched  it disappeared into the evening gloom .   nanny ogg sighed  and broke whatever spell there was .      so that   s it  then .         yes .         are you going to the dance up at the castle .         are you .         well   mr .  casanunda did ask if i could show him the long man .  you know .  properly .  i suppose it   s him being a dwarf .  they   re very interested in earthworks .         can   t get enough of them     said casanunda .   granny rolled her eyes .      act your age  gytha .         act .  don   t have to act  can do it automatic     said nanny .     acting half my age   now that   s the difficult trick .  anyway  you didn   t answer me .      to the surprise of nanny  and of ridcully  and possibly even of granny weatherwax herself  she slipped her arm around ridcully   s arm .      mr .  ridcully and i are going to have a stroll down to the bridge .         we are .     said ridcully .      oh  that   s nice .         gytha ogg  if you keep on looking at me like that i shall give you a right ding around the ear .         sorry  esme     said nanny .      good .         i expect you want to talk about old times     nanny volunteered .      maybe old times .  maybe other times .      the unicorn reached the forest  and galloped onward .      the waters of the lancre gushed below .  no one crossed the same water twice  even on a bridge .   ridcully dropped a pebble .  it went plunk .      it all works out     said granny weatherwax     somewhere .  your young wizard knows that  he just puts daft words around it .  he   d be quite bright  if only he   d look at what   s in front of him .         he wants to stay here for a while     said ridcully gloomily .  he flicked another pebble into the depths .     seems fascinated by the stones .  i can   t say no  can i .  the king   s all for it .  he says other kings have always had fools  so he   ll try having a wise man around  just in case that works better .      granny laughed .      and there   s young diamanda going to be up and about any day now     she said .      what do you mean .         oh  nothing .  that   s the thing about the future .  it could turn out to be anything .  and everything .      she picked up a pebble .  it hit the water at the same time as one of ridcully   s own  making a double plunk .      do you think     said ridcully     that   somewhere   it all went right .         yes .  here .      granny softened at the sight of his sagging shoulders .      but there  too     she said .      what .         i mean that somewhere mustrum ridcully married esmerelda weatherwax and they lived       granny gritted her teeth       lived happily ever after .  more or less .  as much as anyone does .         how d   you know .         i   ve been picking up bits of her memories .  she seemed happy enough .  and i ain   t easily pleased .         how can you do that .         i try to be good at everything i do .         did she say anything about           she didn   t say nothing .  she don   t know we exist .  don   t ask questions .  it   s enough to know that everything happens somewhere  isn   t it .      ridcully tried to grin .      is that the best you can tell me .     he said .      it   s the best there is .  or the next best thing .         where does it end .    on a summer night  with couples going their own ways  and silky purple twilight growing between the trees .  from the castle  long after the celebrations had ended  faint laughter and the ringing of little silver bells .  and from the empty hillside  only the silence of the elves .       author   s note     by and large  most discworld books have stood by themselves  as complete books .  it helps to have read them in some kind of order  but it   s not essential .   this one is different .  i can   t ignore the history of what has gone before .  granny weatherwax first turned up in equal rites .  in wyrd sisters she became the unofficial head of a tiny coven consisting of the easy going  much married nanny ogg and young magrat  she of the red nose and unkempt hair and tendency to be soppy about raindrops and roses and whiskers on kittens .   and what took place was a plot not unadjacent to that of a famous play about a scottish king  which ended with verence ii becoming king of the little hilly  forested country of lancre .   technically this shouldn   t have happened  since strictly speaking he was not the heir  but to the witches he looked like being the best man for the job and  as they say  all   s well that ends well .  it also ended with magrat reaching a very tentative understanding with verence   very tentative indeed  since both of them were so shy they immediately forgot whatever it was they were going to say to one another whenever they met  and whenever either of them did manage to say anything the other one misunderstood it and took offense  and both of them spent a lot of time wondering what the other one was thinking .  this might be love  or the next best thing .   in witches abroad the three witches had to travel halfway across the continent to face down the godmother  who had made destiny an offer it couldn   t refuse  .   this is the story of what happened when they came home .   now read on         about the author

eleven hours extra time  and twice when the other finalists ran away .        who was also general poacher  cess pit cleaner  and approximate carpenter .              with a couple of nails it   ll stay up all right .             the thing about iron is that you generally don   t have to think fast in dealing with it .        well  it   s like this   the carter parents were a quiet and respectable lancre family who got into a bit of a mix up when it came to naming their children .  first  they had four daughters  who were christened hope  chastity  prudence  and charity  because naming girls after virtues is an ancient and unremarkable tradition .  then their first son was born and out of some misplaced idea about how this naming business was done he was called anger carter  followed later by jealousy carter  bestiality carter  and covetousness carter .  life being what it is  hope turned out to be a depressive  chastity was enjoying life as a lady of negotiable affection in ankh morpork  prudence had thirteen children  and charity expected to get a dollar   s change out of seventy five pence   whereas the boys had grown into amiable  well tempered men  and bestiality carter was  for example  very kind to animals .        ponder was one hundred percent wrong about this .        verence and magrat had a lot in common  really .        if it wasn   t a big stick .        it was here that the thaum  hitherto believed to be the smallest possible particle of magic  was successfully demonstrated to be made up of resons   or reality fragments .  currently research indicates that each reson is itself made up of a combination of at least five    flavors     known as    up        down        sideways        sex appeal     and    peppermint .            lit     thing ies .             gods like a joke as much as anyone else .        except for nanny ogg  who did it all the time  although not on purpose .        as has been pointed out earlier in the discworld chronicles  entire agricultural economies have been based on the lifting power of little old ladies in black dresses .        i . e .   having a lot of bosk .        really true .  that   s why people stand aside when kings go past .        the lancratians did not consider geography to be a very original science .        troll  a lifeform on silicon rather than carbon  can   t in fact digest people .  but there   s always someone ready to give it a try .        insert the usual    red hot curried marbles    description here  if you like .        in the case of the a    street mappe of ankh morpork  this would be the sunshine home for sick dragons in morphic street  please leave donations of coal by side door .  remember  a dragon is for life  not just for hogswatchnight .        shawn ogg .           except when he was lying down .        which is another country .        but not huge  by wig standards .  there have  in the course of decadent history  been many large wigs  often with built in gewgaws to stop people having to look at boring hair all the time .  there had been ones big enough to contain pet mice or clockwork ornaments .  mme .  cupidor  mistress of mad king soup ii  had one with a bird cage in it  but on special state occasions wore one containing a perpetual calendar  a floral clock  and a take away linguini shop .        i . e .   far enough so   s not to look like you   re intruding on the conversation  but close enough to get a pretty good idea of what is going on .        carrots so you can see in the dark  she   d explain  and oysters so   s you   ve got something to look at .        the librarian  an ape of simple but firmly held tastes  considered an episode with custard pies  buckets of whitewash  and especially that bit when someone takes someone else   s hat off  fills it with something oozy  and replaces it on the deadpan head while the orchestra plays    whah   whah   whah   whaaa       to be an absolutely essential part of any theatrical performance .  since a roasted peanut is a dangerous and painful item when hurled with pinpoint accuracy  directors in ankh morpork had long ago taken the hint .  this made some of the grand guignol melodramas a little unusual  but it was considered that plays like    the blood soaked tragedy of the mad monk of quirm  with custard pie scene     were far better than being deaf in one ear for five days .        made it up .           had read a lot of stuff that other people had made up  too .           he   s just an old soppy really      from the nanny ogg book of cat sayings .        he knew this because the previous month   s issue of popular armor had run a feature entitled    we test the top twenty sub     helmets .     it had also run a second feature called    battleaxes  we put the ten best through their paces    and had advertised for half a dozen new testers .        the shortest unit of time in the multiverse is the new york second  defined as the period of time between the traffic lights turning green and the cab behind you honking .        although this is a phallusy .        which  no matter how carefully coiled  will always uncoil overnight and tie the lawnmower to the bicycles .        there are many recipes for the flat round loaves of lancre dwarf bread  but the common aim of all of them is to make a field ration that is long lasting  easily packed  and can disembowel the enemy if skimmed through the air hard enough .  edibility is a kind of optional extra .  most recipes are a closely guarded secret  apart from the gravel .        hence the term    wholesale destruction .           the monks of cool  whose tiny and exclusive monastery is hidden in a really cool and laid back valley in the lower ramtops  have a passing out test for a novice .  he is taken into a room full of all types of clothing and asked  yo   my son  which of these is the most stylish thing to wear .  and the correct answer is  hey  whatever i select .         cool  but not necessarily up to date .        nanny ogg was also a great picker up of unconsidered trifles .        when hwel the playwright turned up with the rest of the troupe next day they told him all about it  and he wrote it down .  but he left out all the bits that wouldn   t fit on a stage  or were too expensive  or which he didn   t believe .  in any case  he called it the taming of the vole  because no one would be interested in a play called things that happened on a midsummer night .        this happens all the time  everywhere in the multiverse  even on cold planets awash with liquid methane .  no one knows why it is  but in any group of employed individuals the only naturally early riser is always the office manager  who will always leave reproachful little notes  or  as it might be  engraved helium crystals  on the desks of their subordinates .  in fact the only place this does not happen very often is the world zyrix  and this is only because zyrix has eighteen suns and it is only possible to be an early riser there once every       .   years  but even then  once every       .   years  resonating to some strange universal signal  smallminded employers slither down to the office with a tentacle full of small reproachful etched frimpt shells at the ready .        he lived on his nerves .        the study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by the discovery of the bi directional nature of library space .  the thaumic mathematics are complex  but boil down to the fact that all books  everywhere  affect all other books .  this is obvious  books inspire other books written in the future  and cite books written in the past .  but the general theory   of l space suggests that  in that case  the contents of books as yet unwritten can be deduced from books now in existence .         there   s a special theory as well  but no one bothers with it much because it   s self evidently a load of marsh gas .        it was largely dark .
