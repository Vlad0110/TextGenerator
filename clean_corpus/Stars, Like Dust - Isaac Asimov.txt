hardcover edition    copyright         by isaac asimov      one     the bedroom murmured    the bedroom murmured to itself gently .  it was almost below the limits of hearing  an irregular little sound  yet quite unmistakable  and quite deadly .   but it wasn   t that which awakened biron farrill and dragged him out of a heavy  unrefreshing slumber .  he turned his head restlessly from side to side in a futile struggle against the periodic burr r r on the end table .   he put out a clumsy hand without opening his eyes and closed contact .      hello     he mumbled .   sound tumbled instantly out of the receiver .  it was harsh and loud  but biron lacked the ambition to reduce the volume .   it said     may i speak to biron farrill .      biron said  fuzzily     speaking .  what d   you want .         may i speak to biron farrill .     the voice was urgent .   biron   s eyes opened on the thick darkness .  he became conscious of the dry unpleasantness of his tongue and the faint odor that remained in the room .   he said     speaking .  who is this .      it went on  disregarding him  gathering tension  a loud voice in the night .     is anyone there .  i would like to speak to biron farrill .      biron raised himself on one elbow and stared at the place where the visiphone sat .  he jabbed at the vision control and the small screen was alive with light .      here i am     he said .  he recognized the smooth  slightly asymmetric features of sander jonti .     call me in the morning  jonti .      he started to turn the instrument off once more  when jonti said     hello  hello .  is anyone there .  is this university hall  room     .  hello .      biron was suddenly aware that the tiny pilot light which would have indicated a live sending circuit was not on .  he swore under his breath and pushed the switch .  it stayed off .  then jonti gave up  and the screen went blank  and was merely a small square of featureless light .   biron turned it off .  he hunched his shoulder and tried to burrow into the pillow again .  he was annoyed .  in the first place  no one had the right to yell at him in the middle of the night .  he looked quickly at the gently luminous figures just over the headboard .  three fifteen .  house lights wouldn   t go on for nearly four hours .   besides  he didn   t like having to wake to the complete darkness of his room .  four years    custom had not hardened him to the earthman   s habit of building structures of reinforced concrete  squat  thick  and windowless .  it was a thousand year old tradition dating from the days when the primitive nuclear bomb had not yet been countered by the force field defense .   but that was past .  atomic warfare had done its worst to earth .  most of it was hopelessly radioactive and useless .  there was nothing left to lose  and yet architecture mirrored the old fears  so that when biron woke  it was to pure darkness .   biron rose on his elbow again .  that was strange .  he waited .  it wasn   t the fatal murmur of the bedroom he had become aware of .  it was something perhaps even less noticeable and certainly infinitely less deadly .   he missed the gentle movement of air that one took so for granted  that trace of continuous renewal .  he tried to swallow easily and failed .  the atmosphere seemed to become oppressive even as he realized the situation .  the ventilating system had stopped working  and now he really had a grievance .  he couldn   t even use the visiphone to report the matter .   he tried again  to make sure .  the milky square of light sprang out and threw a faint  pearly luster on the bed .  it was receiving  but it wouldn   t send .  well  it didn   t matter .  nothing would be done about it before day  anyway .   he yawned and groped for his slippers  rubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms .  no ventilation  eh .  that would account for the queer smell .  he frowned and sniffed sharply two or three times .  no use .  it was familiar  but he couldn   t place it .   he made his way to the bathroom  and reached automatically for the light switch  although he didn   t really need it to draw himself a glass of water .  it closed  but uselessly .  he tried it several times  peevishly .  wasn   t anything working .  he shrugged  drank in the dark  and felt better .  he yawned again on his way back to the bedroom where he tried the main switch .  all the lights were out .   biron sat on the bed  placed his large hands on his hard muscled thighs and considered .  ordinarily  a thing like this would call for a terrific discussion with the service staff .  no one expected hotel service in a college dormitory  but  by space  there were certain minimum standards of efficiency one could demand .  not that it was of vital importance just now .  graduation was coming and he was through .  in three days he   d be saying a last good by to the room and to the university of earth  to earth itself  for that matter .   still  he might report it anyway  without particular comment .  he could go out and use the hall phone .  they might bring in a self powered light or even rig up a fan so he could sleep without psychosomatic choking sensations .  if not  to space with them .  two more nights .   in the light of the useless visiphone  he located a pair of shorts .  over them he slipped a one piece jumper  and decided that that would be enough for the purpose .  he retained his slippers .  there was no danger of waking anybody even if he clumped down the corridors in spiked shoes  considering the thick  nearly soundproof partitions of this concrete pile  but he saw no point in changing .   he strode toward the door and pulled at the lever .  it descended smoothly and he heard the click that meant the door release had been activated .  except that it wasn   t .  and although his biceps tightened into lumps  nothing was accomplished .   he stepped away .  this was ridiculous .  had there been a general power failure .  there couldn   t have been .  the clock was going .  the visiphone was still receiving properly .   wait .  it could have been the boys  bless their erratic souls .  it was done sometimes .  infantile  of course  but he   d taken part in these foolish practical jokes himself .  it wouldn   t have been difficult  for instance  for one of his buddies to sneak in during the day and arrange matters .  but  no  the ventilation and lights were working when he had gone to sleep .   very well  then  during the night .  the hall was an old  outmoded structure .  it wouldn   t have taken an engineering genius to hocus the lighting and ventilation circuits .  or to jam the door  either .  and now they would wait for morning and see what would happen when good old biron found he couldn   t get out .  they would probably let him out toward noon and laugh very hard .      ha  ha     said biron grimly  under his breath .  all right  if that   s the way it was .  but he would have to do something about it  turn the tables some way .   he turned away and his toe kicked something which skidded metallically across the floor .  he could barely make out its shadow moving through the dim visiphone light .  he reached under the bed  patting the floor in a wide arc .  he brought it out and held it close to the light .   they weren   t so smart .  they should have put the visiphone entirely out of commission  instead of just yanking out the sending circuit .    he found himself holding a small cylinder with a little hole in the blister on top .  he put it close to his nose and sniffed at it .  that explained the smell in the room  anyway .  it was hypnite .  of course  the boys would have had to use it to keep him from waking up while they were busy with the circuits .   biron could reconstruct the proceedings step by step now .  the door was jimmied open  a simple thing to do  and the only dangerous part  since he might have wakened then .  the door might have been prepared during the day  for that matter  so that it would seem to close and not actually do so .  he hadn   t tested it .  anyway  once open  a can of hypnite would be put just inside and the door would be closed again .  the anesthetic would leak out slowly  building up to the one in ten thousand concentration necessary to put him definitely under .  then they could enter  masked  of course .  space .  a wet handkerchief would keep out the hypnite for fifteen minutes and that would be all the time needed .   it explained the ventilation system situation .  that had to be eliminated to keep the hypnite from dispersing too quickly .  that would have gone first  in fact .  the visiphone elimination kept him from getting help  the door jamming kept him from getting out  and the absence of lights induced panic .  nice kids .   biron snorted .  it was socially impossible to be thin skinned about this .  a joke was a joke and all that .  right now  he would have liked to break the door down and have done with it .  the well trained muscles of his torso tensed at the thought  but it would be useless .  the door had been built with atom blasts in mind .  damn that tradition .   but there had to be some way out .  he couldn   t let them get away with it .  first  he would need a light  a real one  not the immovable and unsatisfactory glow of the visiphone .  that was no problem .  he had a self powered flashlight in the clothes closet .   for a moment  as he fingered the closet door controls  he wondered if they had jammed that too .  but it moved open naturally  and slid smoothly into its wall socket .  biron nodded to himself .  it made sense .  there was no reason  particularly  to jam the closet  and they didn   t have too much time  anyway .   and then  with the flashlight in his hand  as he was turning away  the entire structure of his theory collapsed in a horrible instant .  he stiffened  his abdomen ridging with tension  and held his breath  listening .   for the first time since awakening  he heard the murmuring of the bedroom .  he heard the quiet  irregular chuckling conversation it was holding with itself  and recognized the nature of the sound at once .   it was impossible not to recognize it .  the sound was    earth   s death rattle .     it was the sound that had been invented one thousand years before .   to be exact  it was the sound of a radiation counter  ticking off the charged particles and the hard gamma waves that came its way  the soft clicking electronic surges melting into a low murmur .  it was the sound of a counter  counting the only thing it could count  death .     softly  on tiptoe  biron backed away .  from a distance of six feet he threw the white beam into the recesses of the closet .  the counter was there  in the far corner  but seeing it told him nothing .   it had been there ever since his freshman days .  most freshmen from the outer worlds bought a counter during their first week on earth .  they were very conscious of earth   s radioactivity then  and felt the need of protection .  usually they were sold again to the next class  but biron had never disposed of his .  he was thankful for that now .   he turned to the desk  where he kept his wrist watch while sleeping .  it was there .  his hand was shaking a little as he held it up to the flashlight   s beam .  the watch strap was an interwoven flexible plastic of an almost liquidly smooth whiteness .  and it was white .  he held it away and tried it at different angles .  it was white .   that strap had been another freshman purchase .  hard radiation turned it blue  and blue on earth was the color of death .  it was easy to wander into a path of radiating soil during the day if you were lost or careless .  the government fenced off as many patches as it could  and of course no one ever approached the huge areas of death that began several miles outside the city .  but the strap was insurance .   if it should ever turn a faint blue  you would show up at the hospital for treatment .  there was no argument about it .  the compound of which it was made was precisely as sensitive to radiation as you were  and appropriate photoelectric instruments could be used to measure the intensity of the blueness so that the seriousness of the case might be determined quickly .   a bright royal blue was the finish .  just as the color would never change back  neither would you .  there was no cure  no chance  no hope .  you just waited anywhere from a day to a week  and all the hospital could do was to make final arrangements for cremation .   but at least it was still white  and some of the clamor in biron   s thoughts subsided .   there wasn   t much radioactivity then .  could it be just another angle of the joke .  biron considered and decided that it couldn   t .  nobody would do that to anyone else .  not on earth  anyway  where illegal handling of radioactive material was a capital offense .  they took radioactivity seriously here on earth .  they had to .  so nobody would do this without overpowering reason .   he stated the thought to himself carefully and explicitly  facing it boldly .  the overpowering reason  for instance  of a desire to murder .  but why .  there could be no motive .  in his twenty three years of life  he had never made a serious enemy .  not this serious .  not murder serious .   he clutched at his clipped hair .  this was a ridiculous line of thought  but there was no escaping it .  he stepped cautiously back to the closet .  there had to be something there that was sending out radiation  something that had not been there four hours earlier .  he saw it almost at once .   it was a little box not more than six inches in any direction .  biron recognized it and his lower lip trembled slightly .  he had never seen one before  but he had heard of them .  he lifted the counter and took it into the bedroom .  the little murmur fell off  almost ceased .  it started again when the thin mica partition  through which the radiation entered  pointed toward the box .  there was no question in his mind .  it was a radiation bomb .   the present radiations were not in themselves deadly  they were only a fuse .  somewhere inside the box a tiny atomic pile was constructed .  short lived artificial isotopes heated it slowly  permeating it with the appropriate particles .  when the threshold of head and particle density was reached  the pile reacted .  not in an explosion  usually  although the heat of reaction would serve to fuse the box itself into a twist of metal  but in a tremendous burst of deadly radiation that would kill anything living within a radius of six feet to six miles  depending on the bomb   s size .   there was no way of telling when the threshold would be reached .  perhaps not for hours  and perhaps the next moment .  biron remained standing helplessly  flashlight held loosely in his damp hands .  half an hour before  the visiphone had awakened him  and he had been at peace then .  now he knew he was going to die .   biron didn   t want to die  but he was penned in hopelessly  and there was no place to hide   he knew the geography of the room .  it was at the end of a corridor  so that there was another room only on one side  and  of course  above and below .  he could do nothing about the room above .  the room on the same floor was on the bathroom side  and it adjoined via its own bathroom .  he doubted that he could make himself heard .   that left the room below .   there were a couple of folding chairs in the room  spare seats to accommodate company .  he took one .  it made a flat  slapping sound when it hit the floor .  he turned it edgewise and the sound became harder and louder .   between each blow  he waited  wondering if he could rouse the sleeper below and annoy him sufficiently to have him report the disturbance .   abruptly  he caught a faint noise  and paused  the splintering chair raised above his head .  the noise came again  like a faint shout .  it was from the direction of the door .   he dropped the chair and yelled in return .  he crushed his ear up against the crack where door joined wall  but the fit was good  and the sound even there was dim .   but he could make out his own name being called .      farrill .  farrill .     several times over  and something else .  maybe    are you in there .     or    are you all right .      he roared back     get the door open .     he shouted it three or four times .  he was in a feverish sweat of impatience .  the bomb might be on the point of letting loose even now .   he thought they heard him .  at least  the muffled cry came back     watch out .  something  something  blaster .     he knew what they meant and backed hurriedly away from the door .   there were a couple of sharp  cracking sounds  and he could actually feel the vibrations set up in the air of the room .  then there followed a splitting noise and the door was flung inward .  light poured in from the corridor .   biron dashed out  arms flung wide .     don   t come in     he yelled .     for the love of earth  don   t come in .  there   s a radiation bomb in there .      he was facing two men .  one was jonti .  the other was esbak  the superintendent .  he was only partly dressed .      a radiation bomb .     he stuttered .   but jonti said     what size .     jonti   s blaster was still in his hand  and that alone jarred with the dandyish effect of his ensemble  even at this time of night .   biron could only gesture with his hands .      all right     said jonti .  he seemed quite cool about it  as he turned to the superintendent .     you   d better evacuate the rooms in this area  and if you have leadsheets anywhere on the university grounds  have them brought out here to line the corridor .  and i wouldn   t let anyone in there before morning .      he turned to biron .     it probably has a twelve to eighteen foot radius .  how did it get there .         i don   t know     said biron .  he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand .     if you don   t mind  i   ve got to sit down somewhere .     he threw a glance at his wrist  then realized his wrist watch was still in the room .  he had a wild impulse to return after it .   there was action now .  students were being hustled out of their rooms .      come with me     said jonti .     i think you had better sit down too .       biron said     what brought you out to my room .  not that i   m not thankful  you understand .         i called you .  there was no answer  and i had to see you .         to see me .     he spoke carefully  trying to control his irregular breathing .     why .         to warn you that your life was in danger .      biron laughed raggedly .     i found out .         that was only the first attempt .  they   ll try again .         who are    they    .         not here  farrill     said jonti .     we need privacy for this .  you   re a marked man  and i may already have endangered myself as well .        two     the net across space    the student lounge was empty  it was dark as well .  at four thirty in the morning it could scarcely have been otherwise .  yet jonti hesitated a moment as he held the door open  listening for occupants .      no     he said softly     leave the lights out .  we won   t need them to talk .         i   ve had enough of the dark for one night     muttered biron .      we   ll leave the door ajar .      biron lacked the will to argue .  he dropped into the nearest chair and watched the rectangle of light through the closing door narrow down to a thin line .  now that it was all over  he was getting the shakes .   jonti steadied the door and rested his little swagger stick upon the crack of light on the floor .     watch it .  it will tell us if anyone passes  or if the door moves .      biron said     please  i   m not in a conspiratorial mood .  if you don   t mind  i   d appreciate your telling me whatever it is you want to tell me .  you   ve saved my life  i know  and tomorrow i   ll be properly thankful .  right now  i could do with a short drink and a long rest .         i can imagine your feelings     jonti said     but the too long rest you might have had has been avoided  momentarily .  i would like to make it more than just momentarily .  do you know that i know your father .      the question was an abrupt one  and biron raised his eyebrows  a gesture lost in the dark .  he said     he has never mentioned knowing you .         i would be surprised if he did .  he doesn   t know me by the name i use here .  have you heard from your father recently  by the way .         why do you ask .         because he is in great danger .         what .      jonti   s hand found the other   s arm in the dimness and gripped it firmly .     please .  keep your voice as it has been .     biron realized  for the first time that they had been whispering .   jonti resumed     i   ll be more specific .  your father has been taken into custody .  you understand the significance .         no  i certainly don   t understand .  who has taken him into custody  and what are you getting at .  why are you bothering me .     biron   s temples were throbbing .  the hypnite and the near death had made it impossible to fence with the cool dandy sitting so close to him that his whispers were as plain as shouts .      surely     came the whisper     you have some inkling of the work your father is doing .         if you know my father  you know he is rancher of widemos .  that is his work .      jonti said     well  there is no reason you should trust me  other than that i am risking my own life for you .  but i already know all that you can tell me .  as an example  i know that your father has been conspiring against the tyranni .         i deny that     said biron tensely .     your service to me this night does not give you the right to make such statements about my father .         you are foolishly evasive  young man  and you are wasting my time .  don   t you see that the situation is beyond verbal fencing .  i   ll say it outright .  your father is in the custody of the tyranni .  he may be dead by now .         i don   t believe you .     biron half rose .      i am in a position to know .         let   s break this off  jonti .  i am in no mood for mystery  and i resent this attempt of yours to          well  to what .     jonti   s voice lost some of its refined edge .     what do i gain by telling you this .  may i remind you that this knowledge of mine  which you will not accept  made it plain to me that an attempt might be made to kill you .  judge by what has happened  farrill .      biron said     start again and tell it straight .  i   ll listen .         very well .  i imagine  farrill  that you know me to be a fellow countryman from the nebular kingdoms  although i   ve been passing myself off as a vegan .         i judged that might be a possibility by your accent .  it didn   t seem important .         it   s important  my friend .  i came here because  like your father  i didn   t like the tyranni .  they   ve been oppressing our people for fifty years .  that   s a long time .         i   m not a politician .      again jonti   s voice had an irritated edge to it .     oh  i   m not one of their agents trying to get you into trouble .  i   m telling you the truth .  they caught me a year ago as they have caught your father now .  but i managed to get away  and came to earth where i thought i might be safe until i was ready to return .  that   s all i need to tell you about myself .         it is more than i have asked for  sir .     biron could not force the unfriendliness out of his voice .  jonti affected him unfavorably with his too precise mannerisms .      i know that .  but it is necessary to tell you so much at least  for it was in this manner that i met your father .  he worked with me  or  rather  i with him .  he knew me but not in his official capacity as the greatest nobleman on the planet of nephelos .  you understand me .      biron nodded uselessly in the darkness and said     yes .         it is not necessary to go into that further .  my sources of information have been maintained even here  and i know that he has been imprisoned .  it is knowledge .  if it were merely suspicion  this attempt on your life would have been sufficient proof .         in what way .         if the tyranni have the father  would they leave the son at large .         are you trying to tell me that the tyranni set that radiation bomb in my room .  that   s impossible .         why is it impossible .  can   t you understand their position .  the tyranni rule fifty worlds  they are outnumbered hundreds to one .  in such a position  simple force is insufficient .  devious methods  intrigue  assassination are their specialties .  the net they weave across space is a wide one  and close meshed .  i can well believe that it extends across five hundred light years to earth .      biron was still in the grip of his nightmare .  in the distance there were the faint sounds of the lead shields being moved into place .  in his room the counter must still be murmuring .   he said     it doesn   t make sense .  i am going back to nephelos this week .  they would know that .  why should they kill me here .  if they   d wait  they   d have me .     he was relieved to find the flaw  eager to believe his own logic .   jonti leaned closer and his spiced breath stirred the hairs on biron   s temple .     your father is popular .  his death  and once imprisoned by the tyranni  his execution becomes a probability you must face  will be resented even by the cowed slave race the tyranni are trying to breed .  you could rally that resentment as the new rancher of widemos  and to execute you as well would double the danger for them .  to make martyrs is not their purpose .  but if you were to die in a faraway world  by accident  it would be convenient for them .         i don   t believe you     said biron .  it had become his only defense .   jonti rose  adjusting his thin gloves .  he said     you go too far  farrill .  your role would be more convincing if you pretended to no such complete ignorance .  your father has been shielding you from reality for your own protection  presumably  yet i doubt that you could remain completely uninfluenced by his beliefs .  your hate for the tyranni cannot help being a reflection of his own .  you cannot help being ready to fight them .      biron shrugged .   jonti said     he may even recognize your new adulthood to the point of putting you to use .  you are conveniently here on earth and it is not unlikely you may be combining your education with a definite assignment .  an assignment  perhaps  for the failure of which the tyranni are ready to kill you .         that   s silly melodrama .         is it .  let it be so  then .  if the truth will not persuade you now  events will later .  there will be other attempts on your life  and the next one will succeed .  from this moment on  farrill  you are a dead man .      biron looked up .     wait .  what   s your own private interest in the matter .         i am a patriot .  i would like to see the kingdoms free again  with governments of their own choosing .         no .  your private interest .  i cannot accept idealism only  because i won   t believe it of you .  i am sorry if that offends you .     biron   s words pounded doggedly .   jonti seated himself again .  he said     my lands have been confiscated .  before my exile it was not comfortable to be forced to take orders from those dwarfs .  and since then it has become more imperative than ever to become once again the man my grandfather had been before the tyranni came .  is that enough of a practical reason for wanting a revolution .  your father would have been a leader of that revolution .  failing him  you .         i .  i am twenty three and know nothing of all this .  you could find better men .         undoubtedly i could  but no one else is the son of your father .  if your father is killed  you will be rancher of widemos  and as such you would be valuable to me if you were only twelve and an idiot besides .  i need you for the same reason the tyranni must be rid of you .  and if my necessity is unconvincing to you  surely theirs cannot be .  there was a radiation bomb in your room .  it could only have been meant to kill you .  who else would want to kill you .      jonti waited patiently and picked up the other   s whisper .      no one     said biron .     no one would want to kill me that i know of .  then it   s true about my father .         it is true .  view it as a casualty of war .         you think that would make it better .  they   ll put up a monument to him someday  perhaps .  one with a radiating inscription that you can see ten thousand miles out in space .     his voice was becoming a bit ragged .     is that supposed to make me happy .      jonti waited  but biron said nothing more .  jonti said     what do you intend doing .         i   m going home .         you still don   t understand your position  then .         i said  i   m going home .  what do you want me to do .  if he   s alive  i   ll get him out of there .  and if he   s dead  i   ll  i   ll          quiet .     the older man   s voice was coldly annoyed .     you rave like a child .  you can   t go to nephelos .  don   t you see that you can   t .  am i talking to an infant or to a young man of sense .   biron muttered     what do you suggest .         do you know the director of rhodia .         the friend of the tyranni .  i know the man .  i know who he is .  everyone in the kingdoms knows who he is .  hinrik v  director of rhodia .         have you ever met him .         no .         that is what i meant .  if you haven   t met him  you don   t know him .  he is an imbecile  farrill .  i mean it literally .  but when the ranchy of widemos is confiscated by the tyranni  and it will be  as my lands were  it will be awarded to hinrik .  there the tyranni will feel them to be safe  and there you must go .         why .         because hinrik  at least  has influence with the tyranni  as much influence as a lickspittle puppet may have .  he may arrange to have you reinstated .         i don   t see why .  he   s more likely to turn me over to them .         so he is .  but you   ll be on your guard against it  and there is a fighting chance you may avoid it .  remember  the title you carry is valuable and important  but it is not all sufficient .  in this business of conspiracy  one must be practical above all .  men will rally about you out of sentiment and respect for your name  but to hold them  you will need money .      biron considered .     i need time to decide .         you have no time .  your time ran out when the radiation bomb was planted in your room .  let us take action .  i can give you a letter of introduction to hinrik of rhodia .         you know him so well  then .      your suspicion never sleeps very soundly  does it .  i once headed a mission to hinrik   s court on behalf of the autarch of lingane .  his imbecile   s mind will probably not remember me  but he will not dare to show he has forgotten .  it will serve as introduction and you can improvise from there .  i will have the letter for you in the morning .  there is a ship leaving for rhodia at noon .  i have tickets for you .  i am leaving myself  but by another route .  don   t linger .  you   re all through here  aren   t you .         there is the diploma presentation .      a scrap of parchment  does it matter to you .         not now .         do you have money .         enough .         very well .  too much would be suspicious .     he spoke sharply .     farrill .      biron stirred out of what was nearly a stupor .     what .         get back to the others .  tell no one you are leaving .  let the act speak .      biron nodded dumbly .  far away in the recesses of his mind there was the thought that his mission remained unaccomplished and that in this way  too  he failed his dying father .  he was racked with a futile bitterness .  he might have been told more .  he might have shared the dangers .  he should not have been allowed to act in ignorance .   and now that he knew the truth  or at least more of it  concerning the extent of his father   s role in conspiracy  there was an added importance to the document he was to have obtained from earth   s archives .  but there was no time any longer .  no time to get the document .  no time to wonder about it .  no time to save his father .  no time  perhaps  to live .   he said     i   ll do as you say  jonti .      sander jonti looked briefly out over the university campus as he paused on the steps of the dormitory .  certainly there was no admiration in his glance .   as he stepped down the bricked walk that wound unsubtly through the pseudo rustic atmosphere affected by all urban campuses since antiquity  he could see the lights of the city   s single important street gleam just ahead .  past it  drowned in daytime  but visible now  was the eternal radioactive blue of the horizon  mute witness of prehistoric wars .   jonti considered the sky for a moment .  over fifty years had passed since the tyranni had come and put a sudden end to the separate lives of two dozen sprawling  brawling political units in the depths beyond the nebula .  now  suddenly and prematurely  the peace of strangulation lay upon them .   the storm that had caught them in one vast thunderclap had been something from which they had not yet recovered .  it had left only a sort of twitching that futilely agitated a world here and there  now and then .  to organize those twitchings  to align them into a single well timed heave would be a difficult task  and a long one .  well  he had been rusticating here on earth long enough .  it was time to go back .   the others  back home  were probably trying to get in touch with him at his rooms right now .   he lengthened his stride a bit .     he caught the beam as he entered his room .  it was a personal beam  for whose security there were as yet no fears and in whose privacy there was no chink .  no formal receiver was required  no thing of metal and wires to catch the faint  drifting surges of electrons  with their whispered impulses swimming through hyperspace from a world half a thousand light years away .   space itself was polarized in his room  and prepared for reception .  its fabric was smoothed out of randomness .  there was no way of detecting that polarization  except by receiving .  and in that particular volume of space  only his own mind could act as receiver  since only the electrical characteristics of his own particular nerve cell system could resonate to the vibrations of the carrier beam that bore the message .   the message was as private as the unique characteristics of his own brain waves  and in all the universe  with its quadrillions of human beings  the odds against a duplication sufficiently close to allow one man to pick up another   s personal wave was a twenty figured number to one .   jonti   s brain tickled to the call as it whined through the endless empty incomprehensibility of hyperspace .         calling   calling   calling   calling        sending was not quite so simple a job as receiving .  a mechanical contrivance was needed to set up the highly specific carrier wave that would carry back to the contact beyond the nebula .  that was contained in the ornamental button that he carried on his right shoulder .  it was automatically activated when he stepped into his volume of space polarization  and after that he had only to think purposefully and with concentration .      here i am .     no need for more specific identification .   the dull repetition of the calling signal halted and became words that took form within his mind .     we greet you  sir .  widemos has been executed .  the news is  of course  not yet public .         it does not surprise me .  was anyone else implicated .           no  sir .  the rancher made no statements at any time .  a brave and loyal man .         yes .  but it takes more than simply bravery and loyalty  or he would not have been caught .  a little more cowardice might have been useful .  no matter .  i have spoken to his son  the new rancher  who has already had his brush with death .  he will be put to use .         may one inquire in what manner  sir .         it is better to let events answer your question .  certainly i cannot foretell consequences at this early date .  tomorrow he will set off to see hinrik of rhodia .          hinrik .  the young man will run a fearful risk .  is he aware that          i have told him as much as i can     responded jonti sharply .     we cannot trust him too far until he has proved himself .  under the circumstances as they exist  we can only view him as a man to be risked  like any other man .  he is expendable  quite expendable .  do not call me here again  as i am leaving earth .      and  with a gesture of finality  jonti broke the connection mentally .   quietly and thoughtfully  he went over the events of the day and the night  weighing each event .  slowly  he smiled .  everything had been arranged perfectly  and the comedy might now play itself out .   nothing had been left to chance .     three     chance and the wrist watch    the first hour of a space ship   s rise from planetary thralldom is the most prosaic .  there is the confusion of departure  which is much the same in essence as that which must have accompanied the shoving off of the first hollowed out tree trunk on some primeval river .   you have your accommodations  your luggage is taken care of  there is the first stiff moment of strangeness and meaningless hustle surrounding you .  the shouted last moment intimacies  the quieting  the muted clang of the air locks  followed by the slow soughing of air as the locks screw inward automatically  like gigantic drills  becoming airtight .   then the portentous silence and the red signs flicking in every room     adjust acceleration suits .  .  .  . adjust acceleration suits .  .  .  . adjust acceleration suits .      the stewards scour the corridors  knocking shortly on each door and jerking it open .     beg pardon .  suits on .      you battle with the suits  cold  tight  uncomfortable  but cradled in a hydraulic system which absorbs the sickening pressures of the take off .   there is the faraway rumble of the atom driven motors  on low power for atmospheric maneuvering  followed instantly by the giving back against the slow yielding oil of the suit cradle .  you recede almost indefinitely back  then very slowly forward again as the acceleration decreases .  if you survive nausea during this period  you are probably safe from space sickness for duration .     the view room was not open to the passengers for the first three hours of the flight  and there was a long line waiting when the atmosphere had been left behind and the double doors were ready to separate .  there were present not only the usual hundred percent turnout of all planetaries  those  in other words  who had never been in space before   but a fair proportion of the more experienced travelers as well .   the vision of earth from space  after all  was one of the tourist    musts .      the view room was a bubble on the ship   s    skin     a bubble of curved two foot thick  steel hard transparent plastic .  the retractile iridium steel lid which protected it against the scouring of the atmosphere and its dust particles had been sucked back .  the lights were out and the gallery was full .  the faces peering over the bars were clear in the earth shine .   for earth was suspended there below  a gigantic and gleaming orange and blue and white patched balloon .  the hemisphere showing was almost entirely sunlit  the continents between the clouds  a desert orange  with thin  scattered lines of green .  the seas were blue  standing out sharply against the black of space where they met the horizon .  and all around in the black  undusted sky were the stars .   they waited patiently  those who watched .   it was not the sunlit hemisphere they wanted .  the polar cap  blinding bright  was shifting down into view as the ship maintained the slight  unnoticed sidewise acceleration that was lifting it out of the ecliptic .  slowly the shadow of night encroached upon the globe and the huge world island of eurasia africa majestically took the stage  north side    down .      its diseased  unliving soil hid its horror under a night induced play of jewels .  the radioactivity of the soil was a vast sea of iridescent blue  sparkling in strange festoons that spelled out the manner in which the nuclear bombs had once landed  a full generation before the force field defense against nuclear explosions had been developed so that no other world could commit suicide in just that fashion again .   the eyes watched until  with the hours  earth was a bright little half coin in the endless black .     among the watchers was biron farrill .  he sat by himself in the front row  arms upon the railing  eyes brooding and thoughtful .  this was not the way he had expected to leave earth .  it was the wrong manner  the wrong ship  the wrong destination .   his tanned forearm rubbed against the stubble of his chin and he felt guilty about not having shaved that morning .  he   d go back to his room after a while and correct that .  meanwhile  he hesitated to leave .  there were people here .  in his room he would be alone .   or was that just the reason he should leave .   he did not like the new feeling he had  that of being hunted  that of being friendless .   all friendship had dropped from him .  it had shriveled from the very moment he had been awakened by the phone call less than twenty four hours earlier .   even in the dormitory he had become an embarrassment .  old esbak had pounced upon him when he had returned after his talk with jonti in the student lounge .  esbak was in turmoil  his voice overshrill .      mr .  farrill  i   ve been looking for you .  it has been a most unfortunate incident .  i can   t understand it .  do you have any explanation .         no     he half shouted     i don   t .  when can i get into my room and get my stuff out .         in the morning  i am sure .  we   ve just managed to get the equipment up here to test the room .  there is no longer any trace of radioactivity above normal background level .  it was a very fortunate escape for you .  it must have missed you only by minutes .         yes  yes  but if you don   t mind  i would like to rest .         please use my room till morning and then we   ll get you relocated for the few days remaining you .  umm  by the way  mr .  farrill  if you don   t mind  there is another matter .      he was being overly polite .  biron could almost hear the egg shells give slightly beneath his finicky feet .      what other matter .     asked biron wearily .      do you know of anyone who might have been interested in  er  hazing you .         hazing me like this .  of course not .         what are your plans  then .  the school authorities would  of course  be most unhappy to have publicity arise as a result of this incident .      how he kept referring to it as an    incident    .  biron said dryly     i understand you .  but don   t worry .  i   m not interested in investigations or in the police .  i   m leaving earth soon  and i   d just as soon not have my own plans disrupted .  i   m not bringing any charges .  after all  i   m still alive .      esbak had been almost indecently relieved .  it was all they wanted from him .  no unpleasantness .  it was just an incident to be forgotten .   he got into his old room again at seven in the morning .  it was quiet and there was no murmuring in the closet .  the bomb was no longer there  nor was the counter .  they had probably been taken away by esbak and thrown into the lake .  it came under the head of destroying evidence  but that was the school   s worry .  he threw his belongings into suitcases and then called the desk for assignment to another room .  the lights were working again  he noticed  and so  of course  was the visiphone .  the one remnant of last night was the twisted door  its lock melted away .   they gave him another room .  that established his intention to stay for anyone that might be listening .  then  using the hall phone  he had called an air cab .  he did not think anyone saw him .  let the school puzzle out his disappearance however they pleased .   for a moment he had caught sight of jonti at the space port .  they met in the fashion of a glancing blow .  jonti said nothing  gave no sign of recognition  but after he had passed by  there were in biron   s hand a featureless little black globe that was a personal capsule and a ticket for passage to rhodia .   he spent a moment upon the personal capsule .  it was not sealed .  he read the message later in his room .  it was a simple introduction with minimum wordage .   biron   s thoughts rested for a while upon sander jonti  as he watched earth shrivel with time there in the view room .  he had known the man very superficially until jonti had whirled so devastatingly into his life  first to save it and then to set it upon a new and untried course .  biron had known his name  he had nodded when they passed  had exchanged polite formalities occasionally  but that was all .  he had not liked the man  had not liked his coldness  his overdressed  overmannered personality .  but all that had nothing to do with affairs now .   biron rubbed his crew cut with a restless hand and sighed .  he actually found himself hungering for jonti   s presence .  the man was at least master of events .  he had known what to do  he had known what biron was to do  he had made biron do it .  and now biron was alone and feeling very young  very helpless  very friendless  and almost frightened .   through it all  he studiously avoided thinking of his father .  it would not help .        mr .  malaine .      the name was repeated two or three times before biron started at the respectful touch upon his shoulder and looked up .   the robot messenger said again     mr .  malaine     and for five seconds biron stared blankly  until he remembered that that was his temporary name .  it had been penciled lightly upon the ticket which jonti had given him .  a stateroom had been reserved in that name .      yes  what is it .  i am malaine .     the messenger   s voice hissed very faintly as the spool within whirled off its message .     i have been asked to inform you that your stateroom has been changed  and that your baggage has already been shifted .  if you will see the purser  you will be given your new key .  we trust that this will cause no inconvenience for you .         what   s all this .     biron whirled in his seat  and several of the thinning group of passengers  still watching  looked up at the explosive sound .     what   s the idea .      of course  it was no use arguing with a machine that had merely fulfilled its function .  the messenger had bowed its metal head respectfully  its gently fixed imitation of a human smile of ingratiation unchanging  and had left .   biron strode out of the view room and accosted the ship   s officer at the door with somewhat more energy than he had planned .      look here .  i want to see the captain .      the officer showed no surprise .     is it important  sir .         it sure as space is .  i   ve just had my stateroom shifted without my permission and i   d like to know the meaning of it .      even at the time  biron felt his anger to be out of proportion to the cause  but it represented an accumulation of resentment .  he had nearly been killed  he had been forced to leave earth like a skulking criminal  he was going he knew not where to do he knew not what  and now they were pushing him around aboard ship .  it was the end .   yet  through it all  he had the uncomfortable feeling that jonti  in his shoes  would have acted differently  perhaps more wisely .  well  he wasn   t jonti .   the officer said     i will call the purser .         i want the captain     insisted biron .      if you wish  then .     and after a short conversation through the small ship   s communicator suspended from his lapel  he said urbanely     you will be called for .  please walt .        captain hirm gordell was a rather short and thickset man  who rose politely and leaned over his desk to shake hands with biron when the latter entered .      mr .  malaine     he said     i am sorry we had to trouble you .      he had a rectangular face  iron gray hair  a short  well kept mustache of slightly darker hue  and a clipped smile .      so am i     said biron .     i had a stateroom reservation to which i was entitled and i feel that not even you  sir  had the right to change it without my permission .         granted  mr .  malaine .  but  you understand  it was rather an emergency .  a last minute arrival  an important man  insisted on being moved to a stateroom closer the gravitational center of the ship .  he had a heart condition and it was important to keep ship   s gravity as low as possible for him .  we had no choice .         all right  but why pick on me as the one to be shifted .         it had to be someone .  you were traveling alone  you are a young man who we felt would have no difficulty in taking a slightly higher gravity .     his eyes traveled automatically up and down biron   s six feet two of hard musculature .     be .  sides  you will find your new room rather more elaborate than your old one .  you have not lost by the exchange .  no indeed .      the captain stepped from behind his desk .     may i show you your new quarters personally .      biron found it difficult to maintain his resentment .  it seemed reasonable  this whole matter  and then again  not reasonable either .   the captain was saying as they left his quarters     may i have your company at my table for tomorrow night   s dinner .  our first jump is scheduled for that time .      biron heard himself saying     thank you .  i will be honored .      yet he thought the invitation strange .  granted that the captain was merely trying to soothe him  yet surely the method was stronger than necessary .     the captain   s table was a long one  taking up an entire wall of the salon .  biron found himself near the center  taking an unsuitable precedence over others .  yet there was his place card before him .  the steward had been quite firm  there was no mistake .   biron was not particularly overmodest .  as son of the rancher of widemos  there had never been any necessity for the development of any such characteristic .  and yet as biron malaine  he was quite an ordinary citizen  and these things ought not to happen to ordinary citizens .   for one thing  the captain had been perfectly correct about his new stateroom .  it was more elaborate .  his original room had been what his ticket called for  a single  second class  while the replacement was a double room  first .  there was a bathroom adjoining  private  of course  equipped with a stall shower and an air dryer .   it was near    officer   s country     and the presence of uniforms was almost overpowering .  lunch had been brought to his room on silver service .  a barber made a sudden appearance just before dinner .  all this was perhaps to be expected when one traveled on a luxury space liner  first class  but it was too good for biron malaine .   it was far too good  for by the time the barber had arrived  biron had just returned from an afternoon walk that had taken him through the corridors in a purposely devious path .  there had been crewmen in his path wherever he had turned  polite  clinging .  he shook them free somehow and reached     d  his first room  the one he had never slept in .   he stopped to light a cigarette and  in the interval spent thus  the only passenger in sight turned a corridor .  biron touched the signal light briefly and there was no answer .   well  the old key had not been taken from him yet .  an oversight  no doubt .  he placed the thin oblong sliver of metal into its orifice and the unique pattern of leaden opacity within the aluminum sheath activated the tiny phototube .  the door opened and he took one step inside .   it was all he needed .  he left and the door closed automatically behind him .  he had learned one thing immediately .  his old room was not occupied  neither by an important personage with a weak heart nor by anyone else .  the bed and furnishings were too neat  no trunks  no toilet articles were in sight  the very air of occupancy was missing .   so the luxury they were surrounding him with served only to prevent his taking further action to get back his original room .  they were bribing him to stay quietly out of the old room .  why .  was it the room they were interested in  or was it himself .   and now he sat at the captain   s table with the questions unanswered and rose politely with the rest as the captain entered  strode up the steps of the dais on which the long table was set  and took his place .   why had they moved him .     there was music in the ship  and the walls that separated the salon from the view room had been retracted .  the lights were low and tinged with orange red .  the worst of such space sickness as there might have been after the original acceleration or as the result of first exposure to the minor gravity variations between various parts of the ship had passed by now  the salon was full .   the captain leaned forward slightly and said to biron     good evening  mr .  malaine .  how do you find your new room .         almost too satisfactory  sir .  a little rich for my way of life .     he said it in a flat monotone  and it seemed to him that a faint dismay passed momentarily over the captain   s face .   over the dessert  the skin of the view room   s glass bubble slid smoothly back into its socket  and the lights dimmed to nearly nothing .  neither sun  earth  nor any planet was in view on that large  dark screen .  they were facing the milky way  that longwise view of the galactic lens  and it made a luminous diagonal track among the hard  bright stars .   automatically the tide of conversation ebbed .  chairs shifted so that all faced the stars .  the dinner guests had become an audience  the music a faint whisper .   the voice over the amplifiers was clear and well balanced in the gathered question .      ladies  gentlemen .  we are ready for our first jump .  most of you  i suppose  know  at least theoretically  what a jump is .  many of you  however  more than half  in point of fact  have never experienced one .  it is to those last i would like to speak in particular .      the jump is exactly what the name implies .  in the fabric of space time itself  it is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light .  that is a natural law  first discovered by one of the ancients  the traditional einstein  perhaps  except that so many things are credited to him .  even at the speed of light  of course  it would take years  in resting time  to reach the stars .      therefore one leaves the space time fabric to enter the little known realm of hyperspace  where time and distance have no meaning .  it is like traveling across a narrow isthmus to pass from one ocean to another  rather than remaining at sea and circling a continent to accomplish the same distance .      great amounts of energy are required  of course  to enter this    space within space    as some call it  and a great deal of ingenious calculation must be made to insure re entry into ordinary space time at the proper point .  the result of the expenditure of this energy and intelligence is that immense distances can be traversed in zero time .  it is only the jump which makes interstellar travel possible .      the jump we are about to make will take place in about ten minutes .  you will be warned .  there is never more than some momentary minor discomfort  therefore  i hope all of you will remain calm .  thank you .      the ship lights went out altogether  and there were only the stars left .   it seemed a long while before a crisp announcement filled the air momentarily     the jump will take place in exactly one minute .     and then the same voice counted the seconds backwards     fifty .  .  . forty .  .  . thirty .  .  . twenty .  .  .  ten .  .  . five .  .  . three .  .  . two .  .  . one .  .  .      it was as though there had been a momentary discontinuity in existence  a bump which joggled only the deep inside of a man   s bones .   in that immeasurable fraction of a second  one hundred light years had passed  and the ship  which had been on the outskirts of the solar system  was now in the depths of interstellar space .   someone near biron said shakily     look at the stars .      in a moment the whisper had taken life through the large room and hissed itself across the tables     the stars .  see .      in that same immeasurable fraction of a second the star view had changed radically .  the center of the great galaxy  which stretched thirty thousand light years from tip to tip  was closer now  and the stars had thickened in number .  they spread across the black velvet vacuum in a fine powder  back dropping the occasional brightness of the nearby stars .   biron  against his will  remembered the beginning of a poem he himself had once written at the sentimental age of nineteen  on the occasion of his first space flight  the one that had first taken him to the earth he was now leaving .  his lips moved silently        the stars  like dust  encircle me  in living mists of light   and all of space i seem to see  in one vast burst of sight .        the lights went on then  and biron   s thoughts were snapped out of space as suddenly as they had entered it .  he was in a space liner   s salon again  with a dinner dragging to an end  and the hum of conversation rising to a prosaic level again .   he glanced at his wrist watch  half looked away  then  very slowly  brought the wrist watch into focus again .  he stared at it for a long minute .  it was the wrist watch he had left in his bedroom that night  it had withstood the killing radiation of the bomb  and he had collected it with the rest of his belongings the next morning .  how many times had he looked at it since then .  how many times had he stared at it  taken mental note of the time and no note at all of the other piece of information it shouted at him .   for the plastic wristband was white  not blue .  it was white .   slowly the events of that night  all of them  fell into place .  strange how one fact could shake an the confusion out of them .     he rose abruptly  murmuring     pardon me .     under his breath .  it was a breach of etiquette to leave before the captain  but that was a matter of small importance to him then .   he hastened to his room  striding up the ramps rapidly  rather than waiting for the non gravity elevators .  he locked the door behind him and looked quickly through the bathroom and the built in closets .  he had no real hope of catching anyone .  what they had had to do  they must have done hours ago .   carefully  he went through his baggage .  they had done a thorough job .  with scarcely any sign to show that they had come and gone  they had carefully withdrawn his identification papers  a packet of letters from his father  and even his capsular introduction to hinrik of rhodia .   that was why they had moved him .  it was neither the old room nor the new that they were interested in  merely the process of moving .  for nearly an hour they must have legitimately  legitimately  by space .   concerned themselves with his baggage  and served their own purposes thereby .   biron sank down upon the double bed and thought furiously  but it didn   t help .  the trap had been perfect .  everything had been planned .  had it not been for the completely unpredictable chance of his leaving his wrist watch in the bedroom that night  he would not even now have realized how close meshed the tyranni   s net through space was .   there was a soft burr as his door signal sounded .      come in     he said .   it was the steward  who said respectfully     the captain wishes to know if there is anything he can do for you .  you seemed ill as you left the table .         i   m all right     he said .   how they watched him .  and in that moment he knew that there was no escape  and that the ship was carrying him politely  but surely  to his death .     four     free .     sander jonti met the other   s eyes coldly .  he said     gone  you say .      rizzett passed a hand over his ruddy face .     something is gone .  i don   t know its identity .  it might have been the document we   re after  certainly .  all we know about it is that it had been dated somewhere in the fifteenth to twenty first century of earth   s primitive calendar  and that it is dangerous .         is there any definite reason to believe that the missing one is the document .         only circumstantial reasoning .  it was guarded closely by the earth government .         discount that .  an earthman will treat any document relating to the pre galactic past with veneration .  it   s their ridiculous worship of tradition .         but this one was stolen and yet they never announced the fact .  why do they guard an empty case .         i can imagine their doing that rather than finding themselves forced to admit that a holy relic has been stolen .  yet i cannot believe that young farrill obtained it after all .  i thought you had him under observation .      the other smiled .     he didn   t get it .         how do you know .      jonti   s agent quickly exploded his land mine .     because the document has been gone twenty years .         what .         it has not been seen for twenty years .         then it can   t be the right one .  it was less than six months ago that the rancher learned of its existence .         then somebody else beat him to it by nineteen and a half years .      jonti considered .  he said     it does not matter .  it cannot matter .         why so .         because i have been here on earth for months .  before i came  it was easy to believe that there might be information of value on the planet .  but consider now .  when earth was the only inhabited planet in the galaxy  it was a primitive place  militarily speaking .  the only weapon they had ever invented worth mentioning was a crude and inefficient nuclear reaction bomb for which they had not even developed the logical defense .     he flung his arm outward in a delicate gesture to where the blue horizon gleamed its sickly radio .  activity beyond the thick concrete of the room .   he went on .     all this is placed in sharp focus for me as a temporary resident here .  it is ridiculous to assume that it is possible to learn anything from a society at that level of military technology .  it is always very fashionable to assume that there are lost arts and lost sciences  and there are always these people who make a cult of primitivism and who make all sorts of ridiculous claims for the prehistoric civilizations on earth .      rizzett said     yet the rancher was a wise man .  he told us specifically that it was the most dangerous document he knew .  you remember what he said .  i can quote it .  he said     the matter is death for the tyranni  and death for us as well  but it would mean final life for the galaxy .             the rancher  like all human beings  can be wrong .         consider  sir  that we have no idea as to the nature of the document .  it could  for instance  be somebody   s laboratory notes which had never been published .  it might be something that could relate to a weapon the earthmen had never recognized as a weapon  something which on the face of it might not be a weapon          nonsense .  you are a military man and should know better .  if there is one science into which man has probed continuously and successfully  it is that of military technology .  no potential weapon would remain unrealized for ten thousand years .  i think  rizzett  we will return to lingane .      rizzett shrugged .  he was not convinced .   nor  a thousandfold  was jonti .  it had been stolen  and that was significant .  it had been worth stealing .  anyone in the galaxy might have it now .   unwillingly the thought came to him that the tyranni might have it .  the rancher had been most evasive on the matter .  even jonti himself had not been trusted sufficiently .  the rancher had said it carried death  it could not be used without having it cut both ways .  jonti   s lips clamped shut .  the fool and his idiotic hintings .  and now the tyranni had him .   what if a man like aratap were now in the possession of such a secret as this might be .  aratap .  the one man  now that the rancher was gone  who remained unpredictable  the most dangerous tyrannian of them all .     simok aratap was a small man  a little bandy legged  narrow eyed fellow .  he had the stumpy  thick limbed appearance of the average tyrannian  yet though he faced an exceptionally large and well muscled specimen of the subject worlds  he was completely self possessed .  he was the confident heir  in the second generation  of those who had left their windy  infertile worlds and sparked across the emptiness to capture and enchain the rich and populous planets of the nebular regions .   his father had headed a squadron of small  flitting ships that had struck and vanished  then struck again  and made scrap of the lumbering titanic ships that had opposed them .   the worlds of the nebula had fought in the old fashion  but the tyranni had learned a new one .  where the huge  glittering vessels of the opposed navies attempted single combat  they found themselves flailing at emptiness and wasting their stores of energy .  instead  the tyranni  abandoning power alone  stressed speed and co operation  so that the opposed kingdoms toppled one after the other  singly  each waiting  half joyfully at the discomfiture of its neighbors   fallaciously secure behind its steel shipped ramparts  until its own turn came .   but those wars were fifty years earlier .  now the nebular regions were satrapies that required merely the acts of occupation and taxation .  previously there had been worlds to gain  aratap thought wearily  and now there was little left to do but to contend with single men .   he looked at the young man who faced him .  he was quite a young man .  a tall fellow with very good shoulders indeed  an absorbed  intent face with the hair of his head cut ridiculously short in what was undoubtedly a collegiate affectation .  in an unofficial sense  aratap was sorry for him .  he was obviously frightened .   biron did not recognize the feeling inside him as    fright .     if he had been asked to put a name to the emotion  he would have described it as    tension .     all his life he had known the tyranni to be the overlords .  his father  strong and vital though he was  unquestioned on his own estate  respectfully heard on others  was quiet and almost humble in the presence of the tyranni .   they came occasionally to widemos on polite visits  with questions as to the annual tribute they called taxation .  the rancher of widemos was responsible for the collection and delivery of these funds on behalf of the planet nephelos and  perfunctorily  the tyranni would check his books .   the rancher himself would assist them out of their small vessels .  they would sit at the head of the table at mealtimes  and they would be served first .  when they spoke  all other conversation stopped instantly .   as a child  he wondered that such small  ugly men should be so carefully handled  but he learned as he grew up that they were to his father what his father was to a cow hand .  he even learned to speak softly to them himself  and to address them as    excellency .      he had learned so well that now that he faced one of the overlords  one of the tyranni  he could feel himself shiver with tension .   the ship which he had considered his prison became officially one on the day of landing upon rhodia .  they had signaled at his door and two husky crewmen had entered and stood on either side of him .  the captain  who followed  had said in a flat voice     biron farrill  i take you into custody by the power vested in me as captain of this vessel  and hold you for questioning by the commissioner of the great king .      the commissioner was this small tyrannian who sat before him now  seemingly abstracted and uninterested .  the    great king    was the khan of the tyranni  who still lived in the legendary stone palace on the tyrannian   s home planet .   biron looked furtively about him .  he was not physically constrained in any way  but four guards in the slate blue of the tyrannian outer police flanked him  two and two .  they were armed .  a fifth  with a major   s insignia  sat beside the commissioner   s desk .   the commissioner spoke to him for the first time .     as you may know     his voice was high  pitched  thin     the old rancher of widemos  your father  has been executed for treason .      his faded eyes were fixed on biron   s .  there seemed nothing beyond mildness in them .   biron remained stolid .  it bothered him that he could do nothing .  it would have been so much more satisfying to howl at them  to flail madly at them  but that would not make his father less dead .  he thought he knew the reason for this initial statement .  it was intended to break him down  to make him give himself away .  well  it wouldn   t .   he said evenly     i am biron malaine of earth .  if you are questioning my identity  i would like to communicate with the terrestrial consul .         ah yes  but we are at a purely informal stage just now .  you are biron malaine  you say  of earth .  and yet     aratap indicated the papers before him     there are letters here which were written by widemos to his son .  there is a college registration receipt and tickets to commencement exercises made out to a biron farrill .  they were found in your baggage .      biron felt desperate but he did not let it show .     my baggage was searched illegally  so that i deny that those can be admitted as evidence .         we are not in a court of law  mr .  farrill or malaine .  how do you explain them .         if they were found in my baggage  they were placed there by someone else .      the commissioner passed it by  and biron felt amazed .  his statements sounded so thin  so patently foolish .  yet the commissioner did not remark upon them  but only tapped the black capsule with his forefinger .     and this introduction to the director of rhodia .  also not yours .         no  that is mine .     biron had planned that .  the introduction did not mention his name .  he said     there is a plot to assassinate the director       he stopped  appalled .  it sounded so completely unconvincing when he finally put the beginning of his carefully prepared speech into actual sound .  surely the commissioner was smiling cynically at him .   but aratap was not .  he merely sighed a little and with quick  practiced gestures removed contact lenses from his eyes and placed them carefully in a glass of saline solution that stood on the desk before him .  his naked eyeballs were a little watery .   he said     and you know of it .  even back on earth  five hundred light years away .  our own police here on rhodia have not heard of it .         the police are here .  the plot is being developed on earth .         i see .  and are you their agent .  or are you going to warn hinrik against them .         the latter  of course .         indeed .  and why do you intend to warn him .         for the substantial reward which i expect to get .      aratap smiled .     that  at least  rings true and lends a certain truthful gloss to your previous statements .  what are the details of the plot you speak of .         that is for the director only .      a momentary hesitation  then a shrug .     very well .  the tyranni are not interested and do not concern themselves with local politics .  we will arrange an interview between yourself and the director and that will be our contribution to his safety .  my men will hold you until your baggage can be collected  and then you will be free to go .  remove him .      the last was to the armed men  who left with biron .  aratap replaced his contact lenses  an action which removed    instantly that look of vague incompetence their absence had seemed to induce .   he said to the major  who had remained     we will keep an eye  i think  on this young farrill .      the officer nodded shortly .     good .  for a moment i thought you might have been taken in .  to me  his story was quite incoherent .         it was .  it   s just that which makes him maneuverable for the while .  all young fools who get their notions of interstellar intrigue from the video spy thrillers are easily handled .  lie is  of course  the son of the ex rancher .      and now the major hesitated .     are you sure .  it   s a vague and unsatisfactory accusation we have against him .         you mean that it might be arranged evidence after all .  for what purpose .         it could mean that he is a decoy  sacrificed to divert our attention from a real biron farrill elsewhere .         no .  improbably theatrical  that .  besides  we have a photocube .         what .  of the boy .         of the rancher   s son .  would you like to see it .         i certainly would .      aratap lifted the paperweight upon his desk .  it was a simple glass cube  three inches on each side  black and opaque .  he said     i meant to confront him with it if it had seemed best .  it is a cute process  this one  major .  i don   t know if you   re acquainted with it .  it   s been developed recently among the inner worlds .  outwardly  it seems an ordinary photocube  but when it is turned upside down  there   s an automatic molecular re arrangement which renders it totally opaque .  it is a pleasant conceit .      he turned the cube right side up .  the opacity shimmered for a moment  then cleared slowly like a black fog wisping and feathering before the wind .  aratap watched it calmly  hands folded across his chest .   and then it was water clear  and a young face smiled brightly out of it  accurate and alive  trapped and solidified in mid breath forever .      an item     said aratap     in the ex rancher   s possessions .  what do you think .         it is the young man  without question .         yes .     the tyrannian official regarded the photocube thoughtfully .     you know  using this same process  i don   t see why six photographs could not be taken in the same cube .  it has six faces  and by resting the cube on each of them in turn  a series of new molecular orientations might be induced .  six connected photographs  flowing one into another as you turned  a static phenomenon turned dynamic and taking on new breadth and vision .  major  it would be a new art form .     a mounting enthusiasm had crept into his voice .   but the silent major looked faintly scornful  and aratap left his artistic reflections to say  abruptly     then you will watch farrill .         certainly .         watch hinrik as well .         hinrik .         of course .  it is the whole purpose of freeing the boy .  i want some questions answered .  why is farrill seeing hinrik .  what is the connection between them .  the dead rancher did not playa lone hand  there was  there must have been  a well organized conspiracy behind them .  and we have not yet located the workings of that conspiracy .         but surely hinrik could    not be involved .  he lacks the intelligence  even if he had the courage .         granted .  but it is just because he is half an idiot that he may serve them as a tool .  if so  he represents a weakness in our scheme of things .  we obviously cannot afford to neglect the possibility .      he gestured absently  the major saluted  turned on his heel  and left .   aratap sighed  thoughtfully turned the photocube in his hand  and watched the blackness wash back like a tide of ink .   life was simpler in his father   s time .  to smash a planet had a cruel grandeur about it  while this careful maneuvering of an ignorant young man was simply cruel .   and yet necessary .     five     uneasy lies the head    the directorship of rhodia is not ancient  when compared with earth  as a habitat for homo sapiens .  it is not ancient even when compared with the centaurian or sirian worlds .  the planets of arcturus  for instance  had been settled for two hundred years when the first space ships circled the horsehead nebula to find the nest of hundreds of oxygen water planets behind .  they clustered thickly and it was a real find  for although planets infest space  few can satisfy the chemical necessities of the human organism .   there are between one and two hundred billion radiant stars in the galaxy .  among them are some five hundred billion planets .  of these  some have gravities more than     per cent that of earth  or less than    per cent  and are therefore unbearable in the long run .  some are too hot  some too cold .  some have poisonous atmospheres .  planetary atmospheres consisting largely or entirely of neon  methane  ammonia  chlorine  even silicon tetrafluoride  have been recorded .  some planets lack water  one with oceans of almost pure sulphur dioxide having been described .  others lack carbon .   any one of these failings is sufficient  so that not one world in a hundred thousand can be lived on .  yet this still leaves an estimated four million habitable worlds .   the exact number of these which are actually occupied is disputable .  according to the galactic almanac  admittedly dependent on imperfect records  rhodia was the l   th world settled by man .   ironically enough  tyrann  eventually rhodia   s conqueror  was the     th .   the pattern of history in the trans nebular region was distressingly similar to that elsewhere during the period of development and expansion .  planet republics were set up in rapid succession  each government confined to its own world .  with expanding economy  neighboring planets were colonized and integrated with the home society .  small    empires    were established and these inevitably clashed .   hegemony over sizable regions was established by first one  then another of these governments  depending upon the fluctuations of the fortunes of war and of leadership .   only rhodia maintained a lengthy stability  under the able dynasty of the hinriads .  it was perhaps well on the road to establishing finally a universal trans nebular empire in a stolid century or two  when the tyranni came and did the job in ten years .   ironical that it should be the men of tyrann .  until then  during the seven hundred years of its existence  tyrann had done little better than maintain a precarious autonomy  thanks largely to the undesirability of its barren landscape  which  because of a planetary water dearth  was largely desert .   but even after the tyranni came  the directorship of rhodia continued .  it had even grown .  the hinriads were popular with the people  so their existence served as a means of easy control .  the tyranni did not care who got the cheers as long as they themselves received the taxes .   to be sure  the directors were no longer the hinriads of old .  the directorship had always been elective within the family so that the ablest might be chosen .  adoptions into the family had been encouraged for the same purpose .   but now the tyranni could influence the elections for other reasons  and twenty years earlier  for instance  hinrik  fifth of that name  had been chosen director .  to the tyranni  it had seemed a useful choice .   hinrik had been a handsome man at the time of his election  and he still made an impressive appearance when he addressed the rhodian council .  his hair had grayed smoothly  and his thick mustache remained  startingly enough  as black as his daughter   s eyes .   at the moment he faced his daughter  and she was furious .  she lacked only two inches of his height  and the director lacked less than an inch of six feet .  she was a smoldering girl  dark of hair and of eyes  and  at the moment  loweringly dark of complexion .   she said again     i can   t do it .  i won   t do it .      hinrik said     but  arta  arta  this is unreasonable .  what am i to do .  what can i do .  in my position  what choice have i .         if mother were alive  she would find a way out .     and she stamped her foot .  her full name was artemisia  a royal name that had been borne by at least one female of the hinriads in every generation .      yes  yes  no doubt .  bless my soul .  what a way your mother had with her .  there are times when you seem all of her and none of me .  but surely  arta  you haven   t given him a chance .  have you observed his  ah  better points .         which are those .         the ones which .  .  .     he gestured vaguely  thought a while and gave it up .  he approached her and would have put a consoling hand upon her shoulder  but she squirmed away from him  her scarlet gown shimmering in the air .      i have spent an evening with him     she said bitterly     and he tried to kiss me .  it was disgusting .         but everyone kisses  dear .  it   s not as though this were your grandmother   s time  of respected memory .  kisses are nothing  less than nothing .  young blood  arta  young blood .         young blood  my foot .  the only time that horrible little man has had young blood in him these fifteen years has been immediately after a transfusion .  he   s four inches shorter than i am  father .  how can i be seen in public with a pygmy .         he   s an important man .  very important .         that doesn   t add a single inch to his height .  he is bowlegged  as they all are  and his breath smells .         his breath smells .     artemisia wrinkled her nose at her father .     that   s right  it smells .  it has an unpleasant odor .  i didn   t like it and i let him know it .      hinrik . dropped his jaw wordlessly for a moment  then said in a hoarse half whisper     you let him know it .  you implied that a high official of the royal court of tyrann could have an unpleasant personal characteristic .         he did .  i have a nose  you know .  so when he got too close  i just held it and pushed .  a figure of man to admire  that one is .  he went flat on his back  with his legs sticking up .     she gestured with her fingers in illustration  but it was lost on hinrik  who  with a moan  hunched his shoulders and put his hands over his face .   he peered miserably from between two fingers .     what will happen now .  how can you act so .         it didn   t do me any good .  do you know what he said .  do you know what he said .  it was the last straw .  it was absolutely the limit .  i made up my mind then that i couldn   t stand that man if he were ten feet tail .         but  but  what did he say .         he said  straight out of a video  father  he said     ha .  a spirited wench .  i like her all the better for that .     and two servants helped him stagger to his feet .  but he didn   t try to breathe in my face again .      hinrik doubled into a chair  leaned forward and regarded artemisia earnestly .     you could go through the motions of marrying him  couldn   t you .  you needn   t be in earnest .  why not merely  for the sake of political expediency          how do you mean  not in earnest  father .  shall i cross the fingers of my left hand while signing the contract with my right .      hinrik looked confused .     no  of course not .  what good would that do .  how would crossing fingers alter the validity of the contract .  really  arta  i   m surprised at your stupidity .      artemisia sighed .     what do you mean  then .         mean by what .  you see  you   ve disrupted things .  i can   t keep my mind on matters properly when you argue with me .  what was i saying .         i was merely to pretend i was getting married  or something .  remember .         oh yes .  i mean  you needn   t take it too seriously  you see .         i can have lovers  i suppose .      hinrik stiffened and frowned .     arta .  i brought you up to be a modest  self respecting girl .  so did your mother .  how can you say such things .  it   s shameful .         but isn   t that what you mean .          i can say it .  i am a man  a mature man .  a girl like you ought not to repeat it .         well  i have repeated it and it   s out in the open .  i don   t mind lovers .  i   ll probably have to have them if i   m forced to marry for reasons of state  but there are limits .     she placed her hands upon her hips  and the cape like sleeves of her gown slithered away from her tanned and dimpled shoulders .     what will i do between lovers .  he   ll still be my husband and i just can   t bear that particular thought .         but he   s an old man  my dear .  life with him would be short .         not short enough  thank you .  five minutes ago he had young blood .  remember .      hinrik spread his hands wide and let them drop .     arta  the man is a tyrannian  and a powerful one .  he is in good odor at the khan   s court .         the khan might think it   s a good odor .  he probably would .  he probably stinks himself .      hinrik   s mouth was an o of horror .  automatically  he looked over his shoulder .  then he said hoarsely     don   t ever say anything like that again .         i will if i feel like it .  besides  the man has had three wives already .     she forestalled him .     not the khan  the man you want me to marry .         but they   re dead     hinrik explained earnestly .     arta  they   re not alive .  don   t think that .  how can you imagine i would let my daughter marry a bigamist .  we   ll have him produce documents .  he married them consecutively  not simultaneously  and they   re dead now  entirely dead  all of them .         it   s no wonder .         oh  bless my soul  what shall i do .     he made a last effort at dignity .     arta  it is the price of being a hinriad and a director   s daughter .         i didn   t ask to be a hinriad and a director   s daughter .         that has nothing to do with it .  it is just that the history of all the galaxy  arta  shows that there are occasions when reasons of state  the safety of planets  the best interests of peoples require that  uh          that some poor girl prostitute herself .         oh  this vulgarity .  someday  you   ll see  someday you   ll say something of the sort in public .         well  that   s what it is  and i won   t do it .  i   d rather die .  i   d rather do anything .  and i will .      the director got to his feet and held out his arms to her .  his lips trembled and he said nothing .  she ran to him in a sudden agony of tears and clung desperately to him .     i can   t  daddy .  i can   t .  don   t make me .      he patted her awkwardly .     but if you don   t  what will happen .  if the tyranni are displeased  they will remove me  imprison me  maybe even exec      he gagged on the word .     these are very unhappy times  arta  very unhappy .  the rancher of widemos was condemned last week and i believe he has been executed .  you remember him  arta .  he was at court half a year ago .  a big man  with a round head and deep set eyes .  you were frightened of him at first .          i remember .         well  he is probably dead .  and who knows .  myself next  perhaps .  your poor  harmless old father next .  it is a bad time .  he was at our court and that   s very suspicious .      she suddenly held herself out at arm   s length .     why should it be suspicious .  you weren   t involved with him  were you .         i .  indeed not .  but if we openly insult the khan of tyrann by refusing an alliance with one of his favorites  they may choose to think even that .      hinrik   s hand wringing was interrupted by the muted buzz of the extension .  he started uneasily .      i   ll take it in my own room .  you just rest .  you   ll feel better after a nap .  you   ll see  you   ll see .  it   s just that you   re a little on edge now .      artemisia looked after him and frowned .  her    face was intensely thoughtful  and for minutes only the gentle tide of her breasts betrayed life .   there was the sound of stumbling feet at the door  and she turned .      what is it .     the tone was sharper than she had intended .   it was hinrik  his face sallow with fear .     major andros was calling .         of the outer police .     hinrik could only nod .   artemisia cried     surely  he   s not      she paused reluctantly at the threshold of putting the horrible thought into words  but waited in vain for enlightenment .      there is a young man who wants an audience .  i don   t know him .  why should he come here .  he   s from earth .     he was gasping for breath and staggered as he spoke  as though his mind were on a turntable and he had to follow it in its gyrations .   the girl ran to him and seized his elbow .  she said sharply     sit down  father .  tell me what has happened .     she took him and some of the panic drained out of his face .      i don   t know exactly     he whispered .     there   s a young man coming here with details concerning a plot on my life .  on my life .  and they tell me i ought to listen to him .      he smiled foolishly .     i   m loved by the people .  no one would want to kill me .  would they .  would they .      he was watching her eagerly  and relaxed when she said     of course no one would want to kill you .      then he was tense again .     do you think it might be they .         who .      he leaned over to whisper .     the tyranni .  the rancher of widemos was here yesterday  and they killed him .     his voice ascended the scale .     and now they   re sending someone over to kill me .      artemisia gripped his shoulder with such force that his mind turned to the present pain .   she said     father .  sit quietly .  not a word .  listen to me .  no one will kill you .  do you hear me .  no one will kill you .  it was six months ago that the rancher was here .  do you remember .  wasn   t it six months ago .  think .         so long .     whispered the director .     yes  yes  it must have been so .         now you stay here and rest .  you   re overwrought .  i   ll see the young man myself and then i   ll bring him to you if it   s safe         will you  arta .  will you .  he won   t hurt a woman .  surely he wouldn   t hurt a woman .      she bent suddenly and kissed his cheek .      be careful     he murmured  and closed his eyes wearily .     six     that wears a crown    biron farrill waited uneasily in one of the outer buildings on the palace grounds .  for the first time in his life he experienced the deflating sensation of being a provincial .   widemos hall  where he had grown up  had been beautiful in his eyes  and now his memory endowed it with merely barbaric glitter .  its curved lines  its filigree work  its curiously wrought turrets  its elaborate    false windows     he winced at the thought of them .   but this  this was different .   the palace grounds of rhodia were no mere lump of    ostentation built by the petty lords of a cattle kingdom  nor were they the childlike expression of a fading and dying world .  they were the culmination  in stone  of the hinriad dynasty .   the buildings were strong and quiet .  their lines were straight and vertical  lengthening toward the center of each structure  yet avoiding anything as effeminate as a spire effect .  they held a bluntness about them  yet lifted into a climax that affected the onlooker without revealing their method of doing so at a casual glance .  they were reserved  self contained  proud .   and as each building was  so was the group as a whole  the huge palace central becoming a crescendo .  one by one  even the few artificialities remaining in the masculine rhodian style had dropped away .  the very    false windows     so valued as decoration and so useless in a building of artificial light and ventilation  were done away with .  and that  somehow  without loss .   it was only line and plane  a geometrical abstraction that led the eye upward to the sky .   the tyrannian major stopped briefly at his side as he left the inner room .      you will be received now     he said .   biron nodded  and after a while a larger man in a uniform of scarlet and tan clicked heels before him .  it struck biron with sudden force that those who had the real power did not need the outward show and could be satisfied with slate blue .  he recalled the splendid formality of a rancher   s life and bit his lip at the thought of its futility .      biron malaine .     asked the rhodian guard  and biron rose to follow .     there was a little gleaming monorail carriage that was suspended delicately by diamagnetic forces upon a single ruddy shaft of metal .  biron had never seen one before .  he paused before entering .   the little carriage  big enough for five or six at the most  swayed with the wind  a graceful teardrop returning the gleam of rhodia   s splendid sun .  the single rail was slender  scarcely more than a cable  and ran the length of the carriage   s underside without touching .  biron bent and saw blue sky all the length between them .  for a moment  as he watched  a lifting gust of wind raised it  so that it hovered a full inch above the rail  as though impatient for flight and tearing at the invisible force field that held it .  then it fluttered back to the rail  closer and still closer  but never touching .      get in     said the guard behind him impatiently  and biron climbed two steps into the carriage .   the steps remained long enough for the guard to follow  then lifted quietly and smoothly into place  forming no break in the carriage   s even exterior .   biron became aware that the outer opacity of the carriage was an illusion .  once within  he found himself sitting in a transparent bubble .  at the motion of a small control  the carriage lifted upward .  it climbed the heights easily  buffeting the atmosphere which whistled past .  for one moment  biron caught the panorama of the palace grounds from the apex of the arc .   the structures became a gorgeous whole  could they   have been originally conceived other than as an air view .    laced by the shining copper threads  along one or two of which the graceful carriage bubbles skimmed .   he felt himself pressed forward  and the carriage came to a dancing halt .  the entire run had lasted less than two minutes .     a door stood open before him .  he entered and it closed behind him .  there was no one in the room  which was small and bare .  for the moment  no one was pushing him  but he felt no comfort because of it .  he was under no illusions .  ever since that damned night  others had forced his moves .   jonti had placed him on the ship .  the tyrannian commissioner had placed him here .  and each move had increased the measure of his desperation .   it was obvious to biron that the tyrannian had not been fooled .  it had been too easy to get away from him .  the commissioner might have called the terrestrial consul .  he might have hyper waved earth  or taken his retinal patterns .  these things were routine  they could not have been omitted accidentally .   he remembered jonti   s analysis of affairs .  some of it might still be valid .  the tyranni would not kill him outright to create another martyr .  but hinrik was their puppet  and he was as capable as they of ordering an execution .  and then he would have been killed by one of his own  and the tyranni would merely be disdainful onlookers .   biron clenched his fists tightly .  he was tall and strong  but he was unarmed .  the men who would come for him would have blasters and neuronic whips .  he found himself backing against the wall .   he whirled quickly at the small sound of the opening door to his left .  the man who entered was armed and uniformed but there was a girl with him .  he relaxed a bit .  it was only a girl with him .  at another time he might have observed the girl closely  since she was worth observation and approval  but at the moment she was only a girl .   they approached together  stopping some six feet away .  he kept his eye on the guard   s blaster .   the girl said to the guard     i   ll speak to him first  lieutenant .      there was a little vertical line between her eyes as she turned to him .  she said     are you the man who has this story of an assassination plot against the director .      biron said     i was told i would see the director .         that is impossible .  if you have anything to say  say it to me .  if your information is truthful and useful  you will be well treated .         may i ask you who you are .  how do i know you are authorized to speak for the director .      the girl seemed annoyed .     i am his daughter .  please answer my questions .  are you from outside the system .         i am from earth .     biron paused  then added     your grace .      the addition pleased her .     where is that .         it is a small planet of the sirian sector  your grace .         and what is your name .         biron malaine  your grace .      she stared at him thoughtfully .     from earth .  can you pilot a space ship .      biron almost smiled .  she was testing him .  she knew very well that space navigation was one of the forbidden sciences in the tyranni controlled worlds .   he said     yes  your grace .     he could prove that when the performance test came  if they let him live that long .  space navigation was not a forbidden science en earth  and in four years one could learn much .   she said     very well .  and your story .      he made his decision suddenly .  to the guard alone  he would not have dared .  but this was a girl  and if she were not lying  if she really were the director   s daughter  she might be a persuasive factor on his behalf .   he said     there is no assassination plot  your grace .      the girl was startled .  she turned impatiently to her companion .     would you take over  lieutenant .  get the truth out of him .      biron took a step forward and met the cold thrust of the guard   s blaster .  he said urgently     wait  your grace .  listen to me .  it was the only way to see the director .  don   t you understand .      he raised his voice and sent it after her retreating form .     will you tell his excellency  at least  that i am biron farrill and claim my sanctuary right .      it was a feeble straw at which to clutch .  the old feudal customs had been losing their force with the generations even before the tyranni came .  now they were archaisms .  but there was nothing else .  nothing .   she turned  and her eyebrows were arched .     are you claiming now to be of the aristocratic order .  a moment ago your name was malaine .      a new voice sounded unexpectedly .     so it was  but it is the second name which is correct .  you are biron farrill indeed  my good sir .  of course you are .  the resemblance is unmistakable .     .   a small  smiling man stood in the doorway .  his eyes  widely spaced and brilliant  were taking in all of biron with an amused sharpness .  he cocked his narrow face upward at biron   s height and said to the girl     don   t you recognize him  too  artemisia .      artemisia hurried to him  her voice troubled .     uncle oil  what are you doing here .         taking care of my interests  artemisia .  remember that if there were an assassination  i would be the closest of the hinriads to the possible succession .     gillbret oth hinriad winked elaborately  then added     oh  get the lieutenant out of here .  there isn   t any danger .      she ignored that and said     have you been sounding the communicator again .         but yes .  would you deprive me of an amusement .  it is pleasant to eavesdrop on them .         not if they catch you .         the danger is part of the game  my dear .  the amusing part .  after all  the tyranni do not hesitate to sound the  . palace .  we can   t do much without their knowing .  well  turnabout  you know .  aren   t you going to introduce me .         no  i   m not     she said shortly .     this is none of your business .         then i   ll introduce you .  when i heard his name  i stopped listening and came in .     he moved past artemisia  stepped up to biron  inspected him with an impersonal smile  and said     this  is biron farrill .         i have said so myself     said biron .  more than half his attention was upon the lieutenant  who still held his blaster in firing position .      but you have not added that you are the son of the rancher of widemos .         i would have but for your interruption .  in any case  you   ve got the story now .  obviously  i had to get away from the tyranni  and that without giving them my real name .     biron waited .  this was it  he felt .  if the next move was not an immediate arrest  there was still a trifling chance .   artemisia said     i see .  this is a matter for the director .  you are sure there is no plot of any sort  then .         none  your grace .         good .  uncle gil  will you remain with mr .  farrill .  lieutenant  will you come with me .      biron felt weak .  he would have liked to sit down  but no suggestion to that effect was made by gillbret  who still inspected him with an almost clinical interest .      the rancher   s son .  amusing .      biron brought his attention downward .  he was tired of cautious monosyllables and careful phrases .  he said abruptly     yes  the rancher   s son .  it is a congenital situation .  can i help you in any other way .      gillbret showed no offense .  his thin face merely creased further as his smile widened .  he said     you might satisfy my curiosity .  you really came for sanctuary .  here .         i   d rather discuss that with the director  sir .         oh  get off it  young man .  you   ll find that very little business can be done with the director .  why do you suppose you had to deal with his daughter just now .  that   s an amusing thought  if you   ll consider it .         do you find everything amusing .         why not .  as an attitude toward life  it   s an amusing one .  it   s the only adjective that will fit .  observe the universe  young man .  if you can   t force amusement out of it  you might as well cut your throat  since there   s damned little good in it .  i haven   t introduced myself  by the way .  i   m the director   s cousin .      biron said coldly     congratulations .      gillbret shrugged .     you   re right .  it   s not impressive .  and i   m likely to remain just that indefinitely since there is no assassination to be expected after all .         unless you whip one up for yourself .         my dear sir  your sense of humor .  you   ll have to get used to the fact that nobody takes me seriously .  my remark was only an expression of cynicism .  you don   t suppose the directorship is worth anything these days  do you .  surely you cannot believe that hinrik was always like this .  he was never a great brain  but with every year he becomes more impossible .  i forget .  you haven   t seen him yet .  but you will .  i hear him coming .  when he speaks to you  remember that he is the ruler of the largest of the trans nebular kingdoms .  it will be an amusing thought .      hinrik bore his dignity with the ease of experience .  he acknowledged biron   s painstakingly ceremonious bow with the proper degree of condescension .  he said  with a trace of abruptness     and your business with us  sir .      artemisia was standing at her father   s side  and biron noticed  with some surprise  that she was quite pretty .  he said     your excellency  i have come on behalf of my father   s good name .  you must know his execution was unjust .      hinrik looked away .     i knew your father slightly .  he was in rhodia once or twice .     he paused  and his voice quavered a bit .     you are very like him .  very .  but he was tried  you know .  at least i imagine he was .  and according to law .  really  i don   t know the details .         exactly  your excellency .  but i would like to learn those details .  i am sure that my father was no traitor .      hinrik broke in hurriedly .     as his son  of course  it is understandable that you should defend your father  but  really  it is difficult to discuss such matters of state now .  highly irregular  in fact .  why don   t you see aratap .         i do not know him  excellency .         aratap .  the commissioner .  the tyrannian commissioner           i have seen him and he sent me here .  surely  you understand that i dare not let the tyranni       but hinrik had grown stiff .  his hand had wandered to his lips  as though to keep them from trembling  and his words were consequently muffled .     aratap sent you here  you say .         i found it necessary to tell him          don   t repeat what you told him .  i know     said hinrik .     i can do nothing for you  rancher  uh  mr .  farrill .  it is not in my jurisdiction alone .  the executive council  stop pulling at me  arta .  how can i pay attention to matters when you distract me .   must be consulted .  gillbret .  will you see that mr .  farrill is taken care of .  i will see what can be done .  yes  i will consult the executive council .  the forms of law  you know .  very important .  very important .      he turned on his heel  mumbling .   artemisia lingered for a moment and touched biron   s sleeve .     a moment .  was it true  your statement that you could pilot a spaceship .         quite true     said biron .  he smiled at her  and after a moment   s hesitation  she dimpled briefly in return .      gillbret     she said     i want to speak to you later .      she hurried off .  biron looked after her till gillbret tweaked at his sleeve .      i presume you are hungry  perhaps thirsty  would like a wash .     asked gillbret .     the ordinary amenities of life continue  i take it .         thank you  yes     said biron .  the tension had almost entirely washed out of him .  for a moment he was relaxed and felt wonderful .  she was pretty .  very pretty .     but hinrik was not relaxed  in his own chambers his thoughts whirled at a feverish pace .  try as he might  he could not wriggle out of the inevitable conclusion .  it was a trap .  aratap had sent him and it was a trap .   he buried his head in his hands to quiet and deaden the pounding  and then he knew what he had to do .     seven     musician of the mind      night settles in time on all habitable planets .  not always  perhaps  at respectable intervals  since recorded periods of rotation vary from fifteen to fifty two hours .  that fact requires the most strenuous psychological adjustment from those traveling from planet to planet .   on many planets such adjustments are made  and the waking sleeping periods are tailored to fit .  on many more the almost universal use of conditioned atmospheres and artificial lighting make the day night question secondary except in so far as it modifies agriculture .  on a few planets  those of the extremes  arbitrary divisions are made which ignore the trivial facts of light and dark .   but always  whatever the social conventions  the coming of night has a deep and abiding psychological significance  dating back to man   s pre human arboreal existence .  night will always be a time of fear and insecurity  and the heart will sink with the sun .   inside palace central there was no sensory mechanism by which one could tell the coming of night  yet biron felt that coming through some indefinite instinct hidden in the unknown corridors of the human brain .  he knew that outdoors the night   s blackness was scarcely relieved by the futile sparks of the stars .  he knew that  if it were the right time of year  the jagged    hole in space    known as the horsehead nebula  so familiar to all the trans nebular kingdoms  inked out half the stars that might otherwise have been visible .   and he was depressed again .  he had not seen artemisia since the little talk with the director  and he found himself resenting that .  he had looked forward to dinner  he might have spoken to her .  instead  he had eaten alone  with two guards lounging discontentedly just outside the door .  even gillbret had left him  presumably to eat a less lonely meal in the company one would expect in a palace of the hinriads .   so that when gillbret returned and said     artemisia and i have been discussing you     he obtained a prompt and interested reaction .   it merely amused him and he said so .     first i want to show you my laboratory     he had said then .  he gestured and the two guards moved off .      what kind of a laboratory .     asked biron with a definite loss of interest .      i build gadgets     was the vague response .     it was not a laboratory to the eye .  it was more nearly a library  with an ornate desk in the corner .   biron looked it over slowly .     and you build gadgets here .  what kind of gadgets .         well  special sounding devices to spy out the tyrannian spy beams in a brand new way .  nothing they can detect .  that   s how i found out about you  when the first word came through from aratap .  and i have other amusing trinkets .  my visisonor  for instance .  do you like music .         some kinds .         good .  i invented an instrument  only i don   t know if you can properly call it music .     a shelf of book films slid out and aside at a touch .     this is not really much of a hiding place  but nobody takes me seriously  so they don   t look .  amusing  don   t you think .  but i forget  you   re the unamused one .      it was a clumsy  boxlike affair  with that singular lack of gloss and polish that marks the homemade object .  one side of it was studded with little gleaming knobs .  he put it down with that side upward .      it isn   t pretty     gillbret said     but who in time cares .  put the lights out .  no  no .  no switches or contacts .  just wish the lights were out .  wish hard .  decide you want them out .      and the lights dimmed  with the exception of the faint pearly luster of the ceiling that made them two ghostly faces in the dark .  gillbret laughed lightly at biron   s exclamation .      just one of the tricks of my visisonor .  it   s keyed to the mind like personal capsules are .  do you know what i mean .         no  i don   t  if you want a plain answer .         well     he said     look at it this way .  the electric field of your brain cells sets up an induced one in the instrument .  mathematically  it   s fairly simple  but as far as i know  no one has ever jammed all the necessary circuits into a box this size before .  usually  it takes a five story generating plant to do it .  it works the other way too .  i can close circuits here and impress them directly upon your brain  so that you   ll see and hear without any intervention of eyes and ears .  watch .      there was nothing to watch  at first .  and then something fuzzy scratched faintly at the corner of biron   s eyes .  it became a faint blue violet ball hovering in mid air .  it followed him as he turned away  remained unchanged when he closed his eyes .  and a clear  musical tone accompanied it  was part of it  was it .   it was growing and expanding and biron became disturbingly aware that it existed inside his skull .  it wasn   t really a color  but rather a colored sound  though without noise .  it was tactile  yet without feeling .   it spun and took on an iridescence while the musical tone rose in pitch till it hovered above him like falling silk .  then it exploded so that gouts of color splattered at him in touches that burned momentarily and left no pain .   bubbles of rain drenched green rose again with a quiet  soft moaning .  biron thrust at them in confusion and became aware that he could not see his hands nor feel them move .  there was nothing  only the little bubbles filling his mind to the exclusion of all else .   he cried out soundlessly and the fantasy ceased .  gillbret was standing before him once again in a lighted room  laughing .  biron felt an acute dizziness and wiped shakily at a chilled  moist forehead .  he sat down abruptly .      what happened .     he demanded  in as stiff a tone as he could manage .   gillbret said     i don   t know .  i stayed out of it .  you don   t understand .  it was something your brain had lacked previous experience with .  your brain was sensing directly and it had no method of interpretation for such a phenomenon .  so as long as you concentrated qn the sensation  your brain could only attempt  futilely  to force the effect into the old  familiar pathways .  it attempts separately and simultaneously to interpret it as sight and sound and touch .  were you conscious of an odor  by the way .  sometimes it seemed to me that i smelled the stuff .  with dogs i imagine the sensation would be forced almost entirely into odor .  i   d like to try it on animals someday .      on the other hand  if you ignore it  make no attack upon it  it fades away .  it   s what i do  when i want to observe its effects on others  and it isn   t difficult .      he placed a little veined hand upon the instrument  fingering the knobs aimlessly .     sometimes i think that if one could really study this thing  one could compose symphonies in a new medium  do things one could never do with simple sound or sight .  i lack the capacit y for it  i   m afraid .      biron said abruptly     i   d like to ask you a question .         by all means .         why don   t you put your scientific ability to worth while use instead of          wasting it on useless toys .  i don   t know .  it may not be entirely useless .  this is against the law  you know .         what is .         the visisonor .  also my spy devices .  if the tyranni knew  it could easily mean a death sentence .         surely  you   re joking .         not at all .  it is obvious that you were brought up on a cattle ranch .  the young people cannot remember what it was like in the old days  i see .     suddenly his head was to one side and his eyes were narrowed to slits .  he asked     are you opposed to tyrannian rule .  speak freely .  i tell you frankly that i am .  i tell you also that your father was .      biron said calmly     yes  i am .         why .         they are strangers  outlanders .  what right have they to rule in nephelos or in rhodia .         have you always thought that .     biron did not answer .   gillbret sniffed .     in other words  you decided they were strangers and outlanders only after they executed your father  which  after all  was their simple right .  oh  look  don   t fire up .  consider it reasonably .  believe me  i   m on your side .  but think .  your father was rancher .  what rights did his herdsmen have .  if one of them had stolen cattle for his own use or to sell to others  what would have been his punishment .  imprisonment as a thief .  if he had plotted the death of your father  for whatever reason  for perhaps a worthy reason in his own eyes  what would have been the result .  execution  undoubtedly .  and what right has your father to make laws and visit punishment upon his fellow human beings .  h e was their tyranni .      your father  in his own eyes and in mine  was a patriot .  but what of that .  to the tyranni  he was a traitor  and they removed him .  can you ignore the necessity of self defense .  the hinriads have been a bloody lot in their time .  read your history  young man .  all governments kill as part of the nature of things .       so find a better reason to hate the tyranni .  don   t think it is enough to replace one set of rulers by another  that the simple change brings freedom .      biron pounded a fist into his cupped palm .     all this objective philosophy is fine .  it is very soothing to the man who lives apart .  but what if it had been your father who was murdered .         well  wasn   t it .  my father was director before hinrik  and he was killed .  oh  not outright  but subtly .  they broke his spirit  as they are breaking hinrik   s now .  they wouldn   t have me as director when my father died  i was just a little too unpredictable .  hinrik was tall  handsome  and  above all  pliant .  yet not pliant enough  apparently .  they hound him continuously  grind him into a pitiful puppet  make sure he cannot even itch without permission .  you   ve seen him .  he   s deteriorating by the month now .  his continual state of fear is pathetically psychopathic .  but that  all that  is not why i want to destroy tyrannian rule .         no .     said biron .     you have invented an entirely new reason .         an entirely old one  rather .  the tyranni are destroying the right of twenty billion human beings to take part in the development of the race .  you   ve been to school .  you   ve learned the economic cycle .  a new planet is settled     he was ticking the points off on his fingers     and its first care is to feed itself .  it becomes an agricultural world  a herding world .  it begins to dig in the ground for crude ore to export  and sends its agricultural surplus abroad to buy luxuries and machinery .  that is the second step .  then  as population increases and foreign investments grow  an industrial civilization begins to bud  which is the third step .  eventually  the world becomes mechanized  importing food  exporting machinery  investing in the development of more primitive worlds  and so on .  the fourth step .      always the mechanized worlds are the most thickly populated  the most powerful  militarily  since war is a function of machines  and they are usually surrounded by a fringe of agricultural  dependent worlds .      but what has happened to us .  we were at the third step  with a growing industry .  and now .  that growth has been stopped  frozen  forced to recede .  it would interfere with tyrannian control of our industrial necessities .  it is a short term investment on their part  because eventually we   ll become unprofitable as we become impoverished .  but meanwhile  they skim the cream .      besides  if we industrialized ourselves  we might develop weapons of war .  so industrialization is stopped  scientific research is forbidden .  and eventually the people become so used to that  they lack the realization even that anything is missing .  so that you are surprised when   tell you that i could be executed for building a visisonor .      of course  someday we will beat the tyranni .  it is fairly inevitable .  they can   t rule forever .  no one can .  they   ll grow soft and lazy .  they will intermarry and lose much of their separate traditions .  they will become corrupt .  but it may take centuries  because history doesn   t hurry .  and when those centuries have passed  we will still all be agricultural worlds with no industrial or scientific heritage to speak of  while our neighbors on all sides  those not under tyrannian control  will be strong and urbanized .  the kingdoms will be semicolonial areas forever .  they will never catch up  and we will be merely observers in the great drama of human advance .      biron said     what you say is not completely unfamiliar .         naturally  if you were educated on earth .  earth occupies a very peculiar position in social development .         indeed .         consider .  all the galaxy has been in a continuous state of expansion since the first discovery of interstellar travel .  we have always been a growing society  therefore  an immature society .  it is obvious that human society reached maturity in only one place and at only one time and that this was on earth immediately prior to its catastrophe .  there we had a society which had temporarily lost all possibility for geographical expansion and was therefore faced with such problems as over population  depletion of resources  and so on  problems that have never faced any other portion of the galaxy .      they were forced to study the social sciences intensively .  we have lost much or all of that and it is a pity .  now here   s an amusing thing .  when hinrik was a young man  he was a great primitivist .  he had a library on things earthly that was unparalleled in the galaxy .  since he became director  that   s gone by the board along with everything else .  but in a way  i   ve inherited it .  their literature  such scraps as survive  is fascinating .  it has a peculiarly introspective flavor to it that we don   t have in our extraverted galactic civilization .  it is most amusing .      biron said     you relieve me .  you have been serious for so long that i began to wonder if you had lost your sense of humor .      gillbret shrugged .     i am relaxing and it is wonderful .  first time in months  i think .  do you know what it is to playa part .  to split your personality deliberately for twenty four hours a day .  even when with friends .  even when alone  so that you will never forget inadvertently .  to be a dilettante .  to be eternally amused .  to be of no account .  to be so effete and faintly ridiculous that you have convinced all who know you of your own worthlessness .  an so that your life may be safe even though it means it has become barely worth living .  but  even so  once in a while i can fight them .      he looked up  and his voice was earnest  almost pleading .     you can pilot a ship .  i cannot .  isn   t that strange .  you talk about my scientific ability  yet i cannot pilot a simple one man space gig .  but you can  and it follows then that you must leave rhodia .      there was no mistaking the pleading  but biron frowned coldly .     why .      gillbret continued  speaking rapidly     as i said  artemisia and i have discussed you and arranged this .  when you leave here  proceed directly to her room  where she is waiting for you .  i have drawn a diagram for you  so that you won   t have to ask your way through the corridors .     he was forcing a small sheet of metallene upon biron .     if anyone does stop you  say that you have been summoned by the director  and proceed .  there will be no trouble if you show no uncertainty          hold on .     said biron .  he was not going to do it again .  jonti had chevied him to rhodia and  consequently  succeeded in bringing him before the tyranni .  the tyrannian commissioner had then chevied him to palace central before he could feel his own secret way there and  consequently  subjected him  nakedly unprepared  to the whims of an unsteady puppet .  but that was all .  his moves  henceforward  might be severely limited  but  by space and time  they would be his own .  he felt very stubborn about it .   he said     i   m here on what is important business to me  sir .  i   m not leaving .         what .  don   t be a young idiot .     for a moment the old gillbret was showing through .     do you think you will accomplish anything here .  do you think you will get out of the palace alive if you let the morning sun rise .  why  hinrik will call in the tyranni and you will be imprisoned within twenty four hours .  he is only waiting this while because it takes him so long to make up his mind to do anything .  he is my cousin .  i know him  i tell you .      biron said     and if so  what is that to you .  why should you be so concerned about me .     he was not going to be chevied .  he would never again be another man   s fleeing marionette .   but gillbret was standing  staring at him .     i want you to take me with you .  i   m concerned about myself .  i cannot endure life under the tyranni any longer .  it is only that neither artemisia nor i can handle a ship or we would have left long ago .  it   s our lives too .      biron felt a certain weakening of his resolve .     the director   s daughter .  what has she to do with this .         i believe that she is the most desperate of us .  there is a special death for women .  what should be ahead of a director   s daughter who is young  personable  and unmarried  but to become young  personable  and married .  and who  in these days  should be the delightful groom .  why  an old  lecherous tyrannian court functionary who has buried three wives and wishes to revive the fires of his youth in the arms of a girl .         surely the director would never allow such a thing .         the director will allow anything .  nobody waits upon his permission .      biron thought of artemisia as he had last seen her .  her hair had been combed back from her forehead and allowed to fall in simple straightness  with a single inward wave at shoulder level .  clear  fair skin  black eyes  red lips .  tall  young  smiling .  probably the description of a hundred million girls throughout the galaxy .  it would be ridiculous to let that sway him .   yet he said     is there a ship ready .      gillbret   s face wrinkled under the impact of a sudden smile .  but  before he could say a word  there came a pounding at the door .  it was no gentle interruption of the photo .  .  beam  no tender of the weapon of authority .   it was repeated  and gillbret said     you   d better open the door .      biron did so  and two uniforms were in the room .  the foremost saluted gillbret with abrupt efficiency  then turned to biron .     biron farrill  in the name of the resident commissioner of tyrann and of the director of rhodia  i place you under arrest .         on what charge .     demanded biron .      on that of high treason .      a look of infinite loss twisted gillbret   s face momentarily .  he looked away .     hinrik was quick this once  quicker than i had ever expected .  an amusing thought .      he was the old gillbret  smiling and indifferent  eyebrows a little raised  as though inspecting a distasteful fact with a faint tinge of regret .      please follow me     said the guard  and biron was aware of the neuronic whip resting easily in the other   s hand .     eight     a lady   s skirts    biron   s throat was growing dry .  he could have beaten either of the guards in fair fight .  he knew that  and he itched for the chance .  he might even have made a satisfactory showing against both together .  but they had the whips  and he couldn   t have lifted an arm without having them demonstrate the fact .  inside his mind he surrendered .  there was no other way .   but gillbret said     let him take his cloak  men .      biron  startled  looked quickly toward the little man and retracted that same surrender .  he knew he had no cloak .   the guard whose weapon was out clicked his heels as a gesture of respect .  he motioned his whip at biron .     you heard milord .  get your cloak and snap it up .      biron stepped back as slowly as he dared .  he retreated to the bookcase and squatted  groping behind the chair for his nonexistent cloak .  and as his fingers clawed at the empty space behind the chair  he waited tensely for gillbret .   the visisonor was just a queer knobbed object to the guards .  it would mean nothing to them that gillbret fingered and stroked the knobs gently .  biron watched the muzzle of the whip intensely and allowed it to fill his mind .  certainly nothing else he saw or heard  thought he saw or heard  must enter .   but how much longer .   the armed guard said     is your cloak behind that chair .  stand up .     he took an impatient step forward  and then stopped .  his eyes narrowed in deep amazement and he looked sharply to his left .   that was it .  biron straightened and threw himself forward and down .  he clasped the guard   s knees and jerked .  the guard was down with a jarring thud  and biron   s large fist closed over the other   s hand  grasping for the neuronic whip it contained .   the other guard had his weapon out  but for the moment it was useless .  with his free hand  he was brushing wildly at the space before his eyes .   gillbret   s high pitched laugh sounded .     anything bothering you  farrill .         don   t see a thing     he grunted  and then     except this whip i   ve got now .         all right  then leave .  they can   t do anything to stop you .  their minds are full of sights and sounds that don   t exist .     gillbret skipped out of the way of the writhing tangle of bodies .   biron wrenched his arms free and heaved upward .  he brought his arm down solidly just below the other   s ribs .  the guard   s face twisted in agony and his body doubled convulsively .  biron rose  whip in hand .      careful     cried gillbret .   but biron did not turn quickly enough .  the second guard was upon him  bearing him down again .  it was a blind attack .  what it was that the guard thought he was grasping  it was impossible to tell .  that he knew nothing of biron at the moment was certain .  his breath rasped in biron   s ear and there was a continuous incoherent gurgle bubbling in his throat .   biron twisted in an attempt to bring his captured weapon into play and was frighteningly aware of the blank and empty eyes that must be aware of some horror invisible to anyone else .   biron braced his legs and shifted weight in an effort to break loose  quite uselessly .  three times he felt the guard   s whip flung hard against his hip  and flinched at the contact .   and then the guard   s gurgle dissolved into words .  he yelled     i   ll get you all .     and the very pale  almost invisible shimmer of the ionized air in the path of the whip   s energy beam made its appearance .  it swept wide through the air  and the path of the beam intersected biron   s foot .   it was as though he had stepped into a bath of boiling lead .  or as if a granite block had toppled upon it .  or as if it had been crunched off by a shark .  actually  nothing had happened to it physically .  it was only that the nerve endings that governed the sensation of pain had been universally and maximally stimulated  boiling lead could have done no more .   biron   s yell tore his throat raw  and he collapsed .  it did not even occur to him that the fight was over .  nothing mattered but the ballooning pain .   yet  though biron did not know it  the guard   s grip had relaxed  and minutes later  when the young man could force his eyes open and blink away the tears  he found the guard backed against the wall  pushing feebly at nothing with both hands and giggling to himself .  the first guard was still on his back  arms and legs spread eagled now .  he was conscious  but silent .  his eyes were following something in an erratic path  and his body quivered a little .  there was froth on his lips .   biron forced himself to his feet .  he limped badly as he made his way to the wall .  he used the butt of the whip and the guard slumped .  then back to the first  who made no defense either  his eyes moving silently to the very moment of unconsciousness .   biron sat down again  nursing his foot .  he stripped shoe and stocking from it  and stared in surprise at the unbroken skin .  he chafed it and grunted at the burning sensation .  he looked up at gillbret  who had put down his visisonor and was now rubbing one lean cheek with the back of his hand .      thank you     said biron     for the help of your instrument .      gillbret shrugged .  he said     there   ll be more here soon .  get to artemisia   s room .  please .  quickly .      biron realized the sense of that .  his foot had subsided to a quiet quiver of pain  but it felt swollen and puffy .  he put on a stocking and tucked the shoe under his elbow .  he already had one whip  and he relieved the second guard of the other .  he stuffed it precariously within his belt .   he turned at the door and asked  with a sense of crawling revulsion     what did you make them see  sir .         i don   t know .  i can   t control it .  i just gave them all the power i could and the rest depended on their own complexes .  please don   t stand there talking .  do you have the map to artemisia   s room .      biron nodded and set off down the corridor .  it was quite empty .  he could not walk quickly  since trying to do so made his walk a hobble .   he looked at his watch  then remembered that he had somehow never had the time to adjust it to rhodian local chronometry .  it still ran on standard interstellar time as used aboard ship  where one hundred minutes made an hour and a thousand a day .  so the figure     which gleamed pinkly on the cool metal face of the watch meant nothing now .   still  it had to be well into the night  or into the planetary sleeping period  at any rate  supposing that the two did not coincide   as otherwise the halls would not be so empty and the bas reliefs on the wall would not phosphoresce unwatched .  he touched one idly as he passed  a coronation scene  and found it to be two dimensional .  yet it gave the perfect illusion of standing out from the wall .   it was sufficiently unusual for him to stop momentarily in order to examine the effect .  then he remembered and hurried on .   the emptiness of the corridor struck him as another sign of the decadence of rhodia .  he had grown very conscious of all these symbols of decline now that he had become a rebel .  as the center of an independent power  the palace would always have had its sentries and its quiet wardens of the night .   he consulted gillbret   s crude map and turned to the right  moving up a wide  curving ramp .  there might have been processions here once  but nothing of that would be left now .   he leaned against the proper door and touched the photo signal .  the door moved ajar a bit  then opened wide .      come in  young man .      it was artemisia .  biron slipped inside  and the door closed swiftly and silently .  he looked at the girl and said nothing .  he was gloomily conscious of the fact that his shirt was torn at the shoulder so that one sleeve flapped loosely  that his clothes were grimy and his face welted .  he remembered the shoe he was still carrying  dropped it and wriggled his foot into it .   then he said     mind if .  i sit down .      she followed him to the chair  and stood before him  a little annoyed .     what happened .  what   s wrong with your foot .         i hurt it     he said shortly .     are you ready to leave .      she brightened .     you   ll take us  then .      but biron was in no mood to be sweet about it .  his foot still twinged and he cradled it .  he said     look  get me out to a ship .  i   m leaving this damn planet .  if you want to come along  i   ll take you .      she frowned .     you might be more pleasant about it .  were you in a fight .         yes  i was .  with your father   s guards  who wanted to arrest me for treason .  so much for my sanctuary right .         oh .  i   m sorry .         i   m sorry too .  it   s no wonder the tyranni can lord it over fifty worlds with a handful of men .  we help them .  men like your father would do anything to keep in power  they would forget the basic duties of a simple gentleman  oh  never mind .         i said i was sorry  lord rancher .     she used the title with a cold pride .     please don   t set yourself up as judge of my father .  you don   t know all the facts .         i   m not interested in discussing it .  we   ll have to leave in a hurry  before more of your father   s precious guards come .  well  i don   t mean to hurt your feelings .  it   s all right .     biron   s surliness canceled out any meaning to his apology  but  damn it  he had never been hit by a neuronic whip before and it wasn   t fun .  and  by space  they had owed him sanctuary .  at least that much .   artemisia felt angry .  not at her father  of course  but at the stupid young man .  he was so young .  practically a child  she decided  scarcely older than herself  if that .   the communicator sounded and she said sharply     please wait a minute and we   ll go .      it was gillbret   s voice  sounding faintly .     arta .  all right at your end .         he   s here     she whispered back .      all right .  don   t say anything .  just listen .  don   t leave your room .  keep him there .  there   s going to be a search of the palace  which there   s no way of stopping .  i   ll try to think of something  but  meanwhile  don   t move .     he waited for no reply .  contact was broken .      so that   s that     said biron .  he had heard also .     shall i stay and get you into trouble  or shall i go out and give myself up .  there   s no reason to expect sanctuary anywhere on rhodia  i suppose .      she faced him in a rage  crying in a choked whisper     oh  shut up  you big  ugly fool .      they glared at each other .  biron   s feelings were hurt .  in a way  he was trying to help her too .  there was no reason for her to be insulting .   she said     i   m sorry     and looked away .      that   s all right     he said coldly  without meaning it .     you   re entitled to your opinion .         you don   t have to say the things you do about my father .  you don   t know what being director is like .  he   s working for his people  whatever you may think .         oh  sure .  he has to sell me to the tyranni for the sake of the people .  that makes sense .         in a way  it does .  he has to show them he   s loyal .  otherwise  they might depose him and take over the direct rule of rhodia .  would that be better .         if a nobleman can   t find sanctuary          oh  you think only of yourself .  that   s what   s wrong with you .         i don   t think it   s particularly selfish not to want to die .  at least for nothing .  i   ve got some fighting to do before i go .  my father fought them .     he knew he was beginning to sound melodramatic  but she affected him that way .   she said     and what good did it do your father .         none  i suppose .  he was killed .      artemisia felt unhappy .     i keep saying i   m sorry  and this time i really mean it .  i   m all upset .     then  in defense     i   m in trouble  too  you know .      biron remembered .     i know .  all right  let   s start all over .     he tried to smile .  his foot was feeling better anyway .   she said  in an attempt at lightness     you   re not really ugly .      biron felt foolish .     oh well       then he stopped  and artemisia   s hand flew to her mouth .  abruptly  their heads turned to the door .   there was the sudden  soft sound of many ordered feet on the semi elastic plastic mosaic that floored the corridor outside .  most passed by  but there was a faint  disciplined heel clicking just outside the door  and the night signal purred .     gillbret had to work quickly .  first  he had to hide his visisonor .  for the first time he wished he had a better hiding place .  damn hinrik for making up his mind so quickly this once  for not waiting till morning .  he had to get away  he might never have another chance .   then he called the captain of the guard .  he couldn   t very well neglect a little matter of two unconscious guards and an escaped prisoner .   the captain of the guard was grim about it .  he had the two unconscious men cleared out  and then faced gillbret .      my lord  i am not quite clear from your message exactly what happened     he said .      just what you see     said gillbret .     they came to make their arrest  and the young man did not submit .  he is gone  space knows where .         that is of little moment  my lord     said the captain .     the palace is honored tonight with the presence of a personage  so it is well guarded despite the hour .  he cannot get out and we will draw the net through the interior .  but how did he escape .  my men were armed .  he was not .         he fought like a tiger .  from that chair  behind which i hid          i am sorry  my lord  that you did not think to aid my men against an accused traitor .      gillbret looked scornful .     what an amusing thought  captain .  when your men  wit l doubled advantage in numbers and weapons  need help from myself  it is time you recruited yourself other men .         very well .  we will search the palace  find him  and see if he can repeat the performance .         i shall accompany you  captain .      it was the captain    s turn to raise his eyebrows .  he said     i would not advise it  my lord .  there would be some danger .      it was the kind of remark that one did not make to a hinriad .  gillbret knew that  but he only smiled and let the wrinkles fill his lean face .     i know that     he said     but occasionally i find even danger amusing .      it took five minutes for the company of guards to assemble .  gillbret  alone in his room during that time  called artemisia .     biron and artemisia had frozen at the purring of the little signal .  it sounded a second time and then there was the cautious rap upon the door  and gillbret   s voice was heard .      do let me try  captain     it said .  then  more loudly     artemisia .      biron grinned his relief and took a step forward  but the girl put a sudden hand upon his mouth .  she called out     one moment  uncle oil     and pointed desperately toward the wall .   biron could only stare stupidly .  the wall was quite blank .  artemisia made a face and stepped quickly past him .  her hand on the wall caused a portion of it to slide noiselessly aside  revealing a dressing room .  her lips motioned a    get inside .     and her hands were fumbling at the ornamental pin at her right shoulder .  the unclasping of that pin broke the tiny force field that held an invisible seam tightly closed down the length of the dress .  she stepped out of it .   biron turned around after stepping across what had been the wall  and its closing endured just long enough for him to see her throwing a white furred dressing gown across her shoulders .  the scarlet dress lay crumpled upon the chair .   he looked about him and wondered if they would search artemisia   s room .  he would be quite helpless if a search took place .  there was no way out of the dressing room but the way he had entered  and there was nothing in it that could serve as a still more confined hiding place .   along one wall there hung a row of gowns  and the air shimmered very faintly before it .  his hand passed easily through the shimmer  with only a faint tingling where it crossed his wrist  but then it was meant to repel only dust so that the space behind it could be kept aseptically clean .   he might hide behind the skirts .  it was what he was doing  really .  he had manhandled two guards  with gillbret   s help  to get here  but  now that he was here  he was hiding behind a lady   s skirts .  a lady   s skirts  in fact .   incongruously  he found himself wishing he had turned a bit sooner before the wall had closed behind him .  she had quite a remarkable figure .  it was ridiculous of him to have been so childishly nasty awhile back .  of course she was not to blame for the faults of her father .   and now he could only wait  staring at the blank wall  waiting for the sound of feet within the room  for the wall to pull back once more  for the muzzles facing him again  this time without a visisonor to help him .   he waited  holding a neuronic whip in each hand .     nine     and an overlord   s trousers       what   s the matter .     artemisia did not have to feign uneasiness .  she spoke to gillbret  who  with the captain of the guard  was at the door .  half a dozen uniformed men hovered discreetly in the background .  then  quickly     has anything happened to father .         no  no     gillbret reassured her     nothing has happened that need concern you at all .  were you asleep .         just about     she replied     and my girls have been about their own affairs for hours .  there was no one to answer but myself and you nearly frightened me to death .      she turned to the captain suddenly  with a stiffening attitude .     what is wanted of me  captain .  quickly  please .  this is not the time of day for a proper audience .      gillbret broke in before the other could more than open his mouth .     a most amusing thing  arta .  the young man  whatsisname  you know  has dashed off  breaking two heads on his way .  we   re hunting him on even terms now .  one platoon of soldiers to one fugitive .  and here i am myself  hot on the trail  delighting our good captain with my zeal and courage .      artemisia managed to look completely bewildered .   under his breath the captain muttered a monosyllabic imprecation .  his lips scarcely moved .  he said then     if you please  my lord  you are not quite plain  and we are delaying matters insufferably .  my lady  the man who calls himself the son of the ex rancher of widemos has been arrested for treason .  he has managed to escape and is now at large .  we must search the palace for him  room by room .      artemisia stepped back  frowning .     including my room .         if your ladyship permits .         ah  but i do not .  i would certainly know if there was a strange man in my room .  and the suggestion that i might be having dealings with such a man  or any strange man  at this time of night is highly improper .  please observe due respect for my position  captain .      it worked quite well .  the captain could only bow and say     no such implication was intended  my lady .  your pardon for annoying you at this time of night .  your statement that you have not seen the fugitive is  of course  sufficient .  under the circumstances  it was necessary to assure ourselves of your safety .  he is a dangerous man .         surely not so .  dangerous that he cannot be handled by you and your company .      gillbret   s high pitched voice interposed again .     captain  come  come .  while you exchange courtly sentiments with my niece  our man has had time to rifle the armory .  i would suggest that you leave a guard at the lady artemisia   s door  so that what remains of her sleep will not be further disturbed .  unless  my dear     and he twinkled his fingers at artemisia     you would care to join us .         i shall satisfy myself     said artemisia coldly     in locking my door and retiring  thank you .         pick a large one     cried gillbret .     take that one .  a fine uniform our guards have  artemisia .  you can recognize a guard as far as you can see him by his uniform alone .         my lord     said the captain impatiently     there is no time .  you delay matters .      at a gesture from him  a guard fell out of the platoon  saluted artemisia through the closing door  then the captain .  the sound of ordered footsteps fell away in both directions .   artemisia waited  then slid the door quietly open an inch or two .  the guard was there  legs apart  back rigid  right hand armed  left hand at his alarm button .  he was the guard suggested by gillbret  a tall one .  as tall as biron of widemos  though without his breadth of shoulders .   it occurred to her  at that moment  that biron  though young and  therefore  rather unreasonable in some of his viewpoints  was at least large and well muscled  which was convenient .  it had been foolish of her to snap at him .  quite pleasant looking too .   she closed the door  and stepped toward the dressing room .     biron tensed as the door slid away again .  he held his breath and his fingers stiffened .   artemisia stared at his whips .     be careful .      he puffed out his breath in relief and stuffed each into a pocket .  they were very uncomfortable there  but he had no proper holsters .  he said     that was just in    case it was somebody looking for me .         come out .  and speak in a whisper .      she was still in her night robe  woven out of a smooth fabric with which biron was unfamiliar  adorned with little tufts of silvery fur  and clinging to the body through some faint static attraction inherent in the material  so that neither buttons  clasps  loops  or seam fields were necessary .  nor  as a consequence  did it do more than merely faintly dim the outlines of artemisia   s figure .   biron felt his ears reddening  and liked the sensation very much .   artemisia waited  then made a little whirling gesture with her forefinger and said     do you mind .      biron looked up at her face .     what .  oh  i   m sorry .      he turned his back to her and remained stiffly attentive to the faint rustling of the change of outer garments .  it did not occur to him to wonder why she did not use the dressing room  or why  better still  she had not changed before opening the door .  there are depths in feminine psychology  which  without experience  defy analysis .   she was in black when he turned  a two piece suit which did not reach below the knee .  it had that more substantial appearance that went with clothing meant for the outdoors rather than for the ballroom .   biron said  automatically     are we leaving  then .      she shook her head .     you   ll have to do your part first .  you   ll need other clothes yourself .  get to one side of the door  and i   ll have the guard in .         what guard .      she smiled briefly .     they left a guard at the door  at uncle oil   s suggestion .      the door to the corridor ran smoothly along its runners an inch or two .  the guard was still there  stiffly immobile .      guard     she whispered .     in here  quickly .      there was no reason for a common soldier to hesitate in his obedience to the director   s daughter .  he entered the widening door  with a respectful     at your service  my        and then his knees buckled under the weight which came down upon his shoulders  while his words were cut off  without even an interrupting squawk  by the forearm which slammed against his larynx .   artemisia closed the door hurriedly and watched with sensations that amounted almost to nausea .  the life in the palace of the hinriads was mild almost to decadence  and she had never before seen a man   s face congest with blood and his mouth yawn and puff futilely under the influence of asphyxia .  she looked away .   biron bared his teeth with effort as he tightened the circle of bone and muscle about the other   s throat .  for a minute the guard   s weakening hands ripped futilely at biron   s arm  while his feet groped in aimless kicks .  biron heaved him clear of the floor without relaxing his grip .   and then the guard   s hands fell to his sides  his legs hung loosely  and the convulsive and useless heavings of the chest began to subside .  biron lowered him gently to the floor .  the guard sprawled out limply  as though he were a sack which had been emptied .      is he dead .     asked artemisia  in a horrified whisper .      i doubt it     said biron .     it takes four or five minutes of it to kill a man .  but he   ll be out of things for a while .  do you have anything to tie him up with .      she shook her head .  for the moment  she felt quite helpless .   biron said     you must have some cellite stockings .  they would do fine .     he had already stripped the guard of weapons and outer clothing .     and i   d like to wash up too .  in fact  i have to .      it was pleasant to step through the detergent mist in artemisia   s bathroom .  it left him perhaps a trifle over scented  but the open air would take care of the fragrance  he hoped .  at least he was clean  and it had required merely the momentary passage through the fine  suspended droplets that shot past him forcefully in a warm air stream .  no special drying chamber was required  since he stepped out dry as well as clean .  they didn   t have this on widemos  or on earth .   the guard   s uniform was a bit tight  and biron did not like the way the somewhat ugly  conical military cap fit over his brachycephalic head .  he stared at his reflection with some dissatisfaction .     how do i look .         quite like a soldier     she said .   he said     you   ll have to carry one of these whips .  i can   t handle three .      she took it between two fingers and dropped it into her bag  which was then suspended from her wide belt by another microforce  so that her hands remained free .      we had better go now .  don   t say a word if we meet anyone  but let me do the talking .  your accent isn   t right  and it would be impolite to talk in my presence unless you wore directly addressed  anyway .  remember .  you   re a common soldier .      the guard on the floor was beginning to wriggle a bit and roll his eyes .  his wrists and ankles were securely tied in a clump at the small of his back with stockings that had the tensile strength of more than an equal amount of steel .  his tongue worked futilely at his gag .   he had been shoved out of the way  so that it was not necessary to step over him to get to the door .      this way     breathed artemisia .   at the first turning there was a footstep behind them  and a light hand came down on biron   s shoulder .   biron stepped to one side quickly and turned  one hand catching the other   s arm  while his other snatched at his whip .   but it was gillbret who said     easy  man .      biron loosened his grip .   gillbret rubbed his arm .     i   ve been waiting for you  but that   s no reason to break my bones .  let me stare admiringly at you  farrill .  your clothes seem to have shrunk on you  but not bad  not bad at all .  nobody would look twice at you in that getup .  it   s the advantage of a uniform .  it   s taken for granted that a soldier   s uniform holds a soldier and nothing else .         uncle gil     whispered artemisia urgently     don   t talk so much .  where are the other guards .         everyone objects to a few words     he said pettishly .     the other guards are working their way up the tower .  they   ve decided that our friend is on none of the lower levels  so they   ve just left some men at the main exits and at the ramps  with the general alarm system in operation as well .  we can get past it .         won   t they miss you  sir .     asked biron .      me .  hah .  the captain was glad to see me go  for all his toe scraping .  they won   t look for me  i assure you .      they were speaking in whispers  but now even those died away .  a guard stood at the bottom of the ramp  while two others flanked the large  carved double door that led to the open air .   gillbret called out     any word of the escaped prisoner  men .         no  my lord     said the nearest .  he clicked his heels together and saluted .      well  keep your eyes open     and they walked past them and out  one of the guards at the door carefully neutralizing that section of the alarm as they left .   it was nighttime outside .  the sky was clear and starry  the ragged mass of the dark nebula blotting out the specks of light near the horizon .  palace central was a dark mass behind them  and the palace field was less than half a mile away .   but after five minutes of walking along the quiet path  gillbret grew restless .      there   s something wrong     he said .   artemisia said     uncle oil  you haven   t forgotten to arrange to have the ship ready .         of course not     he snapped at her  as nearly as one could snap in a whisper     but why is the field tower lit up .  it should be dark .      he pointed up through the trees  to where the tower was a honeycomb of white light .  ordinarily  that would indicate business at the field  ships leaving for space or arriving from it .   gillbret muttered     nothing was scheduled for tonight .  that was definite .      they saw the answer at a distance  or gillbret did .  he stopped suddenly and spread his arms wide to hold back the others .      that   s all     he said  and giggled almost hysterically .     this time hinrik has really messed things properly  the idiot .  they   re here .  the tyranni .  don   t you understand .  that   s aratap   s private armored cruiser .      biron saw it  gleaming faintly under the lights  standing out among the other undistinguished ships .  it was smoother  thinner  more feline than the rhodian vessels .   gillbret said     the captain said a    personage    was being entertained today  and i paid no attention .  there   s nothing to do now .  we can   t fight tyranni .      biron felt something suddenly snap .     why not .     he said savagely .     why can   t we fight them .  they have no reason to suspect trouble  and we   re armed .  let   s take the commissioner   s own ship .  let   s leave him with his trousers down .      he stepped forward  out of the relative obscurity of the trees and onto the bare field .  the others followed .  there was no reason to hide .  they were two members of the royal family and an escorting soldier .   but it was the tyranni they were fighting now .     simok aratap of tyrann had been impressed the first time he had ever seen the palace grounds at rhodia years earlier  but it had turned out to be only a shell that had impressed him .  the interior was nothing but a musty relic .  two generations earlier rhodia   s legislative chambers had met on these grounds and most of the administrative offices had been quartered there .  palace central had been the heartbeat of a dozen worlds .   but now the legislative chambers  still existing  for the khan never interfered with local legalisms  met once a year to ratify the executive orders of the past twelve months .  it was quite a formality .  the executive council was still  nominally  in continuous session  but it consisted of a dozen men who remained on their estates nine weeks in ten .  the various executive bureaus were still active  since one could not govern without them  whether the director or the khan ruled  but they were now scattered over the planet  made less dependent upon the director  more conscious of their new masters  the tyranni .   which left the palace as majestic as it had always been in stone and metal  and that only .  it housed the directorial family  a scarcely adequate corps of servants  and an entirely inadequate corps of native guards .   aratap felt uncomfortable in the shell and was unhappy .  it was late  he was tired  his eyes burned so that he longed to remove his contact lenses  and  most of all  he was disappointed .   there was no pattern .  he glanced occasionally at his military aide  but the major was listening to the director with expressionless stolidity .  as for aratap himself  he paid little attention .      widemos   s son .  indeed .     he would say  in abstraction .  then  later     and so you arrested him .  quite right .      but it meant little to him  since events lacked a design .  aratap had a neat and tidy mind which could not bear the thought of individual facts loosely clumped together with no decent arrangement .   widemos had been a traitor  and widemos   s son had attempted a meeting with the director of rhodia .  he had attempted it first in secret  and when that had failed  such was the urgency  he had attempted it openly with his ridiculous story of an assassination plot .  surely that must have been the beginning of a pattern .   and now it fell apart .  hinrik was giving up the boy with indecent haste .  he could not even wait the night  it seemed .  and that did not fit at all .  or else aratap had not yet learned all the facts .   he focused his attention on the director again .  hinrik was beginning to repeat himself .  aratap felt a twinge of compassion .  the man had been made into such a coward that even the tyranni themselves grew impatient with him .  and yet it was the only way .  only fear could insure absolute loyalty .  that and nothing else .   widemos had not been afraid  and despite the fact that his self interest had been bound at every point with the maintenance of tyrannian rule  he had rebelled .  hinrik was afraid and that made the difference   and because hinrik was afraid  he sat there  lapsing into incoherence as he struggled to obtain some gesture of approval .  the major would give none  of course  aratap knew .  the man had no imagination .  he sighed and wished he had none either .  politics was a filthy business .   so he said  with some air of animation     quite so .  i commend your  quick decision and your zeal in the service of the khan .  you may be sure he will hear of it .      hinrik brightened visibly  his relief obvious .   aratap said     have him brought in  then  and let us hear what our cockerel has to say .     he suppressed a desire to yawn .  he had absolutely no interest in what the    cockerel    had to say .   it was hinrik   s intention at this point to signal for the captain of the guard  but there was no necessity for that  as the captain stood in the doorway  unannounced .      excellency     he cried and strode in without waiting for permission .   hinrik stared hard at his hand  still inches from the signal  as though wondering whether his intention had somehow developed sufficient force to substitute for the act .   he said uncertainly     what is it  captain .      the captain said     excellency  the prisoner has escaped .      aratap felt some of the weariness disappear .  what was this .     the details  captain .     he ordered  and straightened in his chair .   the captain gave them with a blunt economy of words .   he concluded     i ask your permission  excellency  to proclaim a general alarm .  they are yet but minutes away .         yes  by all means     stuttered hinrik     by all means .  a general alarm  indeed .  just the thing .  quickly .  quickly .  commissioner  i cannot understand how it could have happened .  captain  put every man to work .  there will be an investigation  commissioner .  if necessary  every man on the guards will be broken .  broken .  broken .      he repeated the word in near hysteria but the captain remained standing .  it was obvious that he had more to say .   aratap said     why do you wait .         may i speak to your excellency in private .     said the captain abruptly .   hinrik cast a quick  frightened look at the bland  unperturbed commissioner .  he mustered a feeble indignation .     there are no secrets from the soldiers of the khan  our friends  our          say your say  captain     interposed aratap gently .   the captain brought his heels together sharply and said     since i am ordered to speak  your excellency  i regret to inform you that my lady artemisia and my lord gillbret accompanied the prisoner in his escape .         he dared to kidnap them .     hinrik was on his feet .     and my guards allowed it .         they were not kidnapped  excellency .  they accompanied him voluntarily .         how do you know .     aratap was delighted  and thoroughly awake .  it formed a pattern now  after all .  a better pattern than he could have anticipated .   the captain said     we have the testimony of the guard they overpowered  and the guards who  unwittingly  allowed them to leave the building .     he hesitated  then added grimly     when i interviewed my lady artemisia at the door of her private chambers  she told me she had been on the point of sleep .  it was only later that i realized that when she told me that  her face was elaborately made up .  when i returned  it was too late .  i accept the blame for the mismanagement of this affair .  after tonight i will request your excellency to accept my resignation  but first have i still your permission to sound the general alarm .  without your authority i could not interfere with members of the royal family .      but hinrik was swaying on his feet and could only stare at him vacantly .   aratap said     captain  you would do better to look to the health of your director .  i would suggest you call his physician .         the general alarm .     repeated the captain .      there will be no general alarm     said aratap .     do you understand me .  no general alarm .  no recapture of the prisoner .  the incident is closed .  return your men to their quarters and ordinary duties and look to your director .  come  major .        the tyrannian major spoke tensely once they had left the mass of palace central behind them .      aratap     he said     i presume you know what you   re doing .  i kept my mouth shut in there on the basis of that presumption .         thank you  major .     aratap liked the night air of a planet full of green and growing things .  tyrann was more beautiful in its way  but it was a terrible beauty of rocks and mountains .  it was dry  dry .   he went on     you cannot handle hinrik  major andros .  in your hands he would wilt and break .  he is useful  but requires gentle treatment if he is to remain so .      the major brushed that aside .     i   m not referring to that .  why not the general alarm .  don   t you want them .         do you .     aratap stopped .     let us sit here for a moment  andros .  a bench on a pathway along a lawn .  what more beautiful  and what place is safer from spy beams .  why do you want the young man  major .         why do i want any traitor and conspirator .         why do you  indeed  if you only catch a few tools while leaving the source of the poison untouched .  whom would you have .  a cub  a silly girl  a senile idiot .      there was a faint splashing of an artificial waterfall nearby .  a small one  but decorative .  now that was a real wonder to aratap .  imagine water  spilling out  running to waste  pouring  ndefinitely down the rocks and along the ground .  he had never educated himself out of a certain indignation over it .      as it is     said the major     we have nothing .         we have a pattern .  when the young man first arrived  we connected him with hinrik  and that bothered us  because hinrik is  what he is .  but it was the best we could do .  now we see it was not hinrik at all  that hinrik was a misdirection .  it was hinrik   s daughter and cousin he was after  and that makes more sense .         why didn   t he call us sooner .  he waited for the middle of the night .         because he is the tool of whoever is the first to reach him  and gillbret  i am sure  suggested this night meeting as a sign of great zeal on his part .         you mean we were called here on purpose .  to witness their escape .     .      no  not for that reason .  ask yourself .  where do these people intend on going .      the major shrugged .      rhodia is big .         yes  if it were the young farrill alone who was concerned .  but where on rhodia would two members of the royal family go unrecognized .  particularly the girl .         they would have to leave the planet  then .  yes  i agree .         and from where .  they can reach the palace field in a fifteen minute walk .  now do you see the purpose of our being here .      the major said     our ship .         of course .  a tyrannian ship would seem ideal to them .  otherwise  they would have to choose among freighters .  farrill has been educated on earth  and  i   m sure  can fly a cruiser .         now there   s a point .  why do we allow the nobility to send out their sons in all directions .  what business has a subject to know more about travel than will suffice him for local trade .  we bring up soldiers against us .         nevertheless     said aratap  with polite indifference     at the moment farrill has a foreign education  and let us take that into account objectively  without growing angry about it .  the fact remains that i am certain they have taken our cruiser .         i can   t believe it .         you have your wrist caller .  make contact with the ship  if you can .      the major tried  futilely .   aratap said     try the field tower .      the major did so  and the small voice came out of the tiny receiver  in minute agitation     but  excellency  i don   t understand  there is some mistake .  your pilot took off ten minutes ago .      aratap was smiling .     you see .  work out the pattern and each little event becomes inevitable .  and now do you see the consequences .      the major did .  he slapped his thigh  and laughed briefly .     of course .     he said .      well     said aratap     they couldn   t know  of course  but they have ruined themselves .  had they been satisfied with the clumsiest rhodian freighter on the field  they would surely have escaped and  what   s the expression .   i would have been caught with my trousers down this night .  as it is  my trousers are firmly belted  and nothing can save them .  and when i pluck them back  in my own good time     he emphasized the words with satisfaction     i will have the rest of the conspiracy in my hands as well .      he sighed and found himself beginning to feel sleepy once more .     well  we have been lucky  and now there is no hurry .  call central base  and have them send another ship after us .        ten     maybe .     biron farrill   s training in spationautics back on earth had been largely academic .  there had been the university courses in the various phases of spatial engineering  which  though half a semester was spent on the theory of the hyperatornic motor  offered little when it came to the actual manipulation of ships in space .  the best and most skilled pilots learned their art in space and not in schoolrooms .   he had managed to take off without actual accident  though that was more luck than design .  the remorseless answered the controls far more quickly than biron had anticipated .  he had manipulated several ships on earth out into space and back to the planet  but those had been aged and sedate models  maintained for the use of students .  they had been gentle  and very  very tired  and had lifted with an effort and spiraled slowly upward through the atmosphere and into space .   the remorseless  on the other hand  had lifted effortlessly  springing upward and whistling through the air  so that biron had fallen backward out of his chair and all but dislocated his shoulder .  artemisia and gillbret  who  with the greater caution of the inexperienced  had strapped themselves in  wefe bruised against the padded webbing .  the tyrannian prisoner had lain pressed against the wall  tearing heavily at his bonds and cursing in a monotone .   biron had risen shakily to his feet  kicked the tyrannian into a brooding silence  and made his way along the wall rail  hand over hand against the acceleration  back to his seat .  forward blasts of power quivered the ship and reduced the rate of increasing velocity to a bearable quantity .   they were in the upper reaches of the rhodian atmosphere by then .  the sky was a deep violet and the hull of the ship was hot with air friction  so that warmth could be felt within .   it took hours thereafter to set the ship into an orbit about rhodia .  biron could find no way of readily calculating the velocity necessary to overcome rhodia   s gravity .  he had to work it by hit and miss  varying the velocity with puffs of power forward and backward  watching the massometer  which indicated their distance from the planet   s surface by measuring the intensity of the gravitational field .  fortunately  the massometer was already calibrated for rhodia   s mass and radius .  without considerable experimentation  biron could not have adjusted the calibration himself .   eventually  the massometer held steady and over a period of two hours showed no appreciable drift .  biron allowed himself to relax  and the others climbed out of their belts .   artemisia said     you don   t have a very light touch  my lord rancher .         i   m flying  my lady     biron replied curtly .     if you can do better  you   re welcome to try  but only after i myself disembark .         quiet  quiet  quiet     said gillbret .     the ship is too cramped for pettishness  and  in addition  since we are to be crushed into an inconvenient familiarity in this leaping prison pen  i suggest we discard the many    lords    and    ladies    which will otherwise encrust our conversation to an unbearable degree .  i am gillbret  you are biron  she is artemisia .  i suggest we memorize those terms of address  or any variation we care to use .  and as for piloting the ship  why not use the help of our tyrannian friend here .      the tyrannian glared  and biron said     no .  there is no way we could trust him .  and my own piloting will improve as i get the hang of this ship .  i haven   t cracked you up yet  have i .      his shoulder still hurt as a result of the first lurch and  as usual  pain made him peevish .      well     said gillbret     what do we do with him .         i don   t like to kill him in cold blood     said biron     and that won   t help us .  it would just make the tyranni doubly excited .  killing one of the master race is really the unforgivable sin .         but what is the alternative .         we   ll land him .         all right .  but where .         on rhodia .         what .         it   s the one place they won   t be looking for us .  besides which  we   ve got to go down pretty soon  anyway .         why .         look  this is the commissioner   s ship  and he   s been using it for hopping about the surface of the planet .  it isn   t provisioned for space voyages .  before we go anywhere  we   ll have to take complete inventory aboard ship  and at least make sure that we have enough food and water .      artemisia was nodding vigorously .     that   s right .  good .  i wouldn   t have thought of that myself .  that   s very clever  biron .      biron made a deprecating gesture  but warmed with pleasure  nevertheless .  it was the first time she had used his first name .  she could be quite pleasant  when she tried .   gillbret said     but he   ll radio our whereabouts instantly .         i don   t think so     said biron .     in the first place  rhodia has its desolate areas  i imagine .  we don   t have to drop him into the business section of a city  or into the middle of one of the tyrannian garrisons .  besides  he may not be so anxious to contact his superiors as you might think .  .  .  .  say  private  what would happen to a soldier who allowed the commissioner of the khan to have his private cruiser stolen from him .      the prisoner did not answer  but his lip line became  pale and thin .   biron would not have wanted to be in the soldier   s place .  to be sure  he could scarcely be blamed .  there was no reason why he should have suspected trouble resulting from mere politeness to members of the rhodian royal family .  sticking to the letter of the tyrannian military code  he had refused to allow them aboard ship without the permission of his commanding officer .  if the director himself had demanded permission to enter  he insisted  he would have to deny it .  but  in the meantime  they had closed in upon him  and by the time he realized he should have followed the military code still more closely and had his weapon ready  it was too late .  a neuronic whip was practically touching his chest .   nor had he given in tamely  even then .  it had taken a whip blast at his chest to stop him .  and  even so  he could face only court martial and conviction .  no one doubted that  least of all the soldier .     they had landed two days later at the outskirts of the city of southwark .  it had been chosen deliberately because it lay far from the main centers of rhodian population .  the tyrannian soldier had been strapped into a repulsion unit and allowed to flutter downward some fifty miles from the nearest sizable town .   the landing  on an empty beach  was only mildly jerky  and biron  as the one least likely to be recognized  made the necessary purchases .  such rhodian currency as gillbret had had the presence of mind to bring with him had scarcely sufficed for elementary needs  since much of it went for a little biwheel and tow cart  on which he could carry the supplies away piecemeal .      you might have stretched the money farther     said artemisia     if you hadn   t wasted so much of it on the tyrannian mush you bought .         i think there was nothing else to do     said biron hotly .     it may be tyrannian mush to you  but it   s a well balanced food  and will see us through better than anything else i could have gotten .      he was annoyed .  it had been stevedore   s work  getting all that out of the city and then aboard ship .  and it had meant a considerable risk  buying it at one of the tyrannian run commissaries in the city .  he had expected appreciation .   and there was no alternative anyway .  the tyrannian forces had evolved an entire technique of supply adapted strictly to the fact that they used tiny ships .  they couldn   t afford the huge storage spaces of other fleets which were stacked with the carcasses of whole animals  neatly hung in rows .  they had had to develop a standard food concentrate containing what was necessary in the way of calories and food factors and let it go at that .  it took up only one twentieth of the space that an equivalent supply of natural animal food would take  and it could be piled up in the low temperature storeroom like packaged bricks .      well  it tastes awful     said artemisia .      well  you   ll get used to it     retorted biron  mimicking her petulance  so that she flushed and turned away angrily .   what was bothering her  biron knew  was simply the lack of space and all that accompanied the lack .  it wasn   t just a question of using a monotonous food stock because in that way more calories could be packed to the cubic inch .  it was that there were no separate sleeping rooms  for instance .  there were the engine rooms and the control room  which took up most of the ship   s space .   after all  biron thought  this is a warship  not a pleasure yacht .   then there was the storeroom  and .  one small cabin  with two tiers of three bunks on either side .  the plumbing was located in a little niche just outside the cabin .   it meant crowding  it meant a complete absence of privacy  and it meant that artemisia would have to adjust herself to the fact that there were no women   s clothes aboard  no mirrors  no washing facilities .   well  she would have to get used to it .  biron felt that he had done enough for her  gone sufficiently out of his way .  why couldn   t she be pleasant about it and smile once in a while .  she had a nice smile  and he had to admit that she wasn   t bad  except for her temper .  but oh  that temper .   well  why waste his time thinking about her .   the water situation was the worst .  tyrann was a desert planet  in the first place  where water was at a premium and men knew its value  so none was included on board ship for washing purposes .  soldiers could wash themselves and their personal effects once they had landed on a planet .  during trips a little grime and sweat would not hurt them .  even for drinking purposes  water was barely sufficient for the longer trips .  after all  water could be neither concentrated nor dehydrated  but had to be carried in bulk  and the problem was aggravated by the fact that the water content of the food concentrates was quite low .   there were distilling devices to re use water lost by the body  but biron  when he realized their function  felt sick and arranged for the disposal of waste products without attempt at water recovery .  chemically  it was a sensible procedure  but one has to be educated into that sort of thing .   the second take off was  comparatively  a  model of smoothness  and biron spent time playing with the controls afterward .  the control board resembled only in the dimmest fashion those of the ships he had handled on earth .  it had been compressed and compacted frightfully .  as biron puzzled out the action of a contact or the purpose of a dial  he wrote out minute directions on paper and pasted them appropriately on the board .   gillbret entered the pilot room .   biron looked over his shoulder .     artemisia   s in the cabin  i suppose .         there isn   t anyplace else she could be and stay inside the ship .      biron said     when you see her  tell her i   ll make up a bunk here in the pilot room .  i   d advise you to do the same  and let her have the cabin to herself .     he muttered the addition     now there   s one childish girl .         you have your moments  too  biron     said gillbret .     you   ll have to remember the sort of life she   s used to .         all right .  i do remember it  and so what .  what sort of life do you think i   m used to .  i wasn   t born in the mine fields of some asteroidal belt  you know .  i was born on the biggest ranch of nephelos .  but if you   re caught in a situation  you   ve got to make the best of it .  damn it  i can   t stretch the hull of the ship .  it will hold just so much food and water  and i can   t do anything about the fact that there isn   t any shower bath .  she picks on me as if i personally manufactured this ship .     it was a relief to shout at gillbret .  it was a relief to shout at anybody .   but the door opened again  and artemisia stood there .  she said  freezingly     i would refrain  mr .  farrill  from shouting  if i were you .  you can be distinctly heard all over the ship .         that     said biron     does not bother me .  and if the ship bothers you  just remember that if your father hadn   t tried to kill me off and marry you off  neither one of us would be here .     c     don   t talk about my father .         i   ll talk about anyone i please .      gillbret put his hands over his ears .     please .      it brought the argument to a momentary halt .  gillbret said     shall we discuss the matter of our destination now .  it   s obvious at this point that the sooner we   re somewhere else and out of this ship  the more comfortable we   ll be .         i agree with you there  oil     said biron .     just let   s go somewhere where i don   t have to listen to her clacking .  talk about women on space ships .      artemisia ignored him and addressed gillbret exclusively .     why don   t we get out of the nebular area altogether .         i don   t know about you     said biron at once     but i   ve got to get my ranch back and do a little something about my father   s murder .  i   ll stay in the kingdoms .         i did not mean     said artemisia     that we were to leave forever  only till the worst of the search was over .  i don   t see what you intend doing about your ranch  anyway .  you can   t get it back unless the tyrannian empire is broken to pieces  and i don   t see you doing that .         you never mind what i intend doing .  it   s my business .         might i make a suggestion .     asked gillbret mildly .   he took silence for consent  and went on     then suppose i tell you where we ought to go  and exactly what we ought to do to help break the empire to pieces  just as arta said .         oh .  how do you propose doing that .     said biron .   gillbret smiled .     my dear boy  you   re taking a very amusing attitude .  don   t you trust me .  you look at me as though you think that any enterprise i might be interested in was bound to be a foolish one .  i got you out of the palace .         i know that .  i   m perfectly willing to listen to you .         do so  then .  i   ve been waiting for over twenty years for my chance to get away from them .  if i had been a private citizen  i could have done it long since  but through the curse of birth  i   ve been in the public eye .  and yet .  if it hadn   t been for the fact that i was born a hinriad  i would not have attended the coronation of the present khan of tyrann  and in that case i would never have stumbled on the secret which will someday destroy that same khan .         go on     said biron .      the trip from rhodia to tyrann was by tyrannian warship  of course  as was the trip back .  a ship like this  i might say  but rather larger .  the trip there was uneventful .  the stay on tyrann had its points of amusements  but  for our purposes now  was likewise uneventful .  on the trip back  however  a meteor hit us .         what .      gillbret held up a hand .     i know quite well it   s an unlikely accident .  the incidence of meteors in space  especially in interstellar space  is low enough to make the chances of collision with a ship completely insignificant  but it does happen  as you know .  and it did happen in this case .  of course any meteor that does hit  even when it is the size of a pinhead  as most of them are  can penetrate the hull of any but the most heavily armored ship .         i know     said biron .     it   s a question of their momentum  which is a product of their mass and velocity .  the velocity more than makes up for their lack of mass .     he recited it glumly  like a school lesson  and caught himself watching artemisia furtively .   she had seated herself to listen to gillbret  and she was so close to him that they were almost touching .  it occurred to biron that her profile was beautiful as she sat there  even if her hair was becoming a little bedraggled .  she wasn   t wearing her little jacket  and the fluffy whiteness of her blouse was still smooth and unwrinkled after forty eight hours .  he wondered how she managed that .   the trip  he decided  could be quite wonderful if she would only learn to behave herself .  the trouble was that no one had ever controlled her properly  that was all .  certainly not her father .  she   d become too used to having her own way .  if she   d been born a commoner  she would be a very lovely creature .   he was just beginning to slip into a tiny daydream in which he controlled her properly and brought her to a state of proper appreciation of himself  when she turned her head and met his eye calmly .  biron looked away and fastened his attention instantly on gillbret .  he had missed a few sentences .      i haven   t the slightest idea why the ship   s screen had failed .  it was just one of those things to which no one will ever know the answer  but it had failed .  anyway  the meteor struck amidships .  it was pebble sized and piercing the hull slowed it just sufficiently so that it couldn   t blaze its way out again through the other side .  if it had done that  there would have been little harm to it  since the hull could have been temporarily patched in no time .      as it was  however  it plunged into the control room  ricocheted off the far wall and slammed back and forth till it came to a halt .  it couldn   t have taken more than a fraction of a minute to come to a halt  but at an original velocity of a hundred miles a minute  it must have crisscrossed the room a hundred times .  both crewmen were cut to pieces  and i escaped only because i was in the cabin at the time .      i heard the thin clang of the meteor when it originally penetrated the hull  then the click clack of its bouncing  and the terrifying short screams of the two crewmen .  when i jumped into the control room  there was only the blood everywhere and the torn flesh .  the things that happened next i remember only vaguely  although for years i lived it over step by step in my nightmares .      the cold sound of escaping air led me to the meteor hole .  i slapped a disk of metal over it and air pressure made a decent seal of it .  i found the little battered space pebble on the floor .  it was warm to the touch  but i hit it with a spanner and split it in two .  the exposed interior frosted over instantly .  it was still at the temperature of space .      i tied a cord to the wrist of each corpse and then tied each cord to a towing magnet .  i dumped them through the air lock  heard the magnets clank against the hold  and knew that the hard frozen bodies would follow the ship now wherever it went .  you see  once we returned to rhodia  i knew i would need the evidence of their bodies to show that it had been the meteor that had killed them and not i .      but how was i to return .  i was quite helpless .  there was no way i could run the ship  and there was nothing i dared try there in the depths of interstellar space .  i didn   t even know how to use the sub etheric communication system  so that i couldn   t sos .  i could only let the ship travel on its own course .         but you couldn   t very well do that  could you .     biron said .  he wondered if gillbret    were inventing this  either out of simple romantic imaginings or for some severely practical reason of his own .     what about the jumps through hyperspace .  you must have managed those  or you wouldn   t be here .         a tyrannian ship     said gillbret     once the controls are properly set  will make any number of jumps quite automatically .      biron stared his disbelief .  did gillbret take him for a fool .     you   re making that up     he said .      i am not .  it   s one of the damned military advances which won their wars for them .  they didn   t defeat fifty planetary systems  outnumbering tyrann by hundreds of times in population and resources  just by playing mumblety peg  you know .  sure they tackled us one at a time  and utilized our traitors very skillfully  but they had a definite military edge as well .  everyone knows that their tactics were superior to ours  and part of that was due to the automatic jump .  it meant a great increase in the maneuverability of their ships and made possible much more elaborate battle plans than any we could set up .      i   ll admit it   s one of their best kept secrets  this technique of theirs .  i never learned it until i was trapped alone on the bloodsucker  the tyranni have the most annoying custom of naming their ships unpleasantly  though i suppose it   s good psychology  and watched it happen .  i watched it make the jumps without a hand on the controls .         and you mean to say that this ship can do that too .         i don   t know .  i wouldn   t be surprised .      biron turned to the control board .  there were still dozens of contacts he had not determined the slightest use for .  well  later .   he turned to gillbret again .     and the ship took you home .         no  it didn   t .  when that meteor wove its pattern through the control room  it didn   t leave the board untouched .  it would have been most amazing if it had .  dials were smashed  the casing battered and dented .  there was no way of telling how the previous set of the controls had been altered  but it must have been somehow  because it never took me back to rhodia .      eventually  of course  it began deceleration  and i knew the trip was theoretically over .  i couldn   t tell where i was  but i managed to maneuver the visiplate so that i could tell there was a planet close enough to show a disk in the ship telescope .  it was blind luck  because the disk was increasing in size .  the ship was heading for the planet .      oh  not directly .  that would have been too impossible to hope for .  if i had just drifted  the ship would have missed the planet by a million miles  at least  but at that distance i could use ordinary etheric radio .  i knew how to do that .  it was after this was allover that i began educating myself in electronics .  i made up my mind that i would never be quite so helpless again .  being helpless is one of the things that isn   t altogether amusing .      biron prompted     so you used the radio .      gillbret went on     exactly  and they came and got me         who .         the men of the planet .  it was inhabited .         well  the luck piles up .  what planet was it .         i don   t know .         you mean they didn   t tell you .         amusing  isn   t it .  they didn   t .  but it was somewhere among the nebular kingdoms .         how did you know that .         because they knew the ship i was in was a tyrannian vessel .  they knew that by sight  and almost blasted it before i could convince them i was the only one on board alive .      biron put his large hands on his knees and kneaded them .     now hold on and pull back .  i don   t get this .  if they knew it was a tyrannian vessel and intending blasting it  isn   t that the best proof that the world was not in the nebular kingdoms .  that it was anywhere but there .         no  by the galaxy .     gillbret   s eyes were shining  and his voice climbed in enthusiasm .     it was in the kingdoms .  they took me to the surface  and what a world it was .  there were men there from allover the kingdoms .  i could tell by the accents .  and they had no fear of the tyranni .  the place was an arsenal .  you couldn   t tell from space .  it might have been a rundown farming world  but the life of the planet was underground .  somewhere in the kingdoms  my boy  somewhere there is that planet still  and it is not afraid of the tyranni  and it is going to destroy the tyranni as it would have destroyed the ship i was on then  if the crewmen had been still alive .      biron felt his heart bound .  for a moment he wanted to believe .   after all  maybe .  maybe .     eleven     and maybe not .     and then again  maybe not .   biron said     how did you learn all this about its being an arsenal .  how long did you stay .  what did you see .      gillbret grew impatient .     it wasn   t exactly what i saw at all .  they didn   t conduct me on any tours  or anything like that .     he forced himself to relax .     well  look  this is what happened .  by the time they got me off the ship  i was in more or less of a bad state .  i had been too frightened to eat much  it   s a terrible thing  being marooned in space   and i must have looked worse than i really was .      i identified myself  more or less  and they took me underground .  with the ship  of course .  i suppose they were more interested in the ship than in myself .  it gave them a chance to study tyrannian spatio engineering .  they took me to what must have been a hospital .         but what did you see  uncle .     asked artemisia .   biron interrupted     hasn   t he ever told you this before .      artemisia said     no .      and gillbret added     i   ve never told anyone till now .  i was taken to a hospital  as i said .  i passed research laboratories in that hospital that must have been better than anything we have on rhodia .  on the way to the hospital i passed factories in which some sort of metalwork was going on .  the ships that had captured me were certainly like none i   ve ever heard about .      it was all so apparent to me at the time that i have never questioned it in the years since .  i think of it as my    rebellion world     and i know that someday swarms of ships will leave it to attack the tyranni  and that the subject worlds will be called upon to rally round the rebel leaders .  from year to year i   ve waited for it to happen .  each new year i   ve thought to myself  this may be the one .  and  each time  i half hoped it wouldn   t be  because i was longing to get away first  to join them so that i might be part of the great attack .  i didn   t want them to start without me .      he laughed shakily .     i suppose it would have amused most people to know what was going on in my mind .  in my mind .  nobody thought much of me  you know .      biron said     all this happened over twenty years ago  and they haven   t attacked .  there   s been no sign of them .  no strange ships have been reported .  no incidents .  and you still think       gillbret fired at him     yes  i do .  twenty years isn   t too long to organize a rebellion against a planet that rules fifty systems .  i was there just at the beginning of the rebellion .  i know that too .  slowly  since then  they must have been honeycombing the planet with their underground preparations  developing newer ships and weapons  training more men  organizing the attack .      it   s only in the video thrillers that men spring to arms at a moment   s notice  that a new weapon is needed one day  invented the next  mass produced the third  and used the fourth .  these things take time  biron  and the men of the rebellion world must know they will have to be completely ready before beginning .  they won   t be able to strike twice .      and what do you call    incidents    .  tyrannian ships have disappeared and never been found .  space is big  you might say  and they might simply be lost  but what if they were captured by the rebels .  there was the case of the tireless two years back .  it reported a strange object close enough to stimulate the massometer  and then was never heard from again .  it could have been a meteor  i suppose  but was it .      the search lasted months .  they never found it .  i think the rebels have it .  the tireless was a new ship  an experimental model .  it would be just what they would want .      biron said     once having landed there  why didn   t you stay .         don   t you suppose i wanted to .  i had no chance .  i listened to them when they thought i was unconscious  and i learned a bit more then .  they were just starting  out there  at that time .  they couldn   t afford to be found out then .  they knew i was gillbret oth hinriad .  there was enough identification on the ship  even if i hadn   t told them myself  which i had .  they knew that if i didn   t return to rhodia there would be a full scale search that would not readily come to a halt .      they couldn   t risk such a search  so they had to see to it that i was returned to rhodia .  and that   s where they took me .         what .     cried biron .     but that must have been an even greater risk .  how did they do that .         i don   t know .     gillbret passed his thin fingers through his graying hair  and his eyes seemed to be probing uselessly into the backward stretches of his memory .     they anesthetized me  i suppose .  that part all blanks out .  past a certain point there is nothing .  i can only remember that i opened my eyes and was back in the bloodsucker  i was in space  just off rhodia .         the two dead crewmen were still attached by the tow magnets .  they hadn   t been removed on the rebellion world .     asked biron .      they were still there .         was there any evidence at all to indicate that you had been on the rebellion world .         none  except for what i remembered .         how did you know you were off rhodia .         i didn   t .  i knew i was near a planet  the massometer said so .  i used the radio again  and this time it was rhodian ships that came for me .  i told my story to the tyrannian commissioner of that day  with appropriate modifications .  i made no mention of the rebellion world  of course .  and i said the meteor had hit just after the last jump .  i didn   t want them to think i knew that a tyrannian ship could make the jumps automatically .         do you think the rebellion world found out that little fact .  did you tell them .         i didn   t tell them .  i had no chance .  i wasn   t there long enough .  conscious  that is .  but i don   t know how long i was unconscious and what they managed to find out for themselves .      biron stared at the visiplate .  judging from the rigidity of the picture it presented  the ship they were on might have been nailed in space .  the remorseless was traveling at the rate of ten thousand miles an hour  but what was that to the immense distances of space .  the stars were hard  bright  and motionless .  they had a hypnotic quality about them .   he said     then where are we going .  i take it you still don   t know where the rebellion world is .         i don   t .  but i have an idea who would .  i am almost sure i know .     gillbret was eager about it .      who .         the autarch of lingane .         lingane .     biron frowned .  he had heard the name some time back  it seemed to him  but he had forgotten the connection .     why he .         lingane was the last kingdom captured by the tyranni .  it is not  shall we say  as pacified as the rest .  doesn   t that make sense .         as far as it goes .  but how far is that .         if you want another reason  there is your father .         my father .     for a moment biron forgot that his father was dead .  he saw him standing before his mind   s eye  large and alive  but then he remembered and there was that same cold wrench inside him .     how does my father come into this .         he was at court six months ago .  i gained certain notions as to what he wanted .  some of his talks with my cousin  hinrik  i overheard .         oh  uncle     said artemisia impatiently .      my dear .         you had no right to eavesdrop on father   s private discussions .      gillbret shrugged .     of course not  but it was amusing  and useful as well .       biron interrupted     now  wait .  you say it was six months ago that my father was at rhodia .     he felt excitement mount .      yes .         tell me .  while there  did he have access to the director   s collection of primitivism .  you told me once that the director had a large library of matters concerning earth .          i imagine so .  the library is quite famous and it is usually made available to distinguished visitors  if they   re interested .  they usually aren   t  but your father was .  yes  i remember that very well .  he spent nearly a day there .      that checked .  it had been half a year ago that his father had first asked his help .  biron said     you yourself know the library well  i imagine .         of course .         is there anything in the library that would suggest that there .  exists a document on earth of great military value .      gillbret was blank of face and  obviously  blank of mind .   biron said     somewhere in the last centuries of prehistoric  earth there must have been such a document .  i can only tell you that my father thought it to be the most valuable single item in the galaxy  and the deadliest .  i was to have gotten it for him  but i left earth too soon  and in any case     his voice faltered     he died too soon .      but gillbret was still blank .     i don   t know what you   re talking about .         you don   t understand .  my father mentioned it to me first six months ago .  he must have learned of it in the library on rhodia .  if you   ve been through it yourself  can   t you tell me what it was he must have learned .      but gillbret could only shake his head .   biron said     well  continue with your story .      gillbret said     they spoke of the autarch of lingane  your father and my cousin .  despite your father   s cautious phraseology  biron  it was obvious that the autarch was the fount and head of the conspiracy .      and then     he hesitated     there was a mission from lingane and the autarch himself was at its head .  i  i told him of the rebellion world .         you said a while ago you told nobody     said biron .      except the autarch .  i had to know the truth .         what did he tell you .         practically nothing .  but then  he had to be cautious too .  could he trust me .  i might have been working for the tyranni .  how could he know .  but he didn   t close the door altogether .  it   s our only lead .         is it .     biron said .     then we   ll go to lingane .  one place  i suppose  is like another .      mention of his father had depressed him  and  for the moment  nothing mattered much .  let it be lingane .     let it be lingane .  that was easy to say .  but how does one go about pointing the ship .  at a tiny speck of light thirty five light years away .  two hundred trillion miles .  a two with fourteen zeros after it .  at ten thousand miles an hour  current cruising speed of the remorseless  it would take well over two million years to get there .   biron leafed through the standard galactic ephemeris with something like despair .  tens of thousands of stars were listed in detail  with their positions crammed into three iigures .  there were hundreds of pages of these figures  symbolized by the greek letters     rho       theta   and     phi  .      was the distance from the galactic center in parsecs      the angular separation  along the plane of the galactic lens from the standard galactic baseline  the line  that is  which connects the galactic center and the sun of the planet  earth       the angular separation from the baseline in the plane perpendicular to that of the galactic lens  the two latter measurements being expressed in radians .  given those three figures  one could locate any star accurately in all the vast immensity of space .   that is  on a given date .  in addition to the star   s position on the standard day for which all the data were calculated  one had to know the star   s proper motion  both speed and direction .  it was a small correction .  comparatively  but necessary .  a million miles is virtually nothing compared with stellar distances  but it is a long way with a ship .   there was  of course  the question of the ship   s own position .  one could calculate the distance from rhodia by the reading of the massometer  or  more correctly  the distance from rhodia   s sun  since this far out in space the sun   s gravitational field drowned out that of any of its planets .  the direction they were traveling with reference to the galactic baseline was more difficult to determine .  biron had to locate two known stars other than rhodia   s sun .  from their apparent positions and the known distance from rhodia   s sun  he could plot their actual position .   it was roughly done but  he felt sure  accurately enough .  knowing his own position and that of lingane   s sun  he had only to adjust the controls for the proper direction and strength of the hyperatornic thrust .   biron felt lonely and tense .  not frightened .  he rejected the word .  but tense  definitely .  he was deliberately calculating the elements of the jump for a time six hours later .  he wanted plenty of time to check his figures .  and perhaps there might be the chance for a nap .  he had dragged the bed makings out of the cabin and it was ready for him now .   the other two were  presumably  sleeping in the cabin .  he told himself that that was a good thing and that he wanted nobody around bothering him  yet when he heard the small sound of bare feet outside  he looked up with a certain eagerness .      hello     he said     why aren   t you sleeping .      artemisia stood in the doorway  hesitating .  she said  in a small voice     do you mind if i come in .  will i be bothering you .         it depends on what you do .         i   ll try to do the right things .      she seemed too humble  biron thought suspiciously  and then the reason for it came out .      i   m awfully frightened     she said .     aren   t you .      he wanted to say no  not at all  but it didn   t come out that way .  he smiled sheepishly  and said     sort of .      oddly enough  that comforted her .  she knelt down on the floor beside him and looked at the thick volumes opened before him and at the sheets of calculations .      they had all these books here .         you bet .  they couldn   t pilot a ship without them .         and you understand all that .         not all that .  i wish i did .  i hope i understand enough .  we   ll have to jump to lingane  you know .         is that hard to do .         no  not if you know the figures  which are all here  and have the controls  which are all there  and if you have experience  which i haven   t .  for instance  it should be done in several jumps  but i   m going to try it in one because there   ll be less chance of trouble  even though it means a wasteful use of energy .      he shouldn   t tell her  there was no point ill telling her  it would be cowardly to frighten her  and she   d be hard to handle if she got really frightened  panicky frightened .  he kept telling himself all that and it did no good .  he wanted to share it with somebody .  he wanted part of it off his own mind .   he said     there are some things i should know that i don   t .  things like the mass density between here and lingane affect the course of the jump  because that mass density is what controls the curvature of this part of the universe .  the ephemeris  that   s this big book here  mentions the curvature corrections that must be made in certain standard jumps  and from those you   re supposed to be able to calculate your own particular corrections .  but then if you happen to have a super giant within ten light years  all bets are off .  i   m not even sure if i used the computer correctly .         but what would happen if you were wrong .         we could re enter space too close to lingane   s sun .      she considered that  then said     you have no idea how much better i feel .         after what i   ve just said .         of course .  in my bunk i simply felt helpless and lost with so much emptiness in all directions .  now i know that we   re going somewhere and that the emptiness is under our control .      biron was pleased .  how different she was .     i don   t know about it   s being under our control .      she stopped him .     it is .  i know you can handle the ship .      and biron decided that maybe he could at that .   artemisia had tucked her long unclad legs under her and sat facing him .  she had only her filmy underclothes for cover  but seemed unconscious of the fact  though biron was definitely not .   she said     you know  i had an awfully queer sensation in the bunk  almost as i were floating .  that was one of the things that frightened me .  every time i   d turn  i   d give a queer little jump into the air and then flop back slowly as if there were springs in the air holding me back .         you weren   t sleeping in a top bunk  were you .         yes  i was .  the bottom ones give me claustrophobia  with another mattress six inches over your head .      biron laughed .     then that explains it .  the ship   s gravitational force is directed toward its base  and falls off as we move away from it .  in the top bunk you were probably twenty or thirty pounds lighter than on the floor .  were you ever on a passenger liner .  a really big one .         once .  when father and i visited tyrann last year .         well  on the liners they have the gravitation in all parts of the ship directed toward the outer hull  so that the long axis of the ship is always    up     no matter where you are .  that   s why the motors of one of those big babies are always lined up in a cylinder running right along the long axis .  no gravity there .         it must take an awful lot of power to keep an artificial gravity going .         enough to power a small town .         there isn   t any danger of our running short of fuel  is there .         don   t worry about that .  ships are fueled by the total conversion of mass to energy .  fuel is the last thing we   ll run out of .  the outer hull will wear away first .      she was facing him .  he noted that her face had been cleaned of its make up and wondered how that had been done  probably with a handkerchief and as little of the drinking water as she could manage .  she didn   t suffer as a result  for her clear white skin was the more startlingly perfect against the black of her hair and eyes .  her eyes were very warm  thought biron .   the silence had lasted a little too long .  he said hurriedly     you don   t travel very much  do you .  i mean  you were on a liner only once .      she nodded .     once too often .  if we hadn   t gone to tyrann  that filthy chamberlain wouldn   t have seen me and  i don   t want to talk about that .      biron let it .  go .  he said     is that usual .  i mean  not traveling .         i   m afraid so .  father is always hopping around on state visits  opening agricultural expositions  dedicating buildings .  he usually just makes some speech that aratap writes for him .  as for the rest of us  however  the more we stay in the palace  the better the tyranni like it .  poor gillbret .  the one and only time he left rhodia was to attend the khan   s coronation as father   s representative .  they   ve never let him get into a ship again .      her eyes were downcast and  absently  she pleated the material of biron   s sleeve where it ended at the wrist .  she said     biron .         yes  arta .     he stumbled a bit  but it came out .      do you think uncle oil   s story can be true .         do you suppose it could be his imagination .  he   s been brooding about the tyranni for years  and he   s never been able to do anything  of course  except to rig up spy beams  which is only childish  and he knows it .  he may have built himself a daydream and  over the years  gradually come to believe in it .  i know him  you see .         could be  but let   s follow it up a little .  we can travel to lingane  anyway .      they were closer to one another .  he could have reached out and touched her  held her in his arms  kissed her .   and he did so .   it was a complete non sequitur .  nothing  it seemed to biron  had led to it .  one moment they were discussing jumps and gravity and gillbret  and the next she was soft and silky in his arms and soft silky on his lips .   his first impulse was to say he was sorry  to go through all the silly motions of apology  but when he drew away and would have spoken  she still made no attempt at escape but rested her head in the crook of his left arm .  her eyes remained closed .   so he said nothing at all but kissed her again  slowly and thoroughly .  it was the best thing he could have done  and at the time he knew it .   finally she said  a bit dreamily     aren   t you hungry .  i   ll bring you some of the concentrate and warm it for you .  then  if you want to sleep  i can keep an eye on things for you .  and  and i   d better put on more of my clothes .      she turned as she was about to go out the door .     the food concentrate tastes very nice after you get used to it .  thank you for getting it .      somehow that  rather than the kisses  was the treaty of peace between them .   when gillbret entered the control room  hours later  he showed no surprise at finding biron and artemisia lost in a foolish kind of conversation .  he made no remarks about the fact that biron   s arm was about his niece   s waist .   he said     when are we jumping  biron .         in half an hour     said biron .   the half hour passed  the controls were set  conversation languished and died .   at zero time biron drew a deep breath and yanked a lever the full length of its arc  from left to right .   it was not as it had been on the liner .  the remorseless was smaller and the jump was consequently less smooth .  biron staggered  and for a split second things wavered .   and then they were smooth and solid again .   the stars in the visiplate had changed .  biron rotated the ship  so that the star field lifted  each star moving in a stately arc .  one star appeared finally  brilliantly white and more than a point .  it was a tiny sphere  a burning speck of sand .  biron caught it  steadied the ship before it was lost again  and turned the telescope upon it  throwing in the spectroscopic attachment .   he turned again to the ephemeris  and checked under the column headed    spectral characteristics .     then he got out of the pilot   s chair and said     it   s still too far .  i   ll have to nudge up to it .  but  anyway  that   s lingane right ahead .      it was the first jump he had ever made  and it was successful .     twelve     the autarch comes    the autarch of lingane pondered the matter  but his cool  well trained features scarcely creased under the impact of thought .      and you waited forty eight hours to tell me     he said .   rizzett said boldly     there was no reason to tell you earlier .  if we bombarded you with all matters  life would be a burden to you .  we tell you now because we still make nothing of it .  it is queer  and in our position we can afford nothing queer .         repeat this business .  let me hear it again .      the autarch threw a leg upon the flaring window sill and looked outward thoughtfully .  the window itself represented perhaps the greatest single oddity of linganian architecture .  it was moderate in size and set at the end of a five foot recess that narrowed gently toward it .  it was extremely clear  immensely thick  and precisely curved  not so much a window as a lens  funneling the light inward from all directions  so that  looking outward  one eyed a miniature panorama .   from any window in the autarch   s manor a sweep of vision embracing half the horizon from zenith to nadir could be seen .  at the edges there was increasing minuteness and distortion  but that itself lent a certain flavor to what one saw  the tiny flattened motions of the city  the creeping  curved orbits of the crescent shaped stratospherics climbing from the airport .  one grew so used to it that unhinging the window to allow the flat tameness of reality to enter would seem unnatural .  when the position of the sun made the lenslike windows a focus for impossible heat and light  they were blanked out automatically  rather than opened  rendered opaque by a shift in the polarization characteristics of the glass .   and certainly the theory that a planet   s architecture is the reflection of a planet   s place in the galaxy would seem to be borne out by the case of lingane and its windows .   like the windows  lingane was small yet commanded a panoramic view .  it was a    planet state    in a galaxy  which  at the time  had passed beyond that stage of economic and political development .  where most political units were con .  glomerations of stellar systems  lingane remained what it had been for centuries  a single inhabited world .  this did not prevent it from being wealthy .  in fact  it was almost inconceivable that lingane could be anything else .   it is difficult to tell in advance when a world is so located that many jump routes may use it as a pivotal intermediate point  or even must use it in the interests of optimal economy .  a great deal depends on the pattern of development of that region of space .  there is the question of the distribution of the naturally habitable planets  the order in which they are colonized and developed  the types of economy they possess .   lingane discovered its own values early  which was the great turning point of its history .  next to the actual possession of a strategic position  the capacity to appreciate and exploit that position is most important .  lingane had proceeded to occupy small planetoids with neither resources nor capacity for supporting an independent population  choosing them only because they would help maintain lingane   s trade monopoly .  they built servicing stations on those rocks .  all that ships would need  from hyperatomic replacements to new book reels  could be found there .  the stations grew to huge trading posts .  from all the nebular kingdoms fur  minerals  grain  beef  timber poured in  from the inner kingdoms  machinery  appliances  medicinals  finished products of all sorts formed a similar flood .   so that  like its windows  lingane   s minuteness looked out on all the galaxy .  it was a planet alone  but it did well .   the autarch said  without turning from the window     start with the mail ship  rizzett .  where did it meet this cruiser in the first place .         less than one hundred thousand miles off lingane .  the exact coordinates don   t matter .  they   ve been watched ever since .  the point is that  even then  the tyrannian cruiser was in an orbit about the planet .         as though it had no intention of landing  but  rather  was waiting for something .         yes .         no way of telling how long they   d been waiting .         impossible  i   m afraid .  they were sighted by no one else .  we checked thoroughly .         very well     said the autarch .     we   ll abandon that for the moment .  they stopped the mail ship  which is  of course  interference with the mails and a violation of our articles of association with tyrann .         i doubt that they were tyranni .  their unsure actions are more those of outlaws  of prisoners in flight .         you mean the men on the tyrannian cruiser .  it may be what they want us to believe  of course .      at any rate  their only overt action was to ask that a message be delivered directly to me .         directly to the autarch  that is right .         nothing else .         nothing else .         they at no time entered the mail ship .         all communications were by visiplate .  the mail capsule was shot across two miles of empty space and caught by the ship   s net .         was it vision communication or sound only .             full vision .  that   s the point .  the speaker was described by several as being a young man of    aristocratic bearing     whatever that means .      the autarch   s fist clenched slowly .     really .  and no photo impression was taken of the face .  that was a mistake .         unfortunately there was no reason for the mail captain to have anticipated the importance of doing so  if any importance exists .  does all this mean anything to you  sir .      the autarch did not answer the question .     and this is the message .         exactly .  a tremendous message of one word that we were supposed to bring directly to you  a thing we did not do  of course .  it might have been a fission capsule  for instance .  men have been killed that way before .         yes  and autarchs too     said the autarch .     just the word    gillbret .     one word     gillbret .          the autarch maintained his indifferent calm  but a certain lack of certainty was gathering  and he did not like to experience a lack of certainty .  he liked nothing which made him aware of limitations .  an autarch should have no limitations  and on lingane he had none that natural law did not impose .   there had not always been an autarch .  in its earlier days lingane had been ruled by dynasties of merchant princes .  the families who had first established the subplanetary service stations were the aristocrats of the state .  they were not rich in land  hence could not compete in social position with the ranchers and grangers of the neighboring worlds .  but they were rich in negotiable currency and so could buy and sell those same ranchers and grangers  and  by way of high finance  they sometimes did .   and lingane suffered the usual fate of a planet ruled  or misruled  under such circumstances .  the balance of power oscillated from one family to another .  the various groups alternated in exile .  intrigues and palace revolutions were chronic  so that if the directorship of rhodia was the sector   s prime example of stability and orderly development  lingane was the example of restlessness and disorder .     as fickle as lingane     people said .   the outcome was inevitable  if one judges by hindsight .  as the neighboring planet states consolidated into group states and became powerful  civil struggles on lingane became increasingly expensive and dangerous to the planet .  the general population was quite willing  finally  to barter anything for general calm .  so they exchanged a plutocracy for an autocracy  and lost little liberty in the exchange .  the power of several was concentrated in one  but that one  frequently enough  was deliberately friendly to the populace he sought to use as a make weight against the never reconciled merchants .   under the autarchy  lingane increased its wealth and strength .  even the tyranni  attacking thirty years earlier at the height of their power  had been fought to a standstill .  they had not been defeated  but they had been stopped .  the shock  even of that  had been permanent .  not a planet had been conquered by the tyranni since the year they had attacked lingane .   other planets of the nebular kingdoms were outright vassals of the tyranni .  lingane  however  was an associated state  theoretically the equal    ally    of tyrann  with its rights guarded by the articles of association .   the autarch was not fooled by the situation .  the chauvinistic of the planet might allow themselves the luxury of considering themselves free  but the autarch knew that the tyrannian danger had been held at arm   s length this past generation .  only that far .  no farther .   and now it might be moving in quickly for the final  long delayed bear hug .  certainly  he had given it the opportunity it was waiting for .  the organization he had built up  ineffectual though it was  was sufficient grounds for punitive action of any type the tyranni might care to undertake .  legally  lingane would be in the wrong .   was the cruiser the first reaching out for the final bear hug .   the autarch said     has a guard been placed on that ship .         i said they were watched .  two of our freighters     he smiled one sidedly     keep in massometer range .         well  what do you make of it .         i don   t know .  the only gillbret i know whose name by itself would mean anything is gillbret oth hinriad of rhodia .  have you had dealings with him .      the autarch said     i saw him on my last visit to rhodia .         you told him nothing  of course .         of course .      rizzett   s eyes narrowed .     i thought there might have been a certain lack of caution on your part  that the tyranni had been the recipients of an equal lack of caution on the part of this gillbret  the hinriads are notable weaklings these days  and that this now was a device to trap you into final self betrayal .         i doubt it .  it comes at a queer time  this business .  i have been away from lingane for a year or more .  i arrived last week and i shall leave in a matter of days again .  a message such as this reaches me just when i am in a position to be reached .         you don   t think it is a coincidence .         i don   t believe in coincidence .  and there is one way in which all this would not be coincidence .  i will therefore visit that ship .  alone .         impossible  sir .     rizzett was startled .  he had a small  uneven scar just above his right temple and it suddenly showed red .      you forbid me .     asked the autarch dryly .   and he was autarch  after all  since rizzett   s face fell  and he said     as you please  sir .        aboard the remorseless  the wait was proving increasingly unpleasant .  for two days they hadn   t budged from their orbit .   gillbret watched the controls with relentless concentration .  his voice had an edge to it .     wouldn   t you say they were moving .      biron looked up briefly .  he was shaving  and handling the tyranni erosive spray with finicky care .      no     he said     they   re not moving .  why should they .  they   re watching us  and they   ll keep on watching us .      he concentrated upon the difficult area of the upper lip  and frowned impatiently as he felt the slightly sour taste of the spray upon his tongue .  a tyrannian could handle the spray with a grace that was almost poetic .  it was undoubtedly the quickest and closest non permanent shaving method in existence  in the hands of an expert .  in essence  it was an extremely fine air blown abrasive that scoured off the hairs without harming the skin .  certainly the skin felt like nothing more than the gentle pressure of what might have been an air stream .   however  biron felt queasy about it .  there was the well known legend  or story  or fact  whatever it was   about the incidence of face cancer being higher among the tyranni than among other cultural groups  and some attributed this to the tyranni shave spray .  biron wondered for the first time if it might not be better to have his face completely depilated .  it was done in some parts of the galaxy  as a matter of course .  he rejected the thought .  depilation was permanent .  the fashion might always shift to mustaches or cheek curls .   biron was surveying his face in the mirror  wondering how he would look in sideburns down to the angle of the jaw  when artemisia said from the doorway     i thought you were going to sleep .         i did     he said .     then i woke up .     he looked up at her and smiled .   she patted his cheek  then stroked it gently with her fingers .     it   s smooth .  you look about eighteen .      he carried her hand to his lips .     don   t let that fool you     he said .    she said     they   re still watching .         still watching .  isn   t it annoying  these dull interludes that give you time to sit and worry .         i don   t find this interlude dull .         you   re talking about other aspects of it now  arta .      she said     why don   t we cross them up and land on lingane .         we   ve thought of it .  i don   t think we   re ready for that kind of risk .  we can afford to wait till the water supply gets a bit lower .      gillbret said loudly     i tell you they are moving .      biron crossed over to the control panel and considered the massometer readings .  he looked at gillbret and said     you may be right .      he pecked away at the calculator for a moment or two and stared at its dials .      no  the two ships haven   t moved relative to us  gillbret .  what   s changed the massometer is that a third ship has joined them .  as near as i can tell  it   s five thousand miles off  about    degrees    and     degrees    from the ship planet line  if i   ve got the clockwise and counterclockwise conventions straight .  if     i haven   t  the figures are  respectively      and     degrees .      he paused to take another reading .     i think they   re approaching .  it   s a small ship .  do you think you can get in touch with them  gillbret .         i can try     said gillbret .      all right .  no vision .  let   s leave it at sound  till we get some notion of what   s coming .      it was amazing to watch gillbret at the controls of the etheric radio .  he was obviously the possessor of a native talent .  contacting an isolated point in space with a tight radio beam remains  after all  a task in which the ship   s control panel information can participate only slightly .  he had a notion of the distance of the ship which might be off by a hundred miles plus or minus .  he had two angles  either or both of which might easily be wrong by five or six degrees in any direction .   this left a volume of about ten million cubic miles within which the ship might be .  the rest was left to the human operator  and a radio beam which was a probing finger not half a mile in cross section at the widest point of its receivable range .  it was said that a skilled operator could tell by the feel of the controls how closely the beam missed the target .  scientifically  that theory was nonsense  of course  but it often seemed that no other explanation was possible .   in less than ten minutes the activity gauge of the radio was jumping and the remorseless was both sending and receiving .   in another ten minutes biron was able to lean back and say     they   re going to send a man aboard .         ought we to let them .     asked artemisia .      why not .  one man .  we   re armed .         but if we let their ship get too close .         we   re a tyrannian cruiser  arta .  we   ve got three to five times their power  even if they were the best warship lingane had .  they   re not allowed too much by their precious articles of association  and we   ve got five high caliber blasters .      artemisia said     do you know how to use the tyrannian blasters .  i didn   t know you did .      biron hated to turn the admiration off  but he said     unfortunately  i don   t .  at least  not yet .  but then  the linganian ship won   t know that  you see .        half an hour later the visiplate showed a visible ship .  it was a stubby little craft  fitted with two sets of four fins  as though it were frequently called upon to double for stratospheric flight .   at its first appearance in the telescope  gillbret shouted in delight .     that   s the autarch   s yacht     he cried  and his face wrinkled into a grin .     it   s his private yacht .  i   m sure of it .  i told you that the bare mention of my name was the surest way to get his attention .      there was the period of deceleration and adjustment of velocity on the part of the linganian ship  until it hung motionless in the plate .   a thin voice came from the receiver .     ready for boarding .         ready .     clipped biron .     one person only .         one person     came the response .   it was like a snake uncoiling .  the metal mesh rope looped outward from the linganian ship  shooting at them harpoon fashion .  it   s thickness expanded in the visiplate  and the magnestized cylinder that ended it approached and grew in size .  as it grew closer  it edged toward the rim of the cone of vision  then veered off completely .   the sound of its contact was hollow and reverberant .  the magnetized weight was anchored  and the line was a spider thread that did not sag in a normal weighted curve but retained whatever kinks and loops it had possessed at the moment of contact  these moving slowly forward as units under the influence of inertia .   easily and carefully  the linganian ship edged away and the line straightened .  it hung there then  taut and fine  thinning into space until it was an almost invisible thing  glancing with incredible daintiness in the light of lingane   s sun .   biron threw in the telescopic attachment  which bloated the ship monstrously in the field of vision  so that one could see the origin of the half mile length of connecting line and the little figure that was beginning to swing hand over hand along it .   it was not the usual form of boarding .  ordinarily  two ships would maneuver to near contact  so that extensible air locks could meet and merge under intense magnetic fields .  a tunnel through space would connect the ships  and a man could travel from one to the other with no further protection than he needed to wear aboard ship .  naturally  this form of boarding required mutual trust .   by space line  one was dependent upon his space suit .  the approaching linganian was bloated in his  a fat thing of air extended metal mesh  the joints of which required no small muscular effort to work .  even at the distance at which he was  biron could see his arms flex with a snap as the joint gave and came to rest in a new groove .   and the mutual velocities of the two ships had to be carefully adjusted .  an inadvertent acceleration on the part of either would tear the line loose and send the traveler tumbling through space under the easy grip of the faraway sun and of the initial impulse of the snapping line  with nothing  neither friction nor obstruction  to stop him this side of eternity .   the approaching linganian moved on confidently and quickly .  when he came closer it was easy to see that it was not a simple hand over hand procedure .  each time the forward hand flexed  pulling him on  he would let go and float onward some dozen feet before his other hand had reached forward for a new hold .   it was a brachiation through space .  the spaceman was a gleaming metal gibbon .   artemisia said     what if he misses .         he looks too expert to do that     said biron     but if he does  he   d still shine in the sun .  we   d pick him up again .      the linganian was close now .  he had passed out of the field of the visiplate .  in another five seconds there was the clatter of feet on the ship   s hull .   biron yanked the lever that lit the signals which outlined the ship   s air lock .  a moment later  in answer to an imperative series of raps  the outer door was opened .  there was a thump just beyond a blank section of the pilot room   s wall .  the outer door closed  the section of wall slid away  and a man stepped through .   his suit frosted over instantly  blanking the thick glass of his helmet and turning him into a mound of white .  cold radiated from him .  biron elevated the heaters and the gush of air that entered was warm and dry .  for a moment the frost on the suit held its own  then began to thin and dissolve into a dew .   the linganian   s blunt metal fingers were fumbling at the clasps of the helmet as though he were impatient with his snowy blindness .  it lifted off as a unit  the thick  soft insulation inside rumpling his hair as it passed .   gillbret said     your excellency .     in glad triumph  he said     biron  it is the autarch himself .      but biron  in a voice that struggled vainly against stupefaction  could only say     jonti .        thirteen     the autarch remains    the autarch gently toed the suit to one side and appropriated the larger of the padded chairs .   he said     i haven   t had that sort of exercise in quite awhile .  but they say it never leaves you once you   ve learned  and  apparently  it hasn   t in my case .  hello  farrill .  my lord gillbret  good day .  and this  if i remember  is the director   s daughter  the lady artemisia .      he placed a long cigarette carefully between his lips and brought it to life with a single intake of breath .  the scented tobacco filled the air with its pleasant odor .     i did not expect to see you quite so soon  farrill     he said .      or at all  perhaps .     said biron acidly .      one never knows     agreed the autarch .     of course  with a message that read only    gillbret     with the knowledge that gillbret could not pilot a space ship  with the further knowledge that i had myself sent a young man to rhodia who could pilot a space ship and who was quite capable of stealing a tyrannian cruiser in his desperation to escape  and with the knowledge that one of the men on the cruiser was reported to be young and of aristocratic bearing  the conclusion was obvious .  i am not surprised to see you .         i think you are     said biron .     i think you   re as surprised as hell to see me .  as an assassin  you should be .  do you think i am worse at deduction than you are .         i think only highly of you  farrill .      the autarch was completely unperturbed  and biron felt awkward and stupid in his resentment .  he turned furiously to the others .     this man is sander jonti  the sander jonti i   ve told you of .  he may be the autarch of lingane besides  or fifty autarchs .  it makes no difference .  to me he is sander jonti .      artemisia said     he is the man who       gillbret put a thin and shaking hand to his brow .     control yourself  biron .  are you mad .         this is the man .  i am not mad .     shouted biron .  he controlled himself with an effort .     all right .  there   s no point yelling  i suppose .  get off my ship  jonti .  now that   s said quietly enough .  get off my ship .         my dear farrill .  for what reason .      gillbret made incoherent sounds in his throat  but biron pushed him aside roughly and faced the seated autarch .     you made one mistake  jonti .  just one .  you couldn   t tell in advance that when i got out of my dormitory room back on earth i would leave my wrist watch inside .  you see  my wrist watch strap happened to be a radiation indicator .      the autarch blew a smoke ring and smiled pleasantly .   biron said     and that strap never turned blue  jonti .  there was no bomb in my room that night .  there was only a deliberately planted dud .  if you deny it  you are a liar  jonti  or autarch  or whatever you please to call yourself .      what is more  you planted that dud .  you knocked me out with hypnite and arranged the rest of that night   s comedy .  it makes quite obvious sense  you know .  if i had been left to myself  i would have slept through the night and would never have known that anything was out of the way .  so who rang me on the visiphone until he was sure i had awakened .  awakened  that is  to discover the bomb  which had been deliberately placed near a counter so that i couldn   t miss it .  who blasted my door in so that i might leave the room before i found out that the bomb was only a dud after all .  you must have enjoyed yourself that night  jonti .      biron waited for effect  but the autarch merely nodded in polite interest .  biron felt the fury mount .  it was like punching pillows  whipping water  kicking air .   he said harshly     my father was about to be executed .  i would have learned of it soon enough .  i would  have gone to nephelos  or not gone .  i would have followed my own good sense in the matter  confronted the tyranni openly or not as i decided .  i would have known my chances .  i would have been prepared for eventualities .      but you wanted me to go to rhodia  to see hinrik .  but  ordinarily  you couldn   t expect me to do what you wanted .  i wasn   t likely to go to you for advice .  unless  that is  you could stage an appropriate situation .  you did .      i thought i was being bombed and i could think of do reason .  you could .  you seemed to have saved my life .  you seemed to know everything  what i ought to do next  for instance .  i was off balance  confused .  i followed your advice .      biron ran out of breath and waited for an answer .  there was none .  he shouted     you did not explain that the ship on which i left earth was a rhodian ship and that you had seen to it that the captain had been informed of my true identity .  you did not explain that you intended me to be in the hands of the    tyranni the instant i landed on rhodia .  do you deny that .      there was a long pause .  jonti stubbed out his cigarette .   gillbret chafed one hand in the other .     biron  you are being ridiculous .  the autarch wouldn   t       then jonti looked up and said quietly     but the autarch would .  i admit it all .  you are quite right  biron  and i congratulate you on your penetration .  the bomb was a dud planted by myself  and i sent you to rhodia with the intention of having you arrested by the tyranni .      biron   s face cleared .  some of the futility of life vanished .  he said     someday  jonti  i will settle that matter .  at the moment  it seems you are autarch of lingane with three ships waiting for you out there .  that hampers me a bit more than i would like .  however  the remorseless is my ship .  i am its pilot .  put on your suit and get out .  the space line is still in place .         it is not your ship .  you are a pirate rather than a pilot .         possession is all the law here .  you have five minutes to get into your suit .         please .  let   s avoid dramatics .  we need one another and i have no intention of leaving .         i don   t need you .  i wouldn   t need you if the tyrannian home fleet were closing in right now and you could blast them out of space for me .         farrill     said jonti     you are talking and acting like an adolescent .  i   ve let you have your say .  may i have mine .         no .  i see no reason to listen to you .         do you see one now .      artemisia screamed .  biron made one movement  then stopped .  red with frustration  he remained tense but helpless .   jonti said     i do take certain precautions .  i am sorry to be so crude as to use a weapon as a threat .  but i imagine it will help me force you to hear me .      the weapon he held was a pocket blaster .  it was not designed to pain or stun .  it killed .     he said     for years i have been organizing lingane against the tyranni .  do you know what that means .  it has not been easy .  it has been almost impossible .  the inner kingdoms will offer no help .  we   ve known that from long experience .  there is no salvation for the nebular kingdoms but what they work out for themselves .  but to convince our native leaders of this is no friendly game .  your father was active in the matter and was killed .  not a friendly game at all .  remember that .      and your father   s capture was a crisis to us .  it was life and horrible death to us .  he was in our inner circles and the tyranni were obviously not far behind us .  they had to be thrown off stride .  to do so  i could scarcely temper my dealings with honor and integrity .  they fry no eggs .      i couldn   t come to you and say     farrill  we   ve got to put the tyranni on a false scent .  you   re the son of the rancher and therefore suspicious .  get out there and be friendly with hinrik of rhodia so that the tyranni may look in the wrong direction .  lead them away from lingane .  it may be dangerous  you may lose your life  but the ideals for which your father died come first .         maybe you would have done it  but i couldn   t afford to experiment .  i maneuvered you into doing it without your knowledge .  it was hard  i   ll grant you .  still  i had no choice .  i thought you might not survive  i tell you that frankly .  but you were expendable  and i tell you that frankly .  as it turned out  you did survive  and i am pleased with that .      and there was one more thing  a matter of a document       biron said     what document .         you jump quickly .  i said your father was working for me .  so i know what he knew .  you were to obtain that document and you were a good choice  at first .  you were on earth legitimately .  you were young and not likely to be suspected .  i say  at first .      but then  with your father arrested  you became dangerous .  you would be an object of prime suspicion to the tyranni  and we could not allow the document to fall into your possession  since it would then almost inevitably fall into theirs .  we had to get you off earth before you could complete your mission .  you see  it all hangs together .         then you have it now .     asked biron .   the autarch said     no  i have not .  a document which might have been  the right one has been missing from earth for years .  if it is the right one  i don   t know who has it .  may i put away the blaster now .  it grows heavy .      biron said     put it away .      the autarch did so .  he said     what has your father told you about the document .         nothing that you don   t know  since he worked for you .      the autarch smiled .     quite so .     but the smile had little of real amusement in it .      are you quite through with your explanation now .         quite through .         then     said biron     get off the ship .      gillbret said     now wait  biron .  there   s more than private pique to be considered here .  there   s artemisia and myself  too  you know .  we have something to say .  as far as i   m concerned  what the autarch says makes sense .  i   ll remind you that on rhodia i saved your life  so i think my    views are to be considered .         all right .  you saved my life     shouted biron .  he pointed a finger towards the air lock .     go with him  then .  go on .  you get out of here too    .  you wanted to find the autarch .  there he is .  i agreed to pilot you to him  and my responsibility is over .  don   t try to tell me what to do .      he turned to artemisia  some of his anger still brimming over .     and what about you .  you saved my life too .  everyone went around saving my life .  do you want to go with him too .      she said calmly     don   t put words into my mouth  biron .  if i wanted to go with him  i   d say so .         don   t feel any obligations .  you can leave any time .      she looked hurt and he turned away .  as usual  some cooler part of himself knew that he was acting childishly .  he had been made to look foolish by jonti and he was helpless in the face of the resentment he felt .  and besides  why should they all take so calmly the thesis that it was perfectly right to have biron farrill thrown to the tyranni  like a bone to the dogs  in order to keep them off jonti   s neck .  damn it  what did they think he was .   he thought of the dud bomb  the rhodian liner  the tyranni  the wild night on rhodia  and he could feel the stinging of self pity inside himself .   the autarch said     well  farrill .      and gillbret said     well  biron .      biron turned to artemisia .     what do you think .      artemisia said calmly     i think he has three ships out there still  and is autarch of lingane  besides .  i don   t think you really have a choice .      the autarch looked at her  and he nodded his admiration .     you are an intelligent girl  my lady .  it is good that such a mind should be in such a pleasant exterior .     for a measurable moment his eyes lingered .   biron said     what   s the deal .         lend me the use of your names and your abilities  and i will take you to what my lord gillbret called the rebellion world .      biron said sourly     you think there is one .      and gillbret said simultaneously     then it is yours .      the autarch smiled .     i think there is a world such as my lord described  but it is not mine .         it   s not yours     said gillbret despondently .     does that matter  if i can find it .         how .     demanded biron .   the autarch said     it is not so difficult as you might think .  if we accept the story as it has been told us  we must believe that there exists a world in rebellion against the tyranni .  we must believe that it is located somewhere in the nebular sector and that in twenty years it has remained undiscovered by the tyranni .  if such a situation is to remain possible  there is only one place in the sector where such a planet can exist .         and where is that .         you do not find the solution obvious .  doesn   t it seem inevitable that the world could exist only within the nebula itself .         inside the nebula .      gillbret said     great galaxy  of course .      and  at the moment  the solution did indeed seem obvious and inescapable .   artemisia said timidly     can people live on worlds inside the nebula .         why not .     said the autarch .     don   t mistake the nebula .  it is a dark mist in space  but it is not a poison gas .  it is an incredibly attenuated mass of sodium  potassium  and calcium atoms that absorb and obscure the light of the stars within it  and  of course  those on the side directly opposite the observer .  otherwise  it is harmless  and  in the direct neighborhood of a star  virtually undetectable .      i apologize if i seem pedantic  but i have spent the last several months at the university of earth collecting astronomical data on the nebula .         why there .     said biron .     it is a matter of little importance  but i met you there and i am curious .         there   s no mystery to it .  i left lingane originally on my own business .  the exact nature is of no importance .  about six months ago i visited rhodia .  my agent  widemos  your father  biron  had been unsuccessful in his negotiations with the director  whom we had hoped to swing to our side .  i tried to improve matters and failed  since hinrik  with apologies to the lady  is not the type of material for our sort of work .         hear  hear     muttered biron .   the autarch continued .     but i did meet gillbret  as he may have told you .  so i went to earth  because earth is the original home of humanity .  it was from earth that most of the original explorations of the galaxy set out .  it is upon earth that most of the records exist .  the horsehead nebula was explored quite thoroughly  at least  it was passed through a number of times .  it was never settled  since the difficulties of traveling through a volume of space where stellar observations could not be made were too great .  the explorations themselves  however  were all i needed .      now listen carefully .  the tyrannian ship upon which my lord gillbret was marooned was struck by a meteor after its first jump .  assuming that the trip from tyrann to rhodia was along the usual trade route  and there is no reason to suppose anything else  the point in space at which the ship left its route is established .  it would scarcely have traveled more than half a million miles in ordinary space between the first two jumps .  we can consider such a length as a point in space .      it is possible to make another assumption .  in damaging the control panels  it was quite possible that the meteor might have altered the direction of the jumps  since that would require only an interference with the motion of the ship   s gyroscope .  this would be difficult but not impossible .  to change the power of the hyperatomic thrusts  however  would require complete smashing of the engines  which  of course  were not touched by the meteor .      with unchanged power of thrust  the length of the four remaining jumps would not be changed  nor  for that matter  would their relative directions .  it would be analogous to having a long  crooked wire bent at a single point in an unknown direction through an unknown angle .  the final position of the ship would lie somewhere on the surface of an imaginary sphere  the center of which would be that point in space where the meteor struck  and the radius of which would be the vector sum of the remaining jumps .      i plotted such a sphere  and that surface intersects a thick extension of the horsehead nebula .  some six thousand square degrees of the sphere   s surface  one fourth of the total surface  lies in the nebula .  it remains  therefore  only to find a star lying within the nebula and within one million miles or so of the imaginary surface we are discussing .  you will remember that when gillbret   s ship came to rest  it was within reach of a star .      now how many stars within the nebula do you suppose we can find that close to the sphere   s surface .  remember there are one hundred billion radiating stars in the galaxy .      biron found himself absorbed in the matter almost against his will .     hundreds  i suppose .         five .     replied the autarch .     just five .  don   t be fooled by the one hundred billion figure .  the galaxy is about seven trillion cubic light years in volume  so that there are seventy cubic light years per star on the average .  it is a pity that i do not know which of those five have habitable planets .  we might reduce the number of possibles to one .  unfortunately  the early explorers had no time for detailed observations .  they plotted the positions of the stars  the proper motions  and the spectral types .         so that in one of those five stellar system     said biron     is located the rebellion world .         only that conclusion would fit the facts we know .         assuming oil   s story can be accepted .         i make that assumption .         my story is true     interrupted gillbret intensely .     i swear it .         i am about to leave     said the autarch     to investigate each of the five worlds .  my motives in doing so are obvious .  as autarch of lingane i can take an equal part in their efforts .         and with two hinriads and a widemos on your side  your bid for an equal part  and  presumably  a strong and secure position in the new  free worlds to come  would be so much the better     said biron .      your cynicism doesn   t frighten me  farrill .  the answer is obviously yes .  if there is to be a successful rebellion  it would  again obviously  be desirable to have your fist on the winning side .         otherwise some successful privateer or rebel captain might be rewarded with the autarchy of lingane .         or the ranchy of widemos .  exactly .         and if the rebellion is not successful .         there will be time to judge of that when we find what we look for .      biron said slowly     i   ll go with you .         good .  then suppose we make arrangements for your transfer from this ship .         why that .         it would be better for you .  this ship is a toy .         it is a tyrannian warship .  we would be wrong in abandoning it .         as a tyrannian warship  it would be dangerously conspicuous .         not in the nebula .  i   m sorry  jonti .  i   m joining you out of expedience .  i can be frank too .  i want to find the rebellion world .  but there   s no friendship between us .  i stay at my own controls .         biron     said artemisia gently     the ship is too small for the three of us .         as it stands  yes  arta .  but it can be fitted with a trailer .  jonti knows that as well as i do .  we   d have all the space we needed then  and still be masters at our own controls .  and  for that matter  it would effectively disguise the nature of the ship .      the autarch considered .     if there is to be neither friendship nor trust  farrill  i must protect myself .  you may have your own ship and a trailer to boot  outfitted as you may wish .  but i must have some guarantee for your proper behavior .  the lady artemisia  at least  must come with me .         no .     said biron .   the autarch lifted his eyebrows .     no .  let the lady speak .      he turned toward artemisia  and his nostrils flared slightly .     i dare say you would find the situation very comfortable  my lady .         you  at least  would not find it comfortable  my lord .  be assured of that     she retorted .     i would spare you the discomfort and remain here .         i think you might reconsider if      began the autarch  as two little wrinkles at the bridge of his nose marred the serenity of his expression .      i think not     interrupted biron .     the lady artemisia has made her choice .         and you back her choice then  farrill .     the autarch was smiling again .      entirely .  all three of us will remain on the remorseless .  there will be no compromise on that .         you choose your company oddly .         do i .         i think so .     the autarch seemed idly absorbed in his fingernails .     you seem so annoyed with me because i deceived you and placed your life in danger .  it is strange  then  is it not  that you should seem on such friendly terms with the daughter of a man such as hinrik  who in deception is certainly my master .         i know hinrik .  your opinions of him change nothing .         you know everything about hinrik .         i know enough .         do you know that he killed your father .     the autarch   s finger stabbed toward artemisia .     do you know that the girl you are so deeply concerned to keep under your protection is the daughter of your father   s murderer .        fourteen     the autarch leaves    the tableau remained unbroken for a moment .  the autarch had lit another cigarette .  he was quite relaxed  his face untroubled .  gillbret had folded into the pilot   s seat  his face screwed up as though he were going to burst into tears .  the limp straps of the pilot   s stress absorbing outfit dangled about him and increased the lugubrious effect .   biron  paper white  fists clenched  faced the autarch .  artemisia  her thin nostrils flaring  kept her eyes not on the autarch  but on biron only .   the radio signaled  the soft clickings crashing with the effect of cymbals in the small pilot room .   gillbret jerked upright  then whirled on the seat .   the autarch said lazily     i   m afraid we   ve been more talkative than i   d anticipated .  i told rizzett to come get me if i had not returned in an hour .      the visual screen was alive now with rizzett   s grizzled head .   and then gillbret said to the autarch     he would like to speak to you .     he made room .   the autarch rose from his chair and advanced so that his own head was within the zone of visual transmission .   he said     i am perfectly safe  rizzett .      the other   s question was heard clearly     who are the crew members on the cruiser  sir .      and suddenly biron stood next to the autarch .     i am rancher of widemos     he said proudly .   rizzett smiled gladly and broadly .  a hand appeared on the screen in sharp salute .     greetings  sir .      the autarch interrupted .     i will be returning soon with a young lady .  prepare to maneuver for contact air locks .     and he broke the visual connection between the two ships .   he turned to biron .    i assured them it was you on board ship .  there was some objection to my coming here alone otherwise .  your father was extremely popular with my men .         which is why you can use my name .      the autarch shrugged .   biron said     it is all you can use .  your last statement to your officer was inaccurate .         in what way .         artemisia oth hinriad stays with me .         still .  after what i have told you .      biron said sharply     you have told me nothing .  you have made a bare statement  but i am not likely to take your unsupported word for anything .  i tell you this without any attempt at tact .  i hope you understand me .         is your knowledge of hinrik such that my statement seems inherently implausible to you .      biron was staggered .  visibly and apparently  the remark had struck home .  he made no answer .   artemisia said     i say it   s not so .  do you have proof .         no direct proof  of course .  i was not present at any conferences between your father and the tyranni .  but i can present certain known facts and allow you to make your own inferences .  first  the old rancher of widemos visited hinrik six months ago .  i   ve said that already .  i can add here that he was somewhat overenthusiastic in his efforts  or perhaps he overestimated hinrik   s discretion .  at any rate  he talked more than he should have .  my lord gillbret can verify that .      gillbret nodded miserably .  he turned to artemisia  who had turned to him with moist and angry eyes .     i   m sorry  arta  but it   s true .  i   ve told you this .  it was from widemos that i heard about the autarch .      the autarch said     and it was fortunate for myself that my lord had developed such long mechanical ears with which to sate his lively curiosity concerning the director   s meetings of state .  i was warned of the danger  quite unwittingly  by gillbret when he first approached me .  i left as soon as i could  but the damage  of course  had been done .      now  to our knowledge  it was widemos   s only slip  and hinrik  certainly  has no enviable reputation as a man of any great independence and courage .  your father  farrill  was arrested within half a year .  if not through hinrik  through this girl   s father  then how .      biron said     you did not warn him .         in our business we take our chances  farrill  but he was warned .  after that he made no contact  however indirect  with any of us  and destroyed whatever proof he had of connection with us .  some among us believed that he should leave the sector  or  at the very least  go into hiding .  he refused to do this .      i think i can understand why .  to alter his way of life would prove the truth of what the tyranni must have learned  endanger the entire movement .  he decided to risk his own life only .  he remained in the open .      for nearly half a year the tyranni waited for a betraying gesture .  they are patient  the tyranni .  none came  so that when they could wait no longer  they found nothing in their net but him .         it   s a lie     cried artemisia .     it   s all a lie .  it   s a smug  sanctimonious  lying story with no truth in it .  if all you said were true  they would be watching you too .  you would be in danger yourself .  you wouldn   t be sitting here  smiling and wasting time .         my lady  i do not waste my time .  i have already tried to do what i could toward discrediting your father as a source of information .  i think i have succeeded somewhat .  the tyranni will wonder if they ought to listen further to a man whose daughter and cousin are obvious traitors .  and then again  if they are still disposed to believe him  why  i am on the point of vanishing into the nebula where they will not find me .  i should think my actions tend to prove my story rather than otherwise .      biron drew a deep breath and said     let us consider the interview at an end  jonti .  we have agreed to the extent that we will accompany you and that you will grant us needed supplies .  that is enough .  granting that all you have just said is truth  it is still beside the point .  the crimes of the director of rhodia are not inherited by his daughter .  artemisia oth hinriad stays here with me  provided she herself agrees .         i do     said artemisia .      good .  i think that covers everything .  i warn you  by the way .  you are armed  so am i .  your ships are fighters  perhaps  mine is a tyrannian cruiser .         don   t be silly  farrill .  my intentions are quite friendly .  you wish to keep the girl here .  so be it .  may i leave by contact air lock .      biron nodded .     we will trust you so far .        the two ships maneuvered ever closer  until the flexible airlock extensions pouted outward toward one another .  carefully  they edged about  trying for the perfect fit .  gillbret hung upon the radio .      they   ll be trying for contact again in two minutes     he said .   three times already the magnetic field had been triggered  and each time the extending tubes had stretched toward one another and met off center  gaping crescents of space between them .      two minutes     repeated biron  and waited tensely .   the second hand moved and the magnetic field clicked into existence a fourth time  the lights dimming as the motors adjusted to the sudden drain of power .  again the airlock extensions reached out  hovered on the brink of instability  and then  with a noiseless jar  the vibration of which hummed its way into the pilot room  settled into place properly  clamps automatically locking in position .  an air tight seal had been formed .   biron drew the back of his hand slowly across his forehead and some of the tension oozed out of him .      there it is     he said .   the autarch lifted his space suit .  there was still a thin film of moisture under it .      thanks     he said pleasantly .     an officer of mine will be right back .  you will arrange the details of the supplies necessary with him .      the autarch left .   biron said     take care of jonti   s officer for me for a while  will you  oil .  when he comes in  break the air lock contact .  all you   ll have to do is remove the magnetic field .  this is the photonic switch you   ll flash .      he turned and stepped out of the pilot room .  right now he needed time for himself .  time to think  mostly .   but there was the hurried footstep behind him  and the soft voice .  he stopped .      biron     said artemisia     i want to speak to you .      he faced her .     later  if you don   t mind  arta .      she was looking up at him intently .     no  now .      her arms were poised as though she would have liked to embrace him but was not sure of her reception .  she said     you didn   t believe what he said about my father .         it has no bearing     said biron .     biron     she began  and stopped .  it was hard for her to say it .  she tried again     biron  i know that part of what has been going on between us has been because we   ve been alone and together and in danger  but      she stopped again .   biron said     if you   re trying to say you   re a hinriad  arta  there   s no need .  i know it .  i won   t hold you to anything afterward .         no .  oh no .     she caught his arm and placed her cheek against his hard shoulder .  she was speaking rapidly .     that   s not it at all .  it doesn   t matter about hinriad and widemos at all .  i  i love you  biron .      her eyes went up  meeting his .     i think you love me too .  i think you would admit it if you could forget that i am a hinriad .  maybe you will now that i   ve said it first .  you told the autarch you would not hold my father   s deeds against me .  don   t hold his rank against me  either .      her arms were around his neck now .  biron could feel the softness of her breasts against him and the warmth of her breath on his lips .  slowly his own hands went upward and gently grasped her forearms .  as gently  he disengaged her arms and  still as gently  stepped back from her .   he said     i am not quits with the hinriads  my lady .      she was startled .     you told the autarch that       he looked away .     sorry  arta .  don   t go by what i told the autarch .      she wanted to cry out that it wasn   t true  that her father had not done this thing  that in any case    but he turned into the cabin and left her standing in the corridor  her eyes filling with hurt and shame .     fifteen     the hole in space    tedor rizzett turned as biron entered the pilot room again .  his hair was gray  but his body was still vigorous and his face was broad  red  and smiling .   he covered the distance between himself and biron in a stride and seized the young man   s hand heartily .      by the stars     he said     i   d need no word from you to tell me that you are your father   s son .  it is the old rancher alive again .         i wish it were     said biron  somberly .   rizzett   s smile faltered .     so do we all .  every one of us .  i   m tedor rizzett  by the way .  i   m a colonel in the regular linganian forces  but we don   t use titles in our own little game .  we even say    sir    to the autarch .  that reminds me .     he looked grave .     we don   t have lords and ladies or even ranchers on lingane .  i hope i won   t offend if i forget to throw in the proper title sometimes .      biron shrugged .     as you said  no titles in our little game .  but what about the trailer .  i   m to make arrangements with you  i take it .      for a flickering moment he looked across the room .  gillbret was seated  quietly listening .  artemisia had her back to him .  her slim  pale fingers wove an abstracted pattern on the photocontacts of the computer .  rizzett   s voice brought him back .   the linganian had cast an all inclusive glance about the room .     first time i   ve ever seen a tyrannian vessel from the inside .  don   t care much for it .  now you   ve got the emergency air lock due stern  haven   t you .  it seems to me the power thrusters girdle the midsection .         that   s right .         good .  then there won   t be any trouble .  some of the old model ships had power thrusters due stern  so that trailers had to be set off at an angle .  this makes the gravity adjustment difficult and the maneuverability in atmospheres just about nil .         how long will it take  rizzett .         not long .  how big would you want it .         how big could you get it .         super deluxe .  sure .  if the autarch says so  there   s no higher priority .  we can get one that   s practically a space ship in itself .  it would even have auxiliary motors .         it would have living quarters  i suppose .         for miss hinriad .  it would be considerably better than you have here      he stopped abruptly .   at the mention of her name  artemisia had drifted past coldly and slowly  moving out of the pilot room .  biron   s eyes followed her .   rizzett said     i shouldn   t have said miss hinriad  i suppose .         no  no .  it   s nothing .  pay no attention .  you were saying .         oh  about the rooms .  at least two sizable ones  with a  communicating shower .  it   s got the usual closet room and plumbing arrangements of the big liners .  she would be comfortable .         good .  we   ll need food and water .         sure .  water tank will hold a two months    supply  a little less if you want to arrange for a swimming pool aboard ship .  and you would have frozen whole meats .  you   re eating tyrannian concentrate now  aren   t you .      biron nodded and rizzett grimaced .      it tastes like chopped sawdust  doesn   t it .  what else .         a supply of clothes for the lady     said biron .   rizzett wrinkled his forehead .     yes  of course .  well  that will be her job .         no  sir  it won   t .  we   ll supply you with all the necessary measurements and you can supply us with whatever we ask for in whatever the current styles happen to be .      rizzett laughed shortly and shook his head .     rancher  she won   t like that .  she wouldn   t be satisfied with any clothes she didn   t pi  k .  not even if they were the identical items she would have picked if she had been given the chance .  this isn   t a guess  now .  i   ve had experience with the creatures .      biron said     i   m sure you   re right  rizzett .  but that   s the way it will have to be .         all right  but i   ve warned you .  it will be your argument .  what else .         little things .  little things .  a supply of detergents .  oh yes  cosmetics  perfume  the things women need .  we   ll make the arrangements in time .  let   s get the trailer started .      and now gillbret was leaving without speaking .  biron   s eyes followed him  too  and he felt his jaw muscles tighten .  hinriads .  they were hinriads .  there was nothing he could do about it .  they were hinriads .  gillbret was one and she was another .   he said     and  of course  there   ll be clothes for mr .  hinriad and myself .  that won   t be very important .         right .  mind if i use your radio .  i   d better stay on this ship till the adjustments are made .      biron waited while the initial orders went out .  then rizzett turned on the seat and said     i can   t get used to seeing you here  moving  talking  alive .  you   re so like him .  the rancher used to speak about you every once in a while .  you went to school on earth  didn   t you .         i did .  i would have graduated a little over a week ago  if things hadn   t been interrupted .      rizzett looked uncomfortable .     look  about your being sent to rhodia the way you were .  you mustn   t hold it against us .  we didn   t like it .  i mean  this is strictly between us  but some of the boys didn   t like it at all .  the autarch didn   t consult us  of course .  naturally  he wouldn   t .  frankly  it was a risk on his part .  some of us  i   m not mentioning names  even wondered if we shouldn   t stop the liner you were on and pull you off .  naturally that would have been the worst thing we could possibly have done .  still  we might have done it  except that in the last analysis  we knew that the autarch must have known what he was doing .         it   s nice to be able to inspire that kind of confidence .         we know him .  there   s no denying it .  he   s got it here .     a finger slowly tapped his forehead .     nobody knows exactly what makes him take a certain course sometimes .  but it always seems the right one .  at least he   s outsmarted the tyranni so far and others don   t .         like my father  for instance .         i wasn   t thinking of him  exactly  but in a sense  you   re right .  even the rancher was caught .  but then he was a different kind of man .  his way of thinking was straight .  he would never allow for crookedness .  he would always underestimate the worthlessness of the next man .  but then again  that was what we liked best  somehow .  he was the same to everyone  you know .      i   m a commoner for all i   m a colonel .  my father was a metalworker  you see .  it didn   t make any difference to him .  and it wasn   t that i was a colonel  either .  if he met the engineer   s    prentice walking down the corridor  he   d step aside and say a pleasant word or two  and for the rest of the day  the    prentice would feel like a master engineman .  it was the way he had .      not that he was soft .  if you needed disciplining  you got it  but no more than your share .  what you got  you deserved  and you knew it .  when he was through  he was through .  he didn   t keep throwing it at you at odd moments for a week or so .  that was the rancher .      now the autarch  he   s different .  he   s just brains .  you can   t get next to him  no matter who you are .  for instance .  he doesn   t really have a sense of humor .  i can   t speak to him the way i   m speaking to you right now .  right now  i   m just talking .  i   m relaxed .  it   s almost free association .  with him  you say exactly what   s on your mind with no spare words .  and you use formal phraseology  or he   ll tell you you   re slovenly .  but then  the autarch   s the autarch  and that   s that .      biron said     i   ll have to agree with you as far as the autarch   s brains are concerned .  did you know that he had deduced my presence aboard this ship before he ever got on .         he did .  we didn   t know that .  now  there  that   s what i mean .  he was going to go aboard the tyrannian cruiser alone .  to us  it seemed suicide .  we didn   t like it .  but we assumed he knew what he was doing  and he did .  he could have told us you were probably aboard ship .  he must have known it would be great news that the rancher   s son had escaped .  but it   s typical .  he wouldn   t .        artemisia sat on one of the lower bunks in the cabin .  she had to bend into an uncomfortable position to avoid having the frame of the second bunk pry into her first thoracic vertebra  but that was a small item to her at the moment .   almost automatically  she kept passing the palms of her hands down the side of her dress .  she felt frayed and dirty  and very tired .   she was tired of dabbing at her hands and face with damp napkins .  she was tired of wearing the same clothes for a week .  she was tired of hair which seemed dank and stringy by now .   and then she was almost on her feet again  ready to turn about sharply  she wasn   t going to see him  she wouldn   t look at him .   but it was only gillbret .  she sank down again .     hello  uncle oil .      gillbret sat down opposite her .  for a moment his thin face seemed anxious and then it started wrinkling into a smile .     i think a week of this ship is very unamusing too .  i was hoping you could cheer me up .      but she said     now  uncle oil  don   t start using psychology on me .  if you think you   re going to cajole me into feeling a responsibility for you  you   re wrong .  i   m much more likely to hit you .         if it will make you feel better          i warn you again .  if you hold out your arm for me to hit  i   ll do it  and if you say    does that make you feel better .     i   ll do it again .         in any case  it   s obvious you   ve quarreled with biron .  what about .         i don   t see why there   s any necessity for discussion .  just leave me alone .     then  after a pause     he thinks father did what the autarch said he did .  i hate him for that .         your father .         no .  that stupid  childish  sanctimonious fool .         presumably biron .  good .  you hate him .  you couldn   t put a knife edge between the kind of hate that has you sitting here like this and something that would seem to my own bachelor mind to be a rather ridiculous excess of love .         uncle oil     she said     could he really have done it .         biron .  done what .         no .  father .  could father have done it .  could he have informed against the rancher .      gillbret looked thoughtful and very sober .     i don   t know .     he looked at her out of the corner of his eyes .     you know  he did give biron up to the tyranni .         because he knew it was a trap     she said vehemently .     and it was .  that horrible autarch meant it as such .  he said so .  the tyranni knew who biron was and sent him to father on purpose .  father did the only thing he could do .  that should be obvious to anybody .         even if we accept that     and again that sideways look      he did try to argue you into a rather unamusing kind of marriage .  if hinrik could bring himself to do that       she interrupted .     he had no way out there  either .         my dear  if you   re going to excuse every act of subservience to the tyranni as something he had to do  why  then  how do you know he didn   t have to hint something about the rancher to the tyranni .         because i   m sure he wouldn   t .  you don   t know father the way i do .  he hates the tyranni .  he does .  i know it .  he wouldn   t go out of his way to help them .  i admit that he   s afraid of them and doesn   t dare oppose them openly  but if he could avoid it somehow  he would never help them .          how do you know he could avoid it .      but she shook her head violently  so that her hair tumbled about and hid her eyes .  it hid the tears a bit too .   gillbret watched a moment  then spread his hands helplessly and left .     the trailer was joined to the remorseless by a waspwaist corridor attached to the emergency air lock in the rear of the ship .  it was several dozen times larger than the tyranni vessel in capacity  almost humorously outsized .   the autarch joined biron in a last inspection .  he said     do you find anything lacking .      biron said     no .  i think we   ll be quite comfortable .         good .  and by the way  rizzett tells me the lady artemisia is not well  or at least that she looks unwell .  if she requires medical attention  it might be wise to send her to my ship .         she is quite well     said biron curtly .      if you say so .  would you be ready to leave in twelve hours .         in two hours  if you wish .      biron passed through the connecting corridor  he had to stoop a little  into the remorseless proper .   he said with a careful evenness of tone     you   ve got a private suite back there  artemisia .  i won   t bother you .  i   ll stay here most of the time .      and she replied coldly     you don   t bother me  rancher .  it doesn   t matter to me where you are .        and then the ships blasted off  and after a single jump they found themselves at the edge of the nebula .  they waited for a few hours while the final calculations were made on jonti   s ship .  inside the nebula it would be almost blind navigation .   biron stared glumly at the visiplate .  there was nothing there .  one entire half of the celestial sphere was taken up with blackness  unrelieved by a spark of light .  for the first time  biron realized how warm and friendly the stars were  how they filled space .      it   s like dropping through a hole in space     he muttered to gillbret .   and then they jumped again  into the nebula .   almost simultaneously simok aratap  commissioner of the great khan  at the head of ten armed cruisers  listened to his navigator and said     that doesn   t matter .  follow them anyway .      and not one light year from the point at which the remorseless entered the nebula  ten tyranni vessels did likewise .     sixteen     hounds .     simok aratap was a little uncomfortable in his uniform .  tyrannian uniforms were made of moderately coarse materials and fit only indifferently well .  it was not soldier like to complain of such inconveniences .  in fact  it was part of the tyrannian military tradition that a little discomfort on the part of the soldier was good for discipline .   but still aratap could bring himself to rebel against that tradition to the extent of saying  ruefully     the tight collar irritates my neck .      major andros  whose collar was as tight  and who had been seen in no other than military dress in the memory of man  said     when alone  it would be quite within regulations to open it .  before any of the officers or men  any deviation from regulation dress would be disturbing influence .      aratap sniffed .  it was the second change induced by the quasi military nature of the expedition .  in addition to being forced into uniform  he had to listen to an increasingly self assertive military aide .  that had begun even before they left rhodia .   andros had put it to him baldly .   he had said     commissioner  we will need ten ships .      aratap had looked up  definitely annoyed .  at the moment he was getting ready to follow the young widemos in a single vessel .  he laid aside the capsules in which he was preparing his report for the khan   s colonial bureau  to be forwarded in the unhappy case that he did not return from the expedition .      ten ships  major .         yes  sir .  less will not do .         why not .         i intend to maintain a reasonable security .  the young man is going somewhere .  you say there is a well developed conspiracy in existence .  presumably  the two fit together .         and therefore .         and therefore we must be prepared for a possibly well developed conspiracy .  one that might be able to handle a single ship .         or ten .  or a hundred .  where does security cease .         one must make a decision .  in cases of military action  it is my responsibility .  i suggest ten .      aratap   s contact lenses gleamed unnaturally in the wall light as he raised his eyebrows .  the military carried weight .  theoretically  in times of peace  the civilian made the decisions  but here again  military tradition was a difficult thing to set aside .   he said cautiously     i will consider the matter .         thank you .  if you do not choose to accept my recommendations  and my suggestions have only been advanced as such  i assure you     the major   s heels clicked sharply  but the ceremonial deference was rather empty  and aratap knew it     that would be your privilege .  you would leave me  however  no choice but to resign my commission .      it was up to aratap to retrieve what he could from that position .  he said     it is not my intention to hamper you in any decision you may make on a purely military question  major .  i wonder if you might be as amenable to my decisions in matters of purely political importance .         what matters are these .         there is the problem of hinrik .  you objected yesterday to my suggestion that he accompany us .      the major said dryly     i consider it unnecessary .  with our forces in action  the presence of outlanders would be bad for morale .      aratap sighed softly  just below the limits of hearing .  yet andros was a competent man in his way .  there would be no use in displaying impatience .   he said     again  i agree with you .  i merely ask you to consider the political aspects of the situation .  as you know  the execution of the old rancher of widemos was politically uncomfortable .  it stirred up the kingdoms unnecessarily .  however necessary the execution was  it makes it desirable to refrain from having the death of the son attributed to us .  as far as the people of rhodia know  the young widemos has kidnapped the daughter of the director  the girl  by the way  being a popular and much publicized member of the hinriads .  it would be quite fitting  quite understandable  to have the director head the punitive expedition .      it would be a dramatic move  very gratifying to rhodian patriotism .  naturally  he would ask for tyrannian assistance  and receive it  but that can be played down .  it would be easy  and necessary  to fix this expedition in the popular mind as a rhodian one .  if the inner workings of the conspiracy are uncovered  it will have been a rhodian discovery .  if the young widemos is executed  it would be a rhodian execution  as far as the other kingdoms are concerned .      the major said     it would still be a bad precedent to allow rhodian vessels to accompany a tyrannian military expedition .  they would hamper us in a fight .  in that way  the question becomes a military one .         i did not say  my dear major  that hinrik would command a ship .  surely you know him better than to think him capable of commanding or even anxious to try .  he will stay with us .  there will be no other rhodian aboard ship .         in that case  i waive my objection  commissioner     said the major .     the tyrannian fleet had maintained their position two light years off lingane for the better part of a week and the situation was becoming increasingly unstable .   major andros advocated an immediate landing on lingane .     the autarch of lingane     he said     has gone to considerable lengths to have us think him a friend of the khan  but i do not trust these men who travel abroad .  they gain unsettling notions .  it is strange that just as he returns  the young widemos travels to meet him .         he has not tried to hide either his travels or his return  major .  and we do not know that widemos goes to meet him .  he maintains an orbit about lingane .  why does he not land .         why does he maintain an orbit .  let us question what he does and not what he does not do .         i can propose something which will fit the pattern .         i would be glad to hear it .      aratap placed a finger inside his collar and tried futilely to stretch it .  he said     since the young man is waiting  we can presume he is waiting for something or somebody .  it would be ridiculous to think that  having gone to lingane by so direct and rapid a route  a single jump  in fact that he is merely waiting out of indecision .  i say  then  that he is waiting for a friend or friends to reach him .  thus reinforced  he will proceed elsewhere .  the fact that he is not landing on lingane directly would indicate that he does not consider such an action safe .  that would indicate that lingane in general  the autarch in particular  is not concerned in the conspiracy  although individual linganians may be .         i don   t know if we can always trust the obvious solution to be the correct one .         my dear major  this is not merely an obvious solution .  it is a logical one .  it fits a pattern         maybe it does .  but just the same  if there are no further developments in twenty four hours  i will have no choice but to order an advance linganeward .        aratap frowned at the door through which the major had left .  it was disturbing to have to control at once the restless conquered and the short sighted conquerors .  twenty four hours .  something might happen  otherwise he might have to find some way of stopping andros .   the door signal sounded and aratap looked up with irritation .  surely it could not be andros returning .  it wasn   t .  the tall  stooped form of hinrik of rhodia was in the doorway  behind him a glimpse of the guard who accompanied him everywhere on the ship .  theoretically  hinrik had complete freedom of movement .  probably he himself thought he had .  at least  he never paid any attention to the guard at his elbow .   hinrik smiled mistily .     am i disturbing you  commissioner .         not at all .  take a seat  director .     aratap remained standing .  hinrik seemed not to notice that .   hinrik said     i have something of importance to discuss with you .     he paused  and some of the intentness passed out of his eyes .  he added in quite a different tone     what a large  fine ship this is .         thank you  director .     aratap smiled tightly .  the nine accompanying ships were typically minute in size  but the flagship on which they stood was an outsized model adapted from the designs of the defunct rhodian navy .  it was perhaps the first sign of the gradual softening of the tyrannian military spirit that more and more of such ships were being added to the navy .  the fighting unit was still the tiny two to three man cruiser  but increasing the top brass found reasons for requiring large ships for their own headquarters .   it did not bother aratap .  to some of the older soldiers such increasing softness seemed a degeneration  to himself it seemed increasing civilization .  in the end  in centuries  perhaps  it might even happen that the tyranni would melt away as a single people  fusing with the present conquered societies of the nebular kingdoms  and perhaps even that might be a good thing .   naturally  he never expressed such an opinion aloud .      i came to tell you something     said hinrik .  he puzzled over it awhile  then added     i have sent a message home today to my people .  i have told them i am well and that the criminal will be shortly seized and my daughter returned to safety .         good     said aratap .  it was not news to him .  he himself had written the message  though it was not impossible that hinrik by now had persuaded himself that he was the writer  or even that he actually headed the expedition .  aratap felt a twinge of pity .  the man was disintegrating visibly .   hinrik said     my people  i believe  are quite disturbed over this daring raid upon the palace by these well organized bandits .  i think they will be proud of their director now that i have taken such rapid action in response  eh  commissioner .  they will see that there is still force among the hinriads .     he seemed filled with a feeble triumph .      i think they will     said aratap .      are we within range of the enemy yet .         no  director  the enemy remains where he was  just off lingane .         still .  i remember what i came to tell you .     he grew excited  so that the words tumbled out .     it is very important  commissioner .  i have something to tell you .  there is treachery on board .  i have discovered it .  we must take quick action .  treachery      he was whispering .   aratap felt impatient .  it was necessary to humor the poor idiot of course  but this was becoming a waste of time .  at this rate he would become so obviously mad that he would be useless even as a puppet  which would be a pity .   he said     no treachery  director .  our men are stanch and true .  someone has been misleading you .  you are tired .         no  no .     hinrik put aside aratap   s arm which  for a moment  had rested upon his shoulder .     where are we .         why  here .         the ship  i mean .  i have watched the visiplate .  we are near no star .  we are in deep space .  did you know that .         why  certainly .         lingane is nowhere near .  did you know that .         it is two light years off .         ah .  ah .  ah .  commissioner  no one is listening .  are you sure .     he leaned closely  while aratap allowed his ear to be approached .     then how do we know the enemy is near lingane .  he is too far to detect .  we are being misinformed  and this signifies treachery .      well  the man might be mad  but the point was a good one .  aratap said     this is something fit for technical men  director  and not for men of rank to concern themselves with .  i scarcely know myself .         but as head of the expedition i should know .  i am head  am i not .     he looked about carefully .     actually  i have a feeling that major andros does not always carry out my orders .  is he trustworthy .  of course  i rarely give him orders .  it would seem strange to order a tyrannian officer .  but then  i must find my daughter .  my daughter   s name is artemisia .  she has been taken from me  and i am taking all this fleet to get her back .  so you see  i must know .  i mean  i must know how it is known the enemy is at lingane .  my daughter would be there too .  do you know my daughter .  her name is artemisia .      his eyes looked up at the tyranni commissioner in appeal .  then he covered them with his hand and mumbled something that sounded like    i   m sorry .      aratap felt his jaw muscles clench .  it was difficult to remember that the man before him was a bereaved father and that even the idiot director of rhodia might have a father   s feelings .  he could not let the man suffer .   he said gently     i will try to explain .  you know there is such a thing as a massometer which will detect ships in space .         yes  yes .         it is sensitive to gravitational effects .  you know what i mean .         oh yes .  everything has gravity .     hinrik was leaning toward aratap  his hands gripping one another nervously .      that   s good enough .  now naturally the massometer can only be used when the ship is close  you know .  less than a million miles away or so .  also  it has to be a reasonable distance from any planet  because if it isn   t  all you can detect is the planet  which is much bigger .         and has much more gravity .         exactly     said aratap  and hinrik looked pleased .   aratap went on .     we tyranni have another device .  it is a transmitter which radiates through hyperspace in all directions  and what it radiates is a particular type of distortion of the space fabric which is not electromagnetic in character .  in other words  it isn   t like light or radio or even sub etheric radio .  see .      hinrik didn   t answer .  he looked confused .   aratap proceeded quickly .     well  it   s different .  it doesn   t matter how .  we can detect that something which is radiated  so that we can always know where any tyrannian ship is  even if it   s halfway across the galaxy  or on the other side of a star .      hinrik nodded solemnly .      now     said aratap     if the young widemos had escaped in an ordinary ship  it would have been very difficult to locate him .  as it is  since he took a tyrannian cruiser  we know where he is at all times  although he doesn   t realize that .  that is how we know he is near lingane  you see .  and  what   s more  he can   t get away  so that we will certainly rescue your daughter .      hinrik smiled .     that is well done .  i congratulate you  commissioner .  a very clever ruse .      aratap did not delude himself .  hinrik understood very little of what he had said  but that did not matter .  it had ended with the assurance of his daughter   s rescue  and somewhere in his dim understanding there must be the realization that this  somehow  was made possible by tyrannian science .   he told himself that he had not gone to this trouble entirely because the rhodian appealed to his sense of the pathetic .  he had to keep the man from breaking down altogether for obvious political reasons .  perhaps the return of his daughter would improve matters .  he hoped so .   there was the door signal again and this time it was major andros who entered .  hinrik   s arm stiffened on the armrest of his chair and his face assumed a hunted expression .  he lifted himself and began     major andro       but andros was already speaking quickly  disregarding the rhodian .      commissioner     he said     the remorseless has changed position .         surely he has not landed on lingane     said aratap sharply .      no     said the major .     he has jumped quite away from lingane .         ah .  good .  he has been joined by another ship  perhaps .         by many ships  perhaps .  we can detect only his  as you are quite aware .         in any case  we follow again .         the order has already been given .  i would merely like to point out that his jump has taken him to the edge of the horsehead nebula .         what .         no major planetary system exists in the indicated direction .  there is only one logical conclusion .      aratap moistened his lips and left hurriedly for the pilot room  the major with him .   hinrik remained standing in the middle of the suddenly empty room  looking at the door for a minute or so .  then  with a little shrug of the shoulders  he sat down again .  his expression was blank  and for a long while he simply sat .     the navigator said     the space co ordinates of the remorseless have been checked  sir .  they are definitely inside the nebula .         that doesn   t matter     said aratap .     follow them anyway .      he turned to major andros .     so you see the virtues of waiting .  there is a good deal that is obvious now .  wherever else could the conspirators    headquarters be but in the nebula itself .  where else could we have failed to locate them .  a very pretty pattern .      and so the squadron entered the nebula .     for the twentieth time aratap glanced automatically at the visiplate .  actually  the glances were useless  since the visiplate remained quite black .  there was no star in sight .   andros said     that   s their third stop without landing .  i don   t understand it .  what is their purpose .  what are they after .  each stop of theirs is several days long .  yet they do not land .         it may take them that long     said aratap     to calculate their next jump .  visibility is nonexistent .         you think so .         no .  their jumps are too good .  each time they land very near a star .  they couldn   t do as well by massometer data alone  unless they actually knew the locations of the stars in advance .         then why don   t they land .         i think     said aratap     they must be looking for habitable planets .  maybe they themselves do not know the location of the center of conspiracy .  or  at least  not entirely .     he smiled .     we need only follow .      the navigator clicked heels .     sir .         yes .     aratap looked up .      the enemy has landed on a planet .      aratap signaled for major andros .      andros     said aratap  as the major entered     have you been told .         yes .  i   ve ordered a descent and pursuit .         wait .  you may be again premature  as when you wanted to lunge toward lingane .  i think this ship only ought to go .         your reasoning .         if we need reinforcements  you will be there  in command of the cruisers .  if it is indeed a powerful rebel center  they may think only one ship has stumbled upon them .  i will get word to you somehow and you can retire to tyrann .         retire .         and return with a full fleet .      andros considered .     very well .  this is our least useful ship in any case .  too large .        the planet filled the visiplate as they spiraled down .      the surface seems quite barren  sir     said the navigator .      have you determined the exact location of the remorseless .         yes  sir .         then land as closely as you can without being sighted .      they were entering the atmosphere now .  the sky as they flashed along the day half of the planet was tinged with a brightening purple .  aratap watched the nearing surface .  the long chase was almost over .     seventeen     and hares .     to those who have not actually been in space  the investigation of a stellar system and the search for habitable planets may seem rather exciting  at the least  interesting .  to the spaceman  it is the most boring of jobs .   locating a star  which is a huge glowing mass of hydrogen fusing into helium  is almost too easy .  it advertises itself .  even in the blackness of the nebula  it is only a question of distance .  approach within five billion miles  and it will still advertise itself .   but a planet  a relatively small mass of rock  shining only by reflected light  is another matter .  one could pass through a stellar system a hundred thousand times at all sorts of odd angles without ever coming close enough to a planet to see it for what it is  barring the oddest of coincidences .   rather  one adopts a system .  a position is taken up in space at a distance from the star being investigated of some ten thousand times the star   s diameter .  from galactic statistics it is known that not one time in fifty thousand is a planet located farther from its primary than that .  furthermore  practically never is a habitable planet located farther from its primary than one thousand times its sun   s diameter .   this means that from the position in space assumed by the ship  any habitable planet must be located within six degrees of the star .  this represents an area only       th of the entire sky .  that area can be handled in detail with relatively few observations .   the movement of the tele camera can be so adjusted as to counteract the motion of the ship in its orbit .  under those conditions a time exposure will pinpoint the constellations in the star   s neighborhood  provided  of course  that the blaze of the sun itself is blocked out  which is easily done .  planets  however  will have perceptible proper motions and therefore show up as tiny streaks on the film .   when no streaks appear  there is always the possibility that the planets are behind their primary .  the maneuver is therefore repeated from another position in space and  usually  at a point closer to the star .   it is a very dull procedure indeed  and when it has been repeated three times for three different stars  each time with completely negative results  a certain depression of morale is bound to occur .   gillbret   s morale  for instance  had been suffering for quite a while .  longer and longer intervals took place between the moments when he found something    amusing .      they were readying for the jump to the fourth star on the autarch   s list  and biron said     we hit a star each time  anyway .  at least jonti   s figures are correct .      gillbret said     statistics show that one out of three stars has a planetary system .      biron nodded .  it was a well worn statistic .  every child was taught that in elementary galactography .   gillbret went on     that means that the chances of finding three stars at random without a single planet  without one single planet  is two thirds cubed  which is eight twenty sevenths  or less than one in three .         so .         and we haven   t found any .  there must be a mistake .         you saw the plates yourself .  and  besides  what price statistics .  for all we know  conditions are different inside a nebula .  maybe the particle fog prevents planets from forming  or maybe the fog is the result of planets that didn   t coalesce .         you don   t mean that .     said gillbret  stricken .      you   re right .  i   m just talking to hear myself .  i don   t know anything about cosmogony .  why the hell are planets formed  anyway .  never heard of one that wasn   t filled with trouble .     biron looked haggard himself .  he was still printing and pasting up little stickers on the control panels .   he said     anyway  we   ve got the blasters all worked out  range finders  power control  all that .      it was very difficult not to look at the visiplate .  they   d be jumping again soon  through that ink .   biron said absently     you know why they call it the horsehead nebula  gil .         the first man to enter it was horace hedd .  are you going to tell me that   s wrong .         it may be .  they have a different explanation on earth .         oh .         they claim it   s called that because it looks like a horse   s head .         what   s a horse .         it   s an animal on earth .         it   s an amusing thought  but the nebula doesn   t look like any animal to me  biron .         it depends on the angle you look at it .  now from nephelos it looks like a man   s arm with three fingers  but i looked at it once from the observatory at the university of earth .  it does look a little like a horse   s head .  maybe that is how the name started .  maybe there never was any horace hedd .  who knows .     biron felt bored with the matter  already .  he was still talking simply to hear himself talk .   there was a pause  a pause that lasted too long  because it gave gillbret a chance to bring up a subject which biron did not wish to discuss and could not force himself to stop thinking about .   gillbret said     where   s arta .      biron looked at him quickly and said     somewhere in the trailer .  i don   t follow her about .         the autarch does .  he might as well be living here .         how lucky for her .      gillbret   s wrinkles became more pronounced and his small features seemed to screw together .     oh  don   t be a fool  biron .  artemisia is a hinriad .  she can   t take what you   ve been giving her .      biron said     drop it .         i won   t .  i   ve been spoiling to say this .  why are you doing this to her .  because hinrik might have been responsible for your father   s death .  hinrik is my cousin .  you haven   t changed toward me .         all right     biron said .     i haven   t changed toward you .  i speak to you as i always have .  i speak to artemisia as well .         as you always have .      biron was silent .   gillbret said     you   re throwing her at the autarch .          it   s her choice .         it isn   t .  it   s your choice .  listen  biron     gillbret grew confidential  he put a hand on biron   s knee     this isn   t a thing i like to interfere with  you understand .  it   s just that she   s the only good thing in the hinriad family just row .  would you be amused if i said i loved her .  i have no children of my own .         i don   t question your love .         then i advise you for her good .  stop the autarch  biron .         i thought you trusted him  oil .         as the autarch  yes .  as an anti tyrannian leader  yes .  but as a man for a woman  as a man for artemisia  no .         tell her that .         she wouldn   t listen .         do you think she would listen if i told her .         if you told her properly .      for a moment biron seemed to hesitate  his tongue dabbing slightly at dry lips .  then he turned away  saying harshly     i don   t want to talk about it .      gillbret said sadly     you   ll regret this .      biron said nothing .  why didn   t gillbret leave him alone .  it had occurred to him many times that he might regret all this .  it wasn   t easy .  but what could he do .  there was no safe way of backing out .   he tried breathing through his mouth to get rid  somehow  of the choking sensation in his chest .     the outlook was different after the next jump .  biron had set the controls in accordance with the instructions from the autarch   s pilot  and left the manuals to gillbret .  he was going to sleep through this one .  and then gillbret was shaking his shoulder .      biron .  biron .      biron rolled over in his bunk and out  landing in a crouch  fists balled .     what is it .      gillbret stepped back hastily .     now  take it easy .  we   ve got an f   this time .      it sank in .  gillbret drew a deep breath and relaxed .     don   t ever wake me that way  gillbret .  an f    you say .  i suppose you   re referring to the new star .         i surely am .  it looks most amusing  i think .      in a way  it did .  approximately    per cent of habitable planets in the galaxy circled stars of spectral types f or g  diameter from     to      thousand miles  surface temperature from five to ten thousand centigrade .  earth   s sun was g    rhodia   s f    lingane   s g    as was that of nephelos .  f   was a little warm  but not too warm .   the first three stars they had stopped at were of spectral type k  rather small and ruddy .  planets would probably not have been decent even if they had had any .   a good star is a good star .  in the first day of photography  five planets were located  the nearest being one hundred and fifty million miles from the primary .   tedor rizzett brought the news personally .  he visited the remorseless as frequently as the autarch  lighting the ship with his heartiness .  he was whoofing and panting this time from the hand over hand exercises along the metal line .   he said     i don   t know how the autarch does it .  he never seems to mind .  comes from being younger  i guess .     he added abruptly     five planets .      gillbret said     for this star .  you   re sure .         it   s definite .  four of them are j type  though .         and the fifth .         the fifth may be all right .  oxygen in the atmosphere  anyway .      gillbret set up a thin sort of yell of triumph  but biron said     four are j type .  oh well  we only need one .      he realized it was a reasonable distribution .  the large majority of sizable planets in the galaxy possessed hydrogenated atmospheres .  after all  stars are mostly hydrogen  and they are the source material of planetary building blocks .  j type planets had atmospheres of methane or ammonia  with molecular hydrogen in addition sometimes  and also considerable helium .  such atmospheres were usually deep and extremely dense .  the planets themselves were almost invariably thirty thousand miles in diameter and up  with a mean temperature of rarely more than fifty below zero  centigrade .  they were quite uninhabitable .   back on earth they used to tell him that these planets were called j type because the j stood for jupiter  the planet in earth   s solar system which was the best example of the type .  maybe they were right .  certainly  the other planet classification was the e type and e did stand for earth .  e types were usually small  comparatively  and their weaker gravity could not retain hydrogen or the hydrogen containing gases  particularly since they were usually closer to the sun and warmer .  their atmospheres were thin and contained oxygen and nitrogen usually  with  occasionally  an admixture of chlorine  which would be bad .      any chorine .     asked biron .     how well have they gone over the atmosphere .      rizzett shrugged .     we can only judge the upper reaches from out in space .  if there were any chlorine  it would concentrate toward ground level .  we   ll see .      he clapped a hand on biron   s large shoulder .     how about inviting me to a small drink in your room  boy .      gillbret looked after them uneasily .  with the autarch courting artemisia  and his right hand man becoming a drinking companion of biron  the remorseless was becoming more linganian than not .  he wondered if biron knew what he was doing  then thought of the new planet and let the rest go .     artemisia was in the pilot room when they penetrated the atmosphere .  there was a little smile on her face and she seemed quite contented .  biron looked in her direction occasionally .  he had said     good day  artemisia     when she came in  she hardly ever did come in  he had been caught by surprise   but she hadn   t answered .   she had merely said     uncle oil     very brightly  then     is it true we   re landing .      and oil had rubbed his hands .     it seems so  my dear .  we may be getting out of the ship in a few hours  walking on solid surface .  how   s that for an amusing thought .         i hope it   s the right planet .  if it isn   t  it won   t be so amusing .         there   s still another star     said oil  but his brow furrowed and contracted as he said so .   and then artemisia turned to biron and said  coolly     did you speak  mr .  farrill .      biron  caught by surprise again  started and said     no  not really .         i beg your pardon  then .  i thought you had .      she passed by him so closely that the plastic flair of her dress brushed his knee and her perfume momentarily surrounded him .  his jaw muscles knotted .   rizzett was still with them .  one of the advantages of the trailer was that they could put up a guest overnight .  he said     they   re getting details on the atmosphere now .  lots of oxygen  almost    per cent  and nitrogen and inert gases .  it   s quite normal .  no chlorine .     then he paused and said     hmm .      gillbret said     what   s the matter .         no carbon dioxide .  that   s not so good .         why not .     demanded artemisia from her vantage point near the visiplate  where she watched the distant surface of the planet blur past at two thousand miles an hour .   biron said curtly     no carbon dioxide  no plant life .         oh .     she looked at him  and smiled warmly .   biron  against his will  smiled back  and somehow  with scarcely a visible change in her countenance  she was smiling through him  past him  obviously unaware of his existence  and he was left there  caught in a foolish smile .  he let it fade .   it was just as well he avoided her .  certainly  when he was with her  he couldn   t keep it up .  when he could actually see her  the anesthetic of his will didn   t work .  it began hurting .     gillbret was doleful .  they were coasting now .  in the thick lower reaches of the atmosphere  the remorseless  with its aerodynamically undesirable addition of a trailer  was difficult to handle .  biron fought the bucking controls stubbornly .   he said     cheer up  gil .      he felt not exactly jubilant himself .  radio signals had brought no response as yet  and if this were not the rebellion world  there would be no point in waiting longer .  his line of action was set .   gillbret said     it doesn   t look like the rebellion world .  it   s rocky and dead  and not much water  either .     he turned .     did they try for carbon dioxide again  rizzett .      rizzett   s ruddy face was long .     yes .  just a trace .  about a thousandth of a per cent or so .      biron said     you can   t tell .  they might pick a world like this  just because it would look so hopeless .         but i saw farms     said gillbret .      all right .  how much do you suppose we can see of a planet this size by circling it a few times .  you know damn well  oil  that whoever they are  they can   t have enough people to fill a whole planet .  they may have picked themselves a valley somewhere where the carbon dioxide of the air has been built up  say  by volcanic action  and where there   s plenty of nearby water .  we could whiz within twenty miles of them and never know it .  naturally  they wouldn   t be ready to answer radio calls without considerable investigation .             you can   t build up a concentration of carbon dioxide that easily     muttered gillbret .  but he watched the visiplate intently .   biron suddenly hoped that it was the wrong world .  he decided that he could wait no longer .  it would have to be settled  now .     it was a queer feeling .   the artificial lights had been turned off and sunlight was coming in unhindered at the ports .  actually  it was the less efficient method of lighting the ship  but there was a sudden desirable novelty to it .  the ports were open  in fact  and a native atmosphere could be breathed .   rizzett advised against it on the grounds that lack of carbon dioxide would upset the respiratory regulation of the body  but biron thought it might be bearable for a short time .   gillbret had come upon them  heads together .  they looked up and leaned away from each other .   gillbret laughed .  then he looked out of the open port  sighed  and said     rocks .      biron said mildly     we   re going to set up a radio transmitter at the top of the high ground .  we   ll get more range that way .  at any rate  we ought to be able to contact all of this hemisphere .  and if it   s negative  we can try the other side of the planet .         is that what you and rizzett were discussing .         exactly .  the autarch and i will do the job .  it   s his suggestion  which is fortunate  since otherwise i would have had to make the same suggestion myself .     he looked fleetingly at rizzett as he spoke .  rizzett was expressionless .   biron stood up .     i think it would be best if i unzipped my space suit lining and wore that .      rizzett was in agreement .  it was sunny on this planet  there was little water vapor in the air and no clouds  but it was briskly cold .     the autarch was at the main lock of the remorseless .  his overcoat was of thin foamite that weighed a fraction of an ounce  yet did a nearly perfect job of insulation .  a small carbon dioxide cylinder was strapped to his chest  adjusted to a slow leak that would maintain a perceptible co  vapor tension in his immediate vicinity .   he said     would you care to search me  farrill .     he raised his hands and waited  his lean face quietly amused .      no     said biron .     do you want to check me for weapons .         i wouldn   t think of it .      the courtesies were as frigid as the weather .   biron stepped out into the hard sunlight and tugged at the handle of the two handled suitcase in which the radio equipment was stowed .  the autarch caught the other .      not too heavy     said biron .  he turned  and artemisia was standing just within the ship  silent .   her dress was a smooth  unfigured white which folded in a smooth drape that fled before the wind .  the semitransparent sleeves whipped back against her arms  turning them to silver .   for a moment biron melted dangerously .  he wanted to return quickly  to run  leap into the ship  grasp her so that his fingers would leave bruises on her shoulders  feel his lips meet hers    but he nodded briefly instead  and her returning smile  the light flutter of her fingers was for the autarch .   five minutes later he turned and there was still that glimmer of white at the open door  and then the rise in the ground cut off the view of the ship .  the horizon was free of everything but broken and bare rock now .   biron thought of what lay ahead  and wondered if he would ever see artemisia again  and if she would care if he never returned .     eighteen     out of the jaws of defeat .     artemesia watched them as they became tiny figures  trudging up the bare granite  then dipping below and out of sight .  for a moment  just before they disappeared  one of them had turned .  she couldn   t be sure which one  and  for a moment  her heart hardened .   he had not said a word on parting .  not one word .  she turned away from the sun and rock toward the confined metal interior of the ship .  she felt alone  terribly alone  she had never felt so alone in her life .   it was that  perhaps  that made her shiver  but it would have been an intolerable confession of weakness to admit that it wasn   t simply the cold .   she said peevishly     uncle gil .  why don   t you close the ports .  it   s enough to freeze a person to death .     the thermometer dial read plus seven centigrade with the ship   s heaters on high .      my dear arta     said gillbret mildly     if you will persist in your ridiculous habit of wearing nothing but a little fog here and there  you must expect to be cold .     but he closed certain contacts  and  with little clicks  the air lock slid shut  the ports sunk inward and molded themselves into the smooth  gleaming hull .  as they did so  the thick glass polarized and became nontransparent .  the lights of the ship went on and the shadows disappeared .   artemisia sat down in the heavily padded pilot   s seat and fingered the arms aimlessly .  his hands had often rested there  and the slight warmth that flooded her as she thought that  she told herself  was only the result of the heaters making themselves felt decently  now that the outer winds were excluded .   the long minutes passed  and it became impossible to sit quietly .  she might have gone with him .  she corrected the rebellious thought instantly as it passed through her mind  and changed the singular    him    to the plural    them .      she said     why do they have to set up a radio transmitter anyway  uncle gil .      he looked up from the visiplate  the controls of which he was fingering delicately  and said     eh .         we   ve been trying to contact them from out in space     she said     and we haven   t reached anyone .  what special good would a transmitter on the planet   s surface do .      gillbret was troubled .     why  we must keep trying  my dear .  we must find the rebellion world .     and  between his teeth  he added to himself     we must .      a moment passed  and he said     i can   t find them .         find whom .         biron and the autarch .  the ridge cuts me off no matter how i arrange the external mirrors .  see .      she saw nothing but the sunny rock flashing past .   then gillbret brought the little gears to rest and said     anyway  that   s the autarch   s ship .      artemisia accorded it the briefest of glances .  it lay deeper in the valley  perhaps a mile away .  it glistened unbearably in the sun .  it seemed to her  at the moment  to be the real enemy .  it was  not the tyranni .  she wished suddenly  sharply  and very strongly that they had never gone to lingane  that they had remained in space  the three of them only .  those had been funny days  so uncomfortable and yet so warm  somehow .  and now she could only try to hurt him .  something made her hurt him  though she would have liked    gillbret said     now what does he want .      artemisia looked up at him  seeing him through a watery mist  so that she had to blink rapidly to put him into normal focus .     who .         rizzett .  i think that   s rizzett .  but he   s certainly not coming this way .      artemisia was at the visiplate .     make it larger     she ordered .      at this short distance .     objected gillbret .     you won   t see anything .  it will be impossible to keep it centered .         larger  uncle gil .      muttering  he threw in the telescopic attachment and searched the bloated nubbles of rock that resulted .  they jumped faster than the eye could follow at the lightest touch on the controls .  for one moment  rizzett  a large  hazy figure  flashed past  and in that moment his identity was unmistakable .  gillbret backtracked wildly  caught him again  hung on for a moment  and artemisia said     he   s armed .  did you see that .         no .         he   s got a long range blasting rifle  i tell you .      she was up  tearing away at the locker .      arta .  what are you doing .      she was unzipping the lining from another space suit .     i   m going out there .  rizzett   s following them .  don   t you understand .  the autarch hasn   t gone out to set up a radio .  it   s a trap for biron .     she was gasping as she forced herself into the thick  coarse lining .      stop it .  you   re imagining things .      but she was staring at gillbret without seeing him  her face pinched and white .  she should have seen it before  the way rizzett had been coddling that fool .  that emotional fool .  rizzett had praised his father  told him what a great man the rancher of widemos had been  and biron had melted immediately .  his every action was dictated by the thought of his father .  how could a man let himself be so ruled by a monomania .   she said     i don   t know what controls the air lock .  open it .         arta  you   re not leaving the ship .  you don   t know where they are .         i   ll find them .  open the air lock .      gillbret shook his head .   but the space suit she had stripped had borne a holster .  she said     uncle oil  i   ll use this .  i swear i will .      and gillbret found himself staring at the wicked muzzle of a neuronic whip .  he forced a smile .     don   t now .         open the lock .     she gasped .   he did and she was out  running into the wind  slipping across the rocks and up the ridge .  the blood pounded in her ears .  she had been as bad as he  dangling the autarch before him for no purpose other than her silly pride .  it seemed silly now  and the autarch   s personality sharpened in her mind  a man so studiedly cold as to be bloodless and tasteless .  she quivered with repulsion .   she had topped the ridge  and there was nothing ahead of her .  stolidly she walked onward  holding the neuronic whip before her .     biron and the autarch had not exchanged a word during their walk  and now they came to a halt where the ground leveled off .  the rock was fissured by the action of sun and wind through the millennia .  ahead of them there was an ancient fault  the farther lip of which had crumbled downward  leaving a sheer precipice of a hundred feet .   biron approached cautiously and looked over it .  it slanted outward past the drop  the ground riddled with craggy boulders which  with time and infrequent rains  had scattered out as far as he could see .      it looks     he said     like a hopeless world  jonti .      the autarch displayed none of biron   s curiosity in his surroundings .  he did not approach the drop .  he said     this is the place we found before landing .  it   s ideal for our purposes .      it   s ideal for your purposes  at least  thought biron .  he stepped away from the edge and sat down .  he listened to the tiny hiss from his carbon dioxide cylinder  and waited a moment .   then he said  very quietly     what will you tell them when you get back to your ship  jonti .  or shall i guess .      the autarch paused in the act of opening the two handed suitcase they had carried .  he straightened and said     what are you talking about .      biron felt the wind numb his face and rubbed his nose with his gloved hand .  yet he unbuttoned the foamite lining that wrapped him  so that it flapped wide as the gusts hit it .   he said     i   m talking about your purpose in coming here .         i would like to set up the radio rather than waste my time discussing the matter  farrill .         you won   t set up a radio .  why should you .  we tried reaching them from space  without a response .  there   s no reason to expect more of a transmitter on the surface .  it   s not a question of ionized radio opaque layers in the upper atmosphere  either  because we tried the sub ether as well and drew a blank .  n or are we particularly the radio experts in our party .  so why did you really come up here  jonti .      the autarch sat down opposite biron .  a hand patted the suitcase idly .     if you are troubled by these doubts  why did you come .         to discover the truth .  your man  rizzett  told me you were planning this trip  and advised me to join you .  i believe that your instructions to him were to tell me that by joining you i might make certain you received no messages that i remained unaware of .  it was a reasonable point  except that i don   t think you will receive any message .  but i allowed it to persuade me  and i   ve come with you .         to discover truth .     said jonti mockingly .      exactly that .  i can guess truth already .         tell me then .  let me discover truth as well .         you came to kill me .  i am here alone with you  and there is a cliff before us over which it would be certain death to fall .  there would be no signs of deliberate violence .  there would be no blasted limbs or any thought of weapon play .  it would make a nice  sad story to take back to your ship .  i had slipped and fallen .  you might bring back a party to gather me up and give me a decent burial .  it would all be very touching and i would be out of your way .         you believe this  and yet you came .         i expect it  so you won   t catch me by surprise .  we are unarmed and i doubt that you could force me over by muscular power alone .     for a moment biron   s nostrils flared .  he half flexed his right arm  slowly and hungrily .   but jonti laughed .     shall we concern ourselves with our radio transmitter  then  since your death is now impossible .         not yet .  i am not done .  i want your admission that you were going to try to kill me .         oh .  do you insist that i play my proper role in this impromptu drama you have developed .  how do you expect to force me to do so .  do you intend to beat a confession out of me .  now understand  farrill  you are a young man and i am disposed to make allowances because of that and because of the convenience of your name and rank .  however  i must admit you have until now been more trouble than help to me .         so i have been .  by keeping alive  despite you .         if you refer to the risks you ran on rhodia  i have explained it  i will not explain it again .      biron rose .     your explanation was not accurate .  it has a flaw in it which was obvious from the beginning .         really .         really .  stand up and listen to me  or i   ll drag you to your feet .      the autarch   s eyes narrowed to slits as he rose .     i would not advise you to attempt violence  youngster .         listen .     biron   s voice was loud and his cloak still bellied open in the breeze  disregarded .     you said that you sent me to a possible death on rhodia only to implicate the director in an anti tyrannian plot .         that remains true .         that remains a lie .  your prime object was to have me killed .  you informed the captain of the rhodian ship of my identity at the very beginning .  you had no real reason for believing that i would ever be allowed to reach hinrik .         if i had wanted to kill you  farrill  i might have planted a real radiation bomb in your room .         it would have been obviously more convenient to have the tyranni maneuvered into doing the killing for you .         i might have killed you in space when i first boarded the remorseless .         so you might .  you came equipped with a blaster and you had it leveled at me at one point .  you had expected me on board  but you hadn   t told your crew that .  when rizzett called and saw me  it was no longer possible to blast me .  you made a mistake then .  you told me you had told your men i was probably on board  and awhile later rizzett told me you had not .  don   t you brief your men concerning your exact lies as you tell them  jonti .      jonti   s face had been white in the cold  but it seemed to whiten further .     i should kill you now for giving me the lie  certainly .  but what held back my trigger finger before rizzett got on the visiplate and saw you .         politics  jonti .  artemisia oth hinriad was aboard  and for the moment she was a more important object than myself .  i   ll give you credit for a quick change of plans .  to have killed me in her presence would have ruined a bigger game .         i had fallen in love so rapidly  then .         love .  when the girl concerned is a hinriad  why not .  you lost no time .  you tried first to have her transferred to your ship  and when that failed  you told me that hinrik had betrayed my father .     he was silent for a moment  then said     so i lost her and left you the field undisputed .  now  i presume  she is no longer a factor .  she is firmly on your side and you may proceed with your plan to kill me without any fear that by doing it you may lose your chance at the hinriad succession .      jonti sighed and said     farrill  it is cold  and getting colder .  i believe the sun is heading downward .  you are unutterably foolish and you weary me .  before we end this farrago of nonsense  will you tell me why i should be in the least interested in killing you anyway .  that is  if your obvious paranoia needs any reason .         there is the same reason that caused you to kill my father .         what .         did you think i believed you for an instant when you said hinrik had been the traitor .  he might have been  were it not for the fact that his reputation as a wretched weakling is so well established .  do you suppose that my father was a complete fool .  could he possibly have mistaken hinrik for anything but what he was .  if he had not known his reputation  would not five minutes in his presence have revealed him completely as a hopeless puppet .  would my father have blabbed foolishly to hinrik anything that might have been used to support a charge of treason against him .  no  jonti .  the man who betrayed my father must have been one who was trusted by him .      jonti took a step backward and kicked the suitcase aside .  he poised himself to withstand a charge and said     i see your vile implication .  my only explanation for it is that you are criminally insane .      biron was trembling  and not with cold .     my father was popular with your men  jonti .  too popular .  an autarch cannot allow a competitor in the business of ruling .  you saw to it that he did not remain a competitor .  and it was your next job to see to it that i did not remain alive either to replace or to avenge him .     his voice raised to a shout  which whipped away on the cold air .     isn   t this true .         no .      jonti bent to the suitcase .     i can prove you are wrong .     he flung it open .     radio equipment .  inspect it .  take a good look at it .     he tossed the items to the ground at biron   s feet .   biron stared at them .     how does that prove anything .      jonti rose .     it doesn   t .  but now take a good look at this .      he had a blaster in his hand  and his knuckles were white with tension .  the coolness had left his voice .  he said     i am tired of you .  but i won   t have to be tired much longer .      biron said tonelessly     you hid a blaster in the suitcase with the equipment .         did you think i wouldn   t .  you honestly came here expecting to be thrown off a cliff and you thought i would try to do it with my hands as though i were a stevedore or a coal miner .  i am autarch of lingane     his face worked and his left hand made a flat  cutting gesture before him     and i am tired of the cant and fatuous idealism of the ranchers of widemos .     he whispered then     move on .  toward the cliff .     he stepped forward .   biron  hands raised  eyes on the blaster  stepped back .     you killed my father  then .         i killed your father .     said the autarch .     i tell you this so you may know in the last few moments of your life that the same man who saw to it that your father was blasted to bits in a disintegration chamber will see to it that you will follow him  and keep the hinriad girl for himself thereafter  along with all that goes with her .  think of that .  i will give you an extra minute to think of that .  but keep your hands steady  or i will blast you and risk any questions my men may care to ask .     it was as though his cold veneer  having cracked  left nothing but a burning passion exposed .      you tried to kill me before this  as i said .         i did .  your guesses were in every way correct .  does that help you now .  back .         no     said biron .  he brought his hands down and said     h you   re going to shoot  do so .      the autarch said     you think i will not dare .         i   ve asked you to shoot .         and i will .     the autarch aimed deliberately at biron   s head and at a distance of four feet closed contact on his blaster .     nineteen     defeat .     tedor rizzett circled the little piece of tableland warily .  he was not yet ready to be seen  but to remain hidden was difficult in this world of bare rock .  in the patch of tumbled  crystalline boulders he felt safer .  he threaded his way through them .  occasionally he paused to pass the soft back of the spongy gloves he wore over his face .  the dry cold was deceptive .   he saw them now from between two granite monoliths that met in a v .  he rested his blaster in the crotch .  the sun was on his back .  he felt its feeble warmth soak through  and he was satisfied .  h they happened to look in his direction  the sun would be in their eyes and he himself would be that much less visible .   their voices were sharp in his ear .  radio communication was in operation and he smiled at that .  so far  according to plan .  his own presence  of course  was not according to plan  but it would be better so .  the plan was a rather overconfident one and the victim was not a complete fool  after all .  his own blaster might yet be needed to decide the issue .   he waited .  stolidly he watched the autarch lift his blaster as biron stood there  unflinching .   artemisia did not see the blaster lift .  she did not see the two figures on the flat rock surface .  five minutes earlier she had seen rizzett silhouetted for a moment against the sky  and since then she had followed him .   somehow  he was moving too fast for her .  things dimmed and wavered before her and twice she found herself stretched on the ground .  she did not recall falling .  the second time  she staggered to her feet with one wrist oozing blood where a sharp edge had scraped her .   rizzett had gained again and she had to reel after him .  when he vanished in the glistening boulder forest  she sobbed in despair .  she leaned against a rock  completely weary .  its beautiful flesh pink tint  the glassy smoothness of its surface  the fact that it stood as an ancient reminder of a primeval volcanic age was lost upon her .   she could only try to fight the sensation of choking that pervaded her .   and then she saw him  dwarfed at the forked rock formation  his back to her .  she held the neuronic whip before her as she ran unevenly over the hard ground .  he was sighting along the barrel of his rifle  intent upon the process  taking aim  getting ready .   she wouldn   t make it in time .   she would have to distract his attention .  she called     rizzett .     and again     rizzett  don   t shoot .      she stumbled again .  the sun was blotting out  but consciousness lingered .  it lingered long enough for her to feel the ground jar thuddingly against her  long enough to press her finger upon the whip   s contact  and long enough for her to know that she was well out of range  even if her aim was accurate  which it could not be .   she felt arms about her  lifting .  she tried to see  but her eyelids would not open .      biron .     it was a weak whisper .   the answer was a rough blur of words  but it was rizzett   s voice .  she tried to speak further  then abruptly gave up .  she had failed .   everything was blotted out .     the autarch remained motionless for the space it would take a man to count to ten slowly .  biron faced him as motionlessly  watching the barrel of the blaster that had just been fired point blank at him .  the barrel sank slowly as he watched .   biron said     your blaster seems not be in firing order .  examine it .      the autarch   s bloodless face turned alternately from biron to his weapon .  he had fired at a distance of four feet .  it should have been allover .  the congealed astonishment that held him broke suddenly and he disjointed the blaster in a quick movement .   the energy capsule was missing .  where it should have been  there was a useless cavity .  the autarch whimpered with rage as he hurled the lump of dead metal aside .  it turned over and over  a black blot against the sun  smashing into the rock with a faint ringing sound .      man to man .     said biron .  there was a trembling eagerness in his voice .   the autarch took a step backward .  he said nothing .   biron took a slow step forward .     there are many ways i could kill you  but not all would be satisfying .  if i blasted you  it would mean that a millionth of a second would separate your life from your death .  you would have no consciousness of dying .  that would be bad .  i think that instead there would be considerable satisfaction in using the somewhat slower method of human muscular effort .      his thigh muscles tensed  but the lunge they prepared was never completed .  the cry that interrupted was thin and high  packed with panic .      rizzett .     it came .     rizzett  don   t shoot .      biron whirled in time to see the motion behind the rocks a hundred yards away and the glint of sun on metal .  and then the hurled weight of a human body was upon his back .  he bent under it  dropping to his knees .   the autarch had landed fairly  his knees clasped hard about the other   s waist  his fist thudding at the nape of biron   s neck .  biron   s breath whooshed out in a whistling grunt .   biron fought off the gathering blackness long enough to throw himself to one side .  the autarch jumped free  gaining clear footing while biron sprawled on his back .   he had just time to double his legs up against himself as the autarch lunged down upon him again .  the autarch bounced off .  they were up together this time  perspiration turning icy upon their cheeks .   they circled slowly .  biron tossed his carbon dioxide cylinder to one side .  the autarch likewise unstrapped his  held it suspended a moment by its mesh metal hose  then stepped in rapidly and swung it .  biron dropped  and both heard and felt it whistle above his head .   he was up again  leaping on the other before the autarch could regain his balance .  one large fist clamped down on the other fist exploded in the autarch   s face .  he let the autarch drop and stepped back .   biron said     stand up .  i   ll wait for you with more of the same .  there   s no hurry .      the autarch touched his gloved hand to his face then stared sickly at the blood that smeared off upon it .  his mouth twisted and his hand snaked out for the metal cylinder he had dropped .  biron   s foot came heavily down upon it  and the autarch yelled in agony .   biron said      . you   re too close to the edge of the cliff  jonti .  mustn   t reach in that direction .  stand up .  i   ll throw you the other way now .      but rizzett   s voice rang out     wait .      the autarch screamed     shoot this man  rizzett .  shoot him now .  his arms first  then his legs  and we   ll leave him .      rizzett brought his weapon up slowly against his shoulder .   biron said     who saw to it that your own blaster was unloaded  jonti .         what .     the autarch stared blankly .      it was not i who had access to your blaster  jonti .  who did have .  who is pointing a blaster at you right now  jonti .  not at me  jonti  but at you      the autarch turned to rizzett and screamed     traitor .      rizzett said  in a low voice .     not i  sir .  that man is the traitor who betrayed the loyal rancher of widemos to his death .         that is not i     cried the autarch .     if he has told you i have  he lies .         it is you yourself who have told us .  i not only emptied your weapon  i also shorted your communicator switch  so that every word you said today was received by myself and by every member of the crew .  we all know you for what you are .         i am your autarch .         and also the greatest traitor alive .      for a moment the autarch said nothing  but looked wildly from one to the other as they watched him with somber  angry faces .  then he wrenched to his feet  pulled together the parted seams of his self control  and held them tightly by sheer nervous force .   his voice was almost cool as he said     and if it were all true  what would it matter .  you have no choice but to let matters stand as they are .  one last intranebular planet remains to be visited .  it must be the rebellion world  and only i know the co ordinates .      he retained dignity somehow .  one hand hung uselessly from a broken wrist  his upper lip had swollen ludicrously  and blood was caking his cheek  but he radiated the hauteur of one born to rule .      you   ll tell us     said biron .      don   t delude yourself that i will under any circumstances .  i have told you already that there is an average of seventy cubic light years per star .  if you work by trial and error  without me  the odds are two hundred and fifty quadrillion to one against your coming within a billion miles of any star .  any star .      something went click .  in biron   s mind .   he said     take him back to the remorseless .      rizzett said in a low voice     the lady artemisia       and biron interrupted     then it was she .  where is she .         it   s all right .  she   s safe .  she came out without a carbon dioxide cylinder .  naturally  as the co  washed out of her blood stream  the automatic breathing mechanism of the body slowed .  she was trying to run  didn   t have the sense to breathe deeply voluntarily  and fainted .      biron frowned .     why was she trying to interfere with you  anyway .  making sure her boy friend didn   t get hurt .      rizzett said     yes  she was .  only she thought i was the autarch   s man and was going to shoot you .  i   ll take back this rat now  and  biron          yes .         get back as soon as you can .  he   s still the autarch  and the crew may need talking to .  it   s hard to break a lifetime habit of obedience .  .  .  . she   s behind that rock .  get to her before she freezes to death  will you .  she won   t leave .        her face was almost buried in the hood that covered her head  and her body was formless in the thick  enveloping folds of the space suit lining  but his steps quickened as he approached her .   he said     how are you .      she said     better  thank you .  i am sorry if i caused any trouble .      they stood looking at each other  and the conversation seemed to have burned itself out in two lines .   then biron said     i know we can   t turn time backward  undo things that have been done  unsay things that have been said .  but i do want you to understand .         why this stress on understanding .     her eyes flashed .     i have done nothing but understand for weeks now .  will you ten me again about my father .         no .  i knew your father was innocent .  i suspected the autarch almost from the start  but i had to find out definitely .  i could only prove it  arta  by forcing him to confess .  i thought i could get him to confess by trapping him into attempting to kill me  and there was only one way of doing that .      he felt wretched .  he went on     it was a bad thing to do .  as bad  almost  as what he did to my father .  i don   t expect you to forgive me .      she said     i don   t follow you .     he said     i knew he wanted you  arta .  politically  you would be a perfect matrimonial object .  the name of hinriad would be more useful for his purposes than that of widemos .  so once he had you  he would need me no longer .  i deliberately forced you on him  arta .  i acted as i did  hoping you would turn to him .  when you did  he thought he was ready to rid himself of me  and rizzett and i laid our trap .         and you loved me an the time .      biron said     can   t you bring yourself to believe that  arta .         and of course you were ready to sacrifice your love to the memory of your father and the honor of your family .  how does the old doggerel go .  you could not love me half so much  loved you not honor more .      biron said  miserably     please  arta .  i am not proud of myself but i could think of no other way .         you might have told me your plan  made me your confederate rather than your tool .         it was not your fight .  if i had failed  and i might have   you would have remained out of it .  if the autarch had killed me and you were no longer on my side  you would be less hurt .  you might even have married him  even been happy .         since you have won  it might be that i would be hurt at his loss .         but you aren   t .           how do you know .      biron said desperately     at least try to see my motives .  granted that i was foolish  criminally foolish  can   t you understand .  can   t you try not to hate me .      she said softly     i have tried not to love you and  as you see  i have failed .         then you forgive me .         why .  because i understand .  no .  if f were a matter of simply understanding  of seeing your motives  i would not forgive you your actions for anything i might have in life .  if it were only that and nothing more .  but i will forgive you  biron  because i couldn   t bear not to .  how could i ask you to come back to me unless i forgave you .      and she was in his arms  her weather cold lips turning up to his .  they were held apart by a double layer of thick garments .  his gloved hands could not feel the body they embraced  but his lips were aware of her white  smooth face .   at last he said in concern     the sun is getting lower .  it   s going to get colder .      but she said softly     it   s strange  then  that i seem to be getting warmer .      together they walked back to the ship .   biron faced them now with an appearance of easy confidence which he did not feel .  the linganian ship was large  and there were fifty in the crew .  they sat now facing him .  fifty faces .  fifty linganian faces bred from birth to unquestioning obedience to their autarch .   some had been convinced by rizzett  others had been convinced by the arranged eavesdropping on the autarch   s statements to biron earlier that day .  but how many others were still uncertain or even definitely hostile .   so far biron   s talking had done little good .  he leaned forward  let his voice grow confidential .     and what are you fighting for  men .  what are you risking your lives for .  a free galaxy  i think .  a galaxy in which each world can decide what is best in its own way  produce its own wealth for its own good  be slave to none and master of none .  am i right .      there was a low murmur of what might have been agreement  but it lacked enthusiasm .   biron went on     and what is the autarch fighting for .  for himself .  he is the autarch of lingane .  if he won  he would be autarch of the nebular kingdoms .  you would replace a khan by an autarch .  where would be the benefit of that .  is that worth dying for .      one in the audience cried out     he would be one of us  not a filthy tyranni .      another shouted .     the autarch was looking for the rebellion world to offer his services .  was that ambition .         ambition should be made of sterner stuff  eh .     biron shouted back  ironically .     but he would come to the rebellion world with an organization at his back .  he could offer them all of lingane  he could offer them  he thought  the prestige of an alliance with the hinriads .  in the end  he was pretty sure  the rebellion world would be his to do with what he pleased .  yes  this was ambition .      and when the safety of the movement ran counter to his own plans  did he hesitate to risk your lives for the sake of his ambition .  my father was a danger to him .  my father was honest and a friend of liberty .  but he was too popular     he was betrayed .  in that betrayal  the autarch might have brought to ruins the entire cause and all of you with it .  which one of you is safe under a man who will deal with the tyranni whenever it suits his purpose .  who can be safe serving a cowardly traitor .         better     whispered rizzett .     stick to that .  give it to them .      again the same voice called from the back rows .     the autarch knows where the rebellion world is .  do you know .         we will discuss that later .  meanwhile  consider instead that under the autarch we were all headed for complete ruin  that there is still time to save ourselves by turning from his guidance to a better and nobler way  that it is still possible from the jaws of defeat to snatch            only defeat  my dear young man     came a soft interrupting voice  and biron turned in horror .   the fifty crewmen came babbling to their feet  and for a moment it seemed as though they might surge forward  but they had come to council unarmed  rizzett had seen to that .  and now a squad of tyrannian guardsmen were filing through the various doors  weapons ready .   and simok aratap himself  a blaster in each hand  stood behind biron and rizzett .     twenty     where .     simok aratap weighed carefully the personalities of each of the four who faced him and felt the stirring of a certain excitement within him .  this would be the big gamble .  the threads of the pattern were weaving toward a close .  he was thankful that major andros was no longer with him  that the tyrannian cruisers had gone as well .   he was left with his flagship  his crew and himself .  they would be sufficient .  he hated unwieldiness .   he spoke mildly     let me bring you up to date  my lady and gentlemen .  the autarch    s ship has been boarded by a prize crew and is now being escorted back to tyrann by major andros .  the autarch   s men will be tried according to law and if convicted will receive the punishment for treason .  they are routine conspirators and will be treated routinely .  but what shall i do with you .      hinrik of rhodia sat beside him  his face crumpled in utter misery .  he said     consider that my daughter is a young girl .  she was led into this unwillingly .  artemisia  tell them that you were         your daughter     interposed aratap     will probably be released .  she is  i believe  the matrimonial object of a highly placed tyrannian nobleman .  obviously  that will be kept in mind .      artemisia said     i   ll marry him  if you   ll let the rest go .      biron half rose  but aratap waved him down .  the tyrannian commissioner smiled and said     my lady  please .  i can strike bargains  i admit .  however  i am not the khan  but merely one of his servants .  therefore  any bargain i do make will have to be justified thoroughly at home .  so what is it exactly that you offer .         my agreement to the marriage .         that is not yours to offer .  your father has already agreed and that is sufficient .  do you have anything else .      aratap was waiting for the slow erosion of their wills to resist .  the fact that he did not enjoy his role did not prevent him from filling it efficiently .  the girl  for instance  might at this moment burst into tears and that would have a salutary effect on the young man .  they had obviously been lovers .  he wondered if old pohang would want her under the circumstances  and decided that he probably would .  the bargain would still be all in the ancient   s favor .  for the moment he thought distantly that the girl was very attractive .   and she was maintaining equilibrium .  she was not breaking down .  very good  thought aratap .  she was strong willed as well .  pohang would not have joy of his bargain after an .   he said to hinrik     do you wish to plead for your cousin too .      hinrik   s lips moved soundlessly .   gillbret cried     no one pleads for me .  i don   t want anything of any tyranni .  go ahead .  order me shot .         you are hysterical     said aratap .     you know that i cannot order you shot without trial .         he is my cousin     whispered hinrik .      that will be considered too .  you noblemen will some .  day have to learn that you cannot presume too far on your usefulness to us .  i wonder if your cousin has learned that lesson yet .      he was satisfied with gillbret   s reactions .  that fellow  at least  sincerely wanted death .  the frustration of life was too much for him .  keep him alive  then  and that alone would break him .   he paused thoughtfully before rizzett .  this was one of the autarch   s men .  at the thought he felt a faint embarrassment .  at the start of the chase  he had dismissed the autarch as a factor on the basis of what seemed iron logic .  well  it was healthy to miss occasionally .  it kept self confidence balanced at a point safely short of arrogance .   he said     you   re the fool who served a traitor .  you would have been better off with us .      rizzett flushed .   aratap went on     if you ever had any military reputation  i am afraid this would destroy it .  you are not a nobleman and considerations of state will play no part in your case .  your trial will be public and it will become known that you were a tool of a tool .  too bad .      rizzett said     but you are about to suggest a bargain  i suppose .         a bargain .         khan   s evidence  for instance .  you have only a shipload .  wouldn   t you want to know the rest of the machinery of revolt .      aratap shook his head slightly .     no .  we have the autarch .  he will do as a source of information .  even without it  we need only make war on lingane .  there would be little left of revolt thereafter  i   m sure .  there will be no bargain of that sort .      and this brought him to the young man .  aratap had left him for last because he was the cleverest of the lot .  but he was young  and young people were often not dangerous .  they lacked patience .   biron spoke first  saying     how did you follow us .  was he working with you .         the autarch .  not in this case .  i believe the poor fellow was trying to play both sides of the game  with the usual success of the unskillful .      hinrik interrupted  with an incongruously childish eagerness     the tyranni have an invention that follows ships through hyperspace .      aratap turned sharply .     if your excellency will refrain from interrupting  i would be obliged     and hinrik cringed .   it really didn   t matter .  none of these four would be dangerous hereafter  but he had no desire to decrease by even one any of the uncertainties in the young man   s mind .   biron said     now  look  let   s have facts  or nothing .  you don   t have us here because you love us .  why aren   t we on the way back to tyrann with the others .  it   s that you don   t know how to go about killing us .  two of us are hinriads .  i am a widemos .  rizzett is a well known officer of the linganian fleet .  and that fifth one you have  your own pet coward and traitor  is still autarch of lingane .  you can   t kill any of us without stinking up the kingdoms from tyrann to the edge of the nebula itself .  you   ve got to try to make some sort of bargain with us  because there   s nothing else you can do .      aratap said     you are not altogether wrong .  let me weave a pattern for you .  we followed you  no matter how .  you may disregard  i think  the director   s overactive imagination .  you paused near three stars without landing on any planet .  you came to a fourth and found a planet to land on .  there we landed with you  watched  waited .  we thought there might be something to wait for and we were right .  you quarreled with the autarch and both of you broadcast without limitation .  that had been arranged by you for your own purposes  i know  but it suited our purpose as well .  we overheard .      the autarch said that only one last intra nebular planet remained to be visited and that it must be the rebellion world .  this is interesting  you see .  a rebellion world .  you know  my curiosity is aroused .  where would that fifth and last planet be located .      he let the silence last .  he took a seat and watched them dispassionately  first one  then another .   biron said     there is no rebellion world .         you were looking for nothing  then .         we were looking for nothing .         you are being ridiculous .      biron shrugged wearily .     you are yourself ridiculous if you expect more of an answer .      aratap said     observe that this rebellion world must be the center of the octopus .  to find it is my only purpose in keeping you alive .  you each have something to gain .  my lady  i might free you of your marriage .  my lord gillbret  we might establish a laboratory for you  let you work undisturbed .  yes  we know more of you than you think .      aratap turned away hastily .  the man   s face was working .  he might weep and that would be unpleasant .      colonel rizzett  you will be saved the humiliation of court martial and the certainty of conviction and the ridicule and loss of reputation that would go with it .  you  biron farrill  would be rancher of widemos again .  in your case  we might even reverse the conviction of your father .         and bring him back to life .         and restore his honor .         his honor     said biron     rests in the very actions that led to his conviction and death .  it is beyond your power to add to or detract from it .      aratap said     one of you four will tell me where to find this world you seek .  one of you will be sensible .  he will gain  whichever one it is  what i have promised .  the rest of you will be married  imprisoned  executed  whatever will be worst for you .  i warn you  i can be sadistic if i must be .      he waited a moment .     which one will it be .  if you don   t speak  the one next to you will .  you will have lost everything and i will still have the information i want .      biron said     it   s no use .  you   re setting this up so carefully  and yet it won   t help you .  there is no rebellion world .         the autarch says there is .         then ask the autarch your question .      aratap frowned .  the young man was carrying the bluff forward past the point of reason .   he said     my own inclination is to deal with one of you .         yet you have dealt with the autarch in the past .  do so again .  there is nothing you can sell to us that we are willing to buy from you .     biron looked about him .     right .      artemisia crept closer to him and her hand folded slowly about his elbow .  rizzett nodded curtly and gillbret muttered     right .     in a breathless manner .      you have decided     said aratap  and put his finger on the correct knob .     the autarch   s right wrist was immobilized in a light metal sheath  which was held magnetically tight to the metal band about his abdomen .  the left side of his face was swollen and blue with bruise except for a ragged  force healed scar that seamed it redly .  he stood before them without moving after that first wrench which had freed his good arm from the grip of the armed guard at his side .      what do you want .         i will tell you in a moment     said aratap .     first  i want you to consider your audience .  see whom we have here .  there is the young man  for instance  whom you planned death for  yet who lived long enough to cripple you and destroy your plans  although you were an autarch and he was an exile .      it was difficult to tell whether a flush had entered the autarch   s mangled face .  there was no single muscle motion upon it .   aratap did not look for one .  he went on quietly  almost indifferently     this is gillbret oth hinriad  who saved the young man   s life and brought him to you .  this is the lady artemisia  whom  i am told  you courted in your most charming manner and who betrayed you  nevertheless  for love of the youngster .  this is colonel rizzett  your most trusted military aide  who also ended by betraying you .  what do you owe these people  autarch .      the autarch said again     what do you want .         information .  give it to me and you will be autarch again .  your earlier dealings with us would be held in your favor at the khan   s court .  otherwise          otherwise .         otherwise i will get it from these  you see .  they will be saved and you will be executed .  that is why i ask whether you owe them anything  that you should give them the opportunity of saving their lives by yourself being mistakenly stubborn .      the autarch   s face twisted painfully into a smile .     they cannot save their lives at my expense .  they do not know the location of the world you seek .  i do .         i have not said what the information i want is  autarch .         there is only one thing you can want .     his voice was hoarse  all but unrecognizable .     if my decision is to speak  then my autarchy will be as before  you say .         more closely guarded  of course     amended aratap politely .   rizzett cried out     believe him  and you   ll but add treason to treason and be killed for it in the end .      the guard stepped forward  but biron anticipated him .  he flung himself upon rizzett  struggling backward with him .      don   t be a fool     he muttered .     there   s nothing you can do .      the autarch said     i don   t care about my autarchy  or myself  rizzett .     he turned to aratap .     will these be killed .  that  at least  you must promise .     his horridly discolored face twisted savagely .     that one  above all .     his finger stabbed toward biron .      if that is your price  it is met .         if i could be his executioner  i would relieve you of all further obligation to me .  if my finger could control the execution blast  it would be partial repayment .  but if not that  at least i will tell you what he would have you not know .  i give you rho  theta  and phi in parsecs and radians       .       .         .      .  those three points will determine the position of the world in the galaxy .  you have them now .         so i have     said aratap  writing them down .   and rizzett broke away  crying     traitor .  traitor .      biron  caught off balance  lost his grip on the linganian and was thrown to one knee .     rizzett     he yelled futilely .   rizzett  face distorted  struggled briefly with the guard .  other guards were swarming in  but rizzett had the blaster now .  with hands and knees he struggled against the tyrannian soldiers .  hurling himself through the huddle of bodies  biron joined the fight .  he caught rizzett   s throat  choking him  pulling him back .      traitor     rizzett gasped  struggling to maintain aim as the autarch tried desperately to squirm aside .  he fired .  and then they disarmed him and threw him on his back .   but the autarch   s right shoulder and half his chest had been blasted away .  grotesquely  the forearm dangled freely from its magnetized sheath .  fingers  wrist  and elbow ended in black ruin .  for a long moment it seemed that the autarch   s eyes flickered as his body remained in crazy balance  and then they were glazed and he dropped and was a charred remnant upon the floor .   artemisia choked and buried her face against biron   s chest .  biron forced himself to look once  firmly and without flinching  at the body of his father   s murderer  then turned his eyes away .  hinrik  from a distant corner of the room  mumbled and giggled to himself .   only aratap was calm .  he said     remove the body .      they did so  flaring the floor with a soft heat ray for a few moments to remove the blood .  only a few scattered char marks were left .   they helped rizzett to his feet .  he brushed at himself with both hands  then whirled fiercely toward biron .     what were you doing .  i almost missed the bastard .      biron said wearily     you fell into aratap   s trap  rizzett .          trap .  i killed the bastard  didn   t i .         that was the trap .  you did him a favor .      rizzett made no answer  and aratap did not interfere .  he listened with a certain pleasure .  the young fellow   s brains worked smoothly .   biron said     if aratap overheard what he claimed to have overheard  he would have known that only jonti had the information he wanted .  jonti said that  with emphasis  when he faced us after the fight .  it was obvious that aratap was questioning us only to rattle us  to get us to act brainlessly at the proper time .  i was ready for the irrational impulse he counted upon .  you were not .         i had thought     interposed aratap softly     that you would have done the job .         i     said biron     would have aimed at you .     he turned to rizzett again .     don   t you see that he didn   t want the autarch alive .  the tyranni are snakes .  he wanted the autarch   s information  he didn   t want to pay for it  he couldn   t risk killing him .  you did it for him .         correct     said aratap     and i have my information .      somewhere there was the sudden clamor of bells .   rizzett began     all right .  if i did him a favor  i did myself one at the same time .         not quite     said the commissioner     since our young friend has not carried the analysis far enough .  you see  a new crime has been committed .  where the only crime is treason against tyrann  your disposal would be a delicate matter politically .  but now that the autarch of lingane has been murdered  you may be tried  convicted  and executed by linganian law and tyrann need play no part in it .  this will be convenient for       and then he frowned and interrupted himself .  he heard the clanging  and stepped to the door .  he kicked the release .      what is happening .      a soldier saluted .     general alarm  sir .  storage compartments .         fire .         it is not yet known  sir .      aratap thought to himself  great galaxy .  and stepped back into the room .     where is gillbret .      and it was the first anyone knew of the latter   s absence .   aratap said     we   ll find him .      they found him in the engine room  cowering amid the giant structures  and half dragged  half carried him back to the commissioner   s room .   the commissioner said dryly     there is no escape on a ship  my lord .  it did you no good to sound the general alarm .  the time of confusion is even then limited .      he went on     i think it is enough .  we have kept the cruiser you stole  farrill  my own cruiser  on board ship .  it will be used to explore the rebellion world .  we will make for the lamented autarch   s reference points as soon as the jump can be calculated .  this will be an adventure of a sort usually missing in this comfortable generation of ours .      there was the sudden thought in his mind of his father in command of a squadron  conquering worlds .  he was glad andros was gone .  this adventure would be his alone .   they were separated after that .  artemisia was placed with her father  and rizzett and biron were marched off in separate directions .  gillbret struggled and screamed .      i won   t be left alone .  i won   t be in solitary .      aratap sighed .  this man   s grandfather had been a great ruler  the history books said .  it was degrading to have to watch such a scene .  he said  with distaste     put my lord with one of the others .      and gillbret was put with biron .  there was no speech between them till the corning of space ship    night     when the lights turned a dim purple .  it was bright enough to allow them to be watched through the tele viewing system by the guards  shift and shift about  yet dim enough to allow sleep .   but gillbret did not sleep .      biron     he whispered .     biron .      and biron  roused from a dull semi drowse  said     what do you want .         biron  i have done it .  it is all right  biron .      biron said     try to sleep  oil .      but gillbret went on     but i   ve done it  biron .  aratap may be smart  but i   m smarter .  isn   t that amusing .  you don   t have to worry  biron .  biron  don   t worry .  i   ve fixed it .     he was shaking biron again  feverishly .   biron sat up .     what   s the matter with you .         nothing .  nothing .  it   s all right .  but i fixed it .     gillbret was smiling .  it was a sly smile  the smile of a little boy who has done something clever .      what have you fixed .     biron was on his feet .  he seized the other by the shoulders and dragged him upright as well .     answer me .         they found me in the engine room .     the words were jerked out .     they thought i was hiding .  i wasn   t .  i sounded the general alarm for the storage room because i had to be alone for just a few minutes  a very few minutes .  biron  i shorted the hyperatomics .         what .         it was easy .  it took a minute .  and they won   t know .  i did it cleverly .  they won   t know until they try to jump  and then all the fuel will be energy in one chain reaction and the ship and us and aratap and all knowledge of the rebellion world will be a thin expansion of iron vapor .      biron was backing away  eyes wide .     you did that .         yes .     gillbret buried his head in his hands and rocked to and fro .     we   ll be dead .  biron  i   m not afraid to die  but not alone .  not alone .  i had to be with someone .  i   m glad i   m with you .  i want to be with someone when i die .  but it won   t hurt  it will be so quick .  it won   t hurt .  it won   t hurt .      biron said     fool .  madman .  we might still have won out but for this .      gillbret didn   t hear him .  his ears were filled with his own moans .  biron could only dash to the door .      guard     he yelled .     guard .     were there hours or merely minutes left .     twenty one     here .     the soldier came clattering down the corridor .     get back in there .     his voice was sour and sharp .   they stood facing one another .  there were no doors to the small bottom level rooms which doubled as prison cells  but a force field stretched from side to side  top to bottom .  biron could feel it with his hand .  there was a tiny resilience to it  like rubber stretched nearly to its extreme  and then it stopped giving  as though the first initial pressure turned it to steel .   it tingled biron   s hand  and he knew that though it would stop matter completely  it would be as transparent as space to the energy beam of a neuronic whip .  and there was a whip in the guard   s hand .   biron said     i   ve got to see commissioner aratap .         is that what you   re making a noise about .     the guard was not in the best of humors .  the night watch was unpopular and he was losing at cards .     i   ll mention it after lights on .         it won   t wait .     biron felt desperate .     it   s important .            it will have to wait .  will you get back  or do you want a bit of the whip .         look     said biron     the man with me is gillbret oth hinriad .  he is sick .  he may be dying .  if a hinriad dies on a tyrannian ship because you will not let me speak to the man in authority  you will not have a good time of it .         what   s wrong with him .         i don   t know .  will you be quick or are you tired of life .      the guard mumbled something and was off .   biron watched him as far as he could see in the dim purple .  he strained his ears in an attempt to catch the heightened throbbing of the engines as energy concentration climbed to a pre jump peak  but he heard nothing at all .   he strode to gillbret  seized the man   s hair  and pulled his head back gently .  eyes stared into his out of a contorted face .  there was no recognition in them  only fear .      who are you .         it   s only me  biron .  how do you feel .      it took time for the words to penetrate .  gillbret said  blankly     biron .     then  with a quiver of life     biron .  are they jumping .  death won   t hurt  biron .      biron let the head drop .  no point in anger against gillbret .  on the information he had  or thought he had  it was a great gesture .  all the more so  since it was breaking him .   but he was writhing in frustration .  why wouldn   t they let him speak to aratap .  why wouldn   t they let him out .  he found himself at a wall and beat upon it with his fists .  if there were a door  he could break it down  if there were bars  he could pull them apart or drag them out of their sockets  by the galaxy .   but there was a force field  which nothing could damage .  he yelled again .   there were footsteps once more .  he rushed to the open yet not open door .  he could not look out to see who was coming down the corridor .  he could only wait .   it was the guard again .     get back from the field     he barked .     step back with your hands in front of you .     there was an officer with him .   biron retreated .  the other   s neuronic whip was on him  unwaveringly .  biron said     the man with you is not aratap .  i want to speak to the commissioner .      the officer said     if gillbret oth hinriad is ill  you don   t want to see the commissioner .  you want to see a doctor .      the force field was down  with a dim blue spark showing as contact broke .  the officer entered  and biron could see the medical group insignia on his uniform .   biron stepped in front of him .     all right .  now listen to me .  this ship mustn   t jump .  the commissioner is the only one who can see to that  and i must see him .  do you understand that .  you   re an officer .  you can have him awakened .      the doctor put out an arm to brush biron aside  and biron batted it away .  the doctor cried out sharply and called     guard  get this man out of here .      the guard stepped forward and biron dived .  they went thumping down together  and biron clawed up along the guard   s body  hand over hand  seizing first the shoulder and then the wrist of the arm that was trying to bring its whip down upon him .   for a moment they remained frozen  straining against one another  and then biron caught motion at the corner of his eye .  the medical officer was rushing past them to sound the alarm .   biron   s hand  the one not holding the other   s whip wrist  shot out and seized the officer   s ankle .  the guard writhed nearly free  and the officer kicked out wildly at him  but  with the veins standing out on his neck and temples  biron pulled desperately with each hand .   the officer went down  shouting hoarsely .  the guard   s whip clattered to the floor with a harsh sound .   biron fell upon it  rolled with it  and came up on his knees and one hand .  in his other was the whip .      not a sound     he gasped .     not one sound .  drop anything else you   ve got .      the guard  staggering to his feet  his tunic ripped  glared hatred and tossed a short  metal weighted  plastic club away from himself .  the doctor was unarmed .   biron picked up the club .  he said     sorry .  i have nothing to tie and gag you with and no time anyway .      the whip flashed dimly once  twice .  first the guard and then the doctor stiffened in agonized immobility and dropped solidly  in one piece  legs and arms bent grotesquely out from their bodies as they lay  in the attitude they had last assumed before the whip struck .   biron turned to gillbret  who was watching with dull  soundless vacuity .      sorry     said biron     but you  too  gillbret     and the whip flashed a third time .   the vacuous expression was frozen solid as gillbret lay there on his side .   the force field was still down and biron stepped out into the corridor .  it was empty .  this was space ship    night    and only the watch and the night details would be up .   there would be no time to try to locate aratap .  it would have to be straight for the engine room .  he set off .  it would be toward the bow  of course .   a man in engineer   s work clothes hurried past him .      when   s the next jump .     called out biron .      about half an hour     the engineer returned over his shoulder .      engine room straight ahead .         and up the ramp .     the man turned suddenly .     who are you .      biron did not answer .  the whip flared a fourth time .  he stepped over the body and went on .  half an hour left .   he heard the noise of men as he sped up the ramp .  the light ahead was white  not purple .  he hesitated .  then he put the whip into his pocket .  they would be busy .  there would be no reason for them to suspect him .   he stepped in quickly .  the men were pygmies scurrying about the huge matter energy converters .  the room glared with dials  a hundred thousand eyes staring their information out to all who would look .  a ship this size  one almost in the class of a large passenger liner  was considerably different from the tiny tyrannian cruiser he had been used to .  there  the engines had been all but automatic .  here they were large enough to power a city  and required considerable supervision .   he was on a railed balcony that circled the engine room .  in one corner there was a small room in which two men handled computers with flying fingers .   he hurried in that direction  while engineers passed him without looking at him  and stepped through the door .   the two at the computers looked at him .      what   s up .     one asked .     what are you doing up here .  get back to your post .     he had a lieutenant   s stripes .   biron said     listen to me .  the hyperatomics have been shorted .  they   ve got to be repaired .         hold on     said the second man     i   ve seen this man .  he   s one of the prisoners .  hold him  lancy .      he jumped up and was making his way out the other door .  biron hurdled the desk and the computer  seized the belt of the controlman   s tunic and pulled him backward .      correct     he said .     i   m one of the prisoners .  i   m biron of widemos .  but what i say is true .  the hyperatomics are shorted .  have them inspected  if you don   t believe me .      the lieutenant found himself staring at a neuronic whip .  he said  carefully     it can   t be done  sir  without orders from officer of the day  or from the commissioner .  it would mean changing the jump calculations and delaying us hours .         get the authority  then .  get the commissioner .         may i use the communicator .         hurry .      the lieutenant   s arm reached out for the flaring mouthpiece of the communicator  and halfway there plummeted down hard upon the row of knobs at one end of his desk .  bells clamored in every corner of the ship .   biron   s club was too late .  it came down hard upon the lieutenant   s wrist .  the lieutenant snatched it away  nursing it and moaning over it  but the warning signals were sounding .   guards were rocketing in upon the balcony through every entrance .  biron slammed out of the control room  looked in either direction  then hopped the railing .   he plummeted down  landing knees bent  and rolled .  he rolled as rapidly as he could to prevent setting himself up as a target .  he heard the soft hissing of a needle gun near his ear  and then he was in the shadow of one of the engines .   he stood up in a crouch  huddling beneath its curve .  his right leg was a stabbing pain .  gravity was high so near the ship   s hull and the drop had been a long one .  he had sprained his knee badly .  it meant that there would be no more chase .  if he won out  it was to be from where he stood .   he called out     hold your firer i am unarmed .     first the club and then the whip he had taken from the guard went spinning out toward the center of the engine room .  they lay there in stark impotence and plain view .   biron shouted     i have come to warn you .  the hyperatomics are shorted .  a jump will mean the death of us all .  i ask only that you check the motors .  you will lose a few hours  perhaps  if i am wrong .  you will save your lives  if i am right .      someone called     go down there and get him .      biron yelled     will you sell your lives rather than listen .      he heard the cautious sound of many feet  and shrank backward .  then there was a sound above .  a soldier was sliding down the engine toward him  hugging its faintly warm skin as though it were a bride .  biron waited .  he could still use his arms .   and then the voice came from above  unnaturally loud  penetrating every corner of the huge room .  it said     back to your places .  halt preparations for the jump .  check the hyperatomics .      it was aratap  speaking through the public address system .  the order then came     bring the young man to me .      biron allowed himself to be taken .  there were two soldiers on each side  holding him as though they expected him to explode .  he tried to force himself to walk naturally  but he was limping badly .     aratap was in semidress .  his eyes seemed different  faded  peering  unfocused .  it occurred to biron that the man wore contact lenses .   aratap said     you have created quite a stir  farrill .         it was necessary to save the ship .  send these guards away .  as long as the engines are being investigated  there   s nothing more i intend doing .         they will stay just awhile .  at least  until i hear from my engine men .      they waited  silently  as the minutes dragged on  and then there was a flash of red upon the frosted glass circle above the glowing lettering that read    engine room .      aratap opened contact .     make your report .      the words that came were crisp and hurried     hyperatomics on the c bank completely shorted .  repairs under way .      aratap said     have jump recalculated for plus six hours .      he turned to biron and said coolly     you were right .      he gestured .  the guards saluted  turned on their heels  and left one by one with a smooth precision .  aratap said     the details  please .         gillbret oth hinriad during his stay in the engine room thought the shorting would be a good idea .  the man is not responsible for his actions and must not be punished for it .      aratap nodded .     he has not been considered responsible for years .  that portion of the events will remain between you and me only .  however  my interest and curiosity are aroused by your reasons for preventing the destruction of the ship .  you are surely not afraid to die in a good cause .         there is no cause     said biron .     there is no rebellion world .  i have told you so already and i repeat it .  lingane was the center of revolt  and that has been checked .  i was interested only in tracking down my father   s murderer  the lady artemisia only in escaping an unwanted marriage .  as for gillbret  he is mad .         yet the autarch believed in the existence of this mysterious planet .  surely he gave me the co ordinates of something .         his belief is based on a madman   s dream .  gillbret dreamed something twenty years ago .  using that as a basis  the autarch calculated five possible planets as the site of this dream world .  it is all nonsense .      the commissioner said     and yet something disturbs me .         what .         you are working so hard to persuade me .  surely i will find all this out for myself once i have made the jump .  consider that it is not impossible that in desperation one of you might endanger the ship and the other save it as a complicated method for convincing me that i need look no further for the rebellion world .  i would say to myself  if there were really such a world  young farrill would have let the ship vaporize  for he is a young man and romantically capable of dying what he would consider a hero   s death .  since he has risked his life to prevent that happening  gillbret is mad  there is no rebellion world  and i will return without searching further .  am i too complicated for you .         no .  i understand you .         and since you have saved our lives  you will receive appropriate consideration in the khan   s court .  you will have saved your life and your cause .  no  young sir  i am not quite so ready to believe the obvious .  we will still make the jump .         i have no objections     said biron .      you are cool     said aratap .     it is a pity you were not born one of us .      he meant it as a compliment .  he went on     we   ll take you back to your cell now  and replace the force field .  a simple precaution .      biron nodded .     the guard that biron had knocked out was no longer there when they returned to the prison room  but the doctor was .  he was bending over the still unconscious form of gillbret .   aratap said     is he still under .      at his voice the doctor jumped up .     the effects of the whip have worn off  commissioner  but the man is not young and has been under a strain .  i don   t know if he will recover .      biron felt horror fill him .  he dropped to his knees  disregarding the wrenching pain  and reached out a hand to touch gillbret   s shoulder gently .      gil     he whispered .  he watched the damp  white face  anxiously .      out of the way  man .     the medical officer was scowling at him .  he removed his black doctor   s wallet from an inner pocket .      at least the hypodermics aren   t broken     he grumbled .  he leaned over gillbret  the hypodermic  filled with its colorless fluid  poised .  it sank deep  and the plunger pressed inward automatically .  the doctor tossed it aside and they waited .   gillbret   s eyes flickered  then opened .  for a while they stared unseeingly .  when he spoke finally  his voice was a whisper .     i can   t see  biron .  i can   t see .      biron leaned close again .     it   s all right  oil .  just rest .         i don   t want to .     he tried to struggle upright .     biron  when are .  they jumping .         soon  soon .         stay with me  then .  i don   t want to die alone .     his fingers clutched feebly  and then relaxed .  his head lolled backward .   the doctor stooped  then straightened .     we were too late .  he   s dead .      tears stung at biron   s eyelids .     i   m sorry  oil     he said     but you didn   t know .  you didn   t understand .     they didn   t hear him .     they were hard hours for biron .  aratap had refused to allow him to attend the ceremonies involved in the burial of a body at space .  somewhere in the ship  he knew  gillbret   s body would be blasted in an atomic furnace and then exhausted into space  where its atoms might mingle forever with the thin wisps of interstellar matter .   artemisia and hinrik would be there .  would they understand .  would she understand that he had done only what he had to do .   the doctor had injected the cartilaginous extract that would hasten the healing of biron   s tom ligaments  and already the pain in his knee was barely noticeable  but then that was only physical pain  anyway .  it could be ignored .   he felt the inner disturbance that meant the ship had jumped and then the worst time came .   earlier he had felt his own analysis to be correct .  it had to be .  but what if he were wrong .  what if they were now at the very heart of rebellion .  the information would go streaking back to tyrann and the armada would gather .  and he himself would die knowing that he might have saved the rebellion  but had risked death to ruin it .   it was during that dark time that he thought of the document again .  the document he had once failed to get .   strange the way the notion of the document came and went .  it would be mentioned  and then forgotten .  there was a mad  intensive search for the rebellion world and yet no search at all for the mysterious vanished document .   was the emphasis being misplaced .   it occurred to biron then that aratap was willing to come upon the rebellion world with a single ship .  what was that confidence he had .  could he dare a planet with a ship .   the autarch had said the document had vanished years before  but then who had it .   the tyranni  perhaps .  they might have a document the secret of which would allow one ship to destroy a world .   if that were true  what did it matter where the rebellion world was  or if it existed at all .     time passed and then aratap entered .  biron rose to his feet .   aratap said     we have reached the star in question .  there is a star there .  the co ordinates given us by the autarch were correct .         well .         but there is no need to inspect it for planets .  the star  i am told by my astrogators  was a nova less than a million years ago .  if it had planets then  they were destroyed .  it is a white dwarf now .  it can have no planets .      biron stared .     then       aratap said     so you are right .  there is no rebellion world .        twenty two     there .     all of aratap   s philosophy could not completely wipe out the feeling of regret within him .  for a while he had not been himself  but his father over again .  he  too  these last weeks had been leading a squadron of ships against the enemies of the khan .   but these were degenerate days  and where there might have been a rebellion world  there was none .  there were no enemies of the khan after all  no worlds to gain .  he remained only a commissioner  still condemned to the soothing of little troubles .  no more .   yet regret was a useless emotion .  it accomplished nothing .   he said     so you are right .  there is no rebellion world .      he sat down and motioned biron into a seat as well .     i want to talk to you .      the young man was staring solemnly at him  and aratap found himself gently amazed that they had met first less than a month ago .  the boy was older now  far more than a month older  and he had lost his fear .  aratap thought to himself  i am growing completely decadent .  how many of us are beginning to like individuals among our subjects .  how many of us wish them well .   he said     i am going to release the director and his daughter .  naturally  it is the politically intelligent thing to do .  in fact  it is politically inevitable .  i think  though  that i will release them now and send them back on the remorseless .  would you care to pilot them .      biron said     are you freeing me .         yes .         why .         you saved my ship  and my life as well .         i doubt that personal gratitude would influence your actions in matters of state .      aratap was within a hair of laughing outright .  he did like the boy .     then i   ll give you another reason .  as long as i was tracking a giant conspiracy against the khan  you were dangerous .  when that giant conspiracy failed to materialize  when all i had was a linganian cabal of which the leader is dead  you were no longer dangerous .  in fact  it would be dangerous to try either you or the linganian captives .      the trials would be in linganian courts and therefore not under our full control .  they would inevitably involve discussion of the so called rebellion world .  and though there is none  half the subjects of tyrann would think there might be one after all  that where there was such a deal of drumming  there must be a drum .  we would have given them a concept to rally round  a reason for revolt  a hope for the future .  the tyrannian realm would not be free of rebellion this side of a century .         then you free us all .         it will not be exactly freedom  since none of you is exactly loyal .  we will deal with lingane in our own way  and the next autarch will find himself bound by closer ties to the khanate .  it will be no longer an associated state  and trials involving linganians will not necessarily be tried in linganian courts hereafter .  those involved in the conspiracy  including those in our hands now  will be exiled to worlds nearer tyrann  where they will be fairly harmless .  you yourself cannot return to nephelos and need not expect to be restored to your ranch .  you will stay on rhodia  along with colonel rizzett .         good enough      said biron     but what of the lady artemisia   s marriage .         you wish it stopped .         you must know that we would like to marry each other .  you said once there might be some way of stopping the tyrannian affair .         at the time i said that i was trying to accomplish something .  what is the old saying .     the lies of lovers and diplomats shall be forgiven them .             but there is a way  commissioner .  it need only be pointed out to the khan that when a powerful courtier would marry into an important subject family  it may be motives of ambition that lead him on .  a subject revolt may be led by an ambitious tyrannian as easily as by an ambitious linganian .      aratap did laugh this time .     you reason like one of us .  but it wouldn   t work .  would you want my advice .         what would it be .         marry her yourself  quickly .  a thing once done would be difficult to undo under the circumstances .  we would find another woman for pohang .      biron hesitated .  then he put out a hand .     thank you  sir .      aratap took it .     i don   t like pohang particularly  anyway .  still  there is one thing further for you to remember .  don   t let ambition mislead you .  though you marry the director   s daughter  you will never yourself be director .  you are not the type we want .        aratap watched the shrinking remorseless in the visiplate and was glad the decision had been made .  the young man was free  a message was already on its way to tyrann through the sub ether .  major andros would undoubtedly swell into apoplexy  and there would not be wanting men at court to demand his recall as commissioner .   if necessary  he would travel to tyrann .  somehow he would see the khan and make him listen .  given all the facts  the king of kings would see plainly that no other course of action was possible  and thereafter he could defy any possible combination of enemies .   the remorseless was only a gleaming dot now  scarcely distinguishable from the stars that were beginning to surround it now that they were emerging from the nebula .   rizzett watched the shrinking tyrannian flagship in the visiplate .  he said     so the man let us got you know  if the tyranni were all like him  damned if i wouldn   t join their fleet .  it upsets me in a way .  i have definite notions of what tyranni are like  and he doesn   t fit .  do you suppose he can hear what we say .      biron set the automatic controls and swiveled in the pilot   s seat .     no .  of course not .  he can follow us through hyperspace as he did before  but i don   t think he can put a spy beam on us .  you remember that when he first captured us all he knew about us was what he overheard on the fourth planet .  no more .      artemisia stepped into the pilot room  her finger on her lips .     not too loudly     she said .     i think he   s sleeping now .  it won   t be long before we reach rhodia  will it  biron .         we can do it in one jump  arta .  aratap had it calculated for us .      rizzett said     i   ve got to wash my hands .      they watched him leave  and then she was in biron   s arms .  he kissed her lightly on forehead and eyes  then found her lips as his arms tensed about her .  the kiss came to a lingering and breathless end .  she said     i love you very much     and he said     i love you more than i can say .     the conversation that followed was both as unoriginal as that and as satisfying .   biron said after a while     will he marry us before we land .      artemisia frowned a little .     i tried to explain that he   s director and captain of the ship and that there are no tyranni here .  i don   t know though .  he   s quite upset .  he   s not himself at all  biron .  after he   s rested  i   ll try again .      biron laughed softly .     don   t worry .  he   ll be persuaded .      rizzett   s footsteps were noisy as he returned .  he said     i wish we still had the trailer .  there isn   t room here to take a deep breath .      biron said     we   ll be on rhodia in a matter of hours .  we   ll be jumping soon .         i know .     rizzett scowled .     and we   ll stay on rhodia till we die .  not that i   m complaining overloud  i   m glad i   m alive .  but it   s a silly end to it all .         there hasn   t been any ending     said biron softly .   rizzett looked up .     you mean we can start allover .  no  i don   t think so .  you can  perhaps  but not i .  i   m too old and there   s nothing left for me .  lingane will be dragged into line and i   ll never see it again .  that bothers me most of all  i think .  i was born there and lived there all my life .  i won   t be but half a man anywhere else .  you   re young  you   ll forget nephelos .         there   s more to life than a home planet  tedor .  it   s been our great shortcoming in the past centuries that we   ve been unable to recognize that fact .  all planets are our home planets .         maybe .  maybe .  if there had been a rebellion world  why  then  it might have been so .         there is a rebellion world  tedor .      rizzett said sharply     i   m in no mood for that  biron .         i   m not telling a lie .  there is such a world and i know its location .  i might have known it weeks ago  and so might anyone in our party .  the facts were all there .  they were knocking at my mind without being able to get in until that moment on the fourth planet when you and i had beat down jonti .  do you remember him standing there  saying that we would never find the fifth planet without his help .  do you remember his words .         exactly .  no .         i think i do .  he said     there is an average of seventy cubic light years per star .  if you work by trial and error  without me  the odds are two hundred and fifty quadrillion to one against your coming within a billion miles of any star .  any star .     it was at that moment  i think  that the facts got into my mind .  i could feel the click .         nothing clicks in my mind     said rizzett .     suppose you explain a bit .      artemisia said     i don   t see what you can mean  biron .      biron said     don   t you see that it is exactly those odds which gillbret is supposed to have defeated .  you remember his story .  the meteor hit  deflected his ship   s course  and at the end of its jumps  it was actually within a stellar system .  that could have happened only by a coincidence so incredible as to be not worth any belief .         then it was a madman   s story and there is no rebellion world .         unless there is a condition under which the odds against landing within a stellar system are less incredible  and there is such a condition .  in fact  there is one set of circumstances  and only one  under which he must have reached a system .  it would have been inevitable .         well .         you remember the autarch   s reasoning .  the engines of gillbret   s ship were not interfered with  so the power of the hyperatomic thrusts  or  in other words  the lengths of the jumps  were not changed .  only their direction was changed in such a way that one of the five stars in an incredibly vast area of the nebula was reached .  it was an interpretation which  on the very face of it  was improbable .         but the alternative .         why  that neither power nor direction was altered .  there is no real reason to suppose the direction of drive to have been interfered with .  that was only assumption .  what if the ship had simply followed its original course .  it had been aimed at a stellar system  therefore it ended in a stellar system .  the matter of odds doesn   t enter .         but the stellar system it was aimed at            was that of rhodia .  so he went to rhodia .  is that so obvious that it   s difficult to grasp .      artemisia said     but then the rebellion world must be at home .  that   s impossible .         why impossible .  it is somewhere in the rhodian system .  there are two ways of hiding an object .  you can put it where no one can find it  as  for instance  within the horsehead nebula .  or else you can put it where no one would ever think of looking  right in front of their eyes in plain view .      consider what happened to gillbret after landing on the rebellion world .  he was returned to rhodia alive .  his theory was that this was in order to prevent a tyrannian search for the ship which might come dangerously close to the world itself .  but then why was he kept alive .  if the ship had been returned with gillbret dead  the same purpose would have been accomplished and there would have been no chance of gillbret   s talking  as  eventually  he did .      again  that can only be explained by supposing the rebellion world to be within the rhodian system .  gillbret was a hinriad  and where else would there be such respect for the life of a hinriad but in rhodia .      artemisia   s hands clenched spasmodically .     but if what you say is true  biron  then father is in terrible danger .         and has been for twenty years     agreed biron     but perhaps not in the manner you think .  gillbret once told me how difficult it was to pretend to be a dilettante and a good for nothing  to pretend so hard that one had to live the part even with friends and even when alone .  of course  with him  poor fellow  it was largely self dramatization .  he didn   t really live the part .  his real self came out easily enough with you  arta .  it showed to the autarch .  he even found it necessary to show it to me on fairly short acquaintance .      but it is possible  i suppose  to really live such a life completely  if your reasons are sufficiently important .  a man might live a lie even to his daughter  be willing to see her terribly married rather than risk a lifework that depended on complete tyrannian trust  be willing to seem half a madman       artemisia found her voice .  she said huskily     you can   t mean what you   re saying .         there is no other meaning possible  arta .  he has been director over twenty years .  in that time rhodia has been continually strengthened by territory granted it by the tyranni  because they felt it would be safe with him .  for twenty years he has organized rebellion without interference from them  because he was so obviously harmless .         you   re guessing  biron     said rizzett     and this kind of a guess is as dangerous as the ones we   ve made before .      biron said     this is no guess .  i told jonti in that last discussion of ours that he  not the director  must have been the traitor who murdered my father  because my father would never have been foolish enough to trust the director with any incriminating information .  but the point is  and i knew it at the time  that this was just what my father did .  gillbret learned of jonti   s conspiratorial role through what he overheard in the discussions between my father and the director .  there is no other way in which he could have learned it .      but a stick points both ways .  we thought my father was working for jonti and trying to enlist the support of the director .  why is it not equally probable  or even more probable  that he was working for the director and that his role within jonti   s organization was as an agent of the rebellion world attempting to prevent a premature explosion on lingane that would ruin two decades of careful planning .      why do you suppose it seemed so important to me to save aratap   s ship when gillbret shorted the motors .  it wasn   t for myself .  i didn   t  at the time  think aratap would free me  no matter what .  it wasn   t even so much for you  arta .  it was to save the director .  he was the important man among us .  poor gillbret didn   t understand that .      rizzett shook his head .     i   m sorry .  i just can   t make myself believe all that .      it was a new voice that spoke .     you may as well .  it is true .     the director was standing just outside the door  tall and somber eyed .  it was his voice and yet not quite his voice .  it was crisp and sure of itself .   artemisia ran to him .     father .  biron says          i heard what biron said .     he was stroking her hair with long  gentle motions of the hand .     and it is true .  i would even have let your marriage take place .      she stepped back from him  almost in embarrassment .     you sound so different .  you sound almost as if          as if i weren   t your father .     he said it sadly .     it will not be for long  arta .  when we are back on rhodia  i will be as you knew me  and you must accept me so .      rizzett stared at him  his usually ruddy complexion as gray as his hair .  biron was holding his breath .   hinrik said     come here  biron .      he placed a hand on biron   s shoulder .     there was a time  young man  when i was ready to sacrifice your life .  the time may come again in the future .  until a certain day i can protect neither of you .  i can be nothing but what i have always seemed .  do you understand that .      each nodded .      unfortunately     said hinrik     damage has been done .  twenty years ago i was not as hardened to my role as i am today .  i should have ordered gillbret killed  but i could not .  because i did not  it is now known that there is a rebellion world and that i am its leader .         only we know that     said biron .   hinrik smiled bitterly .     you think that because you are young .  do you think aratap is less intelligent than yourself .  the reasoning by which you determined the location and leadership of the rebellion world is based on facts known to him  and he can reason as well as you .  it is merely that he is older  more cautious  that he has grave responsibilities .  he must be certain .      do you think he released you out of sentiment .  i believe that you have been freed now for the same reason you were freed once before  simply that you might lead him farther along the path that leads to me .      biron was pale .     then i must leave rhodia .         no .  that would be fatal .  there would seem no reason for you to leave  save the true one .  stay with me and they will remain uncertain .  my plans are nearly completed .  one more year  perhaps  or less .         but director  there are factors you may not be aware of .  there is the matter of the document          for which your father was searching .         yes .         your father  my boy  did not know all there was to know .  it is not safe to have anyone in possession of all the facts .  the old rancher discovered the existence of the document independently in the references to it in my library .  i   ll give him credit .  he recognized its significance .  but if he had consulted me  i would have told him it was no longer on earth .         that   s exactly it  sir .  i am certain the tyranni have it .         but of course not .    have it .  i   ve had it for twenty years .  it was what started the rebellion world  for it was only when i had it that i knew we could hold our winnings once we had won .         it is a weapon  then .         it is the strongest weapon in the universe .  it will destroy the tyranni and us alike  but will save the nebular kingdoms .  without it  we could perhaps defeat the tyranni  but we would only have exchanged one feudal despotism for another  and as the tyranni are plotted against  we would be plotted against .  we and they must both be delivered into the ashcan of outmoded political systems .  the time for maturity has come as it once came on the planet earth  and there will be a new kind of government  a kind that has never yet been tried in the galaxy .  there will be no khans  no autarchs  directors  or ranchers .         in the name of space     roared rizzett suddenly     what will there be .         people .         people .  how can they govern .  there must be some one person to make decisions .         there is a way .  the blueprint i have  dealt with a small section of one planet  but it can be adapted to all the galaxy .      the director smiled .     come  children  i may as well marry you .  it can do little more harm now .      biron   s hand tightly enclosed artemisia   s and she was smiling at him .  they felt the queer inward twinge as the remorseless made its single precalculated jump .   biron said     before you start  sir  will you tell me something about the blueprint you mention  so that my curiosity will be satisfied and i can keep my mind on arta .      artemisia laughed and said     you had better do it  father .  i couldn   t bear an abstracted groom .      hinrik smiled .     i know the document by heart .  listen .      and with rhodia   s sun bright on the visiplate  hinrik began with those words that were older  far older  than any of the planets in the galaxy save one         we the people of the united states  in order to form a more perfect union  establish justice  insure domestic tranquility  provide for the common defense  promote the general welfare  and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america .  .  .  .
