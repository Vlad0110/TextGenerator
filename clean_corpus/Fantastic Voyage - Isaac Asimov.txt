contributed to its present form in many different ways .  for all of us  it was a long and arduous task and a great challenge  but also one of deep satisfaction and  i may say  of great delight .  when jay l .  bixby and i wrote our original story  little did we know where it would lead or what would become of it in the hands of men of great imagination and superb artistry saul david  the film s producer  richard fleischer  the director and inspired conjurer of fancy  harry kleiner  who wrote the screenplay  dale hennesy  the art director and an artist in his own right  and the doctors and scientists who gave us so much of their time and their thinking .  and finally  isaac asimov  who lent his pen and great talent to give form and reality to this phantasmagoria of facts and fancy .       chapter     plane      it was an old plane  a four engine plasma jet that had been retired from active service  and it came in along a route that was neither economical nor particularly safe .  it nosed through the cloud banks on a trip that took it twelve hours where five might have sufficed with a rocket powered supersonic .     and there was well over an hour to go .     the agent aboard knew that his part of the job wouldn t be finished till the plane touched down and that the last hour would be the longest .     he glanced at the only other man in the large passenger cabin napping for the moment  with his chin buried in his chest .     the passenger didn t look particularly striking or impressive  but at the moment  he was the most important man in the world .       general alan carter looked up glumly when the colonel walked in .  carter s eyes were pouchy and the corners of his mouth sagged .  he tried to bend the paper clip he was manhandling back into shape and it flicked out of his hand .      nearly got me that time   said colonel donald reid  calmly .  his sandy hair lay back smoothly but his short  graying mustache bristled .  he wore his uniform with the same indefinable unnaturalness that the other did .  both were specialists  drafted for work in a super specialty  with military rank for convenience and  considering the applications of the field  somewhat out of necessity .     both had the cmdf insignia .  each letter  was in a small hexagon  two above  three below .  the middle hexagon of the three bore the symbol that further classified the man .  in the case of reid  it was the caduceus that marked him as a medical man .      guess what i m doing   said the general .      flipping paper clips .       sure .  and counting the hours  too .  like a fool .   his voice rose a controlled notch .   i sit here with my hands wet  my hair sticky  my heart pounding  and i count the hours .  only now it   s the minutes .  seventy two minutes  don .  seventy two minutes and they re down at the airport .       all right .  why be nervous  then .  is there anything wrong .       no .  nothing .  he was picked up safely .  he was taken right out of their hands with  as far as we know  not a hitch .  he got safely into the plane  an old one  .  .        yes .  i know .      carter shook his head .  he wasn t interested in telling the other something new  he was interested in talking .   we figured that they would figure that we would figure time was of the utmost importance  so that we would pile him into an x    and rocket him through inner space .  only we figured they would figure that and have the anti missile network at saturation level  .  .  .       reid said   paranoia  we call it in my profession .  i mean  for anyone to believe they d do that .  they d risk war and annihilation .       they might risk just that to stop what s happening .  i d almost feel we ought to risk it if the situation were reversed .   so we took a commercial plane  a four engine plasma jet .  i was wondering if it could take off  it was so old .       did it .       did it what .   for a moment  the general had sunk into blackened thought .      take off .       yes  yes .  it s coming along fine .  i get my reports from grant .       who s he .       the agent in charge .  i know  .  him .  with him in charge  i feel as safe as it is possible to feel  which isn t much .  grant ran the whole thing  flicked benes out of their hands like a seed out of a watermelon .       well  then .       but i still worry .  i tell you  reid  there s only one safe way of handling matters in this darned racket .  you ve got to believe they re as smart as we are  that for every trick we ve got  they ve got a counter trick  that for every man we ve got planted on their side  they ve got one planted on ours .  this has been going on for over half a century now     we ve got to be evenly matched  or it would have been all over long ago .       take it easy  al .       how can i .  this thing now  this thing benes is bringing with him  this new knowledge  may end the stalemate once and for all .  and with ourselves as winners .      reid said   i hope the others don t think so  too .  if they do  .  .  .  you know  al  so far there have been rules to this game .  one side doesn t do anything to back the other side into a corner so tight he has to use his missile buttons .  you ve got to leave him a safe ledge to step back on .  push hard but not too hard .  when benes gets here  they may get the notion they re being pushed too hard .       we have no choice but to risk that .   then  as the afterthought plagued him   if he gets here .       he will  won t he .      carter had risen to his feet  as though to begin a hasty walk back and forth to nowhere .  he stared at the other  then sat down abruptly .   all right  why get excited .  you ve got that tranquilizer gleam in your eye  doctor .  i don t need any happy pills .  but suppose he does get here in seventy two    sixty six minutes .  suppose he lands at the airport .  he s still got to be brought here  to be kept here  safely  .   .   .  there s many a slip  .   .   .       twixt the cup and the lip   sing songed reid .   look here  general  shall we be sensible and talk about consequences .  i mean what happens after he gets here .       come on  don  let s wait for that till he does get here .       come on  al   mimicked the colonel  an edge appearing on his own words .   it won t do to wait till he gets here .  it will be too late when he gets here .  you ll be too busy  then  and all the little ants at headquarters will start rushing about madly  so that nothing will get done where i think it needs to be done .       i promise  .  .  .    the general s gesture was a vague one of dismissal .     reid ignored it .   no .  you re going to be unable to keep any promise you make for the future .  call the chief now  will you .  now .  you can get through to him .  right now  you re the only one who can get through to him .  get him to understand that cmdf isn t the handmaiden of defense only .  or if you can t  get in touch with commissioner furnald .  he s on our side .  tell him i want some crumbs for the bio sciences .  point out there are votes on this .  look  al  we ve got to have a voice loud enough to be heard .  we ve got to have some fighting chance .  once benes gets here and is jumped by all the real generals  damn them  we ll be out of commission forever .       i can t  don .  and i won   t .   if you want it straight  i m not doing a darned thing till i ve got benes here .  and i don t take it kindly your trying to put the arm on me at this time .      reid s lips went white .   what am i supposed to do  general .       wait as i am waiting .  count the minutes .      reid turned to go .  his anger remained under tight control .   i d reconsider the tranquilizer if i were you  general .      carter watched him go without comment .  he looked at his watch .   sixty one minutes .   he muttered  and groped for a paper clip .       it was almost with relief that reid stepped into the office of dr .  michaels  the civilian head of the medical division .  the expression on michaels  broad face might never move higher than a quiet cheerfulness accompanied by  at most  a dry chuckle  but  on the other hand  it never dropped lower than a twinkling solemnity that never took itself  it would seem  too seriously .     he had the inevitable chart in his hand  or one of them .  to colonel reid  all those charts were alike   each a hopeless maze  and taken together  they were hopelessness many times compounded .     occasionally  michaels would try to explain the charts to him  or to almost anyone michaels was pathetically eager to explain it all .     the blood stream  it seemed  was tagged with a trace of mild radioactivity and the organism  it could be a man or a mouse  then took its own photograph  so to speak  on a laserized principle that produced a three dimensional image .     well  never mind that  michaels would say at that point .  you get a picture of the entire circulatory system in three dimensions which can then be recorded two dimensionally in as large a number of sections and projections as would be required for the job .  you could get down to the smallest capillaries  if the picture were properly enlarged .      and that leaves me just a geographer   michaels would add .   a geographer of the human body  plotting its rivers and bays  its inlets and streams  much more complicated than anything on earth  i assure you .      reid looked at the chart over michaels  shoulder and said   whose is that  max .       no one s to speak of .   michaels tossed it aside .   i m waiting  that s all .  when someone else waits  he reads a book .  i read a blood system .       you re waiting  too  eh .  so s he .   reid s head nodded backward in the general direction of carter s office .   waiting for the same thing .       for benes to get here .  of course .  and yet  you know  i don t entirely believe it .       don t believe what .       i m not sure the man has what he says he has .  i m a physiologist  to be sure  and not a physicist   michaels shrugged in self deprecatory humor   but i like to believe the experts .  they say there s no way .  i hear them say that the uncertainty principle makes it impossible to do it for longer than a given time .  and you can t argue with .  the uncertainty principle  can you .       i m no expert either  max  but those same experts tell us that benes is the biggest expert of them all in this field .  the other side has had him and they ve kept even with us just because of him  just because of him .  they have no one else in the first rank  while we have zaletsky  kramer  richtheim  lindsay and all the rest .   and our biggest men believe he must have something  if he says he does .       do they .  or do they just think we can t afford not to take a chance on it .  after all  even if he turns out to have nothing  we win just out of his defection .  the others would no longer have the use of his service .       why should he lie .      michaels said   why not .  it s getting him out .  it s getting him here  where i suppose he wants to be .  if it turns out he has nothing  we re not going to send him back  are we .  besides  he may not be lying  he may just be mistaken .       hmph   reid tilted his chair back and put his feet on the desk in most un colonel like manner .   you ve got a point there .  and if he diddles us  it would serve carter right .  serve them all right .  the fools .       you got nothing out of carter  eh .       nothing .  he won t do a thing till benes comes .  he s counting the minutes and now so am i .  it s forty two minutes .       till when .       till the plane carrying him lands at the airport .   and the bio sciences have nothing .  if benes is just pulling off a deal to escape from the other side  we have nothing  and if it s legitimate  we ll still have nothing .  defense will take it all  every slice  every crumb  every smell .  it will be too pretty to play with and they ll never let it go .       nonsense .  maybe just at first  they will hang on  but we have our pressures  too .  we can turn duval loose on them  the intense  god fearing peter .      a look of distaste came across reid s face .   i would love to throw him at the military .  the way i feel now  i would love to throw  him at carter  too .  if duval were negatively charged and carter positively charged and i could get them together and let them spark each other to death  .  .  .        don t get destructive  don .  you take duval too seriously .  a surgeon is an artist  a sculptor of living tissue .  a great surgeon is a great  artist and has the temperament of one .       well  i have temperament  too  and i don t use it to be one large pain in the neck .  what gives duval a monopoly on the right to be offensive and arrogant .       if he had the monopoly  my colonel  i would be delighted .  i would leave it to him with all possible gratitude  if he had it all .  the trouble is there are so many other offensive  arrogant characters in the world .       i suppose so .  i suppose so   muttered reid  but he was unmollified .   thirty seven minutes .        if anyone had repeated reid s capsule description of duval to dr .  peter lawrence duval  it would have been met with the same short grunt that a confession of love would have been met with .  it was hot that duval was insensible to either insult or to adoration  it was merely that he reacted to them when he had time  and he rarely had time .     it was not a scowl that he habitually wore on his face  it was rather the muscular contraction that came with thoughts that were elsewhere .  presumably all men have their escape from the world  duval s was the simple one of concentration upon his work .     that route had brought him  by his mid forties  to international renown as a brain surgeon  and to his scarce realized status of bachelorhood .     nor did he look up from the careful measurements he was making on the tri dimensionalized x ray photographs that lay before him when the door opened .  his assistant came in with the accustomed noiseless steps .      what is it  miss peterson .   he asked  and squinted even more painfully at the photographs .  the depth perception was plain enough to the eye  but measuring the actual depth called for a delicate consideration of angles  plus an advance knowledge of what that depth was likely to be in the first place .     cora peterson waited for the moment of additional concentration to pass .  she was twenty five  just twenty years younger than duval  and her master s degree  only a year old  had been carefully laid at the feet of the surgeon .     in the letters she wrote home  she explained almost every time that each day with duval was a college course  that to study his methods  his techniques of diagnosis  his handling of the tools of his trade was to be edified beyond belief .  as for his dedication to his work and to the cause of healing  that could only be described as inspiring .     in less intellectualized fashion  she was perfectly aware  with almost the awareness of a professional physiologist  of the quickening of her heartbeat as she took in the planes and curves of his face bent over his work and noted the quick  sure  unwavering motion of his fingers .     her face remained impassive  however  for she disapproved of the action of her unintellectual heart muscle .     her mirror told her  plainly enough  that she was not plain .  quite otherwise .  her dark eyes were ingenuously wide set  her lips reflected quick humor when she let them do so which wasn t often  and her figure annoyed her for its apparent propensity for interfering with the proper understanding of her professional competence .  it was for her ability she wanted wolf whistles  or their intellectual equivalent  and not for the sinuosity she couldn t help .     duval  at least  appreciated her efficiency and seemed unmoved by her attractiveness and for that she admired him the more .     she said  finally    benes will be landing in less than thirty minutes  doctor .       hmm .   he looked up .   why are you here .  your day s over .      cora might have retorted that his was  too  but she knew well that his day was over only when his work was done .     she had stayed with him through the sixteenth consecutive hour often enough  although she imagined he would maintain  in all honesty  that he kept her firmly to an eight hour day .     she said   i m waiting to see him .       whom .       genes .  doesn t it excite you  doctor .       no .  why should it .       he s a great scientist  and they say he has important information that will revolutionize all we re doing .       it will  will it .   duval lifted the photograph on top of the heap  placed it to one side  and turned to the next .   how will it help you with your laser work .       it can make the target easier to hit .       it already does that .  for what benes will add  only the war makers will have any use .  all benes will do will be to increase the probability of world destruction .       but dr .  duval  you ve said that the extension of the technique could be of great .  importance to the neurophysiologist .       have i .  all right  then  i have .  but just the same i d rather you got your proper rest  miss peterson .   he looked up again  his voice softening just a bit  perhaps .     you look tired .      cora s hand lifted half way to her hair  for translated into the feminine  the word  tired  means  disheveled .   she said   once benes arrives  i will .  i promise .   by the way .       yes .       will you be using the laser tomorrow .       it s what i m trying to decide right now .   if you ll let me  miss peterson .       the      model can t be used .      duval put the photograph down  leaned back .   why not .       it s not reliable enough .  i can t get it to focus properly .  i suspect one of the tunnel diodes is faulty but i haven t located which one yet .       all right .  you set up one that can be trusted just in case we need it  and do it before you leave .  then tomorrow  .  .  .        then tomorrow i ll track down what s wrong with the      .       yes .       she turned to leave  looked quickly at her watch  and said   twenty one minutes and they say the .  plane s on time .      he made a vague sound and she knew he hadn t heard .  she left  closing the door behind her slowly  and with muffled silence .       captain william owens sank back into the softly cushioned seat of the limousine .  he rubbed his sharp nose tiredly and set his wide jaws .  he felt the car lift on its firm jets of compressed air  then move forward with absolute levelness .     he caught no whisper of the turbo engine  though five hundred horses champed behind him .     through the bullet proof windows to right and left  he could see a motorcycle escort .  other cars were before and behind  glimmering the night into a liveness of shielded light .     it made him seem important  this half an army of guardians  but it wasn t for him  of course .  it wasn t even for the man they were going out to meet  not for the man as a man .     only for the contents of a great mind .     the head of the secret service was to owens  left .  it was a sign of the anonymity of the service that owens was not sure of the name of this nondescript man who  from rimless glasses to conservative shoes  seemed a college professor or a haberdasher s clerk .      colonel gander   owens had said  tentatively  on shaking hands .      gonder   was the quiet response .   good evening  captain owens .       they were on the outskirts of the air field  now .  somewhere above and ahead  surely not more than a few miles distant  was the archaic plane  preparing for a landing .      a great day  eh .   said gonder  softly .  everything about the man seemed to whisper  even the unobtrusive cut of his civilian clothing .      yes   said owens  striving to keep the tension out of that monosyllable .  it was not that he felt particularly tense  it was merely that his voice always seemed to carry that tone .  it was that air of tension that seemed to fit his narrow  pinched nose  his slitted eyes  and the high jut of his cheekbones .     he sometimes felt it got in his way .  people expected him to be neurotic when he wasn t .  not more so than others were  anyway .  on the other hand  people sometimes got out of his way for just that reason  without his having to lift a hand .  matters evened out  perhaps .     owens said   quite a coup  getting him here .  the service is to be congratulated .       the credit belongs to our agent .  he s our best man .  his secret  i think  is that he looks like the romantic stereotype of an agent .       looks like one .       tall .  played football at college .  good looking .  terribly clean cut .  one look at him and any enemy would say  there .  that s what one of their secret agents ought to look like  so of course  he can t be one .   and they dismiss him and find out too late that he is one .      owens frowned .  was the man serious .  or was he joking because he thought that would bring relief of tension .     gonder said   you realize  of course  that your part in this isn t something to be dismissed off hand .  you will know him  won t you .       i ll know him   said owens  with his short  nervous laugh .   i ve met him several times at scientific conferences on the other side .  i got drunk with him one night  well  not really drunk  joyous .       did he talk .       i didn t get him drunk to make him talk .  but anyway  he didn t talk .  there was someone else with him .  their scientists go two by two at all times .       did you talk .   the question was light  the intent behind it was clearly not .     owens laughed again .   believe me  colonel  there is nothing i know that he doesn t .  i could talk to him all day without harm .       i wish i knew something about this .  you have my admiration  captain .  here is a technological miracle capable of transforming the world and there are only a handful of men who can understand it .  man s mind is getting away from man .       it s not that bad  really   said owens .   there are quite a lot of us .  there s only one benes  of course  and i m miles from being in his class  in fact  i don t know much more than enough to apply the technique to my ship designs .  that s all .       but you ll recognize benes .   the secret service head seemed to require infinite reassurance .      even if he had a twin brother  which i m sure he doesn t  i d recognize him .       it s not exactly an academic point  captain .  our agent  grant  is good as i ve said  but even so i am a little surprised that he managed it .  i have to ask myself  is there a double double cross involved .  did they expect us to try to get benes and have they prepared a pseudo benes .       i can tell the difference   said owens  confidently .      you don t know what can be done these days with plastic surgery and narco hypnosis .        it doesn t matter .  the face can fool me  but the conversation won t .  either he knows the technique   owens  momentary whisper clearly capitalized the word   better than i do  or he s not benes  whatever he looks like .  they can fake benes  body  perhaps  but not his mind .      they were on the field now .  colonel gonder looked at his watch .   i hear it .  the ship will be landing in minutes and on time .      armed men and armored vehicles splayed out to join those that had already surrounded the air field and turned it into occupied territory sealed off against all but authorized personnel .     the last of the city s lights had faded out  doing no more than to fuzz the horizon to the left .  owens  sigh was one of infinite relief .  benes would be here  at last  in one more moment .     happy ending .     he frowned at the intonation in his mind that had put a question mark after those two words .     happy ending .  he thought grimly  but the intonation slithered out of control so that it became happy ending .     again .       chapter     car      grant watched the lights of the city approaching with intense relief as the plane began its long approach .  no one had given him any real details as to the importance of dr .  benes except for the obvious fact that he was a defecting scientist with vital information .  he was the most important man in the world  they had said and then had neglected to explain why .     don t press  they had told him .  don t throw the grease in the fan by getting tense .  but the whole thing is vital  they said .  unbelievably vital .     take it easy  they had said  but everything depends on it  your country  your world  humanity .     so it was done .  he might never have made it if they hadn t been afraid of killing benes .  by the time they got to the point where they realized that killing benes was the only way they could salvage even a draw  it was too late and he was out .     a bullet crease over the ribs was all grant had to show for it and a long band aid took care of that .     he was tired now  however  tired to the bone .  physically tired  of course  but also tired of the whole crazy foolishness .  in his college days  ten years before  they had called him granite grant and he had tried to live up to that on the football field  like a dumb jerk .  one broken arm was the result but at least he was lucky enough to have kept his teeth and nose intact so that he could retain that craggy set of good looks .   his lips twitched into a silent  flicking smile .      and since then  too  he had discouraged the use of first names .  only the monosyllabic grunt of grant .  very masculine .  very strong .     except to heck with it .  what was it getting him except weariness and every prospect of a short life .  he had just passed thirty now and it was time to retire to his first name .     charles grant .  maybe even charlie grant .  good old charlie grant .     he winced  but then frowned himself firm again .  it had to be .  good old charlie .  that was it .  good old soft charlie who likes to sit in an arm chair and rock .  hi  charlie  nice day .  hey  there  charlie  looks like rain .     get yourself a soft job  good old charlie  and snooze your way to your pension .     grant looked sidewise at jan benes .  even he found something familiar about that shock of grizzled hair  the face with its strong  fleshy nose above the untidy  coarse mustache  likewise grizzled .  cartoonists made do with that nose and mustache alone  but there were his eyes  too  nested in fine wrinkles  and there were the horizontal lines that never left his forehead .  benes  clothes were moderately ill fitting  but they had left hurriedly  without time for the better tailors .  the scientist was pushing fifty  grant knew  but he looked older .     benes was leaning forward  watching the lights of the approaching city .     grant said   ever been to this part of the country before  professor .       i have never been to any part of your country   said benes   or was that intended to be a trick question .   there was a faint but definite trace of accent in his speech .      no .  just making conversation .  that s our second largest city up ahead .  you can have it  though .  i m from the other end of the country .       to me it doesn t matter .  one end .  the other end .  as long as i m here .  it will be  .  .  .   he didn t finish the sentence but there was a sadness in his eyes .     breaking away is hard  thought grant  even when you feel you must .  he said   we ll see to it you have no time to brood  professor .  we ll put you to work .      benes retained his sadness .   i m sure of that .  i expect it .  it is the price i pay  no .       i m afraid so .  you caused us a certain amount of effort  you know .      benes put his hand on grant s sleeve .   you risked your life .  i appreciate that .  you might have been killed .       i run the chance of being killed as a matter of routine .  occupational hazard .  they pay me for it .  not as well as for playing a guitar  you understand  or for hitting a baseball  but about what they feel my life is worth .       you can t dismiss it so .       i ve got to .  my organization does .  when i come back  there will be a shake of hands and an embarrassed  good work .    you know  manly reserve and all that .  then it s   now for the next assignment and we have to deduct for that band aid you have on your side .  have to watch expenses .        your game of cynicism doesn t fool me  young man .       it has to fool me  professor  or i would quit .   grant was almost surprised at the sudden bitterness in his voice .   strap yourself in  professor .  this flying junkheap makes rough landings .        the plane touched down smoothly  despite grant s prediction  and taxied to a stop  turning as it did so .     the secret service contingent closed in .  soldiers leaped out of troop carrying trucks to form a cordon about the plane  leaving a corridor for the motorized stairway steering its way toward the door of the plane .     a convoy of three limousines rolled to near the foot of the stairway .     owens said   you re piling on the security  colonel .       better too much than too little .   his lips moved almost silently in what the astonished owens recognized to be a quick prayer .     owens said   i m glad he s here .       not as glad as i am .  planes have blown up in mid flight before this  you know .      the door to the plane opened and grant appeared momentarily at the opening .  he looked about  then waved .     colonel gonder said   he seems in one piece anyway .  where s benes .      as though in answer to that question  grant flattened to one side and let benes squeeze past .  benes stood there smiling for one moment .  carrying one battered suitcase in his hand  he trotted gingerly down the stops .  grant followed .  behind him were the pilot and co pilot .     colonel gonder was at the foot of the stairs .   professor benes .  glad to have you here .  i m gonder  i ll be in charge of your safety from this point .  this is william owens .  you know him  i think .      benes  eyes lit up and his arms went high as he dropped his suitcase .   colonel gonder unobtrusively picked it up .    owens .  yes  of course .  we got drunk one night together .  i remember it well .  a long  dull  boring session in the afternoon  where all that was interesting was precisely what one could not say  so that despair settled on me like a gray blanket .  at supper  owens and i met .  there were five altogether of his colleagues with him  but i don t remember the others very well .      but owens and i  we went to a little club afterward  with dancing and jazz  and we drank schnapps  and owens was very friendly with one of the girls .  you remember jaroslavie  owens .       the fellow who was with you .   ventured owens .      exactly .  he loved schnapps with a love that passeth understanding  but he was not allowed to drink .  he had to stay sober .  strict orders .       to watch you .      benes signified assent by a single long vertical movement of his head and a sober out thrusting of his lower lips .   i kept offering him liquor .  i said  here  milan  a dusty throat is bad for a man  and he had to keep refusing  but with his heart in his eyes .  it was wicked of me .      owens smiled and nodded .   but let s get into the limousine and get down to headquarters .  we ll have to show you around  first  and let everyone see you re here .  after that  i promise you that you ll sleep for twenty four hours if you want to before we ask you any questions .       sixteen will do .  but first   he looked about anxiously .   where is grant .  ach  there is grant .      he pushed toward the young agent .   grant .   he held out his hand   good bye .  thank you .  thank you very much .  i will see you again  not so .       could be   said grant .   i m an easy man to see .  just look for the nearest rotten job  and i ll be right there on top of it .       i m glad you took this rotten one .      grant reddened .   this rotten one had an important point to it  professor .  glad to be of help .  i mean that .       i know .  good bye .  good bye .   benes waved  stepped back toward the limousine .     grant turned to the colonel   will i be breaking security if i knock off now  chief .       go ahead  .   .   .  and by the way  grant  .  .  .       yes  sir .       good work .       the expression  sir  is   jolly good show .   i don t answer to anything else .   he touched a sardonic forefinger to his temple and walked off .     exit grant  he thought  then  enter good old charlie .     the colonel turned to owens .   get in with benes and talk to him .  i ll be in the car ahead .  and then when we get to headquarters  i want you to be ready with a firm identification  if you have one  or a firm denial  if you have one .  i don t want anything else .       he remembered that drinking episode   said owens .   exactly   said the colonel  discontentedly   he remembered it a little too quickly and a little too well .  talk to him .      they were all in  and the cavalcade moved off  picking up speed .  from a distance  grant watched  waved blindly at no one in particular  then moved off again .     he had free time coming and he knew exactly how he planned spending it  after one night s sleep .  he smiled in cheerful anticipation .       the cavalcade picked its route carefully .  the pattern of bustle and calm in the city varied from section to section and from hour to hour  and that which pertained to this section and this hour was known .     the cars rumbled down empty  streets through rundown neighborhoods of darkened warehouses .  the motorcycles jounced on before and the colonel in the first limousine tried once again to estimate how the others would react to the successful coup .     sabotage at headquarters was always a possibility .  he couldn t imagine what precautions remained to be taken but it was an axiom in his business that no precautions were ever sufficient .     a light .     for just a moment  it had seemed to him that a light had flashed and dimmed in one of the hulks they were approaching .  .  his hand flew  . to the car telephone to alert the motorcycle escort .     he spoke quickly and fiercely .  from behind  a motorcycle raced forward .     even as it did so  an automobile engine  ahead and to one side  roared into loud life  muffled and nearly drowned by the multiple clatter of the oncoming cavalcade  and the automobile itself came hurtling out of an alley .     its headlights were off and in the shock of its sudden approach  nothing registered with anyone .  no one  afterward  could recall a clear picture of events .     the car projectile  aimed squarely at the middle limousine containing benes  met the motorcycle coming forward .  in the crash that ensued  the motorcycle was demolished  its rider hurled many feet to one side and left broken and dead .  the car projectile itself was deflected so that it merely struck the rear of the limousine .     there were multiple collisions .  the limousine  spinning out of control  smashed into a telephone pole and jolted to a stop .  the kamikaze car  also out of control  hit a brick wall and burst into flame .     the colonel s limousine ground to a halt .  the motorcycles screeched  veering and turning .     gonder was out of his limousine  racing for the wrecked car  wrenching at the door .     owens  shaken  a reddened scrape on one cheekbone said   what happened .       never mind that .  how is benes .       he s hurt .       is he alive .       yes .  help me .      together  they half lifted  half pulled benes from the car .  his eyes were open but glazed  and he made only incoherent little sounds .      how are you  professor .      owens said in a quick  low voice .   his head cracked hard against the door handle .  concussion  probably .  but he is benes .  that s certain .      gonder shouted   we know that now  you  .  .  .   he swallowed the last word with difficulty .     the door to the first limousine was opened .  together they lifted benes in as a rifle shot cracked from somewhere above .  gonder threw himself into the car on top of benes .      let s get the show out of here   he yelled .     the car and half the motorcycle escort moved on .  the remainder stayed behind .  policemen ran for the building from which the rifle shot had sounded .  the dying light of the burning kamikaze car cast a hellish glow on the scene .     there was the rustle in the distance of the beginnings of a gathering crowd .     gonder cradled benes  head on his lap .  the scientist was completely unconscious now  his breathing slow  his pulse feeble .     gonder stared earnestly at the man who might well be dead before the vehicle came to its final halt and muttered despairingly to himself   we were almost there .   almost there .        chapter     headquarters      grant was only dopily aware of the hammering at his door .  he stumbled upright and emerged from his bedroom  walking flat footedly across the cold floor  and yawning prodigiously .      coming  .    he felt drugged and he wanted to feel drugged .  in the way of business  he was trained to come alive at any extraneous noise .  instant alertness .  take a mass of sleep  add a pinch of thump and there would be an instant and vast flowering of qui vive .     but now he happened to be on his own time and to heck with it .      what do you want .       from the colonel  sir   came from the other side of the door .   open at once .      against his will  grant jolted into wakefulness .  he stepped to one side of the door and flattened against the wall .  he then opened the door as far as the chain would allow and said   shove your id card here .      a card was thrust at him and he took it into his bedroom .  he groped for his wallet and pinched out his identifier .  he inserted the card and read the result on the translucent screen .     he brought it back and unhinged the chain  ready  despite himself  for the appearance of a gun or for some sign of hostility .     but the young man who entered looked completely harmless .   you ll have to come with me  sir  to headquarters .       what time is it .       about      sir .       a . m .  .       yes  sir .       why do they need me this time of day .       i can t say  sir .  i m following orders .  i must ask you to come with me .  sorry .   he tried a wry joke .   i didn t want to get up myself  but here i am .       do i have time to shave and shower .       well .   .   .       all right  then  do i have time to dress .       yes  sir .   but quickly .      grant scraped at the stubble along the angle of his jaw with his thumb and was glad he had showered the night before .   give me five minutes for  clothes and necessities .   he called out from the bathroom   what s it all about .       i don t know  sir .       what headquarters are we going to .       i don t think .  .  .       never mind .   the sound of rushing water made further speech impossible for a moment .     grant emerged  feeling somberly semi civilized .   but we re going to headquarters .  you said that  right .       yes  sir .       all right  son   said grant  pleasantly   but if i think you re about to cross me  i ll cut you in two .       yes  sir .        grant frowned when the car stopped .  the dawn was gray and dank .  there was a hint of forthcoming rain  the area was a rundown melange of warehouses and a quarter mile back they had passed a roped off area .      what happened here .   grant had asked and his companion was the usual mine of non information .     now they stopped and grant gently placed his hand on the butt of his holstered revolver .      you d better tell me what happens next .       we re here .  this is a secret government installation .  it doesn t look it  but it is .      the young man got out and so did the driver .   please stay in the car  mr .  grant .      the two stepped away for a hundred feet  while grant looked warily about .  there was a sudden jerk of movement and for a split second he was thrown off balance .  recovering  he began to fling the car door open  then hesitated in astonishment as smooth walls grew upward all about him .     it took him a moment to realize that he was sinking along with the car  that the car had been sitting on the top of an elevator shaft .  by the time he had drunk that in  it was too late to try to leave the car .     overhead  a lid moved into place and for a while  grant was in complete darkness .  he flicked on the car s headlights but they splashed uselessly back from the round curve of the rising wall .     there was nothing to do but wait for an interminable three minutes and then the car stopped .     two large doors opened  and grant s tensed muscles were ready for action .  he called them off at once .  a two man scooter bearing one m . p .  one obvious m . p .  in a completely legitimate military uniform was waiting for him .  on his helmet were the letters cmdf .  on the scooter were the same letters .     automatically  grant put words to the initials .   centralized mountain defense forces   he muttered   coastal marine department fisheries .       what .   he said aloud .  he had not heard the m . p .  s remark .      if you ll get in  sir   repeated the m . p .  with stiff propriety  indicating the empty seat .      sure .  quite a place you have here .       yes  sir .       how big is it .      they were passing through a cavernous empty area  with trucks and motor carts lined against the wall  each with its   mdf insigne .      pretty big   said the m . p .      that s what i like about everybody here   said grant .   full of priceless nuggets of data .      the scooter moved smoothly up a ramp to a higher level and a well populated one .  uniformed individuals  both male and female  moved about busily  and there was an indefinable but undeniable air of agitation about the place .     grant caught himself following the hurrying footsteps of n girl in what looked like a nurse s uniform  cmdf neatly printed over the curve of one breast  and remembered the plans he had begun to make the evening before .     if this was another assignment  .  .  .     the scooter made a sharp turn and stopped before a desk .     the m . p .  scrambled out .   charles grant  sir .      the officer behind the desk was unmoved at the information .   name .   he said .      charles grant   said grant   like the nice man said .       i . d .  card  please .      grant handed it over .  it carried an embossed number only  to which the officer gave one curt glance .  he inserted it into the identifier on his desk  while grant watched without much interest .  it was precisely like his own wallet identifier  overgrown and acromegalous .  the gray  featureless screen lit up with his own portrait  full face and profile  looking as it always did in grant s own eyes darkly and menacingly gangsterish .     where was the open  frank  look .  where the charming smile .  where the dimples in his cheeks that drove the girls mad  mad .  only those dark  lowering eyebrows remained to give him that angry look .  it was a wonder anyone recognized him .     the officer did  and apparently without trouble one glance at the photo  one at grant .  the i . d .  card was whipped out  handed back  and he was waved on .     the scooter turned right  passed through an archway and then down a long corridor  marked off for traffic  two lanes each way .  traffic was heavy  too  and grant was the only one not uniformed .     doors repeated themselves at almost hypnotically periodic intervals on either side  with pedestrian lanes immediately adjacent the walls .  those were less heavily populated .     the scooter approached another archway over which was a sign reading   medical division .      an m . p .  on duty in a raised box like that of a traffic policeman hit a switch .  heavy steel doors opened and the scooter slid through and came to a stop .     grant wondered what part of the city he was under by now .     the man in the general s uniform  who was approaching hastily  looked familiar .  grant placed him just before they had closed to within hand shaking stage .      carter  isn t it .  we met on the transcontinental a couple of years ago .  you weren t in uniform then .       hello  grant .   oh  darn the uniform .  i wear it only for status in this place .  it s  the only way we can establish a chain of command .  come with me .   granite grant  wasn t it .       oh  well .      they passed through a door into what was obviously   an operating room .  grant glanced out through the observation window to see the usual sight of men and women in white  bustling about in almost visible asepsis  surrounded by the hard gleam of metal ware  sharp and cold  and all of it dwarfed and rendered insignificant by the proliferation of electronic instruments that had converted medicine into a branch of engineering .     an operating table was being wheeled in  and a full shock of grizzled hair streamed out over the white pillow .     it was then that grant had his worst stab  of surprise .      benes .   he whispered .      benes   said general carter  bleakly .      what happened to him .       they got to him after all .  our fault .  we live in an electronic age  grant .  everything we do  we do with our transistorized servants in hand .  every enemy we have  we ward off by manipulating an electron flow .  we had the route bugged in every possible way  but only for electronified enemies .  we didn t count on an automobile with a man at the controls and on rifles with men at the triggers .       i suppose you got none of them alive .       none .  the man in the car died on the spot .  the others were killed by our bullets .  we lost a few ourselves .      grant looked down again .  there was the look of blank emptiness on benes  face that one associated with deep sedation .      i assume he s alive so that there s hope .       he s alive .  but there isn t much hope .      grant said   did anyone have a chance to  talk to him .       a captain owens william owens do you know him .      grant shook his head   just a glance at the airport of someone gonder referred to by that name .      carter said   owens spoke to benes but got no crucial information .  gonder spoke to him  too .  you spoke to him more than anyone .  did he tell you anything .       no  sir .  i would not have understood if he had .  it was my mission to get him into this country and nothing more       of course .  but you talked to him and he might have said more than he meant to .       if he did  it went right over my head .  but i don t think he did .  living on the other side  you get practice keeping your mouth shut .      carter scowled .   don t be unnecessarily superior  grant .  you get  . the same practice on this side .  if you don t know that  .   .   .  i m sorry  that was unnecessary .       it s all right  general   grant shrugged it off  tonelessly .      well the point is  he talked to no one .  he was put out of action before we could get what we wanted out of him .  he might as well never have left the other side .      grant said   coming here  i passed a place cordoned off .  .  .       that was the place .  five more blocks and we would have had him safe .       what s wrong with him now .       brain injury .  we have to operate and that s why we need you .       me  .   grant said  strenuously .   listen  general  at brain surgery  i m a child .  i flunked advanced cerebellum at old state u .      carter did not react and to grant his own words sounded hollow .      come with me   said carter .     grant followed  through a door  down a short stretch of corridor and into another room .      central monitoring   said carter  briefly .  the walls were covered with tv panels .  the central chair was half surrounded by a semi circular console of switches  banked on a steep incline .     carter sat down while grant remained standing .     carter said   let me give you the essence of the situation .  you understand there s a stalemate between ourselves and them .       and has been for a long time .  of course .       the stalemate isn t a bad thing  altogether .  we compete  we run scared all the time  and we get a lot done that way .  both of us .  but if the stalemate must break  it s got to break in favor of our side .  you see that  i suppose .       i think i do  general   said grant  dryly .      genes represents the possibility of such a break .  if he could tell us what he knows  .  .        may i ask a question  sir .       go ahead .       what does he know .  what sort of thing .       not yet .  not yet .  just wait a few moments .  the exact nature of the information is not crucial at the moment .  let me continue  .  .  .  if he could tell us what he knows  then the stalemate breaks on our side .  if he dies  or even if he recovers but without being able to give us our information because of brain damage  then the stalemate continues .      grant said   aside from humanitarian sorrow for the loss of a great mind  we can say that maintaining the stalemate isn t too bad .       yes  if the situation is just as i have described  but it may not be .       how do you make that out .       consider benes .  he is known as a moderate but we had no indication that he was having trouble with his government .  he had shown every sign of being loyal for a quarter of a century  and he d been well treated .  now he suddenly defects  .  .  .       because he wants to break the stalemate on our side .       does he .  or could it be that he revealed enough of his work  before realizing its full significance  to give the other side the key to the advance .  he may then have come to realize that  without quite meaning to  he had placed world dominion securely into the hands of his own side  and perhaps he wasn t sufficiently confident in the virtues of his own side to be satisfied with that .   so now he comes to us  not so much to give us the victory  as to give no one the victory .  he comes to us in order to maintain the stalemate .       is there any evidence for that  sir .       not one bit   said carter .   but you see it as a possibility  i presume  and you realize that there is not one bit of evidence against it  either .       go on .       if the matter of life or death for benes meant a choice between total victory for us or continued stalemate well  we could manage .  to lose our chance of total victory would he a damned shame  but we might get another chance tomorrow .  however  what might be facing us is a choice between stalemate and total defeat  and there one of the alternatives is completely unbearable .  do you agree .       of course .       you see  then  that if there is even a small possibility that benes  death will involve us in total defeat  then that death must be prevented at any price  at any cost  at any risk .       i take it you mean that statement for my benefit  general  because you re going to ask me to do something .  as it happens  i ve risked my life to prevent eventualities considerably short of total defeat .  i ve never really enjoyed it  if you want a confession but i ve done it .  however  what can i do in the operating room .  when i needed a band aid over my short ribs the other day  benes had to put it on  for me .  and compared to other aspects of medical technique  i m very good at band aids .      carter didn t react to that  either .   gonder recommended you for this .  on general principles  in the first place .  he considers you a remarkably capable man .  so do i .       general  i don t need the flattery .  i find it irritating .       darn it  man .  i m not flattering you .  i m explaining something .  gonder considers you capable in general    but more than that  he considers your mission to remain incomplete .  you were to get benes to us safely  and that has not been done .       he was safe when i was relieved by gonder himself .       nevertheless  he is not safe now .       are you appealing to my professional pride  general .       if you like .       all right .  i ll hold the scalpels .  i ll wipe the perspiration from the surgeon s forehead  i ll even wink at the nurses .  i think that s the complete list of my competencies in an operating room .       you won t be alone .  you ll be part of a team .       i somehow expect that   said grant .   someone else will have to aim the scalpels and push them .  i   just hold them in a tray .      carter manipulated a few switches with a sure touch .  on one tv screen  a pair of dark glassed figures came into instant view .  they were bent intently over a laser beam  its red light narrowing to thread like thinness .  the light flashed out and they removed their glasses .     carter said   that s peter duval .  have you ever heard of him .       sorry  but no .       he s the top brain surgeon in the country .       who s the girl .       she assists him .       hah .       don t be single tracked .  she s an extremely competent technician .      grant wilted a bit .   i m sure of it  sir .       you say you saw owens at the airport .       very briefly  sir .       he ll be with you  too .  also our chief of the medical section .  he ll brief you .      another quick manipulation and this time the tv screen came on with that low buzz that signified sound attachment two way .     an amiable bald head at close quarters dwarfed the intricate network of a circulatory system that filled the wall behind .     carter said   max .      michaels looked up .  his eyes narrowed .  he looked rather washed out .   yes  al .       grant is ready for you .  hurry it on .  there isn t much time .       there certainly isn t .  i ll come get him .   for a moment  michaels caught grant s eye .  he said  slowly   i hope you are prepared  mr .  grant  for the most unusual experience of your life .   or of anyone s .        chapter     briefing      in michaels  office  grant found himself looking at the map of the circulatory system open mouthed .     michaels said   it s an unholy mess  but it s a map of the territory .  every mark on it is a road  every junction is a cross road  that map is as intricate as a road map of the united states .  more so  for it s in three dimensions .       good lord .       a hundred thousand miles of blood vessels .  you see very little of it now  most of it is microscopic and won t be visible to you without considerable magnification  but put it all together in a single line and it would go four times around the earth or  if you prefer  nearly half way to the moon .   have you had any sleep  grant .       about six hours .  i napped on the plane  too .  i m in good shape .       good  you ll have a chance to eat and shave and tend to other such matters if necessary .  i wish i had slept .   he held up a hand as soon as he had said that .   not that i m in bad shape .  i m not complaining .  have you ever taken a morphogen .       never heard of it .  is it some kind of drug .       yes .  relatively new .  it s not the sleep you need  you know .  one doesn t rest in sleep to any greater extent than one would by stretching out comfortably with the eyes open .  less  maybe .  it s the dreams we need .  we ve got to have dreaming time  otherwise cerebral coordination breaks down and you begin to have hallucinations and  eventually  death .       the morphogen makes you dream .  is that it .       exactly .  it knocks you out for half an hour of solid dreaming and then you re set for the day .  take my advice  though  and stay away from the stuff unless it s an emergency .       why .  does it leave you tired .       no .  not particularly tired .  it s just that the dreams are bad .  the morphogen vacuums the mind  cleans out the mental garbage pit accumulated during the day  and it s quite an experience .  don t do it .   but  i had no choice .  that map had to be prepared and i spent all night at it .       that map .       it s benes  system to the last capillary and i ve had to learn all i could concerning it .  up here  almost centrally located in the cranium  right near the pituitary  is the blood clot .       is that the problem .       it certainly is .  everything else can be handled .  the general bruises and contusions  the shock  the concussion .  the clot can t be  not without surgery .  and quickly .       how long has he got  dr .  michaels .       can t say .  it won t be fatal  we hope  for quite a while  but brain damage will come long before death does .  and for this organization  brain damage will be as bad as death .  the people here expect miracles from our benes and now they ve been badly rattled .  carter  in particular  has had a bad blow and wants you .      grant said   you mean he expects the other side will try again .       he doesn t say so  but i suspect that s what he fears and why he wants you on the team .      grant looked about .   is there any reason to think this place has been penetrated .  have they planted agents here .       not to my knowledge  but carter is a suspicious man .  i think he suspects the possibility of medical assassination .       duval .      michaels shrugged .   he s an unpopular character and the instrument he uses can cause death if it slips a hairbreadth .       how can he be stopped .       he can t .       then use someone else  someone you can trust .       no one else has the necessary skill .  and duval is right here with us .  and  after all  there is no proof that he isn t completely loyal .       but if i m placed near duval as a male nurse and if i tint assigned the task of watching him closely  i will do no good .  i won t know what he s doing  or whether he s doing it honestly and correctly .  in fact  i tell you that when he opens the skull  i ll probably pass out .       he won t open the skull   said michaels .   the clot can t be reached from outside .  he s definite about that .       but  then  .  .  .       we ll reach it from the inside .      grant frowned .  slowly  he shook his head .   you know .  i don t know what you re talking about .      michaels said  quietly   mr .  grant  everyone else engaged in this project knows the score  and understands exactly what he or she is to do .  you re the outsider and it is rather a chore to have to educate you .  still  if i must  i must .  i m going to have to acquaint you with some of the theoretical work done in this institution .      grant s lip quirked .   sorry  doctor  but you ve just said a naughty word .  at college  i majored in football with a strong minor in girls .  don t waste theory on me .       i have seen your record  mr .  grant  and it is not quite as you say .  however  i will not deprive you of your manhood by accusing you of your obvious intelligence and education  even if we are in private .  i will not waste theory on you  but will get the nub of the information to you without that .   i assume you have observed our insigne  cmdf .      sure have .       do you have any idea of what it means .       i ve made a few guesses .  how about consolidated martian dimwits and fools .  i ve got a better one than that but it s unprintable .       it happens to stand for combined miniature deterrent forces .       that makes less sense than my suggestion   said grant .   i ll explain .  have you ever heard of the miniaturization controversy .      grant thought a while .   i was in college then .  we spent a couple of sessions on it in the physics course .    in between football games .       yes .  in the off season  as a matter of fact .  if i remember it  a group of physicists claimed they could reduce the size of objects to any degree  and it was exposed as a fraud .  well  maybe not a fraud but a mistake anyway .  i remember the class ran through several arguments showing why it was impossible to reduce a man to the size of  say  a mouse  and keep him a man .       i m sure this was done in every college in the land .  do you remember any of the objections .       i think so .  if you re going to reduce size you can do it in one of two ways .  you can push the individual atoms of an object closer together  or you can discard a certain proportion of the atoms altogether .  to push the atoms together against the inter atomic repulsive forces would take extraordinary pressures .  the pressures at the center of jupiter would be insufficient to compress a man to the size of a mouse .  am i right so far .       you are luminous as the day .       and even if you managed it  the pressure would kill anything alive .  aside from that  an object reduced in size by pushing atoms together would retain all its original mass  and an object the size of a mouse with the mass of a man would be difficult to handle .       amazing  mr .  grant .  you must have amused your girlfriends for many hours with this romantic talk .  and the other method .       the other method is to remove atoms in careful ratio so that the mass and size of an object decreases while the relationship of the parts remains constant .  only if you reduce a man to the size of a mouse you can keep only one atom out of maybe seventy thousand .  if you do that to the brain  what is left is scarcely more complicated than the brain of a mouse in the first place .  besides  how do you re expand the object  as the miniaturizing physicists claimed to be able to do .  how do you get the atoms back and put them in their right places .       quite so  mr .  grant .  but then how did some reputable physicists come to think that miniaturization was practical .       i don t know  doctor  but you don t hear of it any more .       partly because the colleges did such a careful job under orders of knocking it on the head .  the technique went underground both here and on the other side .  literally .  here .  underground .   it was almost with passion that michaels tapped the desk before him .   and we must maintain special courses in miniaturization techniques for graduate physicists who can learn it nowhere else except in analogous schools on the other side .  miniaturization is quite possible  but by neither method you have described .  have you ever seen a photograph enlarged  mr .  grant .  or reduced to microfilm size .       of course .       without theory  then  i tell you that the same process can be used on three dimensional objects  even on a man .  we are miniaturized  not as literal objects  but as images  as three dimensional images manipulated from outside the universe of space time .      grant smiled .   now  teacher  those are just words .       yes  but you don t want theory  do you .  what physicists discovered ten years ago was the utilization of hyper space  a space  that is  of more than the three ordinary spatial dimensions .  the concept is beyond grasping  the mathematics are almost beyond grasp  but the funny part is that it can be done .  objects can be miniaturized .  we nether get rid of atoms nor push them together .  we reduce the size of the atoms  too  we reduce everything  and the mass decreases automatically .  when we wish  we restore the size .       you sound serious   said grant .   are you telling me that we can really reduce a man to the size of a mouse .       in principle we can reduce a man to the size of a bacterium  of a virus  of an atom .  there is no theoretical limit to the amount of miniaturization .  we can shrink an army with all its men and equipment to a size that will fit in a match box .  ideally  we could then ship that match box where it is needed and put the army into business after restoring it to full size .  you see the significance .      grant said   and the other side can do it  too  i take it .       we re certain they can .   but come  grant  matters are progressing at full speed and our time is limited .  come with me .        it was  come with me  here and  come with me  there .  since grant had awakened that morning  he had not been allowed to remain in one place for longer than fifteen minutes .  it annoyed him and yet there seemed nothing he could do about it .  was it a deliberate attempt to keep him from having time enough to think .  what were they preparing to spring on him .     he and michaels were in the scooter now  michaels handling it like a veteran .      if both we and they have it  we neutralize each other   said grant .      yes  but in addition   said michaels   it does neither of us very much good .  there s a catch .       oh .       we ve worked for ten years to extend the size ratio  to reach greater intensities of miniaturization  and of expansion  too just a matter of reversing the hyper field .  unfortunately  we ve reached our theoretical limits in this direction .       what are they .       not very favorable .  the uncertainty principle intervenes .  extent of miniaturization multiplied by the duration of miniaturization  using the proper units  of course  is equal to an expression containing planck s constant .  if a man is reduced to half size  he can be kept so for centuries .  if he is reduced to mouse size  that can be kept up for days .  if he is reduced to bacterium size  that can be kept up only for hours .  after that he expands again .       but then he can be miniaturized again .        only after a sizable lag period .  do you want some of the mathematical background .       no .  i ll take your word for everything .      they had arrived at the foot of an escalator .  michaels got out of the scooter with a small  weary grunt .  grant vaulted the side .     he leaned against the railing as the staircase moved majestically upward .   and what has benes got .       they tell me he claims he can beat the uncertainty principle .  supposedly  he knows how to maintain miniaturization indefinitely .       you don t sound as though you believe that .      michaels shrugged   i am skeptical .  if he extends both miniaturization intensity and  miniaturization duration that can only be at the expense of something else  but for the life of me i can t imagine what that something else might be .  perhaps that only means i am not a benes .  in any case  he says he can do it and we cannot take the chance of not believing him .  neither can the other   er   side  so they ve tried to kill him .      they had come to the top of the escalator and michaels had paused there briefly to complete his remark .  now he moved back to take a second escalator up another floor .      now  grant  you can understand what we must do   save benes .  why we must do it for the information he has .  and how we must do it by miniaturization .       why by miniaturization .       because the brain clot cannot be reached from outside .  i told you that .  so we will miniaturize a submarine  inject it into an artery  and with captain owens at the controls and with myself as pilot  journey to the clot .  there  duval and his assistant  miss peterson  will operate .      grant s eyes opened wide .   and i .       you will be along as a member of the crew .  general supervision  apparently .      grant said  violently   not i .  i am not volunteering for any such thing .  not for a minute .      he turned and started walking down the up escalator  with little effect .     michaels followed him  sounding amused .   it is your business to take risks  isn t it .       risks of my own choosing .  risks i am used to .  risks i am prepared for .  give me as much time to think of miniaturization as you have had and i ll take the risk .       my dear grant .  you have not been asked to volunteer .  it is my understanding that you have been assigned to this duty .  and now its importance has been explained to you .  after all  i am going to  and i am not as young as you  nor have i ever been a football player .  in fact  i ll tell you .  i was depending on you to keep my courage up by coming along  since courage is your business .       if so  i m a rotten business man   muttered grant .  irrelevantly  almost petulantly  he said   i want coffee .      he stood still and let the escalator carry him up again .  near the top of the escalator was a door marked  conference room .   they entered .       grant grew aware of the contents of the room in stages .  what he saw first was that one end of the long table that filled the center of the room was a .  multi cup coffee dispenser and that next to it was a tray of sandwiches .     he moved toward that at once and it was only after downing half a cup of it hot and black and following that by a grant sized bite of a sandwich  that item two entered his awareness .     this was duval s assistant   miss peterson  wasn t that her name .    looking down in the mouth but very beautiful and standing terribly close to duval .  grant had the instant feeling that he was going to find it difficult to like the surgeon and only then did he begin to absorb the rest of the room .     a colonel sat at one end of the table  looking annoyed .  one hand twirled an ashtray slowly while the ashes of his cigarette dropped to the floor .  he said emphatically to duval   i ve made my attitude quite clear .      grant recognized captain owens standing under the portrait of the president .  the eagerness and smiles he had seen at the airport were gone and there was a bruise on one cheekbone .  he looked nervous and upset and grant sympathized with the sensation .      who s the colonel .   grant asked michaels in a low voice .      donald reid  my opposite number on the military side of the fence .       i take it he s annoyed with duval .       constantly .  he s got a lot of company .  few like him .      grant had the impulse to answer  she seems to  but the words sounded petty in his thoughts and he dismissed them .  lord  what a dish .  what did she see in that solemn cutthroat .     reid was talking in a low voice  carefully controlled .   and aside from that  doctor  what is she doing here .       miss cora peterson   said duval  icily   is my assistant .  where i go professionally  she accompanies me professionally .       this is a dangerous mission  .  .  .       and miss peterson has volunteered  understanding full well its dangers .       a number of men  entirely qualified to help  have also volunteered .  matters would be far less complicated if one of those men accompanied you .  i will assign you one .       you will not assign me one  colonel  for if you do  i will not go  and there will be no power to make me .  miss peterson is a third and fourth arm to me .  she knows my requirements well enough to do her job without instructions  to be there before i call  to supply what is needed without being asked .  i will not take a stranger who will need to be shouted at .  i can not be responsible for success if i lose one second because my technician and i do not mesh  and i will not take any assignment in which i am not given a free hand with which to arrange matters in such a way as will carry with it the best chance for success .      grant s eye moved to cora peterson again .  she looked acutely embarrassed  yet stared at duval with the expression grant had once seen in a beagle s eye when its little boy owner returned from school .  grant found that intensely annoying .     michaels  voice cut across the argument as reid was rising furiously to his feet .   i would suggest  don  that since the key step of the entire operation rests upon dr .  duval s hand and eye and since  in fact  we cannot now dictate to him  we humor him in this respect without prejudice to necessary action afterward  eh .  i am willing to take responsibility for that .      he was offering reid a face saving way out  grant realized  and reid  fuming darkly  would have to take it .     reid slammed the flat of his hand on the table before him .   all right .  let it be on record that i opposed this .   he sat back  lips trembling .     duval sat down also  unconcerned .  grant moved forward to pull out a chair for cora  but she helped herself and was seated before he could reach her .     michaels said   dr .  duval  this is grant  a young man who will be accompanying us .       as muscle man  doctor   said grant .   my only qualification .      duval looked up cursorily .  his acknowledgement was a minimal nod thrown in grant s general direction .   and miss peterson .      grant smiled flashily .  she smiled not at all and said   how do you do .       hello   said grant  looked down at what little was left of his second sandwich  realized that no one else was eating at all  and put it down .     carter came in at this point  walking rapidly and nodding vaguely to right and left .  he sat down and said   will you join us  captain owens .  grant .      owens reluctantly moved to the table and took his place opposite duval .  grant sat down several chairs removed and found himself able  in looking at carter   to contemplate cora s face in profile .     could a job be entirely bad if she were part of it .      michaels  who sat down immediately next to grant  leaned forward to whisper in his ear .   actually  it isn t a bad idea to have a woman along .  the men  perhaps  will be more on their mettle .  and it would please me .       is that why you made the pitch for her .       actually  no .  duval is serious .  he wouldn t go without her .       is he that dependent on her .       perhaps not .  but he s that intent on having his way .  especially against reid .  no love lost there .      carter said   to business .  you can drink  or eat  if you wish  while this is going on .  do any of you have any urgent point to make .      grant said  suddenly   i haven t volunteered  general .  i decline the post and suggest you find a substitute .       you re not a volunteer  grant  and your offer to decline is declined .  gentlemen and miss peterson mr grant has been chosen to accompany the expedition for a variety of reasons .  for one thing  it was he who brought benes to this country  managing that assignment with complete skill .      all eyes turned to grant  who felt himself wincing at the momentary expectation that there would be a polite patter of applause .  there was none  and he relaxed .     carter went on .   he is a communications expert and an experienced frogman .  he has a record of resourcefulness and flexibility and is professionally capable of making instant decisions .  for that reason i will place the power of making policy decisions in his hands once the voyage begins .  is that understood .      it apparently was  and grant  staring in annoyance at his fingertips  said   apparently it is up to the rest of you to do your jobs while i take care of emergencies .  i am sorry but i wish to state for the record that i do not consider myself qualified for this post .       the statement is recorded   said carter  unembarrassed   and we will go on .  captain owens has designed an experimental submarine for oceanographic research .  it is not ideally suited for the task at hand  but it is itself at hand  and there is no other vessel in existence that is better suited .  owens himself will  of course  be at the controls of his ship  the proteus .      dr .  michaels will be the pilot .  he has prepared and studied the map of benes  circulatory system  which we will shortly consider .  dr .  duval and his assistant will be in charge of the actual operation  the removal of the clot .      you all know the importance of this mission .  we hope for a successful operation and for your safe return .  there is the chance that benes may die during the operation  but that becomes a certainty if the mission is not undertaken .  there is a chance that the ship may be lost  but under the circumstances  i am afraid that ship and crew are expendable .  the possible price is large but the gain we seek i don t mean the cmdf only  but all mankind is greater .      grant muttered under his breath   yea  team .      cora peterson caught it and looked at him with brief penetration from under dark eyelashes .  grant flushed .     carter said   show them the chart  michaels .      michaels pressed a button on the instrument before him and the wall lit up with the tri dimensional map of benes  circulatory system that grant had last seen in michaels  office .  it seemed to rush toward them and enlarge as michaels turned a knob .  what was left of the circulatory network made up the clear delineation of a head and neck .     the blood vessels stood out with an almost fluorescent brilliance and then grid lines appeared across it .  a thin dark arrow darted into the field  manipulated by the photo pointer in michaels  hand .  michaels did not rise but remained seated in his chair  one arm over its back .      the clot  he said   is there .   it had not been visible to grant s eyes  at least until it had been pointed out  but now that the black arrow delicately marked out its limits  grant could see it a small solid nodule plugging an arteriole .      it represents no immediate danger to life  but this section of the brain   the arrow danced about   is suffering from nerve compression and may already have experienced damage .  dr .  duval tells me that the effects may be irreversible in twelve hours or less .  an attempt to operate in the ordinary manner will involve cutting through the skull either here  here  or here .  in each of these three cases  unavoidable damage will be extensive and the results doubtful .      on the other hand  we could attempt to reach the clot via the blood stream .  if we can enter the carotid artery here in the neck  we will be on a reasonably direct route to our destination .   the flowing of the arrow along the line of the red artery  picking its way through the blueness of the veins  made it seem very easy .      michaels went on   if  then  the proteus and its crew are miniaturized and injected  .  .  .      owens spoke up suddenly .   wait a while .   his voice was harsh and metallic .   how far will we be reduced .       we ll have to be small enough to avoid activating the body s biological defenses .  the overall length of the ship will be three micra .       how much is that in inches .   interjected grant .      just under a ten thousandth of an inch .  the ship will be about the size of a large bacterium .       well  then   said owens .   if we enter an artery  we will be exposed to the full force of the arterial current .       not quite a mile an hour   said carter .      never mind the miles per hour .  we will be moving about         times the length of our ship each second .  that will be equivalent  under ordinary circumstances  to moving     miles a second or something like that .  on our miniaturized scale we ll be moving a dozen times as fast as any astronaut over moved .  at least .       undoubtedly   said carter   but what of it .  every red blood corpuscle in the blood stream moves as quickly and the ship is much more sturdily built than the corpuscle .       no  it is not   said owens  passionately .   a red blood corpuscle contains billions of atoms  but the proteus will crowd billions of billions of billions of atoms into the same space  miniaturized atoms  to be sure  but what of that .  we will be made up of an immensely larger number of units than the red blood corpuscle and we ll be  flabbier for that reason .  furthermore  the red blood corpuscle is in an environment of atoms equal in size to those that make it up  we will be in an environment made up of what will be to us monstrous atoms .      carter said   can you answer that  max .      michaels harumphed .   i do not pretend to be as expert on the problems of miniaturization as captain owens .  i expect that he is thinking of the report by james and schwartz that fragility increases with intensity of miniaturisation .       exactly   said owens .      the increase is a slow one  if you remember  and james rind schwartz had to make some simplifying assumptions in the course of their analysis which may prove to be not entirely valid .  after all  when we enlarge objects  they certainly do not become less fragile .       oh  come on  we ve never enlarged any object more than a hundred fold   said owens  contemptuously   and here we are talking about miniaturizing a ship about a million times in linear dimensions .  no one s ever gone that far  or oven anything close to that far  in either direction .  the fact is that there isn t anyone in the world who can predict just how fragile we will become  or how well we can stand up to the pounding of the blood stream  or even how we might respond to the action of a white blood corpuscle .  isn t that so  michaels .      michaels said   well yes .      carter said  with what seemed rising impatience   it would seem that the course of orderly experiment leading to so drastic a miniaturization has not yet been completed .  we re in no position to carry through a program of such experimentation so we have to take our chances .  if the ship does not survive  it doesn t .      that bucks me up   muttered grant .     cora peterson leaned toward him  whispering tightly     please  mr .  grant  you re not on the football field .       oh  you know my record  miss .       shh .      carter said   we are taking all the precautions we can .  benes will be in deep hypothermia for his own sake .  by freezing him we will cut down the oxygen requirements to   the brain .  that will mean the heartbeat will be drastically slowed and the velocity of the blood flow as well .      owens said   even so  i doubt that we could survive the turbulence  .  .  .      michaels said   captain  if you stay away from the artery walls  you will be in the region of laminar flow no turbulence to speak of .  we will be in the artery only for minutes  and once in the smaller vessels  we will have no problem .  the only place where we would not be able to avoid killing turbulence would be in the heart itself and we would nowhere near the heart .   may i continue  now .       please do   said carter .      having reached the clot  it will be destroyed by a laser beam .  the laser and its beam  having been miniaturized in proportion  will not  if properly used   as in duval s hand it is sure to be   do any damage to the brain or even the blood vessel itself .  nor will it be necessary to demolish every vestige of the clot .  it will be enough to break it up into fragments .  the white blood cells will then take care of it .      we will leave the vicinity at once  of course  returning by way of the venous system  until we reach the base of the neck where we will be removed from the jugular vein .       grant said   how will anyone know where we are and when .      carter said   michaels will be piloting you and see to it that you are in the right place at all times .  you will be in  communication with us by radio  .  .  .        you don t know if that will work   put in owens .  there s a problem in adapting the radio waves across the miniaturization gap  and no one has ever tried this big a gap .       true  but we will try .  in addition  the proteus is nuclear powered and we will be able to trace its radioactivity  also cross the gap .   you will have just sixty minutes  gentlemen .  .  .     grant said   you mean we have to complete the job and be out in sixty minutes .       exactly sixty .  your size will have been adjusted to that  which should be ample time .  if you stay for a longer interval  you will start enlarging automatically .  we can   t keep you down longer .  if we had benes  knowledge we could keep you down indefinitely but if we had his knowledge  .  .  .       this trip would be unnecessary   said grant  sardonically .      exactly .  and if you begin enlarging within benes  body  you will become large enough to attract the attention of the body defenses  and shortly thereafter  you will kill benes .  you will see to it that this does not happen .      carter then looked about .   any further remarks .   in that case  you will begin preparations .  we d like to make entry into benes as quickly as possible .        chapter     submarine      the level of activity in the hospital room had reached the visual analog of a scream .  everyone was moving at a rapid walk  almost a half run .  only the figure on the operating table was still .  a heavy thermal blanket lay over it  the numerous coils snaking through it  filled with their circulating refrigerant .  and under it  was the nude body  chilled to the point where life within it was a sluggish whisper .     benes  head was now shaven and marked off like a nautical chart in numbered lines of latitude and longitude .  on his sleep sunk face was a look of sadness  frozen deeply in .     on the wall behind him was another reproduction of the circulatory system  enlarged to the point where the chest  neck and head were sufficient in themselves to cover the wall from end to end and floor to ceiling .  it had become a forest in which the large vessels were as thick as a man s arm while the fine capillaries fuzzed all the spaces between .     in the control tower  brooding over the operation room  carter and reid watched .  they could see the desk level banks of monitors  at each of which a technician sat  each in his cmdf uniform  a symphony in zippered white .     carter moved to the window  while reid said softly into a mike   bring the proteus into the miniaturization room .      it was customary protocol to give such orders in a quiet voice  and there was quiet on the floor  if absence of sound was the mere criteria .  last minute adjustments were being frantically made at the thermal blanket .  each technician studied his own monitor as though it were his new bride  isolated at last .  the nurses hovered about benes like large  starch winged butterflies .     with the proteus beginning the preparation for miniaturization  every man and woman on the floor knew the last stage of the count down had begun .     reid pushed a button .   heart .      the heart sector was laid out in detail on the tv screen  that was rostrumed just under reid .  within that sector  the ekg recordings dominated and the heartbeat sounded in a dull double thump of sorrowful slowness .      how does it look  henry .       perfect .  holding steady at thirty two per minute .  no abnormalities  acoustic or electronic .  the rest of him should only be like this .       good .   reid flicked him off .  to a heart man  what could be wrong if the heart was right .     he turned on the lung sector .  the world on the screen was suddenly one of respiration rates .   all right  jack .       all right  dr .  reid .  i ve got the respiration down to six per minute .  can t take it any lower .       i m not asking you to .  carry on .      hypothermia next .  this sector was larger than the rest .  it had to concern itself with all the body and here the theme was the thermometer .  temperature readings at the limbs  at  various points of the torso  at delicate contacts making readings at definite depths below the skin .  there were constantly creeping temperature recordings with each wiggle bearing its own label   circulatory    respiratory    cardiac    renal    intestinal   and so on .      any problems  sawyer .   asked reid .      no  sir .  overall average is at twenty eight degrees centigrade eighty two degrees fahrenheit .       you needn t convert  thank you .       yes  sir .      it was as though reid could feel the hypothermia biting at his own vitals .  sixteen fahrenheit degrees below normal  sixteen crucial degrees  slowing metabolism to about one third normal  cutting the oxygen needs to one third  slowing the heartbeat  the rate of blood flow  the scale of life  the strain on the clot blocked brain .   and making the environment more favorable for the ship that was soon to enter the jungle of the human interior .     carter moved back toward reid   all set  don .       as near as can be managed  considering that this was improvised overnight .       i doubt that very much .      reid flushed   what s that supposed to mean  general .       no improvisation was needed .  it s no secret to me that you ve been laying the groundwork for biological experiments with miniaturization .  have you been planning  specifically  the exploration of the human circulatory system .       not specifically  no .  but my team has been working on such problems as a matter of course .  that was their job .       don  .   .   .   carter hesitated  then went on tightly .   if this fails  don  someone s head will be needed for the governmental trophy room  and mine will be the handiest .  if this succeeds  you and your men will come out of it smelling like lilies of the valley .  don t try to push that too far if it happens .       the military will still have first call  eh .  are you telling me not to get in the way .       it might be sensible not to .   another thing .  what s wrong with the girl  cora peterson .       nothing .  why .       your voice was loud enough .  i heard you just before i came into the conference room .  do you know of any reason why she shouldn t be on board .       she s a woman .  she may not be reliable in emergencies .  besides .  .  .        yes .       if you want the truth  duval assumed his usual i am the law and the prophets manner  and i automatically objected .  how far do you trust duval .       what do you mean  trust .       what s your real reason for sending grant along on the mission .  who s he supposed to keep his eye on .      carter said in a low  husky tone   i haven t told him to keep an eye on anyone .   the crew should be about through in the sterilization corridor by now .        grant sniffed at the faintly medicinal odor in the atmosphere and was grateful for the opportunity of a quick shave .  no use not looking his best with a lady on board .  the cmdf uniform wasn t bad  either  one piece  belted and an odd cross between the scientific and the dashing .  the one they had found for him bound him slightly under the armpits  but he d only be wearing it for an hour  perhaps .     in single file  he and the others of the crew passed down the corridor in dim light that was rich in ultra violet .  they wore dark goggles against the dangers of that radiation .     cora peterson walked immediately ahead of grant so that he silently deplored the darkness of the lenses before his eyes and the manner in which they dimmed the interesting style of her walk .     wanting to make conversation  he said   is this walkthrough really sufficient to sterilize us  miss peterson .      she turned her head briefly and said   i think you need have no masculine uneasiness .      grant s mouth quirked .  he had asked for that .  he said   you underestimate my naivete  miss peterson  and i am unfairly run through by your sophistication .       i didn t mean to offend you .      the door at the end of the corridor opened automatically and grant  as automatically  closed the gap between them and offered his hand .  she evaded it and stepped across at the heels of duval .     grant said   no offense .  but my meaning was that we aren t actually sterile .  microbe wise  i mean .  at best  it is only our surfaces that are sterile .  inside  we teem with germs .       for that matter   cora responded   benes isn t sterile  either .  microbe wise  i mean .  but every germ we kill is one less germ we might introduce .  our germs will be miniaturized with us  of course  and we don t know how such miniaturized germs will affect a human being if released in his blood stream .  on the other hand  after one hour any miniaturized germs in his blood stream will expand to their normal size and that expansion might be harmful for all we know .  the less benes is subjected to unknown factors  the better .      she shook her head .   there s so much we don t know .  this really isn t the way to experiment .       but we have no choice  do we  miss peterson .  and may i call you cora  by the way  for the duration .       it makes no difference to me .      they had entered a large round room  glassed in at all sides .  it was floored completely in hexagonal tiles some three feet across  roughened into close packed semi circular bubbles  the whole made of some milk white glassy material .  at the center of the room was a single tile like the rest  except that it was in deep red .     filling much of the room was a white vessel some fifty feet in  length  horse shoe in shape  with an upper bubble the front of which was glassed in and which was topped by a smaller bubble  entirely transparent .  it was on a hydraulic lift and was being maneuvered into the center of the room .     michaels had moved up next to grant .   the proteus   he said .   our home away from home for the next hour or so .       this is a huge room   grant said  looking about .      it s our miniaturization    room .  it s been used for the miniaturization of artillery pieces and small atomic bombs .  it can also serve to hold de miniaturized insects you know  ants blown up to the size of locomotives for easy study .  such bio experiments haven t been authorized yet  though we ve sneaked in one or two quiet efforts along that line .   they re putting the proteus over zero module  that s the red one .  then  i suppose  we get in .  nervous  mr .  grant .       and how .  and you .      michaels nodded in rueful agreement   and how .      the proteus had been adjusted onto its cradle now and the hydraulic lifts that had maneuvered it into place were drawn off .  a ladder on one side led to the entrance .     the ship gleamed in sterile whiteness from the featureless bluntness of its prow to the double jet and upright fin at the rear .     owens said   i ll get in first .  when i signal  the rest of you come in .   he moved up the ladder .      it s his ship   muttered grant .   why not .   then he said to michaels   he seems more nervous than we .       that s just his way .  he looks nervous all the time .  and if he is  he has reason .  he has a wife and two young daughters .  duval and his assistant are both single .       i am  too   said grant .   and you .       divorced .  no children .  so you see .      owens could be seen plainly  now  in the bubble top .  he seemed intent on objects immediately before him .  then he waved the come in gesture .  michaels responded and moved up the ladder .  duval followed him .  grant motioned cora to enter ahead of himself .     all were in their seats when grant ducked through the small one man chamber that made up the hatch .  above  in the lone upper seat  was owens at the control .  below were four more seats .  the two in the rear  well on either side  were occupied by cora and duval  cora on the right near the ladder that led up to the bubble  duval on the left .     in the bow were the other two seats  close together .     michaels had already taken the one on the left .  grant mat down next to him .     on either side were work benches and a set of what looked like auxiliary controls .  underneath the benches were cabinets .  in the rear were a pair of small rooms  one it small work room  the other for storage .     it was still dark inside .  michaels said   we will put you to work  grant .  ordinarily we would have had a communications man in your place one of our own  i mean .  since you have communications experience you will handle the wireless .  no problem  i hope .       i can t see it very well right now  .  .  .        say there  owens .   michaels called upward .   how about the power .       right away .  i m checking a few items .      michaels said   i don t believe there is anything unusual about it .  it is the only non nuclear powered object on the ship .       i don t expect any problems .       good .   relax  then .  it will be a few minutes yet before we can be miniaturized .  the others are busy and if you don t mind  i will talk .       go ahead .      michaels adjusted himself in his seat .   we all have our specific reactions to nervousness .  some light cigarettes   no smoking on board  by the way  .  .  .       i don t smoke .       some drink  some bite their nails .  i talk provided  of course  i don t choke up altogether .  right now  it s a near squeak between talking and choking .  you asked about owens .  are you nervous about him .       should i be .       i m sure carter expects you to be .  a suspicious man  that carter .  paranoid tendencies .  i suspect that carter has brooded over the fact that owens was the man in the car with benes at the time of the accident .      grant said   that thought has occurred even to me .  but what does it mean .  if you re implying that owens might have arranged the incident  the interior of the car was a poor place to be .       i don t suggest anything of the sort   said michaels .  shaking his head vigorously .   i m trying to penetrate carter s reasoning .  suppose owens were a secret enemy agent  converted to their side on one of his trips to scientific conferences overseas  .  .  .       how dramatic   said grant  dryly .   anyone else on board attend such conferences .      michaels thought a moment .   as a matter of fact  we all have .  even the girl attended a short meeting last year  one at which duval presented a paper .  but anyway  suppose it was owens who was converted .  let us say that he was assigned the task of seeing to it that benes was to be killed .  it might be necessary for him to risk his own death .  the driver of the collision car knew be was going to die  the five men at the rifles knew they would die .  people don t seem to mind dying .      and owens may be prepared to die now rather than let us succeed .  is that why he is nervous .         oh  no .  what you now suggest is quite unbelievable .  i can imagine  for the sake of argument  that owens might be willing to give his life for some ideal  but not that he would be willing to sacrifice the prestige of his ship by having its first big mission fail .       then you think we can eliminate him and forget about the possibility of funny work at the cross roads .      michaels laughed gently  his moon face genial .   of course .  but i ll bet carter has considered every one of us .  and that you have  too .      grant said   duval  for instance .       why not .  anyone at all might be on the other side .  not for pay  perhaps  i am sure no one here can be bought  but out of mistaken idealism .  miniaturization  for instance  is primarily a war weapon right now and many of the people here are firmly against that aspect of it .  a signed statement to that effect was sent to the president some months ago  a plea to end the miniaturization race  establish a combined program with other nations for the exploitation of miniaturization for peaceful research in biology and medicine in particular .       who were involved in that movement .       a great many .  duval was one of the most vociferous and outspoken leaders .  and  as a matter of fact  i signed the statement as well .  i assure you the signers were sincere .  i was and i am .  it is possible to argue that benes  device for unlimited duration of miniaturization  if it works  would greatly increase the danger of war and annihilation .  if so  i suppose duval or myself might be eager to see benes dead before he can speak .  for myself  i can deny that i am so motivated .  to such an extreme  in any case .  as for duval    his great problem is his unpleasant personality .  there are many who would be eager to suspect him of anything .      michaels twisted in his seat and said   and that girl there .       she signed  too .       no  the statement was for senior personnel only .  but why is she here .       because duval insisted .  we were there when it happened .       yes  but why should she be available for his insisting .  she is young and quite pretty .  he is twenty years older than she and is not interested in her or in any human being .  can she be eager to come along for duval or for some other more political reason .      grant said   are you jealous  dr .  michaels .      michaels looked startled .  slowly  he smiled .   you know  i never really thought of that .  i ll bet i am  i m no older than duval and if she is really interested in older men  it would certainly be pleasanter to have her prefer me .  but even allowing for my prejudice  there s room for wondering about her motives .      michaels  smile faded and he grew glumly serious once more .   and then  after all  the safety of this ship depends not only on ourselves but on those outside who are to a certain extent in control of us .  colonel reid was as much in favor of the petition as any of us  although as a military officer he could not engage in political activity .  yet though his name was absent from the petition  his voice wasn t .  he and carter quarreled over that .  they were good friends before .       too bad   said grant .      and carter himself .  he s very paranoid .  the stresses of the work here might have created instability in the sanest of men .  i wonder if one can be entirely sure that carter hasn t grown somewhat twisted  .  .  .       do you think he has .      michaels spread out his arms   no  of course not .  i told you this is therapeutic talk .  would you rather i sat here and merely perspired  or that i screamed softly .      grant said   no  i guess not .  in fact  please go ahead .  as long as i listen to you  i have no time to panic myself  it seems to me you ve mentioned everyone .       not at all .  i have deliberately left the least suspicious character for last .  in fact  we might say as a general rule that the seemingly least suspicious character is bound to be guilty .  wouldn t you say so .       obviously   grant said .   and this least suspicious character is who .  or is this the place where a shot rings out and you crumple to the floor just before you name the identity of the fiend .       no one seems to be aiming at me   said michaels .   i think i will have time .  the least suspicious character is  obviously  you yourself  grant .  who would be less suspicious than the trusted agent  assigned to see the ship safely through the mission .  can you really be trusted  grant .       i m not sure .  you have only my word and what s that worth .       exactly .  you have been on the other side  been there oftener and under more obscure circumstances than anyone else on this ship  i m certain .  suppose that in one way or another  you have been bought off .       possible  i suppose   said grant  unemotionally   but i brought benes here safely .       so you did  knowing  perhaps  that he would be taken care of at the next stage  leaving you in the clear and fit for further duties  as you are now .      grant said   i think you mean this .      but michaels shook his head   no  i don t .  and i m sorry for i think i m beginning to grow offensive .   he pinched his nose and said   i wish they would begin miniaturizing .  after that  i might have less time to think .      grant felt embarrassed .  there was a naked look of apprehension on michaels  face as the skin of banter peeled off .  he called up   how about it  captain .       all set .  all set   came owens  metal harsh voice .     the lights went on .  at once  duval pulled out several drawers at his side of the ship  and began to look over the charts .  cora inspected the laser with care .     grant said   may i come up there  owens .       you can stick your head up here if you want to   replied owens .   there isn t room for anything more .      grant said under his breath .   take it easy  dr .  michaels .  i ll be gone for a few minutes and you can jitter  if you feel like it  without being watched .      michaels  voice was dry and his words seemed to grind out with difficulty .   you are a considerate man  grant .  if i had had my natural sleep  .  .  .      grant rose and stepped back  grinning at cora who stepped out of his way coolly .  he then moved quickly up the ladder  looked up and about and said   how will you know where to go .      owens said   i ve got michaels  charts here .   he flipped a switch and on one of the screens immediately before him was a replica of the circulatory system  the one grant had already seen several times before .     owens touched another switch and parts of the chart glowed an iridescent yellow orange .      our projected route   he said .   michaels will be directing me when necessary  and since we are nuclear fueled  carter and the rest will be able to follow us with precision .  they will help direct us  if you take care of your end with the wireless .       you ve got a complicated set of controls here .       it s pretty sophisticated   said owens  with obvious pride .   a button for everything  so to speak  and as compact as i could make it .  this was going to be used for deep sea work  you know .      grant swung down again and again cora made way for him .  she was deep in concentration over her laser  working with what were virtually watchmaker s tools .      that looks complicated   said grant .     cora said briefly   a ruby laser  if you know what that is .      i know it puts out a tight beam of coherent monochromatic light  but i haven t the foggiest notion as to how it works .       then i suggest you go back to your seat and let me do my job .       yes  ma am .  but if you have any footballs you want strung  you let me know .  us physical types are good at that kind of unskilled work .      cora put down a small screw driver  brushed her rubber gloved fingers together and said   mr .  grant .       yes  ma am .       are you going to make this entire venture hideous with your notion of fun .       no  i won t  but  .   .   .  well  how do i talk to you .       like a fellow member of the crew .       you re also a young woman .       i know that  mr .  grant  but what concern is that of yours .  it s not necessary to assure me with every remark and gesture that you re aware of my sex .  it s wearisome and unnecessary .  after this is all over  if you still feel called upon to go through whatever rituals you are accustomed to performing before young women  i will deal with you in whatever fashion seems advisable but for now  .  .  .       all right .  it s a date  for afterwards .       and mr .  grant .       yes .       don t be defensive about once having been a football player .  i really don t care .      grant swallowed and said   something tells me my rituals are going to be tromped on  but  .  .  .      she was paying no attention but had returned to the laser .  grant couldn t help watching  his hand on the counter  following the minutest movement of her sure fingered adjustments .      oh  if you could only frivol   he breathed  and fortunately she didn t hear him  or  at least  showed no signs of having done so .     without warning  she placed her hand on his and grant found himself starting slightly at the touch of her warm fingers .     she said   excuse me .   and moved his hand to one side  then released it .  almost at once she depressed a contact on the laser and a hair thin streak of red light shot out  striking the metal disc over which his hand had just been resting .  a tiny hole appeared at once and there was the thin odor of metal vapor .  had grant s hand remained in place  the thin hole would have been in his thumb .     grant said   you might have warned me .      cora said   there is no reason for you to be standing here  is there .      she lifted the laser  ignoring his offered help and turned toward the store room .      yes  miss   said grant  humbly .   when near you henceforward i shall be careful where i place my hand .      cora looked back as though startled and rather uncertain .  then  for a moment  she smiled .     grant said   careful .  the cheeks may crack .      her smile vanished at once .   you promised   she said  icily  and moved into the work room .     the voice of owens came from above .   grant .  check the wireless .       right   called grant .   i ll be seeing you  cora .  afterward .      he slipped back into his seat and looked at the wireless for the first time .   this seems to be a morse code device .      michaels looked up .  some of the grayness had left his face .   yes  it s technically difficult to transmit voice across the miniaturization gap .  i assume you can handle code .       of course .   he beat out a rapid message .  after a pause  the public address system in the miniaturization room boomed out with a sound level easily heard within the proteus      message received .  wish to confirm .  message reads  miss peterson smiled .      cora  just returning to her seat  looked outraged and said   good grief .      grant bent over the wireless and tapped out  correct .     the return this time was in code .  grant listened  then called out   message received from outside  prepare for miniaturization .        chapter     miniaturization      grant  not knowing how to prepare  sat where he was .  michaels rose with an almost convulsive suddenness  looking about as though making a last minute check of all facilities .     duval  having put his charts aside  began to fumble at his harness .      may i help  doctor .   asked cora .     he looked up   eh .  oh  no .  it s just a matter of getting this buckle straight .  here we are .       doctor .  .  .       yes .   he looked up again and was suddenly all concern over her apparent difficulty in expressing herself .   is anything wrong with the laser  miss peterson .       oh  no .  it s just that i m sorry i was the cause of unpleasantness between yourself and dr .  reid .       that was nothing .  don t think of it .       and thank you for arranging to have me come .      duval said  seriously   it is quite necessary for me to have you .  i couldn t rely on anyone else as i do on you .      cora moved to grant who  having turned to watch duval  was now fiddling with his own harness .      do you know how to work that .   she asked .      it seems more complicated than the ordinary aircraft seat belt .       yes  it is .  here  you ve got this hooked incorrectly .  allow me .   she leaned across him and grant found himself staring at one cheek at close quarters and catching the understated delicacy of light scent .  he restrained himself .     cora said in a low voice .   i m sorry if i ve been hard on you  but my position is a difficult one .       i find it delightful at the moment  .   .   .  no  forgive me .  that slipped out .      she said   i have a position at the cmdf quite analogous to that of a number of men but i find myself blocked at every step by the completely extraneous fact of my sex .  either i receive too much consideration or too much condescension and i want neither .  not at work  at any rate .  it leaves me a bundle of frustration .      grant thought the obvious answer but didn t say it .  i was going to be a strain if he were going to continual refrain from the obvious  more  perhaps  than he would able to bear .     he said   whatever your sex  and at this point i ll be careful not to commit myself  you re the calmest person here except for duval  and i don t think he knows he s here .       don t underestimate him  mr .  grant .  he knows he s here  i assure you .  if he s calm  it s because he realizes that the importance of this mission is greater than that of his individual life .       because of benes  secret .       no .  because this will be the first time miniaturization has been used on this scale  and that it is being used for the purpose of saving life .      grant said   will it be safe to use that laser .  after what it nearly did to my finger .       in dr .  duval s hands that laser beam will destroy the clot without disturbing one molecule of the surrounding tissue .       you have a high estimate of his ability .       it is the world s estimate .  and i share it with reason .  i have been with him ever since i got my master s degree .       i suspect he shows you neither too much condescension nor too much consideration merely because you are a woman .       no  he doesn t .      she returned to her seat and slipped on her own harness in one fluid motion .     owens called .   dr .  michaels  we re waiting .      michaels  having stepped from his seat and moved slowly about the cabin seemed  for the moment  abstracted and uncertain .  then  looking quickly from one strapped person to another said   oh  yes   sat down and adjusted his own harness .     owens swung down from his bubble  checked each harness quickly  mounted again and put on his own .   okay  mr .  grant .  tell them we re ready .      grant did so and the loudspeaker sounded almost at once      attention  proteus .  attention  proties  this is the last voice message you will receive until mission is completed .  you have sixty minutes objective time .  once miniaturization is complete  the ship s time recorder will give the sixty reading .  you are at all times to be aware of that reading  which will be reduced one unit at a time  each minute .  do not repeat  do not  trust your subjective feelings as to time passage .  you must be out of benes  body before the reading reaches zero .  if you are not  you will kill benes regardless of the success of the surgery .  good luck .      the voice stopped and grant could find nothing more original with which to encourage his sinking spirits than   this is it .      to his own surprise  he found he had said it aloud .     michaels  next to him  said   yes  it is   and managed a s weak smile .       in the observation tower  carter waited .  he caught himself wishing he were in the proteus  rather than outside it .  it would be a difficult hour and it would be easier to be in a position where he would know each moment the events of that moment .     he quivered at the sudden sharp tapping of the wireless message over an open circuit .  the aide at the receiving end spoke quietly   proteus reports all secured .      carter called out   miniaturizer .      the proper switch  labelled min  at the proper panel was touched by the proper finger of the proper technician .  it s like a ballet  thought carter  with everyone in place and every motion prescribed  in a dance the end of which none could see .     the touch upon the switch was reflected in the fading to one side of the wall at the end of the miniaturizing room and the revelation  bit by bit  of a huge  honeycombed disc  suspended from a rail running along the ceiling .  it moved toward and over the proteus  making its way silently and without friction on air jets that kept its suspension arm a tenth of an inch above the railing .       to those inside the proteus  the geometrically riddled disc was clearly visible  approaching like a pock marked monster .     michaels  forehead and bald head were unpleasantly beaded with perspiration .   that   he said  in a muffled voice   is the miniaturizer .      grant opened his mouth  but michaels added hurriedly   don t ask me how it works .  owens knows  but i don t .      grant cast an involuntary glance up and back toward owens  who seemed to be tightening and growing rigid .  one of his hands was clearly visible and was grasping a bar which  grant guessed  was one of the ship s more important units of control  grasping it as though the sensation of something material and powerful lent him comfort .  or perhaps the touch of any part of the ship he had himself designed was consoling .  he  more than anyone  must know the strength   or the weakness   of the bubble that would keep them surrounded by a microscopic bit of normality .     grant looked away and found his eye stumbling over duval  whose thin lips were faintly stretched into a smile .      you look uneasy  mr .  grant .  is it not your profession to be in uneasy situations without being uneasy .      darn it .  for how many decades had the public been fed fairy tales about undercover agents .      no  doctor   said grant  levelly .   in my profession to be in an uneasy situation without being uneasy is to be quickly dead .  we are expected only to act intelligently  regardless of the state of our feelings .  you  i take it  do not feel uneasy .       no .  i feel interested .  i feel saturated with with a sense of wonder .  i am unbearably curious and excited .   not uneasy .       what are the chances of death  in your opinion .       small  i hope .  and in any case  i have the consolations of religion .  i have confessed  and for me death is but a doorway .      grant had no reasonable answer to that and made none .  for him  death was a blank wall with but one side  but he had to admit that however logical that seemed to his mind  it offered little consolation at the moment against the worm of uneasiness that  as duval had correctly noted  lay coiled inside that same mind .     he was miserably aware that his own forehead was wet  perhaps as wet as that of michaels  and that cora was looking at him with what his sense of shame immediately translated into contempt .     he said  impulsively   and have you confessed your sin miss peterson .      she said  coolly   which sins do you have in mind  m grant .      he had no answer for that either  so he slumped in his chair and looked up at the miniaturizer which was no exactly overhead .      what do you feel when you are being miniaturized  dr michaels .       nothing  i suppose .  it is a form of motion  a collapsing inward  and if it is done at a constant rate there is no more sensation in that than in moving down an escalator at constant speed .       that s the theory  i suppose   grant kept his eyes fixed on the miniaturizer .   what is the actual sensation .       i don t know .  i have never experienced it .  however  animals in the process of miniaturization never act in the slightest bit disturbed .  they continue their normal actions without interruption  as i have personally noted .       animals .   grant turned to stare at michaels in sudden indignation .   animals .  has any man ever been miniaturized .       i m afraid   said michaels   that we have the honor of being the first .       how thrilling .  let me ask another question .  how far down has any living creature any living creature at all been miniaturized .       fifty   said michaels  briefly .      what .       fifty .  it means the reduction is such that the linear dimensions are one fiftieth normal .       like reducing me to a height of nearly one and a half inches .       yes .       only we re going far past that point .       yes .  to nearly a million  i think .  owens can give you the exact figure .       the exact figure does not matter .  the point is it s much more intense a miniaturization than has ever been tried before .       that is correct .       do you think we can bear up under all the honors we are being showered with in the way of pioneering .       mr .  grant   said michaels  and from somewhere he dredged up the touch of humor that marked his words   i m afraid we must .  we are being miniaturized now  right now  and obviously you don t feel it .       great guns .   muttered grant  and looked up again with kind of frozen and fixed attention .  the bottom of the miniaturizer was glowing with a colored light that blazed without blinding .  it did not seem to be used with the eyes  but with the nerves generally so that lien grant closed his eyes  all actual objects blanked out but the light was still visible as a general  featureless radiance .     michaels must have been watching grant close his eyes pointlessly  for he said   it s not light .  it s not electromagnetic radiation of any sort .  it s a form of energy that is not part of our normal universe .  it affects the nerve endings and our brain interprets it as light because it knows of no other way of interpreting it .       is it dangerous in any way .       not as far as is known  but i must admit that nothing has ever been exposed to it at this intense a level .       pioneering again   muttered grant .     duval cried out   glorious .  like the light of creation .   the hexagonal tiles beneath the vessel were glowing in response to the radiation and the proteus was itself ablaze from within and without .  the chair in which grant sat might have been made of fire  but it remained solid and cool .     even the air about him lit up and he breathed cold illumination .     his fellow passengers and his own hand were frigidly aglow .     duval s luminous band marked out the sign of the cross in a sparking movement and his shining lips moved .     grant said   are you suddenly afraid  dr .  duval .      duval said softly   one prays not only out of fear  but out of gratitude for the privilege of seeing the great wonders of god .      grant acknowledged himself  inwardly  to be the loser of that exchange  too .  he wasn t doing at all well .     owens cried out   look at the walls .      they were drifting away in all directions at a visible rate of speed now and the ceiling was moving upward .  all ends of the large room were shrouded in thick  increasing gloom  all the thicker for being seen through shining air .  the minlaturizer was now an enormous thing  its limits and boundaries not quite visible .  in each indentation of its honeycomb there was a fragment of the unearthly light  a regular marching of so many brilliant stars in a black sky .     grant found himself losing his nervousness in the excitement of it .  with an effort  he glanced hastily at the others .  all of them were looking upward  hypnotized by the light  by the vast distances that had been created out of nowhere  by a room that had enlarged into a universe  and a universe that had grown out of ken .     without warning  the light dimmed to a dull red and the wireless signal sounded in staccato bursts with a sharp  echoing ring .  grant started .     michaels said   belinski at rockefeller said subjective sensations must change with miniaturization .  he was largely ignored  but that signal certainly sounds different .      grant said   your voice doesn t .       that is because you and i are both equally miniaturized .  i m talking about sensations that must cross the miniaturization gap  sensations from out there .      grant translated and read out the message that had come in  miniaturization temporarily halted .  is all well .  reply at once .      is everyone all right .   grant called out  sardonically .  there was no answer and he said   silence gives consent .   and tapped out  all well .       carter licked lips that remained dry .  he watched with painful concentration as the miniaturizer took on its glow and he knew that everyone in the room down to the least essential technician was doing the same .     living human beings had never been miniaturized .  nothing as large as the proteus had ever been miniaturized .  nothing  man or animal  living or dead  large or small  had ever been miniaturized so drastically .     the responsibility was his .  all responsibility in this continuing nightmare was his .      there she goes .   came an almost exultant whisper from the technician at the miniaturization button .  the phrase came clearly over the communications system  as carter watched the proteus shrink .     it did so slowly at first  so that one could only tell it was happening by the change in the way it overlapped the hexagonal structures that made up the floor .  those that were partially revealed beyond the edge of the ship s structure crept outward  and eventually tiles that had earlier been completely hidden began to show .     all around the proteus  the hexagonals emerged  and the rate of miniaturization accelerated until the ship was shrinking like a patch of ice on a warm surface .     carter had watched miniaturization a hundred times  but never with quite the effect upon himself that he was experiencing now .  it was as though the ship were hurling down a long  infinitely long  hole  falling in absolute silence and growing smaller and smaller as the distance increased to miles  to tens of miles  to hundreds  .     the ship was a white beetle now  resting upon the central hexagon immediately under the miniaturizer  resting upon the one red hexagon in the world of white ones the zero module .     the proteus was still falling  still shrinking  and carter  with an effort  raised his hand .  the glow of the minaturizer faded to a dull red and miniaturization stopped .      find out how they are before we continue .      they might conceivably be dead or  just as bad  unable to perform theirs tasks with minimum efficiency .  in that case  they had lost and it would be well to know now .     the communications  technician said   answer returned and reads  all well .      carter thought  if they re unable to operate  they might be unable to realize they re unable .     but there would be no way to check that .  one had to pretend all was well if the crew of the proteus said all was well .  carter said    elevate the  ship .        chapter     submergence      slowly  the zero module began to lift from the floor  a smooth hexagonal pillar  with red top and white sides  bearing the inch wide proteus upon itself .  when the top was four feet above the floor it stopped .      ready for phase two  sir   came the voice of one of the technicians .     carter looked briefly at reid  who nodded .   phase two   said carter .     a panel slid open and a handling device  a gigantic  waldo  so named by the early nuclear technicians from a character in a science fiction story of the      s  carter had once been told  moved in on silent air jets .  it was fourteen feet high and consisted of pulleys on a tripod  pulleys which controlled a vertical arm  dangling down from a horizontal extensor .  the arm itself was in stages  each shorter and on a smaller scale than the one above .  in this case  there were three stages and the lowest one  two inches long  was fitted with steel wires a quarter inch thick  curved to meet each other in interlocking fashion .     the base of the device carried the cmdf insigne and below it was the inscription   min precision handling .     three technicians had entered with the handling device and behind them a uniformed nurse waited with visible impatience .  the brown hair under her nurse s cap looked overhastily adjusted as though on that one day she had other things on her mind .     two of the technicians adjusted the arm of the waldo directly over the shrunken proteus .  for the fine adjustment  three hair thin beams of light reached from the arm support to the surface of the zero module .  the distance of each beam from the center of the module was translated into light intensity upon a small circular screen divided into three segments  meeting in its center .     the light intensities  clearly unequal  shifted delicately as the third technician adjusted a knob .  with the skill of practice  he brought the three segments to equal intensity in a matter of seconds  equal enough to wipe out the boundaries between them .  the technician then threw a switch and locked the waldo into position .  the centering lines of light flicked off and the broader beam of a searchlight illuminated the proteus by indirect reflection .     another control was manipulated  and the arm sank toward the proteus .  slowly and gently it came down  the technician holding his breath .  he had probably handled more miniaturized objects than anyone in the country  possibly than anyone in the world  although no one knew all the details of what was going .  on over there  of course  but this was something unprecedented .     he was going to lift something with a greater normal mass by many times than he had ever done before  and what he was going to lift contained five living human beings .  even a small  barely visible tremor might be enough to kill .     the prongs below opened and slowly slipped down over the proteus .  the technician stopped them and tried to have his eyes assure himself that what his instruments told him was true .  the prongs were accurately centered .  slowly  they closed  bit by bit  until they met underneath the ship and formed a close knit  precision adjusted cradle .     the zero module then dropped and left the proteus suspended in the cradle claws .     the zero module did not stop at floor level  but sank below .  underneath the suspended ship was  for a few minutes  nothing but a hole .     then  sheer glass walls began to rise upward from within the gap left by the zero module .  when those walls  clear and cylindrical  had emerged a foot and a half  the meniscus of a clear liquid showed .  when the zero module had emerged to floor level again  what was resting upon it was a cylinder  one foot wide and four feet tall  two thirds filled with fluid .  the cylinder rested on a circling cork base on which the lettering read  saline solution .     the arm of the waldo  which had not budged during this change  was now suspended over the solution .  the ship was held within the upper portion of the cylinder  a foot above the solution level .     the arm was dropping now  slowly and more slowly .  it stopped when the proteus was almost at solution level  and then began moving with a velocity scaled down by a factor of ten thousand .  the gears under the technician s immediate control moved rapidly while the ship lowered at a rate invisible to the eye .     contact .  the ship lowered further and further till it was half submerged .  the technician held it so for a moment  and then  as slowly as ever  he disengaged the  claws and  making sure the individual wires would clear the ship  lifted them free of the solution .     with a subdued   yahoo   he ran up the arm and unclamped the waldo .   okay  let s get it out of here   he said to the two on either side and then  remembering  barked out in altered  official tones   ship in ampule  sir .      carter said   good .  check on the crew .        the transfer from module to ampule had been dainty enough from the standpoint of the normal world  but had been anything but from within the proteus .     grant had radioed back the all well signal and then  overcoming the initial moment of nausea  at the sudden lurch upward as the zero module began to rise  said   what now .  more miniaturization .  anyone know .      owens said   we ll have to submerge before the next stage of miniaturization .       submerge where .   but grant received no answer to that .  he looked out again into the dim universe of the miniaturization room and caught his first glimpse of the giants .     they were men  moving toward them towers of men in the dim outer light  men foreshortened downward  foreshortened upward  as though viewed in giant distorting mirrors .  a belt buckle was a square of metal  a foot either way .  a shoe  far below  might have been a railroad car .  a head far above seemed a mountainous nose surrounding the twin tunnels of the nostrils .  they moved with odd slowness .      time sense   muttered michaels .  he was squinting upward and then looking at his watch .      what .   asked grant .      another one of belinski s suggestions  that the time sense alters with miniaturization .  ordinary time seems to lengthen and stretch so that right now  five minutes seems to last  i should judge  ten minutes .  the effect grows more intense with extent of miniaturization but exactly what the relationship is  i can t say .  belinski needed the kind of experimental data we can now give him .   see .   he . held out his wristwatch .     grant looked at it  then at his own .  the sweep secondhand did seem to be crawling at that .  he held the watch to his ear .  there was only the faint whirr of its tiny motor but the tone of that whirr seemed to have deepened .      this is good   said michaels .   we have an hour  but it may seem like several hours to us .  a good number  perhaps .       do you mean we will move more quickly .       to ourselves we will move normally  but to an observer in the outer world  i suspect we will seem to be moving quickly   to be squeezing more activity into a given time .  which would  of course  be good  considering the limited time we have .       but .  .  .      michaels shook his head   please .  i can t explain better than that .  belinski s bio physics i think i understand  but his mathematics is beyond me .  maybe owens can tell you .      grant said   i ll ask him afterward .  if there is an afterward .      the ship was suddenly in the light again  ordinary white light .  motion caught grant s eyes and he looked up .  something was descending  a giant pair of prongs moved down on either side of the ship .     owens called out .   everyone check their body harness .      grant did not bother .  he felt a yank behind him  and twisted automatically as far as the harness would allow .     cora said   i was checking to see if you were being tightly held .       only by the harness   said grant   but thanks .       you re welcome .   then  turning to her right  she said  solicitously   dr .  duval .  your harness .       all right .  yours .      cora had loosened the harness so that she might reach grant .  she tightened it now and barely in time .  the prongs had moved below eye level now and were coming together like a gigantic crushing jaw .  grant automatically stiffened .  they halted  moved again  and made contact .     the proteus jogged and jarred and all aboard were thrown violently to the right and then  less violently  to the left .  a harsh  reverberating clang filled the ship .     there was then silence and the clear sensation of suspension over emptiness .  the ship swayed gently and trembled even more gently .  grant looked down and saw a vast red surface sinking and growing dim and dark and vanishing .     he had no way of knowing what the distance to the floor was  on their present size scale  but the sensation was like that he would have had if he had leaned out a window on the twentieth floor of an apartment building .     something as small as the ship now was  falling that distance  ought not to sustain serious damage .  air resistance would slow them to safe velocities .   at least  if their smallness were all there were to it .     but grant had a lively remembrance of the point made by owens during briefing .  he himself was at this moment made up of as many atoms as a full sized man and not of as few as an object actually his present size would be .  he was correspondingly more fragile and so was the ship .  a fall from this height would smash the ship and kill the crew .     he looked at the cradle holding the ship .  what they seemed to a normal man  grant did not stop to consider .  to himself  they were curved steel pillars ten feet in diameter  meshed neatly into a continuous cradle of metal .  for the moment  he felt safe .     owens called out in a voice that cracked with excitement   here it comes .      grant looked quickly in various directions before making out what  it  was .     the light was glinting off the smooth transparent surfaces of a circle of glass big enough to surround a house .  it rose smoothly and rapidly  and far below directly below was the sudden iridescent and twinkling reflection of lights upon water .     the proteus was suspended over a lake .  the glass walls of the cylinder were rising on all sides of the ship now and the surface of the lake did not appear to be more than fifty feet below them .     grant leaned back in his chair .  he had no trouble guessing what came next .  he was prepared  therefore  and felt no nausea whatever when his seat seemed to drop from under him .  the sensation was very much like that he had once experienced in the course of a power dive over the ocean .  the plane that had engaged in that maneuver had pulled out as it was meant to  but the proteus  suddenly an airborne submarine  was not going to .     grant tensed his muscles  then tried to relax them in order to let the harness rather than his bones take the blow .     they hit and the shock nearly jarred his teeth from their sockets .     what grant expected to see through the window was spray  a wall of water shooting high .  what he saw instead was a large  thick swell  smoothly rounded  speeding oilily away .  then  as they continued to sink  another and another .     the claws of the cradle unhooked and the ship jounced madly and came to a floating stop  slowly turning .     grant let out a long breath .  they were on the surface of a lake  yes  but it was like no surface he had ever seen .     michaels said   you expected waves  mr .  grant .       yes  i did .       i must confess i rather did myself .  the human mind  grant  is a funny thing .  it expects always to see what it had seen in the past .  we are miniaturized and are put in a small container of water .  it seems like a lake to us so we expect waves  foam  breakers  who knows what else .  but whatever this lake appears to us to be  it is not a lake but merely a small container of water  and it has ripples and not waves .  and no matter how you enlarge a ripple  it never looks like a wave .       interesting enough  though   said grant .  the thick rolls of fluid  which on an ordinary scale would have made tiny ripples  continued to race outward .  reflected from the distant wall  they returned and made interference patterns that broke the rolls into separate hills  while the proteus rose and fell in drastic rhythms .      interesting .   said cora  indignantly .   is that all you can say .  it s simply magnificent .       his handiwork   added duval   is majestic on every scale of magnitude .       all right   said grant   i ll buy that .  magnificent and majestic .   check .  only a little nauseating  too  you know .       oh  mr .  grant   said cora   you have a knack for deflating everything .       sorry   said grant .     the wireless sounded and grant sent back the all well signal again .  he resisted the impulse to send back  all sea sick .      still  even cora was beginning to look uncomfortable .  perhaps he shouldn t have put the thought into her mind .     owens said   we ll have to submerge manually .  grant  slip out of your harness and open valves one and two .      grant rose unsteadily to his feet  delighted at the feeling  of even the limited freedom of walking  and moved to a butterfly valve marked one on the bulkhead .      i ll take the other   said duval .  their eyes met for a moment  and duval  as though embarrassed by the sudden intimate awareness of another human being  smiled hesitantly .  grant smiled back and thought indignantly  now how can she get sentimental over this mass of unawareness .     with the valves open  the surrounding fluid flowed into the appropriate chambers of the ship  and the liquid rose all about again  higher and higher .     grant moved part way up the ladder to the upper bubble and said   how does it look  captain owens .      owens shook his head .   it s hard to say .  the readings on the dials lack significance .  they were designed with a real ocean in view .  darn it  i never designed the proteus for this .       my mother never designed  me for this  either  if it comes to that   said grant .  they were completely submerged now .  duval had closed both valves and grant returned to his seat .     he put on his harness once again with an almost luxurious feeling .  once beneath the surface the erratic rise and fall of the tiny swell was gone  and there was a blessed motionlessness .       carter tried to unclench his fists .  so far  it had gone well .  the all well had sounded from within the ship  which was now a small capsule glimmering inside the saline solution .      phase three   he said .     the miniaturizer  the brilliance of which had remained subdued through all the second phase  lifted into white glory again  but only from the centermost sections of the honeycomb .     carter watched earnestly .  it was hard to tell at first if what he saw were objectively real  or the straining of his mind .   no  it really was shrinking again .     the inch wide beetle was reducing in size and so  presumably  was the water in its immediate vicinity .  the focus of the miniaturizing beam was tight and accurate and carter expelled another held breath .  at each stage  there was a danger peculiar to itself .     glancingly  carter imagined  what might happen if the beam had been slightly less accurate  if half the proteus had miniaturized rapidly  while the other half  caught at the boundary of the beam  had miniaturized slowly or not at all .  but it hadn t happened and he strove to put it out of his mind .     the proteus was a shrinking dot now  smaller  smaller  down to the barest edge of sight .  now the entire miniaturizer sprang into brilliance .  it wouldn t do to try to focus the beam on something too small to see .     right  right  thought carter .  do the whole thing now .     the entire cylinder of liquid was now shrinking  more and more quickly  until finally it was a mere ampule  two inches high and half an inch thick  with somewhere in the miniaturized fluid an infra miniaturized proteus  no larger than the size of a large bacterium .  the miniaturizer dimmed again .      get them   said carter  shakily .   get some word from them .      he breathed through a tightened throat until the all well was once more announced .  four men and a woman who  not many minutes before  had stood before him in full size and life  were tiny bits of matter within a germ sized ship and were still alive .     he put out his hands  palms downward   take out the miniaturizer on the double .      the last dim light of the miniaturizer flicked out as it moved rapidly away .     a blank circular dial on the wall above carter s head now flashed into a dark    .     carter nodded to reid .   take over  don .  we ve got sixty minutes from this instant .        chapter     entry      the light of the miniaturizer had flashed on again after submergence and the fluid all about had turned into a glimmering opaque milk  but nothing followed that could be observed from within the proteus .   if the opacity were spreading out and the ship shrinking further  there was no way of telling .     grant did not speak in  that interval of time  nor did anyone else .  it seemed to last forever .  and then the light of the miniaturizer went out and owens cried out   is everyone all right .      duval said   i m fine .   cora nodded .  grant lifted a reassuring hand .  michaels shrugged slightly and said   i m all right .       good .  i think we re at full miniaturization now   said owens .     he flipped a switch which hitherto he had not touched .  for an anxious moment  he waited for a dial to come to life .  it did  with a dark and sharp    outlined  upon it .  a similar dial  lower in the ship and visible to the other four  recorded the same .     the wireless rattled harshly and grant sent back the all well .  for a moment  it was as though some climax  had been reached .     grant said   they say outside we re at full miniaturization .  you guessed correctly  captain owens .       and here we are   said owens  sighing audibly .     grant thought  miniaturization is complete but the mission isn t .   it s just beginning .  sixty .  sixty minutes .     aloud  he said   captain owens .  why is the ship vibrating .  is there anything wrong .      michaels said   i feel it .  it s an uneven vibration .    i feel it  too   said cora .     owens came down from the bubble  mopping his forehead with a large handkerchief .      we can t help this .  it s brownian motion .      michaels raised his hands with an  oh  lord   of helpless and resigned understanding .     grant said   whose motion .       brown s if you must know .  robert brown  an eighteenth century scottish botanist  who first observed it .  you see  we re being bombarded by water molecules from all sides .  if we were full size  the molecules would be so tiny in comparison that their collisions wouldn t affect .  however  the fact that we re tremendously miniaturized brings about the same results that would follow if we had remained constant and everything in our surroundings had been greatly magnified .       like the water all around .       exactly .  so far  we re not badly off .  the water around us has been partly miniaturized with us .  when we get into the blood stream  though  each water molecule on our present scale will weigh a milligram or so .  they will still be too small to affect us individually  but thousands will be striking us simultaneously from all directions  and those strikes won t be distributed evenly .  several hundred more might strike from the right than from the left at any given instant  and the combined force of those several hundred extra will shove us toward the left .  the next instant we may be forced a bit downward and so on .  this vibration we feel now is the result of such random molecular strikes .      it will be worse later on .        fine   groaned grant .   nausea  here i come .       it will only be for an hour at most   said cora  angrily .   i wish you would act more grown up .      michaels said  with obvious worry   can the ship take the battering  owens .      owens said   i think so .  i tried to make some calculations concerning it in advance .  from what i feel now  i think my estimates weren t far off .  this can be endured .      cora said   even if the ship is battered and crushed  it s bound to stand up under the bombardment for a little while .  if everything goes well  we can get to the clot and take care of it in fifteen minutes or less and after that it really doesn t matter .      michaels brought his fist down on the arm rest of his chair .   miss peterson  you are speaking nonsense .  what do you suppose would happen  if we managed to reach the clot  destroy it  restore benes to health and then have the proteus smashed to rubble immediately afterward .  i mean  aside from our deaths which i am ready to consider ignoring for the sake of further argument .  it would mean benes  death  too .       we understand that   broke in duval  stiffly .      your assistant apparently does not .  if this ship were to be beaten into fragments  miss peterson  then when the sixty minutes   no  fifty nine   are up  each individual fragment  however small  would enlarge to normal size .  even if the ship were dissolved into atoms  each atom would enlarge and benes would be permeated through and through with the matter of ourselves and the ship .      michaels took a deep breath  one that sounded almost like a snort .  he went on   it is easy to get us out of benes  body if we are intact .  if the ship is in fragments  there will be no way of flushing every fragment out of benes  body .  no matter what is done  enough will remain to kill him at de miniaturization time .  do you understand .      cora seemed to shrink within herself .   i hadn t thought of that .       well  think of it   said michaels .   you too  owens .  now i want to know again  will the proteus stand up under the brownian motion .  i don t mean only till we reach the clot .  i mean till we reach it  finish it  and return .  consider what you say  owens .  if you don t think the ship can survive then we have no right to go on .       well  then   interposed grant   stop hectoring  dr .  michaels  and give captain owens a chance to talk .      owens said doggedly   i came to no final opinion till i felt the partial brownian motion we now experience .  it is my feeling at the present motion  that we can stand up to sixty full minutes of the full pounding .       the question is  ought we to take the risk on the mere strength of captain owens  feelings .   said michaels .      not at all   said grant .   the question is  will i accept captain owens  estimate of the situation .  please remember that general carter said i was to make the policy decisions .  i am accepting owens  statement simply because we have no one of greater authority or with a better understanding of the ship to consult .       well  then   said michaels   what is your decision .       i accept owens  estimate .  we proceed with the mission .   duval said   i agree with you  grant .      michaels  slightly flushed  nodded his head .   all right  grant .  i was merely making what seemed to me a legitimate point .   he took his seat .     grant said   it was a most legitimate point  and i m glad you raised it .   he remained standing  by the window .     cora joined him after a moment and said  quietly   you didn t sound frightened  grant .      grant smiled joylessly .   ah  but that s because i m a good actor  cora .  if it were anyone else taking the responsibility for the decision  i would have made a terrific speech in favor of quitting .  you see  i have cowardly feelings  but i try not to make cowardly decisions .      cora watched him for a moment .   i get the notion  mr .  grant  that you have to work awfully hard  sometimes  to make yourself sound worse than you really are .       oh  i don t know .  i have a talen  .  .  .      at that point  the proteus moved convulsively  first to one side  then to the other  in great sweeps .     lord  thought grant  we re sloshing .     he caught cora s elbow  and forced her toward her seat  then with difficulty took his own while owens swayed and stumbled in an attempt to make it up the ladder  crying out   damn it  they might have warned us .      grant braced himself against his chair and noted the time recorder reading to be    .  a long  minute  he thought .  michaels had said the time sense slowed with miniaturization and he was obviously right .  there would be more time for thought and action .     more time for second thought and panic  too .     the proteus moved even more abruptly .  would the ship break up before the mission proper had even started .       reid took carter s place at the window .  the ampule with its few milliliters of partially miniaturized water  in which the completely miniaturized and quite invisible proteus was submerged  gleamed on the zero module  like some rare gem on a velvet cushion .     at least reid thought the metaphor  but did not allow it to console him .  calculations had been precise and the miniaturization technique could produce sizes that would fully match the precision of the calculation .  that calculation  however  had been worked out in the space of a few hurried and pressure filled hours  by means of a system of computer programming that had not been checked out .     to be sure  if the size were slightly off  it could be corrected  but the time required to do so would have to come out of the sixty minutes and it was going to be fifty nine in fifteen seconds .      phase four   he said .     the waldo had already moved above the ampule  the claw adjusted for horizontal holding  rather than vertical .  again the device was centered  again the arm dropped and the claws came together with infinite delicacy .     the ampule was held with the firm gentleness of a lioness  paw upon her unruly cub .     it was the nurse s turn at last .  she stepped forward briskly  took a small case from her pocket and opened it .  she removed a small glass rod  holding it gingerly by a flat head set upon a slightly constricted neck .  she placed it vertically over the ampule and let it slide a small fraction of an inch  into it  until air pressure held it steady .  she spun it gently and said   plunger fits .       from his upper view  reid smiled in tight relief  and carter nodded his approval .      the nurse waited and the waldo lifted its arm slowly .  smoothly  smoothly  the ampule and plunger rose .  three inches above the zero module  it stopped .     as gently as she might  the nurse eased the cork base off the bottom of the ampule  revealing a small nipple centered on the otherwise flat lower surface .  the tiny opening in the middle of the nipple was masked with a thin plastic sheet that would not stand up against even moderate pressure  but would hold firm against leakage as long as undisturbed .     moving quickly again  the nurse removed a stainless steel needle from the case and adjusted it over the nipple .      needle fits   she said .     what had been an ampule had become a hypodermic needle .     a second set of claws swung out from the waldo and was adjusted to the head of the plunger  then clamped into place .  the entire waldo  carrying the hypodermic needle in its two claws now moved smoothly toward the large double doors that opened at its approach .     no human being could  with his unaided eyes  have detected any motions in the liquid so steadily transported by the inhumanly smooth movement of the machine .  both carter and reid  however  understood quite well that even microscopic motions would be nothing less than storm tossing to the crew of the proteus .     when the device entered the operating room and stopped at the table  carter recognized this fact by ordering   contact the proteus .      the reply was  all well but a little shook  and carter forced a grin at that .     benes was lying on the operating table  a second focus of interest in the room .  the thermal blanket covered him to the collarbone .  thin rubber tubes led from the blanket to the central thermal unit under the operating table .     forming a rough semi sphere beyond benes  shaven  grid marked head were a group of sensitive detectors intended to react to the presence of radioactive emissions .     a team of gauze masked surgeons and their assistants hovered about benes  their eyes fixed solemnly on the approaching device .  the time recorder was prominent on one wall and at this point it changed from    to    .     the waldo stopped at bedside .     two of the sensors moved from their place  as though they were suddenly endowed with life .  following the long distance manipulations of a quick working technician  they lined up on either side of the hypodermic  one adjacent to the ampule and one to the needle .     a small screen on the technician s desk woke to greenish life as a blip appeared upon it  faded  was reinforced  .  faded again  and so on .     the technician said   proteus radioactivity being received .      carter brought his hands together in a harsh clap and reacted with grim satisfaction .  another hurdle  one which he had not been allowing himself to face  had been overcome .  it was not merely radioactivity that had to be sensed  but radioactive particles that had themselves been miniaturized  and that  because of their incredibly tiny  infra atomic size could pass through any ordinary sensor without affecting it .  the particles had  therefore  to pass through a de miniaturizer first  and the necessary juxtaposition of de miniaturizer and sensor had only been improvised in the frantic hours of the early morning .     the waldo holding the plunger of the hypodermic now pushed downward with a smoothly increasing pressure .  the fragile plastic barrier between ampule and needle broke and  after a moment  a tiny bubble began to appear at the tip of the needle .  it dropped off into a small container placed underneath  a second bubble and a third followed .     the plunger sank  and so did the water level within the ampule .  and then  the blip on the screen before the technician s eyes changed position .      proteus in needle   he called out .     the plunger held .     carter looked at reid   okay .      reid nodded .  he said   we can insert now .      the hypodermic needle was tilted into a sharp slant by the two sets of claws and the waldo began to move again  this time toward a spot on benes  neck which a nurse now hastily swabbed with alcohol .  a small circle was marked on the neck  within the circle a smaller cross  and toward the center of the cross the tip of the hypodermic needle approached .  the sensors followed it .     a moment of hesitation as the needle tip touched the neck .  it punctured and entered a prescribed distance  the plunger moved slightly and the sensor technician called out   proteus injected .      the waldo moved off hurriedly .  the cloud of sensors moved in  like eagerly reaching antennae  settling down all over benes  head and neck .      tracking   called out the sensor technician  and flipped a switch .  a half dozen screens  each with its blip in a different position  lit up .  somewhere the information on those screens was fed into a computer  which controlled the huge map of benes  circulatory system .  on that map  a bright dot sprang into life in the carotid artery .  into that artery the proteus had been injected .     carter considered praying but didn t know how .  on the map there seemed only the smallest distance between the position of the dot of light and the position of the blood clot on the brain .     carter watched as the time recorder moved to     then followed the unmistakable and rather rapid motion of the dot of light along the artery  headward and toward the clot .     momentarily  he closed his eyes and thought  please .  if there is anything out there somewhere  please .       grant called out  having a little difficulty catching his breath .   we ve been moved toward benes .  they say they re getting us into the needle and then into his neck .  and i ve told them we re a little shook .  whoof   a little shook .       good   said owens .  he battled with the controls  trying to guess at the rocking motions and neutralize their effect .     he wasn t very successful .     grant said   listen  why   why do we have to get into the   oof   needle .       we ll be more constricted there .  moving the needle will hardly affect us then .  another uh thing  we want as little of the miniaturized water pumped into benes as possible .      cora said   oh  dear .      her hair had fallen into disarray and as she tried  futilely  to move it back and out of her eyes  she nearly fell over .  grant tried to catch her but duval had her upper arm in a firm grip .     as suddenly as the erratic rocking had started  it ceased .      we re in the needle   said owens with relief .  he turned on the ship s outer lights .     grant peered ahead .  there was little to see .  the saline solution ahead seemed to sparkle like a dusting of dim fireflies .  far up above and far down below was the distant curve of something which shone more brightly .  the walls of the needle .     a quick sense of worry nagged at him .  he turned to michaels .   doctor .  .  .      michaels  eyes were closed .  they opened reluctantly and his head turned in the direction of the voice .   yes  mr .  grant .       what do you see .      michaels stared forward  spread his hands slightly  and said   sparkles .       do you make out anything clearly .  does everything seem to dance about .       yes  it does .  it dances .       does that mean our eyes are affected by the miniaturization .       no  no  mr .  grant .   michaels sighed wearily   if you re worried about blindness  forget it .  look around you here in the proteus .  look at me .  is there anything wrong with how it looks in here .       no .       very well .  in here  you are seeing miniaturized lightwaves with an equally miniaturized retina and all is well .  but when miniaturized light waves go out there into a less miniaturized or completely unminiaturized world  they are not easily reflected .  they re quite penetrating  in fact .  we see only intermittent reflections here and there .  therefore  everything out there seems to flicker to us .       i see .  thank you  doc   said grant .     michaels sighed again .   i trust i get my sea legs soon .  the flickering light and the brownian motion together are giving me a headache .       here we go .   cried owens  suddenly .     they were sliding forward now   the sensation was unmistakable .  the far off curving walls of the hypodermic needle seemed more solid now as the spotty reflection of miniaturized light from their walls blurred and melted together .  it was like riding a roller coaster down an infinite incline .     up ahead  the solidity seemed to come to an end in a tiny circle of flicker .  the circle enlarged slowly  then more rapidly  then yawned into an incredible abyss and all was flicker .     owens said   we re in the carotid artery now .   the time recorder read    .       chapter     artery      duval looked about with exultation .   conceive it   he said   inside a human body  inside an artery .   owens .  put out the interior lights  man .  let us see god s handiwork .      the interior lights went off  but a form  of ghostly light streamed in from outside  the spotty reflection of the ship s miniaturized light beams fore and aft .     owens had brought the proteus into virtual motionlessness with reference to the arterial blood stream  allowing it to sweep along with the heart driven flow .  he said   you can remove harnesses  i think .      duval was out of his in a bound  and cora was with him at once .  they flung themselves at the window in a kind of marveling ecstasy .  michaels rose more deliberately  threw a glance at the other two  then turned to his chart  studying it closely .     he said tightly   excellent precision .       did you think we might have missed the artery .   asked grant .     for a moment  michaels stared absently at grant  then   uh   no .  that would have been unlikely .  but we might have penetrated past a key branch point  been unable to buck the arterial current  and lost time having to plot an alternate and poorer route .  as it is  the ship is just where it ought to be .   his voice quavered .     grant said  encouragingly   we seem to be doing well so far .       yes .   a pause  then hastily   from this spot  we combine ease of insertion  rapidity of current  and directness of route  so that we should reach our destination with an absolute minimum of delay .       well  good .   grant nodded  and turned to the window .  almost at once he was lost in amazement at the wonder of it all .     the distant wall seemed half a mile away and glowed a brilliant amber in fits and sparks  for it was mostly hidden by the vast melange of objects that floated by near the ship .     it was a vast exotic aquarium they faced  one in which not fish but far stranger objects .  filled the vision .  large rubber tires  the centers depressed but not pierced through  were the most numerous objects .  each was about twice the diameter of the ship  each an orange straw color  each sparkling and blazing intermittently  as though faceted with diamond slivers .     duval said   the color is not quite true .  if it were possible to de miniaturize the light waves as they leave the ship and miniaturize the returning reflection  we would be far better off .  it is important to obtain an accurate reflection .      owens said   you re quite right  doctor  and the work done by johnson and antoniani indicates that this might actually be possible .  unfortunately  the technique is not yet practical and even if it were  we couldn t have adapted the ship for the purpose in a single night .       i suppose not   said duval .      but even if it s not an accurate reflection   said cora in an awed tone   surely it has a beauty all its own .  they re like soft  squashed balloons that have trapped a millions stars apiece .       actually  they re red blood corpuscles   said michaels to grant .   red in the mass  but straw colored individually .  those  you see are fresh from the heart  carrying their load of oxygen to the head and  particularly  the brain .      grant continued to stare about in wonder .  in addition to the corpuscles  there were smaller objects  flattened plate like affairs were rather common  for instance .   platelets  thought grant  as the shapes of the objects brought up brightening memories of physiology courses in college .      one of the platelets moved gently against the ship  so closely that grant almost had the impulse to reach out and seize it .  it flattened slowly  remained in contact for a moment  then moved away  leaving particles of itself clinging to the window a smear that slowly washed away .      it didn t break   said grant .      no   said michaels .   had it broken  a small clot might have formed about it .  not enough to do any damage  i hope .  if we were larger  though  we might run into trouble .  see that .      grant looked off in the direction of the pointing finger .     he saw small rod like objects  shapeless fragments and detritus and  above all  red corpuscles  red corpuscles  red corpuscles .  then he made out the object at which michaels was pointing .     it was huge  milky and pulsating .  it was granular and inside its milkiness there were black twinkles flashing bits of black so intense as to glow with a blinding non light of their own .     within the mass was a darker area  dim through the surrounding milkiness  and maintaining a steady  unwinking shape .  the outlines of the whole could not be clearly made out but a milky bay suddenly extended in toward the artery wall and the mass seemed to flow into it .  it faded out now  obscured by the closer objects  lost in the swirl  .  .  .      what was that .   asked grant .      a white blood cell  of course .  there aren t many of those  at least  not compared to the red corpuscles .  there are about     reds for every white .  the whites are much bigger  though  and they can move independently .  some of them can even work their way out of the blood vessels altogether .  they re frightening objects  seen on this scale of size .  that s about as close as i want to be to one .       they re the body s scavengers  aren t they .       yes .  we re bacterial sized but we have a metal skin and not a mucopolysaccharide cell wall .  i trust the white cells can tell the difference and that as long as we do no damage to the surrounding tissues  they won t react to us .      grant tried to withdraw his too particular attention from individual objects and attempted to absorb the panorama as a whole .  he stepped back and narrowed his eyes .     it was a .  dance .  each object quivered in its position .  the smaller the object  the more pronounced the quiver .  it was like a colossal and unruly ballet in which the choreographer had gone mad and the dancers were caught in the grip of an eternally insane tarantella .     grant closed his eyes .   feel it .  the brownian motion  i mean .      owens answered   yes  i feel it .  it s not as bad as i thought it would be .  the blood stream is viscous  much more viscous than the saline solution we were in  and the high viscosity damps out the motion .      grant felt the ship move under his feet  first this way  then that  but only soggily  not sharply as had been true while they were still in the hypodermic .  the protein content of the fluid portion of the blood  the  plasma proteins   the phrase came swimming to grant out of the past  cushioned the ship .     not bad at all .  he felt cheered .  perhaps all would be well yet .     owens said   i suggest you all return to your seats now .  we will be approaching a branch in the artery soon and i am going to move over to one side .      the others settled themselves into their seats  still watching their surroundings in absorption .      i think it s a shame that we ll only have a few minutes for this   said cora .   dr .  duval  what are those .      a mass of very tiny structures  clinging together and forming a tight spirally shaped pipe  passed by .  several more followed  each expanding and contracting as it went .      ah   said duval   i don t recognize that .       a virus  perhaps   suggested cora .      a little too large for virus  i think  and certainly like none i ve seen .   owens  are we equipped to take samples .      owens said   we can get out of the ship  if we have to  doctor  but we can t stop for samples .       come now  we may not have this chance again .   duval rose testily to his feet .   let s get a piece of that into the ship .  miss peterson  you  .  .  .      owens said   this ship has a mission  doctor .       it doesn t matter to  .  .  .   began duval  but then broke off at the firm grip of grant s hand on his shoulder .      if you don t mind  doctor   said grant   let s not argue about this .  we have a job to do and we won t stop to pick up anything or turn aside to pick up anything or as much as slow down to pick up anything .  i take it you understand that and will not raise the subject again .      in the uncertain flickering light reflected from the arterial world outside  duval was clearly frowning .      oh  well   he said  ungraciously   they ve gotten away anyhow .      cora said   once we complete this job  dr .  duval  there will be methods developed for miniaturization for indefinite intervals .  we can then take part in a real exploration .       yes  i suppose you re right .      owens said   arterial wall to the right .     the proteus had made a long  sweeping curve and the wall seemed about a hundred feet away  now .  the somewhat corrugated amber stretch of endothelial layer that made up the inner lining of the artery was clearly visible in all its detail .      hah   said duval   what a way to check on athero sclerosis .  you can count the plaques .       you could peel them off  too  couldn t you .   asked grant .      of course .  consider the future .  a ship can be sent through a clogged arterial system  loosening and detaching the sclerotic regions  breaking them up  boring and reaming out the tubes .  pretty expensive treatment  however .       maybe it could be automated eventually   said grant .   perhaps little housekeeping robots can be sent in to clean up the mess .  or perhaps every human being in early manhood can be injected with a permanent supply of such vessel cleansers .  look at the length of it .      they were closer still to the arterial wall now  and the ride was growing rougher in the turbulence near it .  looking ahead  though  they could see the wall stretching ahead for what seemed unbroken miles before veering off .     michaels said   the circulatory system  counting all its vessels to the very smallest  is as i told you earlier  a hundred thousand miles long  if it were strung out in one long line .       not bad   said grant .      a hundred thousand miles in the unminiaturized scale .  on our present scale  it is   he paused to think  then said   over three trillion miles long half a light year .  to travel through every one of benes  blood vessels in our present state would be almost the equivalent of a trip to a star .      he looked about haggardly .  neither their safety thus far  nor the beauty of their surroundings  seemed to have consoled him much .     grant strove to be cheerful .   at least the brownian motion isn t at all bad   he said .      no   said michaels .  then   i didn t come off too well a while ago when we first discussed brownian motion .       neither did duval just now in the matter of samples .  i don t think any of us are doing really well .      michaels swallowed .   that was typically single minded of  duval to want to stop for specimens .      he shook his head and turned to the charts on the curving desk against one wall .  it  and the moving dot of light upon it  was a duplicate of the much larger version in the control tower  and of the smaller version in owens  bubble .  he said      what s our speed  owens .       fifteen knots  our scale       of course  our scale   said michaels  pettishly .  he lifted his slide rule from its recess and made a rapid calculation .   we ll be at the branch in two minutes .  keep the wall at its present distance when you turn .  that will bring you safely into the middle of the branch and you can then move smoothly into the capillary net without further branching .  is that clear .       all clear .      grant waited  watching always through the window .  for a moment  he caught the shadow of cora s profile and watched that  but the view from the window overpowered even his study of the curve of her chin .     two minutes .  how much would that be .  two minutes as his miniaturized time sense would make it out to be .  or two minutes by their time recorder .  he twisted his head to look at it .  it read    and  as he watched  it blanked out and then  very deliberately     appeared dimly and darkened .     there was a sudden wrench and grant was nearly thrown out of his seat .      owens .   he cried out .   what happened .      duval said   have we struck something .      grant struggled his way toward the ladder and managed to climb up .  he said   what s wrong .       i don t know .   owens  face was a contorted mask of effort .   the ship won t handle .      michaels  voice came up tensely   captain owens  correct your course .  we re approaching the wall .       i know that   gasped owens .   we re in some sort of current .      grant said   keep trying .  do your best .      he swung down and  with his back against the ladder  trying to hold steady against the heaving of the ship  said   why should there be a cross current here .  aren t we going along with the arterial flow .       yes   said michaels  emphatically  his face waxen in its pallor   there can t be anything to force us sideways like this .   he pointed outward at the arterial wall  much closer now and still approaching .   there must be something wrong with the controls .  if we strike the wall and damage it  a clot may form about us and fix us there  or the white cells may respond .      duval said   but this is impossible in a closed system .  the laws of hydrodynamics .  .  .       a closed system .   michaels  eyebrows shot upward .  with an effort  he staggered his way to his charts  then moaned   it s no use  i need more magnification and i can t get it here .   watch it  owens  keep away from the wall .      owens  .  shouted back   i m trying .  i tell you there s a current that i can t fight .       don t try to fight it directly  then   cried grant .   give the ship its head and confine yourself to trying to keep its course parallel to the wall .      they were close enough now to see every detail of the wall .  the strands of connective tissue that served as its chief support were like trusses  almost like gothic arches  yellowish in color and glimmering with a thin layer of what seemed a fatty substance .     the connective strands stretched and bowed apart as though the whole structure were expanding  hovered a moment  then moved together again  the surface between the trusses crinkling as they closed in .  grant did not need to ask to realize he was watching the arterial wall pulse in time to the beat of the heart .     the buffeting of the ship was growing worse .  the wall was closer still and beginning to look ragged .  the connective strands had worked loose in spots  as though they themselves had been withstanding a raging torrent for much longer than ever the proteus had  and were beginning to buckle under the strain .  they swayed like cables of a gigantic bridge  coming up to the window and sliding past wetly  giving off their sparkling yellow color in the jumping beam of the ship s headlights .     the approach of the next made cora scream in shrill terror .     michaels shouted   watch out  owens .      duval muttered   the artery is damaged .      but the current swept around the living buttress and carried the ship with it  throwing it into a sickening lurch that piled everyone helplessly against the left wall .     grant  his left arm having withstood a painful slam  caught at cora with his other and managed to keep her upright .  staring straight ahead he was trying to make sense out of the sparkling light .     he shouted   whirlpool .  get into your seats  all of you .  strap yourselves in .      the formed particles  from red corpuscles down  were virtually motionless outside the window for the moment as all were caught in the same whirling current while the wall blurred into yellow featurelessness .     duval and michaels struggled to their seats and wrenched at their harnesses .     owens shouted   some sort of opening dead ahead .   grant said urgently to cora   come on .  pull yourself into your seat .       i m trying   she gasped .     desperately  all but unable to keep his footing against the sharp swaying of the ship  grant pushed her down and then reached for her harness .     it was quite too late .  the proteus was caught up in the whirlpool now and was lifted upward and round with the force of a carnival whip .      grant managed to seize a stanchion by a reflex grab and reached out for cora .  she had been hurled to the floor .  her fingers curled over the arm of her chair  and strained uselessly .     they were not going to hold  grant knew  and he reached for her desperately  but he was a good foot short .  his own arm was slipping from the stanchion  as he reached for her .     duval was struggling uselessly in his own seat  but centrifugal pressure had him pinned .   hold on  miss peterson .  i will try to help .      with an effort he had reached his harness  while michaels watched  eyes turning toward them in frozen helplessness  and owens  pinned in his bubble  remained completely out of the picture .     cora s legs lifted from the ground in response to the centrifugal effect .   i can t  .  .  .     grant  out of sheer lack of alternatives  released his own hold .  he slithered across the floor  hooked a leg around the base of a chair with a blow that numbed it  managed to transfer his left arm there  too  and with his right caught cora about the waist as her own grip gave way .     the proteus was turning faster  now  and seemed to be angling downward .  grant could stand the strained position of his body no longer and his leg flipped away from the chair leg .  his arm  already bruised and painful by earlier contact with the wall  took the additional strain with an ache that made it feel as though it were breaking .  cora clutched at his shoulder and seized the material of his uniform with vise like desperation .     grant managed to grunt out   has anyone figured out what s happening .      duval  still struggling futilely with his harness  said   it s a fistula an arterio venous fistula .      with an effort  grant raised his head and looked out the window once more .  the damaged arterial wall came to an end dead ahead .  the yellow sparkling ceased and a blackened ragged gap was visible .  it reached as high and as low as his restricted vision could make out and red corpuscles  as well as other objects  were vanishing into it .  even the occasional terrifying blobs of white cells which appeared sucked rapidly through the hole .      just a few seconds   gasped grant .   just a few  cora .   he was telling it to himself  to his .  own aching  bruising arm .     with a final vibration that nearly stunned grant with the agony he had to endure  they were through  and slowing  slowing  into sudden calm .     grant released his hold and lay there  panting heavily .  slowly  cora managed to get her legs under her and stand up .     duval was free now .   mr .  grant  how are you .   he knelt down at grant s side .     cora knelt down  too  touching grant s arm gently  venturing to try to knead it .  grant grimaced in pain   don t touch it .       is it broken .   asked duval .      i can t tell .   gingerly and slowly  he tried to bend it  then caught his left biceps in his right palm  and held it tightly .   maybe not .  but even if it isn t  it will be weeks before i can do that again .      michaels had also risen .  his face was twisted almost unrecognizably with relief .   we made it .  we made it .  we re in one piece .  how is it  owens .       in good order  i think   said owens .   not a red light on the panel .  the proteus took more than it was designed to take and it held .   his voice reflected a fierce pride in himself and his ship .     cora was still brooding helplessly over grant .  she said  in shock   you re bleeding .       i am .  where .       your side .  the uniform is showing blood .       oh  that .  i had a little trouble on the other side .  it  just a matter of replacing a band aid .  honestly  it s nothing just blood .      cora looked anxious  then unzipped his uniform .   sit up   she said .   please try to sit up .   she slipped an arm under his shoulders and struggled him upright  then pulled the uniform down over his shoulders with practiced gentleness .      i ll take care of it for you   she said .   and thank you .   it seems foolishly inadequate  but thank you .      grant said   well  do the same for me sometime  wilt you .  help me into my chair  will you .      he struggled to his feet now  cora helping him on one side  michaels on the other .  duval  after one glance at them  had limped to the window .     grant said   now what happened .      michaels said   an arterio ven  .   .   .  well  put it this way .  an abnormal connection existed between an artery and a small vein .  it happens sometimes  usually as the result of physical trauma .  it happened to benes at the time he was hurt in the  car  i suppose .  it represents an imperfection  a kind of inefficiency  but in this case not a serious one .  it s microscopic  a tiny eddy .       a tiny eddy .  this .       on our miniaturized scale  of course  it s a gigantic whirlpool .       didn t it show up on your charts of the circulatory system  michaels .   asked grant .      it must have .  i could probably find it here on the ship s chart  if i could magnify it sufficiently .  the trouble is my initial analysis had to be made in three hours and i missed it .  i have no excuse .      grant said   all right  it just means some lost time .  plot out an alternate route and get owens started .  what s the time  owens .   he looked at the time recorder automatically as he asked .  he read      and owens said   fifty two .       plenty of time   said grant .     michaels was staring at grant with raised eyebrows .  he said   there s no time  grant .  you haven t grasped what s happened .  we re finished .  we ve failed .  we can t get to the clot anymore  don t you understand .  we must ask to be removed from the body .      cora said in horror   but it will be days before the ship can be miniaturized again .  benes will die .       there s nothing to be done .  we re heading into the jugular vein now .  we can t go back through the fissure for we couldn t buck that current  even when the heart is in the iastolic stage  between beats .  the only other route  the one in which we follow the venous current  leads through the heart  which is clear suicide .      grant said  numbly   are you sure .      owens said  in a cracked  dull voice   he s right  grant .  i he mission has failed .        chapter      heart      a modified hell had broken loose in the control tower .  the blip indicating the ship had scarcely changed position on the overall screen but the coordinate pattern had been critically altered .     carter and reid turned at the sound of a monitor signal .      sir  the face on the screen was agitated .   proteus off course .  they ve picked up a blip in quadrant     level b .      reid rushed to the window overlooking the mapping room .  there was nothing to see at that distance  of course  except heads bent over the charts in quite obviously electric concentration .     carter reddened .   don t give me that quadrant stuff .  where are they .       in the jugular vein  sir  heading for the superior vena cava .       in a vein .   for a moment  carter s own veins were in alarming evidence .   what in the world are they doing in a vein .  reid .   he thundered .     reid hurried to him .   yes  i heard .       how did they get into a vein .       i ve ordered the men at the chart to try to locate an arterio venous fistula .  they re rare and not easy to find .       and what  .  .         direct connection between a small artery and a small vein .  the blood seeps over from the artery to the vein and  .  .        didn t they know it was there .       obviously not .  and carter  .  .  .       what .       it may have been a pretty violent affair on their scale .  they may not have survived .      carter turned to the bank of television screens .  he punched the appropriate button .   any new messages from the proteus .       no  sir   came the quick answer .      well  get in touch with them  man .  get something out of them .  and put it through to me directly .   there was an agonizing wait while carter held his chest motionless for the space of three or four ordinary breaths .     the word came through .   proteus reporting  sir .       thank god for so much   muttered carter .   state the message .       they ve passed through an arterio venous fistula  sir .  they cannot return and they cannot go ahead .  they ask leave to be brought out  sir .      carter brought both fists down upon the desk .   no .  by thunder  no .      reid said   but general  they re right .      carter looked up at the time recorder .  it stood at    .  he said  through trembling lips .   they have fifty one minutes and they ll stay there fifty one minutes .  when that thing there reads zero  we take them out .  not a minute before  unless the mission is accomplished .       but it s hopeless  darn it .  god knows how weakened their ship is .  we ll be killing five men .       maybe .  that s the chance they take and that s the chance we take .  but it will be firmly recorded that we never gave up as long as the smallest mathematical chance of success remained .      reid s eyes were cold and his very mustache bristled .   general  you re thinking of your record .  if they die  sir  i ll testify that you kept them in past reasonable hope .       i ll take that chance  too   said carter .   now you tell me you re in charge of the medical division why can t they move .       they can t go back through the fistula against the current .  that s physically impossible no matter how many orders you give .  the gradation of blood pressure is not under army control .       why can t they find another route .       all routes from their present position to the clot lead through the heart .  the turbulence of the heart passage would smash them to kindling in an instant and we can t take that chance .       we .  .  .      we can t  carter .  not because of the lives of the men  though that s reason enough .  if the ship is smashed  we ll never get all of it out and eventually its fragments will deminiaturize and kill benes .  if we get the men out now we can try operating on benes from outside .       that s hopeless .       not as hopeless as our present situation .      for a moment  carter considered .  he said  quietly   colonel reid  tell me without killing benes  how long can we stop his heart .      reid stared .   not for long .       i know that .  i m asking you for a specific figure .       well  in his comatose state  and under hypothermic chilling  but allowing for the shaky condition of his brain  i would say no more than sixty seconds .  on the outside .      carter said   the proteus can plow through the heart in less than sixty seconds  can t it .       i don t know .       they ll have to try  then .  when we ve eliminated the impossible  whatever remains  however risky  however slim a hope  is what we re going to try .   what are the problems involved in stopping the heart .       none .  it can be done with a bare bodkin  to quote hamlet .  the trick will be to start it again .       that  my dear colonel  is going to be your problem and your responsibility .   he looked at the time recorder  which read    .   we re wasting time .  let s get on with it .  get your heart men into action and i ll have the men on the proteus instructed .        the lights were on within the proteus .  michaels  duval and cora  looking disheveled  clustered about grant .     grant said   and that s it .  they re stopping benes  heart by electric shock at the moment of our approach and they ll start it again when we emerge .       start it again .   exploded michaels .   are they mad .  benes can t take that in his condition .       i suspect   said grant   they consider it the only chance the mission has of succeeding .       if that s the only chance  then we ve failed .      duval said   i ve had experience with open heart surgery  michaels .  it may be possible .  the heart is tougher than we think .   owens  how long will it take us to pass through the heart .      owens looked down from the bubble .   i ve been figuring out just that  duval .  if we have no delays  we can do it ill from fifty five to fifty seven seconds .      duval shrugged .   we d have three seconds to spare .      grant said   then we d better get on with it .      owens said   we re drifting with the current toward the heart right now .  i ll shift the engines into high .  i need to test them  anyway .  they took a bad beating .      a muted throb rose somewhat in pitch and the sensation of forward motion overlay the dull  erratic trembling of brownian motion .      lights out   said owens   and we d better relax while i baby this thing along .      and with lights out  all drifted to the window again even michaels .     the world about them had changed completely .  it was still blood .  it still contained all the bits and pieces  all the fragments and molecular aggregates  the platelets and red blood corpuscles  but the difference the difference .   .   .     this was the superior vena cava now  the chief vein coming from the head and neck  its oxygen supply consumed and gone .  the red blood corpuscles were drained of oxygen and now contained hemoglobin itself  not oxyhemoglobin  that bright red combination of hemoglobin and oxygen .     hemoglobin itself was a bluish purple  and in the erratic reflection of the miniaturized light waves from the ship  each corpuscle glittered in flashes of blue and green with a frequently interspersed purple .  all else took on the tinge of these unoxygenated corpuscles .     the platelets slid by in shadow and twice the ship passed  at a most grateful distance the ponderous heavings of a white blood cell  colored now in greenish tinged cream .     grant looked at cora s profile once more  lifted  as it was  with almost worshipful reverence  and itself looking infinitely mysterious in shadowy blue .  she was the ice queen of some polar region lit by a blue green aurora  grant thought quixotically  and suddenly found himself empty and yearning .     duval murmured   glorious .    but it was not at cora that he was looking .     michaels said   are you ready  owens .  i m going to guide you through the heart .      he moved to his charts and put on a small overhead light that instantly dimmed the murky blue that had just filled the proteus with mystery .      owens   he called .   heart chart a   .  approach .  right atrium .  you have it .       yes  i have .      grant said   are we at the heart already .       listen for yourself   said michaels  testily .  don t look .  listen .      an unbreathing silence fell upon those within the proteus .     they could hear it like the distant boom of artillery .  it was only a rhythmic vibration of the floor of the ship  slow and measured  but growing louder .  a dull thud  followed by a duller  a pause  then a repetition  louder  always louder .      the heart .   said cora .   it is .       that s right   said michaels   slowed a great deal .       and we don t hear it accurately   said duval  with dissatisfaction .  the sound waves are too immense in themselves to affect our ear .  they set up secondary vibrations in the ship but that s not the same thing .  in a proper exploration of the body  .  .  .       at some future time  doctor   said michaels .   it sounds like cannon   said grant .      yes  but it lays down quite a barrage  two billion heartbeats in threescore years and ten   said michaels .   more .       and every beat   added duval   is the thin barrier separating us from eternity  each giving us time to make our peace with  .  .  .       these particular beats   said michaels   will send us straight to eternity and give us no time at all .  shut up  all of you .  are you ready  owens .       i am .  at least i m at the controls and i ve got the chart before me .  but how do i find my way through this .       we can t get lost  even if we try .  we re in the superior vena cava now  at the point of junction with the inferior .  got it .       yes     all right .  in seconds  we ll be entering the right atrium  the first chamber of the heart and they had better stop the heart  too .  grant  radio our position .      grant was momentarily lost to all else in his fascination with the view ahead .  the vena cava was the largest vein in the body  receiving in the final stretch of its tube all the blood from all the body but the lungs .  and as it gave way to the atrium  it became a vast resounding chamber  the walls of which were lost to sight so that the proteus seemed to ho within a dark  measureless ocean .  the heart was a slow  terrifying pound now  and at each steady thud  the ship seemed to lift and tremble .     at michaels  second call  grant snapped back to life and turned to his radio transmitter .     owens called out   tricuspid valve ahead .      the others looked ahead .  at the end of a long  long corridor  they could see it in the far distance .  three sparkling red  sheets  separating and billowing open as they moved away from the ship .  an aperture yawned and grew larger while the cusps of the valve fluttered each to its respective side .  .  there beyond it was the right ventricle  one of the two main chambers .     the  blood stream moved into the cavity as though being pulled by a powerful suction .  the proteus moved with it so that the aperture approached and enlarged at a tremendous rate .  the current was smooth  however  and the ship rode it with scarcely a tremor .     then came the sound of the thunderous boom of the ventricles  the main  muscular chambers of the heart  as they contracted in systole .  the leaves of the tricuspid valve ballooned back toward the ship  moving slowly shut  with a wet  smacking contact that closed the wall ahead into a long vertical furrow that parted into two above .     it was the right ventricle that lay on the other side of the now closed valve .  as that ventricle contracted  the blood could not regurgitate through the atrium and was forced instead into and through the pulmonary artery .     grant called out above the reverberating boom .   one more heartbeat and that will be the last  they say .      michaels said   it had better be  or it   s our last heartbeat  too .  shove on through  full speed  owens  the instant the valve opens again .      there was firm determination in his face now  grant noted absently no fear at all .       the radioactive sensors that had hovered about benes  head and neck were now clustered over his chest  over a region from which the thermal blanket had been folded hack     the charts of the circulating system on the wall had expanded now in the region of the heart and showed only part of the heart the right atrium .  the blip that marked the position of the proteus had moved smoothly down the  vena cava into the lightly muscled atrium which had expanded as they entered  then contracted .     the ship had  in one bound  been pushed nearly the length of the atrium toward the tricuspid valve  which closed just as they were at its brink .  on an oscilloscopic scanner  each heartbeat was being translated into a wavering electronic beam and it was watched narrowly .     the electro shock apparatus was in position  and the electrodes hovered over benes  breast .     the final heartbeat began .  the electron beam on the oscilloscope began moving upward .  the left ventricle was relaxing for another intake of blood and as it relaxed the tricuspid valve would open .      now   cried the technician at the heart indicator .     the two electrodes came down upon the chest  a needle on one of the dials of the heart console swung instantly into the red and a buzzer sounded urgently .  it was flipped into silence .  the oscilloscope record flattened out .     the message went up to the control tower in all its final simplicity   heartbeat stopped .      carter grimly clicked the stop watch in his hands and the seconds began ticking off with unbearable speed .       five pairs of eyes looked forward at the tricuspid valve .  owens  hand was set for acceleration .  the ventricle was relaxing and the semi lunar valve at the end of the pulmonary artery  somewhere in there  must be creaking shut .  no blood could return to the ventricle from the artery  the valve made sure of that .  the sound of its closing filled the air with an unbearable vibration .     and as the ventricle continued to relax  blood had to enter from another direction from the right atrium .  the tricuspid valve  facing in the other direction  began to flutter open .     the mighty puckered crack ahead began to broaden  to make a corridor  a larger corridor  a vast opening .      now   shouted michaels .   now .  now .      his words were lost in the heartbeat and in the rise of the engines .  the proteus shot forward  through the opening and into the ventricle .  in a few seconds  that ventricle would contract and in the furious turbulence that would follow the ship would be crushed like a match box and they would all he dead and three quarters of an hour later benes would be dead .     grant held his breath .  the diastolic beat rumbled into silence and now nothing .     a deadly silence had fallen .     duval cried   let me see .      he was up the ladder and his head emerged into the bubble  the one spot within the ship from which a clear  unobstructed view to the rear was possible .      the heart has stopped   he cried .   come and see .      cora took his place  and then grant .     the tricuspid valve hung half open and limp .  on its inner surface were the tremendous connective fibers that bound it to the inner surface of the ventricle  fibers that pulled the valve leaves back when the ventricle relaxed  and that held them firmly in position  when the contraction of the ventricle forced them together  preventing those leaves from pushing through altogether and making a reversed opening .      the architecture is marvelous   said duval .   it would be magnificent to see that valve close from this angle  held by living struts designed to do their work with a combination of delicacy and strength that man himself  for all his science  cannot yet duplicate .       if you were to see that sight now  doctor  it would be your last   said michaels .   top speed  owens  and bear to the left  for the semi lunar valve .  we have thirty seconds to get out of this death trap .      if it were a death trap  and undoubtedly it was  it was a somberly beautiful one .  the walls were strutted with mighty fibers  dividing into roots that were firmly fixed to the distant walls .  it was as though they saw in the distance a gigantic forest of gnarled leaf less trees writhing and riven into a complex design that strengthened and held firm the most vital muscle of the human body .     that muscle  the heart  was a double pump that had to beat from well before birth to the final moment before death and do so with unbroken rhythm  unwearying strength  under all conditions .  it was the greatest heart in the animal kingdom .  the heart of no other mammal beat more than a billion times or so before even the most delayed approach of death  but after a billion heartbeats the human being was merely in early middle age  in the prime of his strength and power .  men and women had lived long enough to experience well over three billion heartbeats .     owens  voice broke in .   only nineteen seconds to go  dr .  michaels .  i see no sign of the valve yet .       keep on  darn it .  you re headed there .  and it had better be open .      grant said tensely   there it is .  isn t that it .  that dark spot .      michaels looked up from his chart to cast it the most cursory glance .   yes  it is .  and its partly open  too  enough for us .  the systolic heartbeat was at the point of starting when the heart was shut down .  now  everyone  strap yourselves in tightly .  we re slamming through that opening  but the heartbeat will be right behind us and when it comes  .  .  .       if it comes   said owens softly .      when it comes   repeated michaels   there ll be a terrific surge of blood .  we ll have to stay as far ahead of it as possible .      with determined desperation  owens flashed the ship ahead for the tiny opening that marked the center of  the crescent crack   semi lunar  for that reason  that marked the closed valve .       the operating room labored under a tense silence .  the surgical team  hovering over benes  were as motionless as he .  benes  cold body and stopped heart brought the aura of death close above all in that room .  only the restlessly quivering sensors remained as signs of life .     in the control room  reid said   they re obviously safe so far .  they re through the tricuspid and are following a curved path aiming at the semi lunar valve .  that s deliberate  powered motion .      yes   said carter  watching his stop watch in tense agony .   twenty four seconds left .       they re almost there now .       fifteen seconds left   said carter inexorably .     the heart technicians at the electro shock apparatus moved stealthily into position .      aiming straight into the semi lunar valve .    six seconds left .  five .  four  .   .   .       they re going through .   and as he spoke  a warning buzzer  ominous as death  sounded .      revive heartbeat   came the word over one of the speakers  and a red button was pressed .  a pace maker went into action  and a rhythmic surge of potential made its appearance on an appropriate screen in the form of a pulsing swing of light .     the oscilloscope registering heartbeat remained dead .  the pace maker pulse was increased  while eyes watched tensely .        it s got to start   said carter  whose whole body tensed and pushed forward in muscular sympathy .       the proteus entered the aperture  which looked like a pair of barely open lips curved in a gigantically pendulous smile .  it scraped against the tough membrane above and below  hung back a moment as the engine roar raised its pitch in a temporarily vain attempt to free the ship of the sticky embrace then lunged through .      we re out of the ventricle   said michaels  rubbing him forehead and then looking at his hand which had come away wet   and into the pulmonary artery .   continue at full speed  owens .  the heartbeat should start in three seconds .      owens looked back .  he alone could do so  the others being strapped helplessly in their seat with forward vision only .     the semi lunar valve was receding  still closed  with its fibers straining their points of attachments into suckers of tense tissue .  with distance  the valve grew smaller  and was still closed .     owens said   the heartbeat .  isn t coming .  it isn t  .   .   .  wait  wait .  there it is .   the two leaves of the valve were relaxing  the fibrous supports were falling back and their tense roots puckered and became flabby .     the aperture was gaping  the rush of blood was coming  and overtaking them was the gigantic  bar room m m  of the systole .     the tidal wave of blood caught up with the proteux  hurtling it forward at break neck velocity .       chapter      capillary      the first heartbeat broke the spell in the control tower .  carter raised both hands in the air and shook them in mute invocation of the gods .   made it  by thunder .  brought them through .      reid nodded .   you won that time  general .  i wouldn t have had the nerve to order them through the heart .      the whites of carter s eyes were bloodshot .   i didn t have the nerve not to order it .  now if they can hold up against the arterial flow  .   .   .   his voice rang out into the transmitter .   get into touch with the proteus the moment their speed diminishes .      reid said   they re back in the arterial system  but they re not heading for the brain  you know .  the original injection was into the systemic circulation  into one of the main arteries leading from the left ventricle to the brain .  the pulmonary artery leads from the right ventricle to the lungs .       it means delay .  i know that   said carter .   but we still have time .   he indicated the time recorder  which read    .      all right  but we d better switch the point of maximum concentration to the respiration center .      he made the appropriate change and the interior of the respiration post was visible on the monitor screen .  reid said   what s the respiration rate .       back to six per minute  colonel .  i didn t think we were going to make it there for a second .       neither did we .  hold it steady .  you re going to have to worry about the ship .  it will be in your sector in no time .       message from the proteus   came another voice .   all well .  uh  sir .  there s more  do you want it read .      carter scowled .   of course  i want it read .       yes  sir .  it says  wish you were here and i were there .      carter said   well  you tell grant that i would rather a hundred times he  .  .  .  no  don t tell him anything .  forget it .        the end of the heartbeat had brought the surge forward to a manageable velocity  and the proteus was moving along smoothly again  smoothly enough to make it possible to feel the soft  erratic brownian motion .     grant welcomed that sensation  for it could be felt only in the quiet moments and it was those quiet moments that he craved .     they were all out of their harnesses again  and grant  at the window  found the view essentially the same as in the jugular vein .  the same blue green violet corpuscles dominated the scene .  the distant walls were more corrugated  perhaps  with the lines lying in the direction of motion .     they passed an opening .      not that one   said michaels at the console  where he labored painfully over his charts .   can you follow my markings up there  owens .       yes  doc .       all right .  count the turnings as i mark them and then to the right here .  is that plain .      grant watched the subdivisions coming at briefer and briefer intervals  dividing off right and left  above and below  while the channel along which they cruised became narrower  the walls more plainly seen and closer at hand .      i d hate to get lost in this highway pattern   said grant  thoughtfully .      you can t get lost   said duval .   all roads lead to the lungs in this part of the body .      michaels  voice was growing monotonous .   up and right now  owens .  straight ahead and then  uh  fourth left .      grant said   no more arterio venous fistulas  i hope  michaels .      michaels shrugged him off impatiently  too absorbed to say anything .     duval said   not likely .  to come across two by accident is asking too much of chance .  besides we re approaching the capillaries .      the velocity of the blood stream had fallen off tremendously and so had that of the proteus .     owens said   the blood vessel is narrowing  dr .  michaels .       it s supposed to .  the capillaries are the finest vessels of all  quite microscopic in size .  keep going  owens .      in the light of the headbeam it could be seen that the walls  as they constricted inward  had lost their furrows and creases and were becoming smooth .  their yellowness faded into cream and then into colorlessness .     they were taking on an unmistakable mosaic pattern  broken into curving polygons  each with a slightly thickened area near the center .     cora said   how pretty .  you can see the individual cells of the capillary wall .  look  grant .   then  as though remembering   how s your side .       it s all right .  fine  in fact .  you put on a very efficient band aid  cora .   we re still friendly enough for the use of cora as your name  i hope .       i suppose it would be rather ungrateful of me to object to that .       and useless  too .       how s your arm .      grant touched it gingerly   hurts like the devil .       i m sorry .       don t be sorry .  just when the time comes be very  very grateful .      cora s lips tightened a bit and grant added hurriedly   just my poor way of being light hearted .  how do you feel .       quite myself .  my side feels a little stiff  but not bad .  and i m not offended .   but listen  grant .       when you talk  cora  i listen .       band aids aren t the latest medical advance  you know  and they re not the universal panacea .  have you done anything about warding off infection .       i put on some iodine .       well  will you see a doctor when we get out .       duval .       you know what i mean .      grant said   all right .  i will .      he turned back to the sight of the cell mosaic .  the proteus was creeping now  inching through the capillary .  in the light of its headbeams  dim shapes could be seen through the cells .     grant said   the wall seems to be translucent .       not surprising   said duval .   those walls are less than one ten thousandth of an inch thick .  they re quite porous  too .  life depends on material getting through those walls and through the equally thin walls that line the alveoli .       the which .      for a moment  he looked at duval in vain .  the surgeon seemed more interested in what he was looking at than in grant s question .  cora hastened to fill the gap .     she said   air enters the lungs through the trachea  you know the windpipe .  that divides  just as the blood vessels do  into smaller and smaller tubes until they finally reach the microscopic little chambers deep in the lung  where the air that enters finds itself separated from the interior of the body only by a narrow membrane  a membrane as narrow as that of the capillaries .  those chambers are the alveoli .  there are about six hundred million of them in the lungs .       complicated mechanism .       a magnificent one .  oxygen leaks across the alveolar membrane and across the capillary membrane  too .  it finds itself in the blood stream and before it can leak back  the red blood corpuscles have picked it up .  meanwhile carbon dioxide wastes leak out in the other direction from blood to lungs .  dr .  duval is waiting to watch that happen .  that s why he didn t answer .       no excuses are necessary .  i know what it is to be absorbed in one thing to the exclusion of another .   he grinned broadly .   i m afraid  though  that dr .  duval s absorptions are not mine .      cora looked uncomfortable but a cry from owens blocked off her answer .      straight ahead .   he called .   watch what s coming .      all eyes turned ahead .  a blue green corpuscle was bumping along ahead of them  scraping its edges slowly against the walls of the capillary on either side .  a wave of faint straw made its appearance at the edges and then swept inward  until all the darker color was gone .     other blue green corpuscles making their way past them turned color likewise .  the headlights were picking up only straw color ahead and the color deepened into orange red in the distance .      you see   said cora  excitedly   as they pick up the oxygen  the hemoglobin turns into oxyhemoglobin and the blood brightens to red .  that will be taken back to the left ventricle of the heart now and the rich  oxygenated blood will be pumped all over the body .       you mean we have to go back through the heart again   said grant  in instant concern .      oh  no   said cora .   now that we re in the capillary system  we ll be able to cut across .   she didn t sound very certain of it  however .     duval said   look at the wonder of it .  look at the god given wonder of it .      michaels said  stiffly   it s just a gas exchange .  a mechanical process worked out by the random forces of evolution over a period of two billion years .      duval turned fiercely   are you maintaining that this is accidental  that this marvelous mechanism  geared to perfection at a thousand points and all interlocking with clever certainty  is produced by nothing more than just the here and there collision of atoms .       that s exactly what i want to tell you .  yes .   said michaels .     at which point both  facing each other in belligerent exasperation  looked up with a snap at the sudden raucous sound of a buzzer .     owens said   what the devil  .  .       he flicked at a switch desperately but a needle on one of his gauges was dropping rapidly toward a red horizontal line .  he shut off the buzzer and called out   grant .       what is it .       something s wrong .  check the manual right over there .   grant followed the pointing finger  moving quickly  while cora crowded behind .     grant said   there s a needle in the red danger zone under something marked tank left .  obviously  the left tank s losing pressure .      owens groaned and looked behind .   and how .  we re bubbling air into the blood stream .  grant  get up here quickly .   he was shucking his harness .     grant scrambled toward the ladder  making room as best he might for owens to squeeze past on the way down .     cora managed to make out the bubbles through the small rear window .  she said   air bubbles in the blood stream can be fatal  .  .  .       not this kind   said duval  hastily .   on our miniaturized scale we produce bubbles that are too tiny to do harm .  and when they de miniaturize they will have become too well distributed to do harm then either .       never mind the danger to benes   said michaels grimly .    we need the air .      owen called back to grant  who was seating himself at the controls .   just leave everything as it is for now  but watch for any red signal flashes anywhere on the board .      he said to michaels as he passed him .   there must be frozen valve .  i can t think of anything else .   i le moved back and opened a panel with a quick wrench i one end  using a small tool he had removed from the ticket of his uniform .  the maze of wires and circuit breakers was revealed in frightening complexity .     owens  skilled fingers probed through them quickly  testing and eliminating with an ease and certainty that could have marked the ship s designer .  he tripped a switch  checked it quickly and let it snap shut  then moved forward to look over the auxiliary controls underneath the windows in the bow of the ship .      there must have been some damage outside when we scraped into the pulmonary artery  or when the arterial blood surge hit us .       is the valve usable .   asked michaels .      yes .  it was jarred a little out of alignment  i think  and then something forced it open just now  maybe just one of the pushes of brownian movement  it stayed that way .  i ve realigned it now and it will give no further trouble  only       only what   said grant .      i m afraid this has torn it .  we don t have enough air to complete the journey .  if this were an orthodox submarine  i d say we would have to surface to renew the air supply .       but then what do we do now .   asked cora .      surface .  it s all we can do .  we ve got to ask to be taken out right now or the ship becomes unmaneuverable in ten minutes and we strangle in five more .      he moved to the ladder .   i ll take over  grant .  you get to the transmitter and give them the news .      grant said   wait .  do we have any reserve air .       that was it .  all of it .  all gone .  in fact  when that air de miniaturizes  it will be much larger in volume than benes  .  it will kill him .       no  it won t   said michaels .   the miniaturized molecules of the air we ve lost will pass right through the tissues and out into the open .  very little will be left in the body by de miniaturization time .  still  i m afraid owens is right .  we can t go on .       but wait   said grant .   why can t we surface .       i ve just said  .   .   .   began owens  impatiently .      i don t mean be taken out of here .  i mean  real surface .  there .  right there .  we have blood corpuscles piling up oxygen in front of our eyes .  can t we do the same .  there are only two thin membranes between ourselves and an ocean of air .  let s get it .      cora said   grant s right .       no  he isn t   said owens .   what do you think we are .  we re miniaturized  with lungs the size of a bacterial fragment .  the air on the other side of those membranes is unminiaturized .  each oxygen molecule in that air is almost large enough to see  damn it .  do you think we can just take them into our lungs .      grant looked non plussed .   but  .  .  .       we can t wait  grant .  you ll have to get in touch with the control room .      grant said   not yet .  didn t you say this ship was originally meant for deep sea research .  what was it supposed to do underwater .       we were hoping to miniaturize underwater specimens for carriage to the surface and investigation at leisure .       well  then  you must have miniaturization equipment on board .  you didn t pull it out last night  did you .       of course we have it .  but only on a small scale .       how large scale do we need it .  if we lead air into the miniaturizer  we can reduce the size of the molecules an lead them into our air tanks .       we don t have the time for that   put in michaels .      if time runs out  then we ll ask to be taken out .  until  then  let s try .  you ve got a snorkel on board i suppose  owens .       yes .   owens seemed completely confused at grant s rapid and urgent sentences .      and we can run such a snorkel through the capillary and lung walls without harming benes  can t we .       at our size  i should certainly think so   said duval .      all right then  we run the snorkel from lung to ship s miniaturizer and lead a tube from miniaturizer to the air reserve chamber .  can you improvise that .      owens considered for a moment  seemed to catch fire at the prospect and said   yes  i think so .       all right then  when benes inhales there ll be pressure enough to fill our tanks for us .  remember that time distortion will make our few minutes grace seem longer than it is on the unminiaturized scale .  anyway  we ve got to try .      duval said   i agree .  we must try .  by all means .  now .      grant said   thanks for the support  doctor .      duval nodded  then said   what s more  if we re going to try this  let s not try to make a one man job out of it .  owens had better stay at the controls  but i will come out with grant .       ah   said michaels .   i was wondering what you were after .  i see now .  you want a chance at exploration in the open .      duval flushed  but grant broke in hastily   whatever the motive  the suggestion is good .  in fact  we had better all come out .  except owens  of course .   the snorkel is aft  i suppose .       in the supply and storage compartment   said owens .  he was back at the controls now  staring straight ahead .   if you ve ever seen a snorkel  you won t mistake it .      grant moved hastily into the compartment  saw the snorkel at once and reached for the packaged underwater gear .     then he stopped in horror and shouted   cora .      she was behind him in a moment .   what s the matter .      grant tried not to explode .  it was the first time he looked at the girl without an appreciative inner comment at her beauty .  for the moment  he was merely agonized .  he pointed and said   look at that .      she looked and turned a white face toward him   i don t understand .      the laser over the working counter was swinging loose on one hook  its plastic cover off .      didn t you bother securing it .   demanded grant .     cora nodded wildly   i did .  i did secure it .  i swear it .       then how could it           i don t know .  how can i answer that .      duval was behind her  his eyes narrowed and his face flushed .  he said   what has happened to the laser  miss peterson .      cora turned to meet the new questioner .   i don t know .  why do you all turn on me .  i ll test it right now .  i ll check          no .   roared grant .   just put it down and make sure it won t knock around any further .  we ve got to get our oxygen before we do anything else .      he began handing out the suits .     owens had come down from the bubble .  he said   the ship s controls are locked in place .  we won t be going anywhere here in the capillary anyway .  my god  the laser .       don t you start   screamed cora  eyes now swimming in tears .     michaels said  clumsily   now  cora  it won t help if you break down .  later  we ll consider this carefully .   it must have been knocked loose in the whirlpool .  clearly an accident .      grant said   captain owens  connect this end of the snorkel to the miniaturizer .  the rest of us will get into our suits and i hope someone shows me quickly how to get into mine .  i ve never tried this .        reid said   there s no mistake .  they re not moving .       no  sir   came the technician s voice .   they re on the outer limits of the right lung and they re staying there .      reid turned to carter .   i can t explain it .      carter stopped his angry pacing for a moment and jerked a thumb at the time recorder  which was reading    .  we ve killed over a quarter of all the time available and we re farther from that damn clot than when we started .  we should have been out by now .       apparently   said reid  coldly   we are laboring under a curse .       and i don t feel whimsical about it  either  colonel .       nor do i .  but what am i supposed to feel in order to satisfy you .       at least  let s find out what s holding them up .   he closed the appropriate circuit and said   contact the proteus .      reid said   i suppose it s some sort of mechanical difficulty .       you suppose .   said carter  with urgent sarcasm .   i don t suppose they ve just stopped for a quiet swim .        chapter      lung      the four of them  .  michaels  duval  cora    and grant  were in  their swim suits now   form fitting  comfortable  and an antiseptic white .  each had oxygen cylinders strapped to he back  a flashlight on the foreheads  fins on the feet and a radio transmitter and receiver at mouth and ear respectively .      it s a form of skin diving   said michaels  adjusting the head gear   and i ve never gone skin diving .  to have the first try at it in someone s blood stream  .   .   .      the ship s wireless tapped urgently .     michaels said   hadn t you better answer that .       and get into a conversation .   said grant  impatiently .   there ll be time for talk when we re done .  here  help me .      cora guided the plastic shielded helmet over grant s head and snapped it into place .     grant s voice  transmuted at once into the faintly distorted version that comes over a small radio  sounded in her ear   thanks  cora .      she nodded at him dolefully .     two by two they used the escape hatch and precious air had to be consumed by forcing blood plasma out of the hatch each time .     grant found himself paddling in a fluid that was not even as clear as the water one would find on the average polluted beach .  it was full of floating debris  flecks and bits of matter .  the proteus filled half the diameter of the capillary and past it red blood corpuscles nudged their way along with the periodic easier passage of the smaller platelets .     grant said uneasily   if platelets break against the proteus  we may form a clot .       we may   said duval   but it won t be dangerous here  not in a capillary .      they could see owens within the ship .  he lifted his head and revealed an anxious face .  he nodded and moved his hand without enthusiasm  trying to dodge and turn so as to be visible between and among the endlessly passing corpuscles .  he put on the head gear of his own swim suit and spoke into its transmitter .     he said   i think i ve got it arranged here .  anyway  i ve done my best .  are you ready to have me release the snorkel .       go ahead   said grant .     it came out of the special release hatch like a cobra coming out of a fakir s basket at the sound of the pipes .  grant seized it .     michaels said   oh  heck   in a sort of whisper .  then  more loudly  and in a tone that seemed saturated with chagrin  he said   consider how narrow the bore of that snorkel is  all of you .  it looks as big around as a man s arm  but how big is a man s arm on our scale .       what of it .   said grant  shortly .  he had a firm grip on the snorkel now and he put his back into moving with it toward the capillary wall  disregarding the soreness of his left biceps .   grab hold  will you  and help pull .      michaels said   there s no point to it .  don t you understand .  it should have occurred to me sooner  but the air won t go through that thing .       what .       not quickly enough .  unminiaturized air molecules are quite big compared to the opening in that snorkel .  do you expect air to leak through a tiny tube barely large enough to see through a microscope .       the air will be under lung pressure .       so what .  ever hear of a slow leak in an automobile tire .  the hole through which air leaks in such a tire is  probably no smaller than that and is under considerably more pressure than the lung can generate  and it s a slow leak .   michaels grimaced lugubriously .   i wish i had thought of this sooner .      grant roared   owens .       i hear you .  don t crack every ear drum in existence .       never mind hearing me .  did you hear michaels .       yes  i have .       is he right .  you re the nearest thing to a miniaturization expert we have .  is he right .       well  yes and no   said owens .      and what does that mean .       it means  yes  the air will go through the snorkel only very slowly unless it is miniaturized and  no  we need not worry if i can succeed in miniaturizing it .  i can extend the field through the snorkel and miniaturize the air on the other side and suck that through by  .  .  .       won t such a field extension affect us .   put in michaels .      no  i ll have it set for a fixed maximum of miniaturization and we re there already .       how about the surrounding blood and lung tissue .   asked duval .      there s a limit to how sharply selective i can make the field   admitted owens .   this is only a small miniaturizer i have here but i can confine it to gas .  there s bound to be some damage  however .  i just hope it won t be too much .       we ll have to chance it  that s all   said grant .   let s get on with it .  we can t take forever .      with four pairs of arms encircling the snorkel and four pairs of legs pumping away  it reached the capillary wall .     for a moment  grant hesitated .   we re going to have to cut through .   duval .      duval s lips curved in a small smile .   there s no need to call on the surgeon .  at this microscopic level  you would do as well .  there is no skill needed .      he drew a knife from a small scabbard at his waist  and looked at it .   it undoubtedly has miniaturized bacteria on it .  eventually  they will de miniaturize in the blood stream but the white cells will take care of them  then .  nothing pathogenic in any case  i hope .       please get on with it  doctor   said grant  urgently .     duval slashed quickly with his knife between two of the cells that made up the capillary .  a neat slit opened .  the thickness of the wall might be a ten thousandth of an inch in the world generally  but on their own miniaturized scale the thickness amounted to several yards .  duval stepped into the slit and forced his way through  breaking stands of inter cellular cement and cutting further .  the wall was perforated at last and the cells drew apart  like the lips of a gaping wound .     through the wound could be seen another set of cells  at which duval slashed neatly and with precision .     he returned and said   it s a microscopic opening .  there ll be no loss of blood to speak of .       no loss at all   said michaels emphatically .   the leakage is the other way .      and  indeed  a bubble of air seemed to bulge inward at the opening .  it bulged further and then stopped .  michaels put his hand to the bubble .  a portion of its surface pushed inward  but the hand did not go through     surface tension .   he said .      what now .   demanded grant .      surface tension  i tell you .  at any liquid surface there is a kind of skin effect .  to something as large as a human being  an unminiaturized human being  the effect is too small to be noticed  but insects can walk on water surfaces because of it .  in our miniaturized state  the effect is even stronger .  we may not be able to get beyond the barrier .      michaels drew his knife and plunged it into the fluid gas interface as  a moment before  duval had operated on the cells .  the knife forced the interface forward into a point  then broke through .      it s like cutting thin rubber   said michaels  panting a bit .  he sliced downward and an opening appeared briefly but closed almost at once  healing itself .     grant tried the same thing  forcing his hand through the opening before it closed .  he winced a bit as the water molecules closed in .      it s got a grip on it  you know .      duval said somberly   if you calculated the size of those water molecules on our scale you d be astonished .  you could make them out with a hand lens .  in fact  .   .   .      michaels said   in fact  you re sorry you didn t bring a hand lens .  i ve got news for you  duval  you wouldn t see much .  you would magnify the wave properties as well as the particle properties of atoms and subatomic particles .  anything you see  even by the reflection of miniaturized light  would be too hazy to do you much good .      cora said   is that why nothing really looks sharp .  i thought it was just because we were seeing things through blood plasma .       the plasma is a factor  certainly .  but in addition  the general graininess of the universe becomes much larger as we become much smaller .  it s like looking really closely at an old fashioned newspaper photograph .  you see the dots more clearly and it becomes hazy .      grant was paying little attention to the conversation .  his arm was through the interface and with it he was tearing away to make room for his other arm and his head .     for a moment the fluid closed about his neck and he felt strangled .      hold my legs  will you .   he called .     duval said   i ve got them .      half his body was through now and he could look through the crevice duval had made through the walls .      all right .  pull me down again .   he came down and the interface closed behind him with a popping sound .     he said   now let s see what we can do about the snorkel .  heave ho .      it was quite useless .  the blunt end of the snorkel made not a dent on the tightly knit skin of water molecules on the air bubble .  knives cut that skin to shreds so that parts of the snorkel got through but the instant the interface was left  to itself  surface tension would reassert itself and the snorkel would pop out .     michaels was panting with effort .   i don t think we re going to make it .       we ve got to   said grant .   look  i m getting in  all the way in .  when you push the snorkel through  i ll grab whatever part makes it and pull .  between pushing and pulling  .  .  .       you can t go in there  grant   said duval .   you ll be sucked in and lost .      michaels said   we can use a lifeline .  right here  grant .   he indicated the neatly nested line at grant s left hip .   duval  take this back to the ship and attach it and we ll get grant through .      duval took the end handed him  rather uncertainly  and swam back toward the ship .     cora said   but how will you get back .  suppose you can t push through the surface tension again .       sure  i will .  besides  don t confuse the situation by taking up problem number   while problem number   is still with us .      owens  within the ship  watched tensely as duval swam up .   do you need another pair of hands out there   he asked .     duval said   i don t think so .  besides  your pair are needed at the miniaturizer .   he hitched the safety line to a small ring on the ship s metal skin and waved his arm .   ok  grant .      grant waved back .  his second penetration of the interface was more quickly done for he had the knack now .   first a slit  then one arm  ouch  the bruised bicep   then the other  then a strenuous push against the interface with his arms  and a kick with his finned legs and he popped out like watermelon seed from between finger and thumb .     he found himself between the two sticky walls of the intercellular slit .  he looked down at michaels  face  clearly visible but somewhat distorted through the curve of the interface .      push it through  michaels .     through the interface  he could make out a thrashing of limbs  the swing of an arm holding a knife .  and then the blunt metal end of the snorkel made a partial appearance .  grant knelt and seized it .  bracing his back against one side of the crevice and his feet against the other  he pulled .  the interface rose with it  clinging to it all about .  grant worked his way upward ahead of it  gasping out   push .  push .      it broke through  clear at last .  inside the tube of the snorkel was fluid  clinging motionlessly .     grant said   i m going to get it up through now  into the alveolus .      michaels said   when you get to the alveolus  be careful .  i don t know how you ll be affected by inhalation and exhalation but you re liable to find yourself in a hurricane .      grant was moving upward  yanking at the snorkel as he found purchases in the soft yielding tissue for gripping fingers and kicking feet .     his head rose beyond the alveolar wall and quite suddenly  he was in another world .  the light from the proteus penetrated through what seemed to him a vast thickness of tissue and in its muted intensity  the alveolus was a tremendous cavern  with walls that glinted moistly and distantly .     about him were crags and boulders of all sizes and colors  sparkling iridescently  as the inefficient reflection of miniaturized light gave them all a spuriously beautiful luster .  he could see now that the edges of the boulders remained hazy even without the presence of slowly swirling fluid to account for it .     grant said   this place is full of rocks .       dust and grit  i imagine   came michaels  voice .   dust and grit .  the legacy of living in civilization  of breathing unfiltered air .  the lungs are a one way passage  we can take dust in but there s no way of pushing it out again .      owens put in   do your best to hold the snorkel over your head  will you .  i don t want any fluid plugging it .   now .      grant heaved it high .   let me know when you ve had enough  owens   he panted .      i will      is it working .       it sure is .  i have the field adjusted strobophilically so that it acts in rapid spurts according to the  .   .   .  well  never mind .  the point is the field is never on long enough to affect liquids or solids significantly but it is miniaturizing gases at a great rate .  i ve got the field extended far beyond benes into the atmosphere of the operating room .       is that safe .   asked grant .      it s the only way we can get enough air .  we have to have thousands of times as much air as all of benes  lungs contain  and miniaturize it all .  is it safe .  good lord  man  i m sucking it in right through benes  tissues without even affecting his respiration .  oh  if i only had a larger snorkel .   owens sounded as gay and excited as a youngster on his first date .     michaels  voice in grant s ear said   how are you being affected by benes  breathing .      grant looked quickly at the alveolar membrane .  it seemed stretched and taut under his foot  so he guessed he was witnessing the slow  slow end of an inhalation .   slow in any case  slower because of the hypothermia  slower still because of the time distortion induced by miniaturization .       it s all right   he said .   no effect at all .      but now a low rasp made itself felt in grant s ear .  it grew slowly louder and grant realized an exhalation was beginning .  he braced himself and held on to the snorkel .     owens said jubilantly   this is working beautifully .  nothing like this has ever been done before .      the motion of air was making itself felt about grant  as the lungs continued their slow but accelerating collapse and the rasp of exhalation grew louder .  grant felt his legs lifting from the alveolar floor .  on an ordinary scale  he knew  the air current in the alveolus was indetectably gentle but on the miniaturized scale  it was gathering into a tornado .     grant gripped the snorkel in desperation  flinging both arms about it and both legs .  it strained upward and so did he .  the very boulders dust boulders came loose and rolled slightly .     the wind slowly died then as the exhalation came to its slow halt and grant released the snorkel with relief .  he said   how s it doing  owens .       almost done .  hang on for a few seconds  will you  grant .       okay .      he counted to himself  twenty thirty forty .  the inhalation was starting and air molecules were impinging upon him .  the alveolar wall was stretching again and he stumbled to his knees .      full .   cried owens .   get back in .       pull down on the snorkel   yelled grant .   quickly .  before another exhalation comes .      he pushed downward and they pulled .  difficulty arose only when the lip of the snorkel approached the interface .  it held tight there for a moment as though in a vice and then pulled through with a small thunderclap of joining surface film .     grant had watched too long .  with the snorkel safely in  he made a motion as though to plunge into the crevice and through the interface at its bottom  but the beginning of the exhalation surrounded him with wind and caused him to stumble .  for a moment  he found himself wedged between two dust boulders and in wrenching free found that he had slightly barked one shin .   hurting one s shin against a particle of dust was surely something to tell one s grandchildren .      where was he .  he shook his lifeline  freeing it from some snag on one of the boulders  and pulled it taut .  it would be easiest to follow it back to the crevice .     the lifeline snaked over the top of the boulder and grant  bracing his feet against it  climbed rapidly upward .  the strengthening exhalation helped him do so and there was scarcely any sensation of effort in the upward striving .  then still less .  the crevice  he knew  was just the other side of the boulder and he might have gone around it but for the fact that the exhalation made the route over it the simpler and because  why not admit it .   it was more exciting this way .     the boulder rolled beneath his feet  at the peak of the exhalation wind  and grant lifted free .  for the moment he found himself high in the air  the crevice just   beyond  exactly where he had expected it to be .  it was only necessary to wait a second or two for exhalation to cease and he would lunge quickly for the crevice  the blood stream  and the ship .     and even as he thought so  he felt himself sucked wildly upward  the lifeline following and snaking entirely free of the crevice which  in half a moment  was lost to sight .       the snorkel had been pulled out of the alveolar crevice and duval was snaking it back to the ship .     cora said anxiously   where s grant .       he s up there   said michaels  peering .      why doesn t he come down .       he will .  he will .  it takes some negotiating  i imagine .   he peered upward again .   benes is exhaling .  once that s done  he ll have no trouble .       shouldn t we grab hold of his lifeline and pull him in .      michaels threw out an arm and forestalled her .   if you do that and yank just as an inhalation starts  forcing him downward  you may hurt him .  he ll tell us what to do if he needs help .      restlessly  cora watched and then broke away toward the lifeline .   no   she said   i want to  .  .  .      and at that moment  the lifeline twitched and snaked upward  its end flashing past  and out through the opening .     cora screamed  and kicked herself desperately toward the opening .     michaels pursued .   you can t do anything   he panted .   don t be foolish .       but we can t leave him in there .  what will happen to him .       we ll hear from him by his radio .       it may be broken .       why should it be .      duval joined them .  he said  chokingly .   it came loose as i watched .  i couldn t believe it .      all three gazed upward helplessly .     michaels called  tentatively   grant .  grant .  do you receive me .        grant went tumbling and twisting upward .  his thoughts were as jumbled as his line of flight .  i won t get back  was the dominant thought .  i won t get back .  even if i stay in radio contact  i can t come in on the beam .     or could he .      michaels   he called .   duval .      there was nothing at first  then a faint crackling noise in his ears  and a distorted squawk that might have been  grant .      he tried again   michaels .  do you hear me .  do you hear me .      again the squawking .  he could not make out anything .     somewhere within a tense mind there came a calm thought  as though his intellect had found time to make a serene note .  although miniaturized light waves were more penetrating than the ordinary kind  miniaturized radio waves seemed less penetrating .     very little was known about the miniaturized state  apparently .  it was the misfortune of the proteus and her crew to be pioneers into a realm that was literally unknown  surely a fantastic voyage if ever there was one .     and within that voyage  grant was now on a fantastic subvoyage of his own  blown through what seemed miles of space within a microscopic air chamber in the lung of a dying man .     his motion was slowing .  he had reached the top of the alveolus and had moved into the tubular stalk from which it was suspended .  the far off light of the proteus was dim indeed .  could he follow the light  then .  could he try to move in whatever direction it seemed stronger .     he touched the wall of the tubular stalk and stuck there  like a fly on flypaper .  and with no more sense than the fly  at first  he wriggled .     both legs and an arm were stuck to the wall  in no time .  he paused and forced himself to think .  exhalation was complete but inhalation would be beginning .  the air current would be forcing him downward .  wait for it .     he felt the wind begin and heard the rushing noise .  slowly  he pulled his clinging arm loose and bent his body out into the wind .  it pushed him downward and his legs came loose  too .     he was falling now  plummeting downward from a height which  on his miniaturized scale  was mountainous .  from the unminiaturized point of view  he knew he must be drifting downward in feathery fashion  but as it was  what he experienced was a plummet .  it was a smooth drop  non accelerated  for the large molecules of air  almost large enough to see  michaels had said  had to be pushed to one side as he fell and that took the energy that would otherwise have gone into acceleration .     a bacterium  no larger than he  could fall this distance safely  but he  the miniaturized human  was made up of fifty trillion miniaturized cells and that complexity made him fragile enough  perhaps  to smash apart into miniaturized dust .     automatically  as he thought that  he threw up his hands in self defense when the alveolar wall came whirling close .  he felt the glancing contact  the wall gave soggily and he bounced off after clinging for a moment .  his speed of fall had actually slowed .     down again .  somewhere below  a speck of light  a bare pin point had winked on as he watched .  he kept his eye fixed on that with a wild hope .     still down .  he kicked his feet wildly to avoid an outcropping of dust boulders  narrowly missed and struck a spongy area again .  again falling .  he thrashed wildly in an attempt to move toward the pin point of light as he fell and it seemed to him he might have succeeded somewhat .  he wasn t sure .     he came rolling down the lower slope of the alveolar surface at length .  he flung his lifeline around an outcropping and held on just barely .     the pin point of light had become a small glare  some fifty feet away  he judged .  that must be the crevice and close though it was  he couldn t possibly have found it without the guidance of the light .     he waited for the inhalation to cease .  in the short interval of time before exhalation  he had to make it there .     before inhalation had come to a complete halt  he was slipping and scrambling across the space between .  the alveolar membrane stretched in the final moment of inhalation and then  hovering at that point for a couple of seconds  began to lose its tension as the first instants of gathering exhalation began .     grant threw himself down the crevice which was ablaze with light .  he kicked at the interface which rebounded in rubbery fashion .  a knife slit through  a hand appeared and seized his ankle in firm grip .  he felt the pull downward just as the upward draft was beginning to make itself felt about his ears .     down he went with other hands adding to the grip on his legs and he was back in the capillary .  grant breathed in long  shuddering gasps .  finally  he said   thanks .  i followed the light .  couldn t have made it otherwise .      michaels said   couldn t reach you by radio .      cora was smiling at him .   it was dr .  duval s idea .  he had the proteus move up to the opening and shine its headlight directly into it .  and he made the opening bigger  too .     michaels said   let s get back in the ship .  we ve lost just about all the time we can afford to lose .        chapter      pleura      reid cried out   a message is coming through  al .       from the proteus .   carter ran to the window .      well  not from your wife .      carter waved his hand impatiently .   later .  later .  save all the jokes and we ll go over them one by one in a big heap .  okay .      the word came through   sir  proteus reports dangerous air loss .  refueling operation carried through successfully .       refueling .   cried carter .     reid said  frowning   i suppose they mean the lungs .  they re at the lungs  after all  and that means cubic miles of air on their scale .  but  .  .  .       but what .       they can t use that air .  it s unminiaturized .      carter looked at the colonel in  exasperation .  he barked into the transmitter .   repeat the last sentence of the message .       refueling operation carried through successfully .       is that last word  successfully  .       yes  sir .       get in touch with them and confirm .      he said to reid   if they say  successfully   i suppose they handled it .      reid nodded his head .  he looked up at the time recorder  which read     and said   the pleural lining is a double membrane surrounding the lungs .  they must be moving in the space between  a  clear road  an expressway really  right to the neck .       and they ll be where they started half an hour ago   grated carter .   then what .       they can back into a capillary and find their way to the carotid artery again  which is time consuming  or they may by pass the arterial system by taking to the lymphatics  which involves other problems .   michaels is the pilot  i suppose he ll know what to do .       can you advise him .  for god s sake  don t rest on protocol .      reid shook his head .   i m not sure which course is wisest  and he s on the scene .  he ll be a better judge as to how well the ship can withstand another arterial battering .  we ve got to leave it to them  general .       i wish i knew what to do   said carter .   by the lord  i d take the responsibility  if i knew enough to do so with a reasonable chance of success .       but that s exactly how i feel   said reid   and why i m declining the responsibility .        michaels was looking over the charts   all right  owens  this wasn t the place i was heading for  but it will do .  we re here and we ve made an opening .  head for the crevice .       into the lungs .  said owens  in outrage .      no  no .   michaels bounded from his seat in impatience and climbed the stairs so that his head poked into the bubble .   we ll get into the pleural lining .  get the ship going and i ll guide you .      cora knelt at grant s chair .   how did you manage .      grant said   barely .  i ve been scared more times than i can count i m a very scary person but this time i nearly set a record for fright intensity .       why do you always make yourself out to be such a coward .  after all  your job  .  .  .        because i m an agent .  most of it is pretty routine  pretty safe  pretty dull  and i try to keep it that way .  when i can t avoid frightening situations  i have to endure them for the sake of what i believe i m doing .  i m sufficiently brainwashed  you know  to think it the patriotic thing in a way .       in a way .       in my way .  it s not just this country or that  after all .  we re long past the stage where there can be a meaningful division of humanity .  i honestly believe our policies are intended to uphold the peace and i want to be part  however small  of that upholding .  i didn t volunteer for this mission  but now that i m here  .  .  .   he shrugged .     cora said   you sound as though you re embarrassed to be talking about peace and patriotism .      grant said   i suppose i am .  the rest of you are driven by specific motivation  not by vague words .  owens is testing his ship  michaels is piloting a course across a human body  duval is admiring god s handiwork  and you .  .  .       yes .      grant said softly   you are admiring duval .      cora flushed .   he s worth admiration  he really is .  you know  after he suggested we shine the ship s headlights into the crevice so as to give you something to shoot for  he did nothing further .  he wouldn t say a word to you on your return .  it s his way .  he ll save someone s life  then be casually rude to him and what will be remembered will be his rudeness and not his life saving .  but his manner doesn t alter what he is .       no .  that s true  though it may mask it .       and your manner doesn t affect what you are .  you affect a brittle  adolescent humor in order to mask a deep involvement in humanity .      it was grant s turn to redden .   you make me sound an uncommon jackass .       to yourself perhaps .  in any case  you re not a coward .  but now i ve got to get to work on the laser .   she cast a quick glance at michaels  who was returning to his seat .      the laser .  good lord  i d forgotten .  well  then  do your best to see it s not crucially damaged  will you .      the animation that had brightened her through the previous conversation died away .   oh  if i only could .      she moved to the rear    michaels  eyes followed her .   what about the laser .   he said .     grant shook his head .   she s going to check now .      michaels seemed to hesitate before his next remark .  he shook his head slightly .  grant watched him but said nothing .     michaels settled himself into his seat and said at last   what do you think of our present situation .      grant  until now absorbed in cora  looked up at the windows .  they seemed to be moving between two parallel walls that almost touched the proteus on either side  gleaming yellow and constructed of parallel fibers  like huge tree trunks bound side by side .     the fluid about them was clear  free of cells and objects  almost free of debris .  it seemed to be in dead calm and the proteus churned through it at an even  rapid clip with only the muffled brownian motion to interject any unevenness into its progress .      the brownian motion   said grant   is rougher now .       the fluid here is less viscous than the blood plasma so the motion is less damped out .  we won t be here long  however .       we re not in the blood stream  i take it  then .       does it look like it .  this is the space between the folds of the pleural membrane that lines the lungs .  the membrane on that side is fixed to the ribs .  in fact  we ought to be able to see a huge gentle bulge when we pass one of them .  the other membrane is fixed to the lungs .  if you want the names  they are the parietal pleura and the pulmonary pleura  respectively .       i don t really want the names .       i didn t really think you did .  what we re in now is a film of lubricating moisture between the pleura .  when the lungs expand during inhalation or contact during exhalation  they move against the ribs and this fluid cushions and smooths the motion .  there s so thin a film that the folds of the pleura are commonly considered in contact in the healthy body  but being  germ size we can sneak between the folds through the film of fluid .       when the lung wall moves along the rib cage  doesn t that affect us .       we are alternately hurried along slightly and held back slightly .  not enough to matter .       hey   said grant .   have these membranes anything to do with pleurisy .       they surely do .  when the pleura are infected and inflamed  every breath becomes an agony  and coughing  .  .         what happens if benes coughs .      michaels shrugged .   in our position now  i suppose it would be fatal .  we d come apart .  there s no reason for coughing  however .  he s under hypothermia and in deep sedation and his pleura take my word for it is in good condition .       but if we irritate them  .  .         we re too small to do that .       are you sure .       we can speak only in terms of probabilities .  the probability of a cough now is too small to worry about .   his face was quite calm .      i see   said grant  and looked back to see what cora was doing .     she and duval were in the work room  both heads bent closely over the bench .     grant rose and went to the doorway .  michaels joined him .     on a section of opal glass  illuminated from below into bright milkiness  the laser lay disassembled  each part etched sharp and clear against the light .      what are the total damages now .   demanded duval  crisply .      just those items  doctor  and this broken trigger wire .  that s all .      thoughtfully  duval seemed to be counting the parts  touching each with a delicate finger and moving it .   the key to the situation then is this smashed transistor .  what it amounts to is that there s no way now to fire the lamp  and that s the end of the laser .      grant interrupted .   are there no spare parts .      cora looked up .  her glance drifted guiltily away from grant s firm eyes .  she said   not anything built into the chassis .  we should have brought a second laser but who could have  .  .  .  if it hadn t come loose  .  .  .       michaels said  somberly   are you serious  dr .  duval .  is the laser unusable .      a note of impatience crept into duval s voice .   i m always serious .  now don t bother me .   he seemed lost in thought .     michaels shrugged .   that s it  then .  we ve gone through the heart  and we ve filled our air chambers at the lungs  and all for nothing .  we can t go on .       why not .   demanded grant .      of course  we can go on as a matter of physical ability .  it s just that there s no point in it  grant .  without a laser  there s nothing we can do .      grant said   dr .  duval  is there any way of performing the operation without the laser .       i m thinking   snapped duval .      then share your thoughts   snapped back grant .     duval looked up .   no  there s no way of performing the operation without the laser .       but operations were performed for centuries without a laser .  you cut through the lung wall with your knife  that was an operation .  can t you cut away the clot with your knife .       of course i can  but not without damaging the nerve and placing an entire lobe of the brain in danger .  the laser is incredibly more delicate than the knife .  in this particular case  a knife would be butchery compared with a laser .       but you can save benes  life with the knife  can t you .       i think so  just maybe .  i can t necessarily save his mind  however .  in fact  i should think it almost certain that an operation with a knife would bring benes through with serious mental deficiencies .  is that what you want .      grant rubbed his chin .   i ll tell you .  we re heading for that clot .  when we get there  if all we ve got is a knife  you ll use a knife  duval .  if we lose our knives  you ll use your teeth  duval .  if you don t  i will .  we may fail  but we won t quit .  meanwhile  let s look at it  .  .  .      he pushed between duval and cora and picked up the  transistor which lay neatly on the tip of his first finger .   is this the broken one .       yes   said cora .      if this were fixed or replaced  could you make the laser operate .       yes  but there s no way of fixing it .       suppose you had another transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire .  could you piece it together .       i don t think i could .  it requires such absolute precision .       perhaps you couldn t  but what about you  dr .  duval .  your surgeon s fingers might be able to do it despite the brownian motion .       i could try  with miss peterson s help .  but we don t have the parts .      grant said   yes  we do .  i can supply them .   he seized a heavy metal screw driver and moved purposefully back into the front compartment .  he went to his wireless and without hesitation began to unscrew the panel .     michaels moved behind him  seizing his elbow .   what are you doing  grant .      grant shook himself free   i m getting at its guts .       you mean you re going to dismantle the wireless .       i need a transistor and a wire .       but we ll be out of communication with the outside .       so .       when the time come to take us out of benes  .   .   .  grant  listen  .  .  .      grant said  impatiently   no .  they can follow us through our radioactivity .  the wireless is just for idle talk and we can do without .  we have to  in fact .  it s either radio silence or benes  death .       well then  you d better call carter and put it to him .      grant thought briefly .   i ll call him .  but only to tell him there ll be no further messages .       if he orders you to make ready for withdrawal .       i ll refuse .       but if he orders you  .  .        he can withdraw us by force  but without my cooperation .  as long as we re aboard the proteus  i make the policy decisions .  we ve gone through too much now to quit  so we go forward to the clot  whatever happens and whatever carter orders .       carter shouted   repeat last message .       cannibalizing wireless to repair laser .  this is last message .      reid said  blankly   they re breaking communication .      carter said   what happened to the laser .       don t ask me .      carter sat down heavily .   have coffee brought up here  will you  don .  if i thought i could get away with it  i d ask for a double scotch and soda  and then two more .  we re jinxed .      reid had signalled for coffee .  he said   sabotage  maybe .       sabotage .       yes  and don t play innocent  general .  you anticipated the possibility from the start  or why send grant .       after what happened to benes on the way here  .   .   .       i know .  and i don t particularly trust duval or the girl  either .       they re all right   said carter  with a grimace .   they ve got to be .  everyone here has to be right .  there is no way to make security more secure .       exactly .  no security procedure lends absolute certainty .       all these people work here .       not grant   said reid .      eh .       grant doesn t work here .  he s an outsider .      carter smiled spasmodically .   he s a government agent .      reid said   i know .  and agents can play double games .  you put grant on the proteus and a string of bad luck begins or what looks like bad luck  .  .  .      the coffee had come .  carter said   that s ridiculous .  i know the man .  he s no stranger to me .       when was the last time you saw him .  what do you know about his inner life .       forget it .  it s impossible .   but carter stirred the cream into his coffee with a marked uneasiness .     reid said   all right .  just thinking out loud .      carter said   are they still in the pleura .       yes .      carter looked at the time recorder  which said     and shook his head in frustration .       grant had the wireless in fragments before him .  cora looked at the transistors one after the other  turning them  weighing them  seeming almost to peer within them .      this one   she said  doubtfully   will do  i think  but that wire is much too thick .      duval placed the wire under question on the illuminated opal glass and placed the damaged fragment of original wire next to it  comparing them with somber eyes .     grant said   there s nothing closer .  you ll have to make it do .       it s easy to say that   said cora .   you can give me an order like that  but you can t give such an order to the wire .  it won t work no matter how hard you shout at it .       all right .  all right .   grant tried to think and got nowhere .     duval said   now wait .  with luck  i may be able to scrape it thin enough .    miss peterson  get me a number eleven scalpel .      he placed the wire from what had been grant s device  now wireless in literal truth  in two small clamps and swung a magnifying glass before it .  he reached out for the scalpel which cora placed within his grip and slowly  he began to scrape .     without looking up  he said   kindly take your seat  grant .  you cannot help me by snorting over my shoulder .      grant flinched a little  caught cora s look of appeal .  he said nothing and moved back to his seat .     michaels  in his seat  greeted him humorlessly .   the surgeon is at work   he said .   the scalpel is in his hand and his temperament is at once at its full bent .  don t waste your time being angry with him .      grant said   i m not angry with him .      michaels said   of course you are  unless you re prepared to tell me you ve resigned from the human race .  duval has the gift the god given gift  i m sure he would say of antagonizing people with a single word  a glance  a gesture .  and if that weren t enough  there is the young lady .      grant turned to michaels with clear impatience .   what about the young lady .       come now  grant .  do you want a lecture on boys and girls .      grant frowned and turned away .     michaels said softly  rather sadly   you re in a quandary about her  aren t you .       what quandary .       she s a nice girl  very good looking .  and yet you re a professionally suspicious person .       well .       well .  what happened to the laser .  was it an accident .       it could have been .       yes  it could have been .   michaels  voice was a bare whisper .   but was it .      grant whispered  too  after a quick glance over his shoulder .   are you accusing miss peterson of sabotaging the mission .       of course not .  i have no evidence of that .  but i suspect you are accusing her in your mind and you don t like to be doing so .  hence the quandary .       why miss peterson .       why not .  nobody would pay any attention to her if she were seen fiddling with the laser .  it is her province .  and if she were intent on sabotage  she would naturally gravitate to that part of the mission with which she felt most at home the laser .       which would place immediate and automatic suspicion upon her as it seems to have done   said grant  with some heat .      i see .  you are angry .      grant said   look .  we re all in one relatively small ship and you might think that we were each of us under the close and constant observation of the others  but that s not so .  we ve been so absorbed with what s out there  all of us  that any one of us could have walked back to the storage compartment and done anything he wanted to the laser and done so unnoticed .  you or i might have done it .  i wouldn t have seen you .  you wouldn t have seen me .       or duval .       or duval .  i m not eliminating him .  or it might have been an honest accident .       and your lifeline coming loose .  another accident .       are you prepared to suggest anything else .       no  i m not .  i can point out a few things  if you re in the mood .       i m not  but point them out anyway .       it was duval who secured your lifeline .       and apparently made a poor knot  i suppose   said grant .   still there was considerable tension of the line .  considerable .       a surgeon should be able to tie knots .       that s nonsense .  surgical knots are not sailors  knots .       perhaps .  on the other hand  maybe the knot was deliberately tied so as to come loose .  or perhaps it could have been untied by hand .      grant nodded .   all right .  but there again  everyone had their attention on what was going on about them .  you  or duval  or miss peterson  might have moved quickly back to the ship  loosened the knot  and returned without being noticed .  even   owens might have left the ship for the purpose  i suppose .       yes  but duval had the best chance .  just before you broke loose  he went back to the ship  carrying the snorkel .  he said the lifeline came loose as he watched .  we know by his own admission that he was in the right place at the right time .       and it might still have been an accident .  what s his motive .  the laser had already been sabotaged  and all he could accomplish by loosening the lifeline would be to endanger me personally .  if he was after the mission  why bother with me .      oh  grant .  oh  grant .   michaels smiled and shook his head .      well  talk .  don t just grunt .       suppose it was the young lady who took care of the laser .  and suppose duval s interest was specifically you  suppose he wanted to get rid of you  with damage to the mission strictly secondary .      grant stared speechlessly .     michaels went on .   duval is perhaps not so entirely devoted to his work that he doesn t notice his assistant seems aware of your existence .  you are a fine looking young man  grant  and you have saved her serious injury at the time of the whirlpool  perhaps even her life .  duval watched that and he must have watched her reaction .       there was no reaction .  she s not interested in me .       i watched her when you were lost in the alveolus .  she was distraught .  what was obvious to anyone then  might have been obvious to duval much sooner that she was attracted to you .  and he might have gotten rid of you for that reason .      grant bit at his lower lip in thought  then said   all right .  and the loss of air .  was that an accident  too .      michaels shrugged .   i don t know .  i suspect you will suggest that owens might have been responsible for that .       he might .  he knows the ship .  he designed it .  he can best gimmick its controls .  and only he checked on what was wrong .       that s right  you know .  that s right .       and for that matter   went on grant with gathering anger   what about the arterio venous fistula .  was that an accident  or did you know it was there .      michaels sat back in his chair and looked blank .   good lord  i hadn t thought of that .  i give you my word  grant  i sat here and honestly thought there wasn t a thing that happened that could possibly point in my direction specifically .  i realized that it could be maintained that i had slyly damaged the laser or undone your lifeline knot or jammed the air chamber valve when no one was looking or all three  for that matter .  but in each case it was so much more likely that someone else had done it .  the fistula  i admit  could be no one but myself .       that s right .       except  of course  that i didn t know it was there .  but i can t prove that  can i .       no .      michaels said   do you ever read detective stories  grant .       in my younger days i read quite a few .  now  .  .  .       your profession spoils the fun .  yes  i can well imagine that .  but you know  in detective stories  it is always so simple .  a subtle clue points to one person and one person only and the detective sees it though no one else does .  in real life  it seems  the clues point everywhere .       or nowhere   said grant  firmly .   we could be dealing with a series of accidents and misfortunes .       we could   conceded michaels .     neither  however  sounded very convincing .   or convinced .       chapter      lymphatic      owens  voice sounded from the bubble   dr .  michaels  look ahead .  is that the turnoff .      they could feel the proteus slowing .     michaels muttered   too much talk .  i should have been watching .      immediately ahead was an open ended tube .  the thin walls facing them were ragged  fading away  almost into nothingness .  the opening was barely wide enough for the proteus .      good enough   called out michaels .   head into it .      cora had left the work bench to look forward in wonder  but duval remained in his place  still working  with infinite  untiring patience .      that must be a lymphatic   she said .     they had entered and the walls surrounded them  no thicker than those of the capillary they had left some time back .     as in the capillaries  the walls were made up  quite clearly  of cells in the shape of flat polygons  each with a rounded nucleus at the center .  the fluid through which they were passing was very similar to that in the pleural cavity  sparkling yellowish in the proteus headlights  and lending a yellow cast to the cells .  the nuclei were deeper in color  almost orange .     grant said   poached eggs .  they look exactly like poached eggs .   then   what s a lymphatic .       it s an auxiliary circulatory system in a way   said cora  explaining eagerly .   fluid squeezes out of the very thin capillaries and collects in spaces in the body and between the cells .  that s interstitial fluid .  these drain off into tiny tubes or lymphatics that are open at their ends  as you saw just now .  these tubes gradually combine into larger and larger tubes until the largest are the size of veins .  all the lymph  .  .  .        that s the fluid about us .   asked grant .      yes .  all the lymph is collected into the largest lymphatic of all  the thoracic duct  which leads into the subclaviar vein in the upper chest and is thus restored to the main circulatory system .       and why have we entered the lymphatic .      michaels leaned back  the course momentarily secure .   well   he put in   it s a quiet backwater .  there s no pumping effect of the heart .  muscular pressures and tensions move the fluid and benes isn t having many of those right now .  so we can be assured a quiet journey to the brain .       why didn t we enter the lymphatics to begin with  then .       they are small .  an artery is a much better target for a hypodermic  and the arterial current was expected to carry us to target in minutes .  it didn t work out and to make our way back into an artery from here would delay us badly .  then  once we reached the artery  we would receive a battering which the ship might no longer be able to take .      he spread out a new set of charts and called out   owens  are you following chart    d .       yes  dr .  michaels .       make sure you follow the path i ve traced .  it will take us through a minimum number of nodes .      grant said   what s that up ahead .      michaels looked up and froze .   slow the ship   he cried .     the proteus decelerated vigorously .  through one portion of the wall of the now widening tube  a shapeless mass protruded  milky  granular and somehow threatening .  but as they watched  it shrank and vanished .      move on   said michaels .  he said to grant .   i was afraid that white cell might be coming  but it was going  fortunately .  some of the white cells are formed in the lymph nodes  which are an important barrier against disease .  they form not only white cells but also antibodies .       and what are antibodies .       protein molecules that have the capacity to combine specifically with various outside substances invading the body  germs  toxins  foreign proteins .       and us .       and us  i suppose  under proper circumstances .      cora interposed .   bacteria are trapped in the nodes  which serve as a battleground between them and the white cells .  the nodes swell up and become painful .  you know  children get what are called swollen glands in the armpits or at the angle of the jaw .       and they re really swollen lymph nodes .       that s right .      grant said   it sounds like a good idea to stay away from the lymph nodes .      michaels said   we are small .  benes  antibody system is not sensitized to us  and there is only one series of nodes we need pass through  after which we have clear sailing .  it s a chance  of course  but everything we do now is a chance .   or   he demanded  challengingly   are you going to set policy by ordering me out of the lymphatic system .      grant shook his head   no .  not unless someone suggests a better alternative .         there it is   said michaels  nudging grant gently   see it .       the shadow up ahead .       yes .  this lymphatic is one of several that enters the node  which is a spongy mass of membranes and tortuous passages .  the place is full of lymphocytes  .  .  .        what are those .       one of the types of white cells .  they won t bother us  i hope .  any bacteria in the circulatory system reaches a lymph node eventually .  it can t negotiate the narrow twisting channels .       can we .       we move deliberately  grant  and with an end in view  whereas bacteria drift blindly .  you do see the difference  i hope .  once trapped in the node  the bacterium is handled by antibodies or  if that fails  by white cells mobilized for battle .      the shadow was close now .  the golden tinge of the lymph was darkening and turning cloudy .  up ahead there seemed a wall .      do you have the course  owens .   michaels called out .      i have  but its going to be easy to make a wrong turning .       even if you do  remember that at this moment we are heading generally upward .  keep the gravitometer indicator on the line as steadily as you can  and in the end you can t go wrong .      the proteus made a sharp turn and suddenly all was gray .     the headlights seemed to pick up nothing that was not a shadow of a deeper or lighter gray .  there was an occasional small rod  shorter than the ship and much narrower  clumps of spherical objects  quite small  and with fuzzy boundaries .      bacteria   muttered michaels .   i see them in too great detail to recognize the exact species .  isn t that strange .  too much detail .      the proteus was moving more slowly now  following the many gentle sweeps and turns of the channel almost hesitantly .     duval stepped to the door of the work room .   what s going on .  i can t work on this thing if the ship doesn t hold a steady course .  the brownian motion is bad enough .       sorry  doctor   said michaels  coldly .   we re passing through a lymph node and this is the best we can do .      duval  looking angry  turned away .     grant peered forward   it s getting messy up there  dr .  michaels .  what is that stuff that looks like seaweed or something .       reticular fibers   said michaels .     owens said   dr .  michaels .       yes .       that fibrous stuff is getting thicker .  i won t be able to maneuver through them without doing some damage to them .      michaels looked thoughtful .   don t worry about that .  any damage we do will  in any case  be minimal .      a clump of fibers pulled loose as the proteus nudged into it  slipped and slid along the window and vanished past the sides .  it happened again and again with increasing frequency .      it s all right  owens   said michaels  encouragingly   the body can repair damage like this without trouble .       i m not worried about benes   called out owens .   i m worried about the ship .  if this stuff clogs the vents  the engine will overheat .  and its adhering to us .  can t you tell the difference in the engine sound .      grant couldn t  and his attention turned to the outside again .  the ship was  nosing through a forest of tendrils now .  they glinted a kind of menacing maroon in the headlights .      we ll get through it soon   said michaels  but there was a definite note of anxiety in his voice .     the way did clear a bit and now grant could indeed sense a difference in the sound of the engines  almost a thickening hoarseness  as though the clear echo of gases bubbling through exhaust vents were being muffled and choked off .     owens shouted   dead ahead .      there was a soggy collision of a bacterial rod with the ship .  the substance of the bacterium bent about the curve of the window  sprang back into shape and bounced off  leaving a smear that washed off slowly .     there were others ahead .      what s going on .   said grant in wonder .      i think   said michaels   i think we re witnessing antibody reaction to bacteria .  white cells aren t involved .  see .  watch the walls of the bacteria .   it s hard by the reflection of miniaturized light  but can you see it .       no  i m afraid i can t .      duval s voice sounded behind them .   i can t see anything  either .      grant turned   is the wire adjusted  doctor .       not yet   said duval .   i can t work in this mess .  it will have to wait .  what s this about antibodies .      michaels said   as long as you re not working  let s have the inner lights out .  owens .      the lights went out and the only illumination came from without  a ghostly gray maroon flicker that placed all their faces in angry shadow .      what s going on outside .   asked cora .      that s what i m trying to explain   said michaels .   watch the edges of the bacteria ahead .      grant did his best  narrowing his eyes .  the light was unsteady and flickering .   you mean those small objects that look like bb shot .       exactly .  they re antibody molecules .  proteins  you know  and large enough to see on our scale .  there s one nearby .  see it .  see it .      one of the small antibodies had swirled past the window .  at close quarters it did not seem to be a bb shot at all .  it seemed rather larger than a bb and to be a tiny tangle of spaghetti  vaguely spherical .  thin strands  visible only as fine glints of light  protruded here and there .      what are they doing .   asked grant .      each bacterium has a distinctive cell wall made out of specific atomic groupings hooked up in a specific way .  to us  the various walls look smooth and featureless  but if we were smaller still on the molecular scale instead of the bacterial we d see that each wall had a mosaic pattern  and that this mosaic was different and distinctive in each bacterial species .  the antibodies can fit neatly upon this mosaic and once they cover key portions of the wall  the bacterial cell is through  it would be like blocking a man s nose and mouth and choking him to death .     cora said excitedly   you can see them cluster .  how   how horrible .       are you sorry for the bacteria  cora .   said michaels  smiling .      no  but the antibodies seem so vicious  the way they pounce .      michaels said   don t give them human emotions .  they are only molecules  moving blindly .  inter atomic forces  pull them against those portions of the wall which they fit and hold them there .  it s analogous to the clank of a magnet against an iron bar .  would you say the magnet attacks the iron viciously .      knowing what to look for  grant could now see what was happening .  a bacterium  moving blindly through a cloud of hovering antibodies  seemed to attract them  to pull them in to itself .  in moments  its wall had grown fuzzy with them .  the antibodies lined up side by side  their spaghetti strand projections entangling .     grant said   some of the antibodies seem indifferent .  they don t touch the bacterium .       the antibodies are specific   said michaels .   each one is designed to fit the mosaic of a particular kind of bacterium  or of a particular protein molecule .  right now  most of the antibodies  though not all  fit the bacteria surrounding us .  the presence of these particular bacteria has stimulated the rapid formation of this particular variety of antibody .  how this stimulation is brought about  we still don t know .       good lord   cried duval .   look at that .      one of the bacteria was now solidly encased in antibodies which had followed its every irregularity  so that it seemed to be exactly as before  but with a fuzzy  thickened boundary .     cora said   it fits perfectly .       no  not that .  don t you see that the intermolecular bindings of the antibody molecules produce a kind of pressure on the bacterium .  this was never clear even in electron microscopy which only shows us dead objects .      a silence fell upon the crew of the proteus  which was now moving slowly past the bacterium .  the antibody coating seemed to stiffen and tighten and the bacterium within writhed .  the coating stiffened and tightened again  then again  and suddenly the bacterium seemed to crumple and give way .  the antibodies drew together and what had been it rod became a featureless ovoid .      they killed the bacterium .  they literally squeezed it to death   said cora  with revulsion .      remarkable   muttered duval .   what a weapon for research we have in the proteus .      grant said   are you sure we re safe from the antibodies .      michaels  said   it seems so .  we re not the sort of thing for which antibodies are designed .       are you sure .  i have a feeling they can be designed for any shape  if properly stimulated .       you re right  i suppose .  still  we re obviously not stimulating them .      owens called out   more fibers ahead  dr .  michaels .  we re pretty well coated with the stuff .  it s cutting down our speed .      michaels said   we re almost out of the node  owens .      occasionally  a writhing bacterium slammed against the ship  which shuddered in response  but the fight was thinning out now  the bacteria clearly the losers .  the proteus was humping and nudging its way through fibers again .      right ahead   said michaels   one more left turn and we re at the efferent lymphatic .      owens said   we re trailing the fibers .  the proteus looks like a shaggy dog .      grant said   how many more lymph nodes on the course to the brain .       three more .  one may be avoidable .  i m not quite sure .       we can t do that .  we lose too much time .  we won t make it through three more like this .  are there any any short cuts .      michaels shook his head .   none that won t create problems worse than those we now face .   sure  we ll make it through the nodes .  the fibers will wash off  and if we don t stop to look at bacterial warfare  we can go faster .       and next time   said grant  frowning   we ll meet a fight involving white cells .      duval stepped over to michaels  charts and said   where are we now  michaels .       right here   said michaels  watching the surgeon narrowly .     duval thought a moment and said   let me get my bearings .  we re in the neck now  aren t we .       yes .      grant thought  in the neck .  right where they had started .  he looked at the time recorder .  it said    .  more than half the time gone and they were back where they had started .     duval said   can t we avoid all nodes  and actually take a short cut  too  if we turn off somewhere around here and make straight for the inner ear .  from that to the clot is no distance at all .      michaels wrinkled his forehead into a washboard and sighed .   on the map that looks fine .  you make a quick mark on the chart and you re home safe .  but have you thought what passing through the inner ear means .      duval said   no .  what .       the ear  my dear doctor  as i  needn t tell you  is a device for concentrating and amplifying sound waves .  the slightest sound  the slightest sound outside  will set up intense vibrations in the inner ear .  on our miniaturized scale those vibrations will be deadly .      duval looked thoughtful .   yes  i see .      grant said   is the inner ear always vibrating .       unless there is silence  with no sound above the hearing threshold .  even then  on our scale  we ll probably detect some gentle motions .       worse than brownian motion .       perhaps not .      grant said   the sound has to come from outside  doesn t it .  if we pass through the inner ear  the throbbing of the ship s engine or the sound of our voices won t affect it  will it .       no  i m sure it won t .  the inner ear isn t designed for our miniaturized vibrations .       well  then  if the people out there in the hospital room maintain complete silence  .  .  .       how will we get them to do so .   demanded michaels .  then  almost brutally   you demolished the wireless so we can t get in touch with them .       but they can track us .  they ll find us heading for the inner ear .  they ll understand the need for silence .       will they .       won t they .   said grant  impatiently .   most of them there are medical men .  they have an understanding of such matters .       do you want to take that kind of chance .      grant looked about .   what do the rest of you think .      owens said   i ll follow any course that s set for me  but i m not going to set it for myself .      duval said   i m not sure .      michaels said   and i am sure .  i m against it .      grant looked briefly at cora  who sat in silence .      all right   he said .   the responsibility is mine .  we re heading for the inner ear .  set the course  michaels .      michaels said   look here  .  .        the decision is made  michaels .  set the course .      michaels flushed and then shrugged .   owens   he said  coldly .   we ll have to make a sharp left turn at the point i am now indicating .  .  .        chapter      ear      carter lifted his coffee cup absently  drops of liquid slipped off and landed on his pants leg .  he noticed that but paid it no attention .   what do you mean  they ve veered off .       i should guess they felt they had spent too much time in the lymph node and didn t want to go through any more of them   said reid .      all right .  where are they going instead .       i m not positive yet  but they seem to be headed for the inner ear .  i m not sure that i approve of that .      carter put down his cup again and shoved it to one side .  he had not placed it to his lips .   why not .   he glanced quickly at the time recorder .  it read    .      it will be difficult .   we ll have to watch out for sound .       why .       you can figure it out  can t you  al .  the ear reacts to sound .  the cochlea vibrates .  if the proteus is anywhere near it  it will vibrate  too  and it may vibrate to destruction .      carter leaned forward in his seat  staring at reid s calm face .   why are they going there  then .       i suppose because they think that s the only route that will get them to destination fast enough .  or  on the other hand  they may just be crazy .  we have no way of telling since they cannibalized their wireless .      carter said   are they in there yet .  in the inner ear  i mean .      reid flicked a switch and asked a quick question .  he turned back .   just about .      do the men down there in the operating room understand about the necessity for silence .       i suppose so .         you suppose so .  what good is supposing .       they won t be in it long .       they ll be in it long enough .  listen  you tell those men down there  .   .   .  no  too late to take a chance .  get me a piece of paper and call in someone from outside .  anyone .  anyone .      an armed security man came in and saluted .      oh  shut up   said carter  wearily .  he didn t return the salute .  he had scribbled on the paper in block letters  silence .  absolute silence while proteus is in ear .      take this   he said to the security man .   you go down into the operating room and show it to each man .  make sure he looks at it .  if you make any noise i ll kill you .  if you say one word  i ll disembowel you first .  do you understand .       yes  sir   he said  but looked confused and alarmed .      go ahead .  hurry .  and take off your shoes .       sir .       take them off .  you walk into that room on stocking feet .      they watched from the observation room  counting the interminable seconds until the stockinged soldier walked into the operating room .  from doctor to nurse to doctor he went  holding up the paper and jerking a thumb up toward the control room .  person after person nodded grimly .  none budged from his or her spot .  for a moment  it seemed a mass paralysis had gripped everyone in the room .      obviously they understand   said reid   even without instructions .       i congratulate them   said carter  savagely .   now listen  you get in touch with the various guys at controls .  no buzzers must sound  no bells  no gongs  nothing .  for that matter  no flashing lights .  i don t want anyone to be startled into as much as a grunt .       they ll be through in a few seconds .       maybe   said carter   and maybe not .  hop to it .      reid hopped to it .       the proteus had entered a wide region of pure liquid .  except for a few antibodies flashing by now and then  there was nothing to be seen except the glitter of the ship s headlights making its way through the yellow tinged lymph .     a dim sound below the threshold of hearing rubbed over the ship  almost as though it had slid against a washboard .  then again .  and again .     michaels called out   owens .  put out the cabin lights  will you .      the exterior leaped into greater clarity at once .   do you see that .   michaels asked .     the others stared .  grant saw nothing at all .      we re in the cochlear duct   said michaels .   inside the little spiral tube in the inner ear that does our hearing for us .  this one does benes  hearing for him .  it vibrates to sound in different patterns .  see .      now grant saw .  it was almost like a shadow in the fluid  a huge  flat shadow whipping past them .      it s a sound wave   said michaels .   at least  in a manner of speaking .  a wave of compression which we somehow make out with our miniaturized light .       does that mean someone is talking .   asked cora .      oh  no  if someone were talking or making any real sound  this thing would heave like the granddaddy of all earthquakes .  even in absolute silence  though  the cochlea picks up sounds  the distant thud of the heartbeat  the rasp of blood working through the tiny veins and arteries of the ear and so on .  didn t you ever cup your ear with a shell and listen to the sound of the ocean .  what you re listening to mainly is the magnified sound of your own ocean  the blood stream .      grant said   will this be dangerous .      michaels shrugged .   no worse than it is  if no one talks .      duval  back in the work room and bent over the laser once more  said   why are we slowing .  owens .      owens said   something s wrong .  the engine is choking off and i don t know why .      there was the slowly intensifying sensation of being in a down dropping elevator as the proteus settled lower in the duct .     they hit bottom with a slight jar and duval put down his scalpel .   now what .      owens said anxiously .   the engine is overheating and i had to stop it .  i think  .  .  .       what .       it must be those reticular fibers .  the damned seaweed .  it must have blocked the intake vents .  there s nothing else i can think of that would be causing this .       can you blow them out .   asked grant  tensely .     owens shook his head .   not a chance .  those are intake vents .  they suck inward .       well  then  there s only one thing to do   said grant .   it has to be cleaned off from the outside and that means more skin diving .   with furrowed brow  he began to clamber into his diving outfit .     cora was looking anxiously out the window .     she said   there are antibodies out there .       not many   said grant  briefly .      but what if they attack .       not likely   said michaels  reassuringly .   they re not sensitized to the human shape .  and as long as no damage is done to the tissues themselves  the antibodies probably will remain passive .       see   said grant  but cora shook her head .     duval  who had listened for a moment  bent down to look at the wire he was shaving  matching it against the original wire thoughtfully  and then turning it in his hands slowly to try to gauge the evenness of its cross section .     grant dropped out the ventral hatch of the ship  landing on the soft rubber elasticity of the lower wall of the cochlear duct .  he looked ruefully at the ship .  it was not the clean  smooth metal it had been .  it looked furry  shaggy .     he kicked off into the lymph  propelling himself toward the bow of the ship .  owens was quite correct .  the intake valves were choked with the fibers .     grant seized a double handful and pulled .  they came loose with difficulty  many breaking off at the surface of the vent filters .     michaels  voice reached him over his small receiver .   how is it .       pretty rotten   said grant .      how long will it take you .  we ve got a    reading on the time recorder .       it s going to take me quite a while .   grant yanked desperately  but the viscosity of the lymph slowed his movements and the tenacity of the fibers seemed to fight back .     within the ship  cora said  tensely .   wouldn t it be better if some of us went out to help him .       well  now   began michaels  doubtfully .      i m going to .   she seized her suit .     michaels said   all right .  i will  too .  owens had better stay at the controls .      duval said   and i think i had better stay right here  too .  i have this thing almost done .       of course  dr .  duval   said cora .  she adjusted her swimming mask .     the task was scarcely eased by the fact that three of them were soon wiggling about the ship s bow  all three snatching desperately at the fibers  pulling them loose  letting them drift away in the slow current .  the metal of the filters was beginning to show and grant pushed some recalcitrant pieces into the vent .      i hope this doesn t do any harm  but i can t get them out .  owens  what if some of these fibers get into the vents  inside  i mean .      owens voice in his ear said   then they get carbonized in the motor and foul it .  it will mean a nasty cleaning job when we re through .       once we get through  i don t care if you have to scrap this stinking ship .   grant pushed at the fibers that were flush with the filters and pulled at those that weren t .  cora and michaels did the same .     cora said   we re making it .      michaels said   but we re in the cochlea a lot longer than we had expected to be .  at any moment  some sound  .  .  .        shut up   said grant irritably   and finish the job .        carter made as if to tear at his hair and then held back .   no  no  no  no .   he cried .   they ve stopped again .      he pointed at the message written on a piece of paper and held up in his direction from one of the television screens .      at least he remembered not to talk   said reid .   why do you suppose they ve stopped .       how in the world do i know .  maybe they ve stopped for a coffee break .  maybe they ve decided to stop for a sunbath .  maybe the girl  .  .  .      he broke off .   well  i don t know .  all i do know is that we have only twenty four minutes left .      reid said   the longer they stay in the inner ear  the more nearly certain it will be that some joker will make a sound sneeze something .       you re right .   carter thought  then said softly   oh  for the love of mike .  it s the simple solutions we don t see .  call in that messenger boy .      the security man entered again .  he didn t salute .     carter said .   you still have your shoes off .  okay .  take this down and show it to one of the nurses .  you remember about the disemboweling .       yes  sir .      the message read  cotton at benes  ears .     carter lit a cigar and watched through the control window as the security man entered  hesitated a moment  then moved with quick  gingerly steps to one of the nurses .     she smiled  looked up at carter and made a circle of her thumb and forefinger .     carter said   i have to think of everything .      reid said   it will just deaden the noise .  it won t stop it .       you know what they say about half a loaf   said carter .     the nurse slipped off her own shoes and was at one of the tables in two steps .  carefully  she opened a fresh box of absorbent cotten and unrolled two feet of it .     she pulled off a fistful in one hand  and seized a fistful in the other .  it didn t come readily .  she pulled harder  her hand went flying outward  striking a pair of scissors on the table .     it skittered off the table  striking the hard floor .  the nurse s foot flew desperately after it  clamping down upon it hard  but not until after it had given out one sharp  metallic clang like the hiccup of a fallen angel .     the nurse s face reddened into a look of deathly horror  everyone else in the room turned to stare  and carter  dropping his cigar  crumpled into his chair .      finished .   he said .       owens turned on the engine and gently checked the controls .  the needle on the temperature gauge  which had been well into the danger zone almost since they had entered the cochlear duct  was dropping .     he said   it looks good .  are you all set out there .      grant s voice sounded in his ear .   nothing much left .  get ready to move .  we re coming in .      and at that moment  the universe seemed to heave .  it was as though a fist had driven up against the proteus  which lifted high .  owens seized a panel for support and held on desperately  listening to a distant thunder .     below  duval  as desperately  held on to the laser  trying to cushion it against a world gone mad .     outside  grant felt himself flung high in the air as though caught in the grip of a huge tidal wave .  he flipped over and over and plunged into the wall of the cochlear duct .  he was shaken loose from the wall  which seemed to be caving forward .     somewhere in a miraculously calm segment of his mind  grant knew that on the ordinary scale the wall was responding with rapid vibrations of microscopic amplitude to some sharp sound  but that thought was buried in sheer shock .     grant tried desperately to locate the proteus but he caught only a quick glimpse of its headlights flashing against a distant section of the wall .     cora had been holding on to a projection of the proteus at the moment the vibration had struck .  instinctively  her grip tightened and for a moment she rode the proteus as though it were an insanely bucking bronco .  the breath was jerked out of her and when her grip was torn away  she went skidding across the floor of the membrane on which the ship had been resting .     the ship s headlights caught the path ahead of her and though she tried in horror to brake her motion it was quite useless .  she might as well have tried to dig her heels into the ground in order to stop an avalanche .     she was heading  she knew  for a section of the organ of corti  the basic center of hearing .  included among the components of the organ were the hair cells         of them altogether .  she could make out a few of them now  each with its delicate  microscopic cilium held high .  certain numbers of them vibrated gently according to the pitch and intensity of the sound waves conducted into the inner ear and there amplified .     that  however  was as she might have considered it in some course in physiology  phrases as they might have been used in the universe of normal scale .  here what she saw was a sheer precipice and beyond it a series of tall  graceful columns  moving in stately fashion  not all in unison  but rather first one and then another as though a swaying wave were rippling over the entire structure .     cora went skidding and spinning over the precipice into a world of vibrating columns and walls .  her headlight flashed erratically as she went tumbling downward .  she felt the pull of something on her harness and swung forcefully against a firmly elastic object .  she dangled  head downward  afraid to struggle lest whatever projection had stopped her would give way and let her fall the rest of the way .     she spun first this way  then that  as the column against which she clung  a microscopic  cilium on one hair cell of the organ of corti  continued to sway majestically .     she was managing to breathe now and heard her own name .  someone was calling .  carefully  she made a pleading sound .  encouraged by the sound of her voice  she screamed as shrilly as she could .   help .  everybody .  help .        the first devastating shock had passed and owens was bringing the proteus under control in a still turbulent sea .  the sound  whatever it was  might have been intense but it had been sharp and quick dying .  that alone saved them .  had it continued for even a short time  .  .  .     duval  cradling the laser under one arm and seated with his back against the wall and his legs pressing desperately against a bench support  shouted   all clear .       i think we pulled through   gasped owens .   the controls respond .       we had better leave .       we ve got to pick up the others .      duval said   oh  yes .  i had forgotten .   carefully  he rolled over  got one hand beneath to steady himself and then carefully made it to his feet .  he still clutched the laser .   get them in .      owens called   michaels .  grant .  miss peterson .       coming in   responded michaels .   i think i m in one piece .       wait   called grant .   i don t see cora .      the proteus was steady now and grant  breathing heavily  and feeling more than a little shaken  was swimming strongly toward its headlight .  he called   cora .      she answered shrilly   help .  everybody .  help .      grant looked about in every direction .  he shouted  desperately   coral where are you .      her voice in his ear said   i can t tell you exactly .  i m caught among the hair cells .       where are they .  michaels  where are the hair cells .      grant could make out michaels approaching the ship from another direction  his body a dim shadow in the lymph  his small headlight cutting a thin swath ahead of him .     michaels said   wait  let me get my bearings .   he flipped quickly  then shouted   owens  turn on ship s headlight wide angle .      light spread in response and michaels said   this way .  owens  follow me .  we ll need the light .      grant followed michaels  quickly moving figure and saw the precipice and columns ahead .      in there .   he asked uncertainly .      must be   returned michaels .     they were at the edge now  with the ship behind them and its headlight spilling into the cavernous file of columns  still swaying gently .      i don t see her   said michaels .      i do   said grant  pointing .   isn t that she .  cora .  i see you .  move your arm so i can be certain .      she waved .      all right .  i m coming to get you .      cora waited and felt a touch at her knee  the faintest and gentlest sensation  like that of a fly s wing brushing against her .  she looked toward her knee but saw nothing .     there was another touch near her shoulder  then still another .     quite suddenly  she made them out  just a few the little balls of wool  with their quivering out thrusting filaments .  the protein molecules of the antibodies  .  .  .     it was almost as though they were exploring her surface  testing her  tasting her  deciding whether she were harmless or not .  there were only a few  but more were drifting toward her from along the columns .     with the headlights from the proteus shining down  she could make them out clearly  in the glittering reflection of miniaturized light .  each filament shone like a questing sunbeam .     she screamed   come quickly .  there are antibodies all about .   in her thoughts she could see  all too clearly  the antibodies coating the bacterial cell  fuzzing it completely  then crushing it as inter molecular forces drew the antibodies together .     an antibody had touched her elbow and was clinging there .  she shook her arm in revulsion and horror  so that her whole body writhed and went slamming into the column .  the antibody did not shake loose .  another joined it  the two fitting together neatly  filaments interlaced .        antibodies   muttered grant .     michaels said   she must have done enough damage to surrounding tissue to spark their appearance .       can they do anything to her .       not immediately .  they re not sensitized to her .  no antibodies are deliberately designed for her form .  but some will fit somewhere on a sheerly random basis and she will stimulate the formation of more like those that do fit .  then they ll come swarming .      grant could see them now  swarming already  settling about her like a cloud of tiny fruit flies .     he said   michaels  get back to the sub .  one person is enough to risk .  i ll get her out of here somehow .  if i don t  it will be up to the three of you to get whatever s left of us back into the ship .  we can t be allowed to de miniaturize here whatever happens .      michaels hesitated  then said   take care   and turned  hastening back to the proteus .     grant continued to plunge toward cora .  the turbulence caused by his approach sent the antibodies spinning and dancing rapidly .      let s get you out of here  cora   he panted .      oh  grant .  quickly .      he was pulling desperately at her oxygen cylinders  where they had cut into a column and stuck .  thick strands of viscous material were still oozing outward from the break and it was that  perhaps  which had triggered the arrival of the antibodies .      don t move  cora .  let me  .   .   .  ah .   cora s ankle was caught between two fibers and he strained them apart .   now  come with me .      both executed a half somersault and started moving away .  cora s body was fuzzed with clinging antibodies but the bulk were left behind .  then  following who knew what kind of equivalent of  scent  on the microscopic scale  they began to follow  first a few  then many  then the entire growing swarm .      we ll never make it   gasped cora .      yes  we will   said grant .   just put every muscle you have into it .       but they re still attaching themselves .  i m scared  grant .        grant looked over his shoulder at her  then fell back slightly .  her back was half covered by a mosaic of the wool balls .  they had gauged the nature of her surface well  that part of it at least .     he brushed her back hurriedly  but the antibodies clung  flattening out at the touch of his hand and springing back into shape afterward .  a few were now beginning to probe and  taste  grant s body .      faster  cora .       but i can t .   .  .        but you can .  hang on to me  will you .      they shot upward  over the lip of the precipice  to the waiting proteus .       duval helped michaels up through the hatch .   what s happening out there .      michaels pulled off his helmet  gasping .   miss peterson was trapped in the cells of hensen .  grant is trying to get her loose but antibodies are swarming over her .      duval s eyes widened .   what can we do .       i don t know .  maybe he can get her back .  otherwise  we ve got to go on .      owens said   but we can t leave them there .       of course not   said duval .   we ve got to go out there  all three of us and  .   .   .   then  harshly   why are you back here  michaels .  why aren t you out there .      michaels looked at duval hostilely   because i wouldn t have done any good .  i haven t got grant s muscles or his reflexes .  i d have been in the way .  if you want to help  get out there yourself .      owens said   we ve got to get them back  alive or   or   otherwise .  they ll be de miniaturizing in about a quarter of an hour .       all right  then   shouted duval .   get into your swimsuit and let s get out there .       wait   said owens .   they re coming .  i ll get the hatch ready .        grant s hand was clutching firmly at the wheel of the hatch  while the signal light flashed redly above it .  he picked at the antibodies on cora s  back  pinching the wool like fibers of one between thumb and forefinger  feeling its soft springiness give and then become a wiry core that gave no further .     he thought  this is a peptide chain .     dim memories of college courses came back .  he had once been able to write the chemical formula of a portion of a peptide chain and here was the real thing .  if he had a microscope could he see the individual atoms .  no  michaels had said those would fuzz into nothing no matter what he could do .     he lifted the antibody molecule .  it clung tightly at first then gave  sucking free .  neighboring molecules  clinging to it  pulled loose  too .  an entire patch came free and grant swung it away  batting at it .  they remained together and came back  seeking a place to cling to again .     they had no brains  not even the most primitive  and it was wrong to think of them as monsters  or predators  or even fruit flies .  they were merely molecules with atoms so arranged as to make them cling to the surfaces that fit theirs through the blind action of inter atomic forces .  a phrase came back to grant from the recesses of memory    van der waals forces .   nothing more .     he kept pulling at the fuzz on cora s back .  she cried out   they re coming  grant .  let s get into the hatch .      grant looked back .  they were finding their way  sensing their presence .  links and chains of them were swooping high above the lip of the precipice and coming down in the general direction like blinded cobras .     grant said   we ve got to wait  .   .   .   the light turned green .    .  all right .  now .   he whirled at the wheel  desperately .     the antibodies were all about them  but making chiefly for cora .  for her they had already been sensitized and there was far less hesitation now .  they clung and joined  spanning her shoulders and making their woolly pattern across her abdomen .  they hesitated over the uneven three dimensional curve of her breasts as though they had not figured that out yet .     grant had no time to aid cora in her ineffectual clutchings at the antibodies .  he pulled the hatch door open  thrust cora into it  antibodies and all  and followed after her .     he pushed forcefully against the hatch door while antibodies continued to pour in .  the door closed upon their elasticity but the basic wiriness of hundreds of them clogged the door at the end .  he bent his back against the pressure of that wiriness and managed to turn the wheel that locked the door in place .  a dozen little balls of wool  so soft and almost cuddly when viewed separately and in themselves  wriggled feebly in the crack where the hatch door met the wall .  but hundreds of others  untrapped  filled the fluid about them .  air pressure was pushing the fluid out and the hissing filled their ears but at the moment  grant was concerned only to pull the antibodies loose .  some were settling on his own chest  but that didn t matter .  cora s midriff was buried in them  as was her back .  they  had formed a solid band about her body from breast to thigh .     she said   they re tightening  grant .      through her mask he could see the agony in her face  and he could hear the effort it took her to speak .     the water was sinking rapidly  but they couldn t wait .  grant hammered at the inner door .      i   i   can t brea   gasped cora .     the door opened  the fluid it  still held pouring into the main body of the ship .  duval s hand thrusting through  seized cora s arm and pulled her in .  grant followed .     owens said   lord help us  look at them .   with an expression of distaste and nausea  he started plucking at the antibodies as grant had been doing .     a strand tore  then another  then still another .  half laughing  grant said   it s easy  now .  just brush them off .      all were doing so now .  they fell into the inch or so of fluid on the floor of the ship and moved feebly .     duval said   they re designed to work in body fluid  of course .  once they re surrounded by  air  the molecular attractions alter in nature .       as long as they re off cora .  .  .      cora was breathing in deep  shuddering gasps .  gently  duval removed her head piece  but it was to grant s arm she clung as she suddenly burst into tears .      i was so scared   she sobbed .      both of us were   grant assured her .   will you stop thinking it s a disgrace to be frightened .  there s a purpose to fear  you know .   he was stroking her hair slowly .   it makes the adrenalin flow so that you can swim that much faster and longer and endure that much more .  an efficient fear mechanism is good basic material for heroism .      duval pushed grant impatiently to one side   are you all right  miss peterson .      cora took a deep breath and said with an effort but in a steady voice   quite all right  doctor .      owens said   we ve got to get out of here .   he was in the bubble .   we have practically no time left .        chapter      brain      in the control room  the television receivers seemed to spring back into life .      general carter  .  .  .        yes  what now .       they re moving again  sir .  they re out of the ear and heading rapidly for the clot .       hah .   he looked at the time recorder  which read    .   twelve minutes .   vaguely  he looked about for the cigar and found it on the floor where he had dropped it and then stepped on it .  he picked it up  looked at its flatly mangled shape and threw it away in disgust .      twelve minutes .  can they still make it  reid .      reid was crumpled in his chair  looking miserable .   they can make it .  they can even get rid of the clot  maybe .      but .  .  .       but .       but i don t know if we can get them out in time .  we can t probe into the brain to pull them out  you know .  if we could do that  we would have been able to probe into it for the clot in the first place .  that means they ve got to get to the brain and then proceed to some point where they can be removed .  if they don t  .  .  .       carter said  querulously .   i ve been brought two cups of coffee and one cigar and i haven t had one sip or one puff  .  .  .       they re reaching the base of the brain  sir   came the word .       michaels was back at his chart .  grant was at his shoulder  staring at the complexities before him .      is that the clot here .       yes   said michaels .      it looks a long distance off .  we only have twelve minutes .       it s not as far away as it looks .  we ll have clear sailing now .  we ll be at the base of the brain in less than a minute and from there  in no time at all  .  .  .        there was a sudden flood of light pouring in all about the ship .  grant looked up in astonishment and saw  outside  a tremendous wall of milky light  its boundaries invisible .      the ear drum   said michaels .   on the other side  the outside world .      an almost unbearably poignant homesickness pulled at grant .  he had almost forgotten that there was an outside world .  it seemed to him at that moment that all his life he had been travelling endlessly through a nightmare world of tubes and monsters  a flying dutchman of the circulatory system  .  .  .     but there it was  the light of the outside world  filtering through the ear drum .     michaels said  bending over the chart   you ordered me back into the ship from the hair cells  didn t you  grant .       yes  i did  michaels .  i wanted you on the ship  not at the hair cells .       you tell that to duval .  his attitude           why worry .  his attitude is always unpleasant  isn t it .       this time  he was insulting .  i don t pretend to be a hero  .   .   .       i ll bear witness on your behalf .       thank you  grant .  and and keep an eye on duval .      grant laughed .   of course .      duval approached  almost as though he realized he was being discussed and said  brusquely   where are we  michaels .      michaels looked at him with a bitter expression and said   we re about to enter the sub arachnid cavity .   right at the base of the brain   he added  in grant s direction .      okay .  suppose we go in past the oculomotor nerve .       all right   said michaels .   if that will give you the most favorable shot at the clot  that s how we ll go in .      grant backed away  and bent his head to get into the storage room where cora was lying on a cot .     she made as though to get up  but he lifted his hand .   don t .  stay there .   and he sat on the floor beside her  knees up and enclosed in his arms .  he smiled at her .     she said   i m all right now .  i m just malingering  lying here .       why not .  you re the most beautiful malingerer i ve ever seen .  let s malinger together for a minute  if you don t think that sounds too improper .      she smiled in her turn .   it would be difficult for me to complain that you were too forward .  after all  you seem to make a career of saving my life .       all part of a shrewd and extraordinarily subtle campaign to place you under an obligation to me .       i am .  most decidedly .       i ll remind you of that at the proper time .       please do .   but grant  really  thank you .       i like your thanking me  but it s my job .  that s why i was sent along .  remember .  i make decisions on policy and i take care of emergencies .       but that s not all  is it .       it s quite enough   protested grant .   i plug snorkels into lungs  pull seaweed out of intakes and most of all i hold on to beautiful women .       but that s not all  is it .  you re here to keep an eye on dr .  duval  aren t you .       why do you say that .       because it s true .  the higher echelons at the cmdf don t trust dr .  duval .  they never have .       why is that .       because he is a dedicated man  completely innocent and completely involved .  he offends others not because he wants to  but because he honestly doesn t know he s offensive .  he doesn t know that anything exists beside his work         not even beautiful assistants .      cora flushed .   i suppose not even assistants .  but he values my work  he really does .       he d keep right on valuing your work  wouldn t he  if someone else valued you .      cora looked away  then went on firmly   but he s not disloyal .  one trouble is he favors free exchange of information with the other side and says so because he doesn t know how to keep his views unobtrusive .  then  when others disagree with him he tells them how foolish he thinks they are .      grant nodded .   yes  i can imagine .  and that makes everybody love him because people just adore being told how foolish they are .       well  that s the way he is .       look .  don t sit there and worry .  i don t mistrust duval  any more than i do anyone else .       michaels does .       i know that .  michaels has moments where he mistrusts everyone  both in this ship and outside .  he even mistrusts me .  but i assure you i give that only the weight i think it deserves .      cora looked anxious .   you mean michaels thinks i deliberately damaged the laser .  that dr .  duval and i together  .   .   .       i think he thinks of that as a possibility .       and you  grant .       i think of it as a possibility  too .       but do you believe it .       it is a possibility  cora .  among many possibilities .  some possibilities are better than others .  let me worry about that end of it .      before she could answer  both heard duval s voice raised anger   no  no  no .  it s out of the question  michaels .  won t have a jackass tell me what to do .       jackass .  shall i tell you what you are  you  .  .  .      grant was out front  cora directly behind him .  grant said   hold it  both of you .  what s up .      duval turned and said  fuming .   i have the laser back in order .  the wire is shaved to the proper size  its joined to the transistor  and it s back in place .  i ve just told that to this jackass here  .   .   .   he turned his face toward michaels and snapped out   jackass  i said   then went on   because he asked me about it .       well  good   said grant .   what s wrong with that .      michaels said  heatedly   because the mere fact of his saying so doesn t make it so .  he s put some things together .  i can do that much .  anyone can .  how does he know it will work .       because i know .  i ve worked with lasers for twelve ears .  i know when they work .       well  then  show us  doctor .  let us share your knowledge .  use it .       no .  either it works or it doesn t work .  if it doesn t work  i can t fix it under any circumstances because i ve done all i can and nothing further can be done .  that means we ll be worse off if i wait till we get to the clot to find out that  it doesn t work .  but if it works  and it will work  it remains jerry rigged .  i don t know how long it will last  a dozen blasts or so at most .  i want to save every one of those blasts or the clot .  i won t waste a single one of them here .  i won t have the mission fail because i tested the laser even once .       i tell you  you ve got to test the laser   said michaels .   if you don t  then i swear  duval  that when we get back  i will have you thrown out of the cmdf so far and have you broken into so many small pieces  .  .  .       i ll worry about that when we get back .  meanwhile this is my laser and i do as i please with it .  you can t order me to do anything i don t wish to do  and neither can grant .      grant shook his head .   i m not ordering you to do anything  dr .  duval .      duval nodded briefly and turned away .     michaels looked after him .   i ll get him .       he makes sense in this case  michaels   said grant .   are you sure you re not annoyed with him for personal reasons .       because he calls me coward and jackass .  am i supposed to love him for that .  but whether i have personal animosity against him or not doesn t matter .  i think he s a traitor .      cora said  angrily   that s quite untrue .       i doubt   said michaels freezingly   that you re a reliable witness in this case .   but never mind .  we re getting to the clot and we ll see about duval then .       he ll clear that clot   said cora   if the laser works .       if it works   said michaels .   and if it does  i wouldn t be surprised if he kills benes .  and not by accident .        carter had his jacket off and his sleeves rolled up .  he was slumped in his chair on the base of his spine and a second cigar  freshly lit  was in his mouth .  he wasn t puffing .      in the brain .   he said .     reid s mustache seemed bedraggled at last .  he rubbed his eyes .   practically at the clot .  they ve stopped .      carter looked at the time recorder  which read   .     he felt used up  out of juice  out of adrenalin  out of tension  out of life .  he said   think they ll make it .      reid shook his head .   no  i don t .      in nine minutes  maybe ten  the men  ship and all  would be standing full size before them exploding benes  body  if they hadn t gotten out in time .     carter thought of what the newspapers would make of cmdf if this project failed .  he heard the speeches from every politician in the land  and from those on the other side .  how far would cmdf be set back .  how many months years would it take it to recover .     wearily  he began to write his letter of resignation in his mind .        we ve entered the brain itself   announced owens  with controlled excitement .     he doused ship s lights again and all of them looked forward in a moment of wonder that put everything else  even the climax of the mission  out of their minds for a moment .     duval murmured   how wonderful .  the supreme peak of creation .      grant  for the moment  felt that .  surely the human brain was the most intensely complicated object crowded into the smallest possible volume in all the universe .     there was a silence about their surroundings .  the cells they could see were jagged  uneven  with fibrous dendrites jutting out here and there  like a bramble bush .     as they drifted through the interstitial fluid along passageways between the cells  they could see the dendrites tangling overhead and for a moment they were passing under what seemed the twisted limbs of a row of ancient forest tress .     duval said   see  they don t touch .  you can see the synapses clearly  always that gap which must be jumped across chemically .      cora said   they seem to be full of lights .      michaels said  an edge of anger still in his voice   a mere illusion .  the reflection of miniaturized light plays tricks .  it bears no relation to reality .       how do you know .   demanded duval  at once .   this is an important field for study .  the reflection of miniaturized light is bound to vary subtly with the structure of the molecular contents of the cell .  this sort of reflection  i predict  will become a more powerful instrument for studying the micro details of the cell than any now existing .  it may well be that the techniques arising out of this mission of ours will be far more important than what happens to benes .       is that how you re excusing yourself  doctor .   asked michaels .     duval reddened .   explain that .       not now .   said grant  imperiously .   not one more word  gentlemen .      duval drew a deep breath and turned back to the window .     cora said   but anyway  do you see the lights .  watch up above .  watch that dendrite as it comes close .       i see it   said grant .  the usual glittering reflections did not  as had been generally true elsewhere in the body  sparkle from this point and that randomly  making the whole look like a dense cloud of fire flies .  instead  the sparkle chased itself along the dendrite  a new one beginning before the old one had completed its path .     owens said   you know what it looks like .  anyone ever see films of old fashioned advertising signs with electric lights .  with waves of light and dark moving along .       yes   said cora .   that s exactly what it s like .  but why .      duval said   a wave of depolarization sweeps along a nerve fiber when it is stimulated .  the ion concentrations change  sodium ion enters the cell .  this changes the charge intensity inside and out and lowers the electric potential .  somehow that must affect the reflection of miniaturized light which is exactly the point i was making and what we see is the wave of depolarization .      now that cora had pointed out the fact or perhaps because they were moving ever deeper into the brain  the moving wave of sparkles could be seen everywhere  moving along the cells  climbing and descending fibers  twisting into an unimaginably complex system which seemed  at first glance  without any form of order  and yet which gave the sense of order  anyway .      what we see   said duval   is the essence of humanity .  the cells are the physical brain  but those moving sparkles represent thought  the human mind .       is that the essence   said michaels  harshly .   i would have thought it was the soul .  where is the human soul  duval .       because i can t point it out  do you think it doesn t exist .   demanded duval .   where is benes   genius .  you are in his brain .  point to his genius .       enough .   said grant .     michaels called up to owens .   we re almost there .  cross over into the capillary at the indicated point .  just push through .      duval said thoughtfully   that s the awesome thing of it .  we re not just in the mind of a man .  this  all about us  is the mind of a scientific genius  someone i would put almost on a par with newton .      he was silent for a moment and then quoted       .  .  .  where the statue stood of newton with his prism and silent face .  the marble index of a mind  .   .   .      grant cut in  with an awed whisper       .  .  .  forever voyaging through strange seas of thought  alone .      both were silent for an instant  and grant said   do you think wordsworth ever thought of this  or could have  when he spoke of  strange seas of thought .   this is the literal sea of thought  isn t it .  and strange it is  too .      cora said   i didn t think of you as the poetic type  grant .      grant nodded .   all muscle  no mind .  that s me .       don t be offended .      michaels said   when you are done with mumbling poetry  gentlemen  look ahead .      he pointed .  they were in the blood stream again  but the red corpuscles  bluish in color  drifted without any definite motion  shuddering slightly in response to brownian motion  no more .  up ahead was a shadow .     a forest of dendrites could be seen through the transparent walls of the capillary  each strand  each twig with its line of sparkle moving along itself but more slowly now  and still more slowly .  and after a certain point  there were no more sparkles .     the proteus came to a halt .  for an instant or two  there was silence  then owens  said quietly   that s our destination  i think .      duval nodded .   yes .  the clot .        chapter      clot      duval said   notice how the nerve action ends at the clot .  that s visible evidence of nerve damage  possibly irreversible .  i wouldn t swear that we can help benes now  even if we remove the clot .       good thinking  doctor   said michaels sarcastically .   that excuses you  doesn t it .       shut up  michaels   said grant  coldly .     duval said   on with the swim suit  miss peterson .  this had got to be done right now .   and put it on inside out .  the antibodies are sensitized to its normal surface and there may be some about .      michaels smiled wearily .   don t trouble yourselves .  it s too late .   he pointed to the time recorder  which was just making the slow  slow change from   to   .     he said   you couldn t possibly perform the operation in time to allow us to get to the removal point in the jugular .  even if you succeed in the removal of the clot  we ll end by de miniaturizing right here and killing benes .       duval did not stop in his donning of the suit .  nor did cora .  duval said   well  then  he ll be no worse off than he will be if we don t operate .       no  but we will .  we ll get larger slowly at first .  it may take us a whole minute to reach a size that will attract the attention of a white blood cell .  there are millions of them around this site of injury .  we ll be engulfed .       so .       i doubt that either the proteus or we could withstand the physical strain placed upon us by the compression within a digestive vacuole inside a white cell .  not in our miniaturized state  and not after all the ship and we have already gone through .  we ll continue expanding  but when we are back to full size  it will be as a crushed ship and crushed human beings .   you had better leave here  owens  and make it as quickly as you can for the removal point .       hold it   interposed grant  angrily .   owens  how long will it take us to removal point .      owens said  faintly   two minutes .       that leaves us four minutes .  maybe more .  isn t it true that de miniaturization after sixty minutes is a conservative estimate .  couldn t we remain miniaturized for longer  if the field holds a little longer than expected .       maybe   said michaels  flatly   but don t kid yourself .  a minute longer .  two minutes at the outside .  we can t beat the uncertainty principle .       all right .  two minutes .  and mightn t it take longer to de miniaturize than we re counting on .      duval said   it might take a minute or two  if we re lucky .      owens put in .   it s because of the random nature of the basic structure of the universe .  with luck  if everything breaks our way          but only a minute or two   said michaels   at most .       all right   said grant   we ve got four minutes  plus maybe two minutes extra  plus maybe a minute of slow de miniaturization before we do damage to benes .  that s seven minutes of our long time distorted variety .  get going  duval .       all you ll succeed in doing  you crazy fool  is to get benes killed and us with him   yelled michaels .   owens  get us over to removal point .      owens hesitated .     grant moved quickly to the ladder and climbed up to owens  bubble .  he said quietly .   turn off the power  owens .  turn it off .      owens  finger moved to a switch  hovered over it .  grant s hand moved quickly to it and flicked it into the off position with a strenuous gesture .   now get down .  come on down .      he half pulled owens out of his seat  and both came down .  the whole had taken a few seconds and michaels had watched  open mouthed  too startled to move .      what the devil have you done .   he demanded .      the ship is staying right here   said grant   till the operation has succeeded .  now duval  get on with it .      duval said   get the laser  miss peterson .   both were in their swim suits now .  cora s looked sadly seamed and lumpy .     she said   i must be a rare sight .      michaels said   are you mad .  all of you .  there is no time .  all this is suicide .  listen to me   he was almost frothing with anxiety   you can t accomplish anything .      grant said   owens  operate the hatch for them .      michaels flung himself forward  but grant seized him  whirled him around  and said   don t make me hit you  dr .  michaels .  my muscles ache and i don t want to have to use them but if i hit  i will hit hard and  i promise you  i will break your jaw .      michaels lifted his fists almost as though he were ready to accept the challenge .  but duval and cora had disappeared into the hatch and michaels  watching them leave  became almost pleading .      listen  grant  don t you see what s happening .  duval will kill benes .  it will be so easy .  a slip of the laser and who will tell the difference .  if you do as i say  we can leave benes alive  get out and try again tomorrow .       he may not be alive tomorrow and we can t miniaturize for quite a while  someone said .       he might be alive tomorrow  he ll certainly be dead if you don t stop duval .  other people can be miniaturized  tomorrow  even if we can t .       in another ship .  nothing but the proteus can manage  or is available .      michaels became shrill .   grant  i tell you duval is an enemy agent .       i don t believe that   said grant .      why  because he s so religious .  because he s so full of pious platitudes .  isn t that just the disguise he d choose .  or have you been influenced by his mistress  his .  .  .      grant said   don t finish that sentence  michaels .  now  listen .  there s no evidence that he s an enemy agent  and there s no reason for me to believe that .       but i m telling you .  .  .       i know you are .  the fact is  though  i happen to believe that you are the enemy agent  dr .  michaels .      yes .  i have no real evidence for that either  nothing that could hold up in a law court  but once security is through with you  such evidence will be found  i think .      michaels pushed away from grant and stared at him with horror .   of course  i see now .  you are the agent  grant .  owens  don t you see .  there were a dozen times when we could have gotten out safely  when it was obvious that the mission couldn t succeed  and wouldn t .  he kept us in here every time .  that s why he worked so hard replenishing our air supply at the lung .  that s why  .  .  .  help me  owens .  help me .      owens stood irresolute .     grant said   the time recorder is about to move to   .  we now have three minutes more .  give me three minutes  owens .  you know that benes won t live unless we remove the clot in those three minutes .  i ll go out and help them and you keep michaels immobilized .  if i m not back by the reading of    get out of here and save the ship and yourself .  benes will die and maybe we will  too .  but you ll be safe and you can put the finger on michaels .      owens still said nothing .     grant said   three minutes .   and he began putting on his suit .  the time recorder said   .     owens said  finally   three minutes  then .  all right .  but only three minutes .      michaels sat down wearily .   you re letting them kill benes  owens  but i ve done what i could .  my conscience is clear .      grant worked his way through the hatch .       duval and cora swam quickly in the direction of the clot  he carrying the laser  she the power unit .     cora said   i don t see any white cells  do you .       i m not looking for them   said duval  brusquely .     he looked thoughtfully ahead .  the beam of the ship s headlight and their own smaller ones were weakened by the tangle of fibers that seemed to encase the clot just on the other side of the point at which the nerve impulses seemed to stop .  the wall of the arteriole had been abraded by the injury and was not entirely blocked by the clot which embraced the section of nerve fibers and cells tightly .      if we can break up the clot and relieve the pressure without touching the nerve itself   muttered duval   we will be doing well .  if we leave only a basic scab to keep the arteriole plugged   let s see now .      he maneuvered for position and raised the laser   and if this thing works .      cora said   dr .  duval  remember you said that the most economical stroke would be from above .       i remember exactly   said duval  grimly   and i intend to hit it precisely .      he pressed the laser trigger .  for the barest moment  a thin beam of coherent light flashed into being .   it works   cried cora  gladly .      this time   said duval   but it will have to work a number of times .      for a moment  the clot had stood out in relief against the unbearable brilliance of the laser beam and a line of small bubbles formed and marked out its path .  now the darkness was greater than before .     duval said   close one eye  miss peterson  so that its retina will not require resensitization .      again the laser beam and when it was over  cora closed her open eye and opened the closed one .  she said  excitedly   it s working  dr .  duval .  the glitter is progressing out of sight now .  a whole dark area is lighting up .      grant was swimming up to them .   how s it coming  duval .       not bad   said duval .   if i can cut it through transversely now and relieve the pressure on one key spot  i think the entire nerve pathway will be freed .      he swam to one side .     grant called after him   we have less than three minutes .       don t bother me   said duval .     cora said   it s all right  grant .  he ll do it .  did michaels make trouble .       some   said grant  grimly .   owens has him under guard .       under guard .       just in case  .   .   .        inside the proteus  owens cast quick glances outward .   i don t know what to do   he muttered .      just stand here and let the murderers work   said michaels  sarcastically .   you ll be held responsible for this  owens .      owens was silent .     michaels said   you can t believe i m an enemy agent     owens said   i m not believing anything .  let s wait for the two minute mark and if they re not back  we ll leave .  what s wrong with that .       all right   said michaels .     owens said   the laser is working .  i saw the flash .  and you know .  .  .       what .       the clot .  i can see the sparkle of the nerve action in that direction where it couldn t be seen before .       i don t   said michaels  peering outward .      i do   said owens .   i tell you  it s working .  and they ll be back .  it looks as though you were wrong  michaels .      michaels shrugged   all right  so much the better .  if i m wrong and if benes lives  i could ask for nothing more .  only   his voice grew tightly alarmed .   owens .       what .       there s something wrong with the escape hatch .  that darned fool grant must have been too excited to close it properly .  or was it excitement .       but what s wrong .  i don t see anything .       are you blind .  it s seeping fluid .  look at the seam .       it s been wet here since cora and grant got away from the antibodies .  don t you remember .      owens was  staring down at the hatch and michaels  hand  having closed around the screw driver grant had used to open the wireless panel  brought its handle down hard upon owens  head .     with a muffled exclamation  owens dropped to his knees  dazed .     michaels struck again in a fever of impatience and began jamming the limp figure into its swim suit .  perspiration stood out on his bald head in great drops .  opening the escape hatch  he thrust owens into it .  quickly  he let the hatch fill with water then opened the outer door by the panel controls  losing a precious moment searching for it .     ideally  he should now have flipped the ship to make certain that owens had been thrown clear  but there was no time .     no time  he thought  no time .     frantically  he leaped to the bubble and studied the controls .  something would have to be thrown to start the engine .  ah  there .  a thrill of triumph surged through him as he felt the distant drumming of the engines begin again .     he looked ahead toward the clot .  owens had been right .  a glitter of light was racing down the length of a long nerve process which until then had been dark .       duval was aiming the laser beam in short bursts now at quick intervals .     grant said   i think we ve just about had it  doctor .  time s gone .       i m just about done .  the clot has crumbled away .  just one portion .  ah  .  .  .  mr .  grant  the operation has been a success .       and we ve got maybe three minutes to get out  maybe two .  back to the ship  now  .  .  .      cora said   someone else is here .      grant veered  lunged toward the aimlessly swimming figure .   michaels .   he cried .  then   no  it s owens  what  .  .  .      owens said   i don t know .  he hit me  i think .  i don t know how i got out here .       where s michaels .       on the ship  i sup .  .  .      duval cried   the ship s motors have started .       what .   said owens  startled   who  .  .  .       michaels   said grant .   obviously he must be at the controls .       why did you leave the ship  grant .   demanded duval  angrily .      it s what i m asking myself now .  i had hoped owens  .  .  .       i m sorry   said owens   i didn t think he was really an enemy agent .  i couldn t tell  .  .  .      grant said   the trouble is i wasn t completely certain of it myself .  now  of course  .  .  .       an enemy agent .   said cora  with horror .     michaels voice sounded .   all of you  back off .  in two minutes  the white cells will have come and by that time  i ll be on the way out .  i m sorry  but you had your chance to come out with me .      the ship was angling high now  and making a large curve .      he s got it under full acceleration   said owens .      and   said grant   i think he s aiming at the nerve .       exactly what i m doing  grant   came michaels  voice  grimly .   rather dramatic  don t you think .  first  i ll ruin the work of that mouthing saint  duval  not so much for the sake of that alone as to do the kind of damage that will call a cohort of white cells to the scene at once .  they ll take care of you .      duval shouted   listen .  think .  why do this .  think of your country .       i m thinking of mankind   shouted back michaels  furiously .   the important thing is to keep the military out of the picture .  unlimited de miniaturization in their hands will destroy the earth .  if you fools can t see that  .  .  .      the proteus was now diving directly for the just relieved nerve process .     grant said desperately .   the laser .  let me have the laser .      he snatched at the instrument from duval  forcing it away .   where s the trigger .  never mind .  i ve got it .      he angled upward  trying to intercept the hurtling ship .   give me maximum power   he called to cora .      full power .      he took careful aim and a pencil wide beam of light emerged from the laser  and flickered out .     cora said   the laser gave out  grant .       here  then  you hold it .  i think i got the proteus  though .      it was hard to tell .  in the general dimness there was no way to see clearly .      you struck the rudder  i think   said owens .   you ve killed my ship .   behind his mask  his cheeks were suddenly wet .      whatever you struck   said duval   the ship doesn t seem to be handling very well .      the proteus was shaking now indeed  its headlight flashing up and down in a wide arc .     the ship pulled downward  crashed through the arteriole wall  missed the nerve by a hand s breath and lunged downward into a forest of dendrites  catching and breaking free and catching again  until it lay here  a bubble of metal  entangled in thick  smooth fibers .      he missed the nerve   said cora .      he did damage enough   growled duval .   that may  start a new clot or maybe not .  i hope not .  in any case the white cells will be here .  we had better leave .       where .   said owens .      if we follow the optic nerve  we can make it to the eye in a minute or less .  follow me .       we can t leave the ship   said grant .   it will de miniaturize .       well  we can t take it with us   said duval .   we have no choice but to try to save our own lives .       we can still do something  perhaps   insisted grant .   how much time do we have left .      duval said emphatically   none .  i think we re beginning to de miniaturize now .  in a minute or so we ll be large enough to attract the attention of a white cell .        de miniaturizing .  now .  i don t feel it .       you won t .  but the surroundings are slightly smaller than they ve been .  let s go .      duval took a quick view of his surroundings for orientation .   follow me   he said again  and began swimming away .     cora and owens followed and  after a last moment of hesitation  grant followed them .     he had failed .  in the last analysis  he had failed because  feeling not entirely convinced that michaels was an enemy on the basis of some uncertain reasoning  he had vacillated .     he would turn himself in  he thought bitterly  as a jackass unfit for his job .        but they re not moving   said carter  savagely .  they stay there at the clot .  why .  why .  why .      the time recorder read   .      it s too late for them to get out now   said reid .     a message came through from the electroencephalographic unit .   sir  eeg data indicates benes  brain action is being restored to normal .      carter yelled   then the operation is a success .  why are they staying behind .       we have no way of knowing .      the time recorder moved to   and a loud alarm went off .  its shrill jangle filled the entire room with the clang of doom and remained so .     reid raised his voice to be heard .   we ve got to take them out .       it will kill benes .       if  we don t take them out  that will kill benes  too .   carter said   if there s anyone outside the ship  we won t be able to get him out .      reid shrugged   we can t help that .  the white cells may get them or they may de miniaturize unharmed .       but benes will die .      reid leaned toward carter  and shouted   there s nothing to be done about that .  nothing .  benes is dead .  do you want to take a chance on killing five more uselessly .      carter seemed to .  shrink within himself .  he said   give the order .      reid went to the transmitter .   remove the proteus   he said quietly  then went on to the window overlooking the operating room .       michaels was only semi conscious at best when the proteus came to rest in the dendrites .  the sudden veering that had come after the bright flash of the laser it must have been the laser had thrown him against the panel with great force .  the only sensation he had from his right arm now was one of frightful pain .  it had to be broken .     he tried to look behind him  fighting off the haze of agony .  there was a tremendous cavity in the rear of the ship and viscous blood plasma bulged inward  held back partly by the pressure of the miniaturized air within the ship and partly by its own surface tension .     the air he had left would last him for the minute or two that would remain before de miniaturization .  already  even as he watched  it seemed to his dizzying senses that the dendrite cables had narrowed a bit .  they couldn t really be shrinking  so he had to be expanding very slowly just at first .     at full size  his arm could be taken care of .  the others would be killed by white cells and be done with .  he would say he would say something that would explain the broken ship .  and in any case  benes would be dead and indefinite miniaturization would die with him .  there would be peace   peace  .  .  .     he watched the dendrites while his body remained limply draped over the control panel .  could he move .  was he paralyzed .  was his back broken as well as his arm .     dully  he considered the possibility .  he felt his sense of comprehension and awareness slipping away as the dendrites became clouded over with a milky haze .     milky haze .     a white cell .     of course  it was a white cell .  the ship was  larger than the individuals out in the plasma  and it was the ship that was at the site of damage .  the ship would be the first to attract the attention of the white cell .     the window of the proteus was coated with sparkling milk .  milk invaded the plasma at the break in the ship s hull in the rear and struggled to break through the surface tension barrier .     the next to the last sound michaels heard was the hull of the proteus  fragile in its makeup of miniaturized atoms  strained to the breaking point with what it had already been through  cracking and splintering under the assault of the white cell .     the last sound he heard was his own laughter .       chapter      eye      cora saw the white cell at almost the time michaels did .      look   she cried in horror .     they stopped  turned to look back .     the white cell was tremendous .  it was five times as large in diameter as the proteus  perhaps larger  a mountain of milky  skinless  pulsing protoplasm in comparison to the individuals watching .     its large  lobed nucleus  a milky shadow within its substance seemed to be a malevolent  irregular eye  and the shape of the whole creature altered and changed with every moment .  a portion bulged toward the proteus .     grant started toward the proteus  almost as though by reflex action .     cora seized his arm .   what are you going to do  grant .      duval said  excitedly   there s no way to save him .  you ll be throwing away your life .      grant shook his head violently   it s not he i m thinking of .  it s the ship .      owens said  sadly   you can t save the ship  either .       but we might be able to get it out  where it can expand safely .   listen  even if it is crushed by the white cell  even if it is separated into atoms  each miniaturized atom will de miniaturize  it is de miniaturizing right now .  it doesn t matter whether benes is killed by an intact ship or by a pile of splinters .      cora said   you can t get the ship out .  oh  grant  don t die .  not after all this .  please .      grant smiled at her .   believe me  i have every reason not to die  cora .  you three keep on going .  let me make just one college try .      he swam back  heart beating in an almost unbearable revulsion at the monster he was approaching .  there were others behind it  farther off  but he wanted this one  the one that was engulfing the proteus  only this one .     at closer quarters  he could see its surface  a portion in profile showed clear  but within were granules and vacuoles  an intricate mechanism  too intricate for biologists to understand in detail even yet  and all crammed into a single microscopic blob of living matter .     the proteus was entirely within it now  a splintering dark shadow encased in a vacuole .  grant had thought that for a moment he had seen michaels  face in the bubble but that might have been only imagination .     grant was at the heaving mountainous surface now  but how was he to attract the attention of such a thing .  it had neither eyes nor sense  neither a mind nor purpose .     it was an automatic machine of protoplasm designed to respond in certain fashion to injury .     how .  grant didn t know .  yet a white cell could tell when a bacterium was in its vicinity .  in some cellular way  it knew .  it had known when the proteus was near it and it had reacted by engulfing it .     grant was far smaller than the proteus  far smaller than a bacterium  even now .  was he large enough to be noticed .     he had his knife out and sank it deeply into the material before him  slitting it downward .     nothing happened .  no gush of blood  for there is no blood in a white cell .     then  slowly  a bulging of the inner protoplasm appeared at the site of the ruptured membrane and that portion of the membrane drew away .     grant struck again .  he didn t want to kill it  he didn t think he could at his present size .  but was there some way of attracting its attention .     he drifted off and  with mounting excitement  noticed a bulge in the wall  a bulge pointing toward him .     he drifted further away and the bulge followed .     he had been noticed .  the manner of the noticing he could not say  but the white cell with everything it contained  with the proteus  was following .     he moved away faster now .  the white cell followed but  grant hoped fervently  not quickly .  grant had reasoned that it was not designed for speed  that it moved like an amoeba  bulging out a portion of its substance and then pouring itself into the bulge .  under ordinary conditions it fought with immobile objects  with bacteria and with foreign inanimate detritus .  its amoeboid motion was fast enough for that .     now it would have to deal with an object capable of darting away .      darting away quickly enough  grant hoped .      with gathering speed  he swam toward the others who were still delaying  still watching for him .     he gasped   get a move on .  i think it s following .       so are others   said duval  grimly .     grant looked about .  the distance was swarming with white cells .  what one had noticed  all had noticed .      how .  .  .      duval said   i saw you strike at the white cell .  if you damaged it  chemicals were released into the blood stream  chemicals that attracted white cells from all the neighboring regions .       then  for god s sake  swim .        the surgical team was gathered round benes  head  while carter and reid watched from above .  carter s mood of black depression was deepening by the moment .     it was over .  all for nothing .  all for nothing .  all for  .  .  .        general carter .  sir .   the sound was urgent  strident .  the man s voice was cracking with excitement .      yes .       the proteus  sir .  it s moving .      carter yelled .   stop surgery .      each member of the surgical team looked up in startled wonder .     reid plucked at carter s sleeve .   the motion may be the mere effect of the ship s slowly accelerating de miniaturization .  if you don t get them now  they will be in danger of the white cells .       what kind of motion .   shouted carter .   where s it heading .       along the optic nerve  sir .      carter turned fiercely on reid .   where does that go .  what does it mean .      reid s face lit up   it means an emergency exit i hadn t thought of .  they re heading for the eye and out through the lachrymal duct .  they may make it .  they might just get away with it  damaging one eye at most .  get a microscope slide  someone .  carter  let s get down there .        the optic nerve was a bundle of fibers  each like a string of sausages .     duval paused to place his hand on the junction between two of the  sausages .       a node of ranvier   he said  wonderingly   i m touching it .       don t keep on touching it   gasped grant .   keep on swimming .      the white cells had to negotiate the close packed network and did it less easily than the swimmers could .  they had squeezed out into the interstitial fluid and were bulging through the spaces between the close knit nerve fibers .     grant watched anxiously to make sure that the white cell was still in pursuit .  the one with the proteus in it .  he could not make out the proteus any longer .  if it existed in the white cell nearest  it had been transferred so deep into its substance that it was no longer visible .  if the white cell behind was not the white cell  then benes might be killed despite everything .     the nerves sparked wherever the beam from the helmet lights struck and the sparkles moved backward in rapid progression .      light impulses   muttered duval .   genes  eyes aren t entirely closed .      owens said   everything s definitely getting smaller .  do you notice that .      grant nodded .   i sure do .   the white cell was only half the monster it had been only moments before  if that .   we only have seconds to go   said duval .     cora said  i can t keep up .      grant veered toward her .   sure you can .  we re in the eye now .  we re only the width of a tear drop from safety .   he put his arms around her waist  pushing her forward  then took the laser and its power unit from her .     duval said .   through here and we ll be in the lachrymal duct .      they were large enough almost to fill the interstitial space through which they were swimming .  as they grew  their speed had increased and the white cells grew less fearsome .     duval kicked open the membranous wall be had come up against .   get through   he said   miss peterson  you first .      grant pushed her through  and followed her .  then owens and finally duval .      we re out   said duval with a controlled excitement .   we re out of the body .       wait   said grant .   i want that white cell out  too .  otherwise  .   .   .      he waited a moment  then let out a shout of excitement .   there it is .  and  by heaven  it s the right one .      the white cell oozed through the opening that duval s boot had made  but with difficulty .  the proteus  or the shattered splinters of it  could be seen clearly through its substance .  it had expanded until it was nearly half the size of the white cell and the poor monster was finding itself with an unexpected attack of indigestion .     it struggled on gamely  however .  once it had been stimulated to follow  it could do nothing else .     the three men and a woman drifted upward in a well of rising fluid .  the white cell  barely moving  drifted up with them .     the smooth curved wall at one side was transparent .  it was transparent not in the fashion of the thin capillary wall  but truly transparent .  there were no signs of cell membranes of nuclei .     duval said   this is the cornea .  the other wall is the lower eyelid .  we ve got to get far enough away to deminiaturize fully without hurting benes  and we only have seconds to do it in .      up above  many feet above  on their still tiny scale  was a horizontal crack .      through there   said duval .        the ship s on the surface of the eye   came the triumphant shout .      all right   said reid .   right eye .      a technician leaned close with the microscope slide at benes  closed eye .  a magnifying lens was in place .  slowly  with a felted clamp  the lower eyelid was gently pinched and pulled down .      it s there   .  said the technician in hushed tones .   like a speck of dirt .      skillfully  he placed the slide to the eye and a tear drop with the speck in it squeezed on to it .     everyone backed away .     reid said   something that is large enough to see is going to get much larger very quickly .  scatter .      the technician  torn between hurry and the necessity for gentleness  placed the slide down on the floor of the room   then backed away at a quick trot .     the nurses wheeled the operating table quickly through the large double door and with a startlingly accelerated speed  the specks on the slide grew to full size .     three men  a woman  and a heap of metal fragments  rounded and eroded  were present where none had been a moment before .     reid muttered   eight seconds to spare .      but carter said   where s michaels .  if michaels is still in benes  .   .   .   he started after the vanished operating table with the consciousness of defeat once again filling him .     grant pulled off his helmet and waved him back .   it s all right  general .  that s what s left of the proteus and somewhere in it you ll find whatever s left of michaels .  maybe just an organic jelly with some fragments of bones .        grant still hadn t grown used to the world as it was .  he had slept  with a few breaks  for fifteen hours  and he woke in wonder at a world of light and space .     he had breakfast in bed  with carter and reid at his bedside  smiling .     grant said  are the rest getting this treatment  too .      carter said   everything that money can buy for a while  anyway .  owens is the only one we ve let go .  he wanted to be with his wife and kids and we turned him loose  but only after he gave us a quick description of what happened .   apparently  grant  the mission s success was more to your credit than to anyone s .       if you want to go by a few items  maybe   said grant .   if you want to recommend me for a medal and a promotion  i ll accept .  if you want to recommend me for a year s vacation with pay  i ll accept them even more quickly .  actually  though  the mission would have been a failure without any one of us .  even michaels guided us efficiently enough for the most part .       michaels   said carter  thoughtfully .   that bit about him  you know  isn t for publication .  the official story is that he died in the line of duty .  it wouldn t do any good to have it known that a traitor had infiltrated the cmdf .  and i don t know that he was a traitor at that .      reid said   i knew him well enough to be able to say that he wasn t .  not in the usual sense of the word .      grant nodded .   i agree .  he wasn t a story book villain .  he took time to put a swim suit on owens before pushing him out of the ship .  he was content to have the white cells kill owens  but he couldn t do the job himself .  no i think he really wanted to keep indefinite miniaturization a secret for  as he saw it  the good of humanity .      reid said   he was all for peaceful uses of miniaturization .  so am i .  but what good would it do to  .  .  .       carter interrupted .   you re dealing with a mind that grew irrational under pressure .  look  we ve had this sort of thing since the invention of the atomic bomb .  there are always people who think that if some new discovery with frightful implications is suppressed  all will be well .  except that you can t suppress a discovery whose time has come .  if benes had died  indefinite miniaturization would still have been discovered next year  or five years from now  or ten .  only then  they might have had it first .       and now we will have it first   said grant   and what do we do with it .  end in the final war .  maybe michaels was right .      carter said  dryly   and maybe the common sense of humanity will prevail on both sides .  it has so far .      reid said   especially since  once this story gets out  and the news media spread the tale of the fantastic voyage of the proteus  the peaceful uses of miniaturization will he dramatized to the point where we can all fight military domination of the technique .  and perhaps successfully .      carter  taking out a cigar  looked grim and did not answer directly .  he said   tell me  grant  how did you catch on to michaels .       i didn t really   said grant .   it was all the result of a confused mass of thinking .  in the first place  general  you put me on board ship because you suspected duval .       oh  now wait  .   .   .       everyone on the ship knew you had done so .  except duval  perhaps .  that gave me a headstart in the wrong direction .  however  you were clearly not sure of your ground  for you didn t warn me of anything  so i wasn t inclined to go off half cocked myself .  those were high powered people on board ship and i knew that if i grabbed someone and turned out to be mistaken  you would back off and let me take the rap .      reid smiled gently  and carter flushed and grew very interested in his cigar .     grant said   no hard   feelings  of course .  it s part of my job to take the rap   but only if i have to .  so i waited until i was sure  and i was never really sure .      we were plagued with a series of accidents  or what might possibly have been accidents .  for instance  the laser was damaged and there was the chance that miss peterson had damaged it .  but why in so clumsy a fashion .  she knew a dozen ways of gimmicking the laser so that it would seem perfectly all right and yet not work properly .  she could have arranged it so that duval s aim would be off just enough to make it inevitable that he kill the nerve  or perhaps even benes .  a crudely damaged laser was either an accident  then  or the deliberate work of someone other than miss peterson .      then  too  my lifeline came loose in the lungs and i nearly died as a result .  duval was the logical suspect there  but it was he who suggested that the ship s headlight be shone into the gap  and that saved me .  why try to kill me and then act to save me .  it doesn t make sense .  either that was an accident  too  or my lifeline had been loosened by someone other than duval .      we lost our air supply  and owens might have arranged that little disaster .  but then when we pulled in more air  owens improvised an air miniaturization device that seemed to  do miracles .  he could easily not have done so and no one of us would have been able to accuse him of sabotage .  why bother to lose our air and then work like the devil to gain it back .  either that was an accident  too  or the air supply had been sabotaged by someone other than owens .      i could omit myself from consideration  since i knew that i wasn t engaged in sabotage .  that left michaels .       carter said   you reasoned that he had been responsible for all those accidents .       no  they might still have been accidents .  we ll never know .  but if it were sabotage then michaels was far and away the most likely candidate for he was the only one who was not involved in a last minute rescue  or who might be expected to have performed a more subtle piece of sabotage .  so now let s consider michaels .      the first accident was the encounter with the arterio venous fistula .  either that was an honest misfortune or michaels had guided us into it deliberately .  if this was sabotage  then unlike all the other cases  only one culprit was conceivable  only one   michaels .  he admitted as much himself at one point .  only he could possibly have guided us into it  only he could possibly know benes  circulatory system well enough to spot a microscopic fistula  and it was he who directed the exact spot of insertion into the artery in the first place .      reid said   it might still have been a misfortune  an honest error .       true .  but whereas in all the other accidents  those who were involved as possible suspects did their best to pull us through  michaels  after we had emerged into the venous system  argued hard for immediate abandonment of the mission .  he did the same at every other crisis .  he was the only one to do so consistently .  and yet that wasn t the real giveaway as far as i was concerned .       well  then  what was the giveaway .   asked carter .      when the mission first started and we were miniaturized and inserted into the carotid artery  i was scared .  we were all a little uneasy  to say the least  but michaels was the most frightened of all .  he was almost paralyzed with fear .  i accepted that at the time .  i saw no disgrace in it .  as i said  i was pretty frightened myself  and in fact  i was glad of the company .  but  .  .  .        but .       but after we had gotten through the arterio venous fistula  michaels never showed any trace of fear again .  at times when the rest of us were nervous  he was not .  he had become a rock .  in fact  at the start  he had given me plenty of statements on what a coward he was to explain his obvious fear but toward the end of the voyage  he was offended almost to frenzy when duval implied he wits a coward .  that change in attitude got to seeming queerer and queerer to me .      it seemed to me there had to be a special reason for his initial fear .  as long as he faced dangers with the rest of us  he was a brave man .  perhaps  then  it was when he faced a danger the rest of us did not share that he was afraid .  the inability to share the risk  the necessity to face death alone  was what turned him coward .      at the start  after all  the rest of us were frightened of the mere act of being miniaturized but that was carried through safely .  after that  we all expected to move toward the clot  operate on it and get out  taking ten minutes perhaps  all told .      but michaels must have been the only one of us who knew this was not going to happen .  he alone must have known there would be trouble and that we were about to rumble into a whirlpool .  owens had spoken about the ship s fragility at the briefing and michaels must have expected death .  he alone must have expected death .  no wonder he nearly broke down .      when we got through the fistula in one piece  he was almost delirious with relief .  after that  he felt certain that we would not be able to complete the mission and he relaxed .  with each successful surmounting of some crisis  he grew angrier .  he had no more room for fear  only for anger .      by the time we were in the ear  i had made up my mind that michaels  not duval  was our man .  i wouldn t let him badger duval into trying the laser beforehand .  i ordered him away from miss peterson when i was trying to get her away from the antibodies .  but then in the end  i made a mistake .  i didn t stay with him during the actual operation and thus gave him his chance to seize the ship .  there was this last little shred of doubt in my mind  .  .  .       that perhaps it was duval after all .   said carter .      i m afraid so .  so i went out to watch the operation when i could have done nothing about it even if duval were a traitor .  if it hadn t been for that final piece of stupidity  i might have brought the ship back intact  and michaels alive .       well   carter got to his feet   it was cheap at the price .  benes is alive and slowly recovering .  i m not sure that owens thinks so  though .  he s in mourning for his ship .       i don t blame him   said grant   it was a sweet vessel .  uh listen  where s miss peterson  do you know .      reid said   up and around .  she had more stamina than you had  apparently .       i mean  is she here at the cmdf anywhere .       yes .  in duval s office  i imagine .       oh   said grant  suddenly deflated .   well  i ll wash and shave and get out of here .        cora put the papers together .   well  then  dr .  duval  if the report can wait over the weekend  i would appreciate the time off .       yes  certainly   said duval .   i think we could all use some time off .  how do you feel .       i seem to be all right .       it s been an experience  hasn t it .      cora smiled and walked toward the door .     the corner of grant s head pushed past it .   miss peterson .      cora started violently  recognized grant  and came running to him  smiling .   it was cora in the blood stream .    is it still cora .       of course .  it always will be  i hope .      grant hesitated .   you might call me charles .  you might even get to the point someday where you can call me good old charlie .       i ll try  charles .       when do you quit work .       i ve just quit for the weekend .      grant thought a while  rubbed his clean shaven chin  then nodded toward duval  who was bent over his desk .   are you all tied up with him .   he asked at last .     cora said  gravely   i admire his work .  he admires my work .   and she shrugged .     grant said   may i admire you .      she hesitated  then smiled a little .   any time you want to .  as long as you want to .  if   if i can admire you occasionally  too .       let me know when and i ll strike a pose .      they laughed together .  duval looked up  saw them in the doorway  smiled faintly  and waved something that might have been either a greeting or a farewell .     cora said   i want to change into street clothes  and then i would like to see benes .  is that all right .       will they allow visitors .      cora shook her head .   no .  but we re special .        benes  eyes were open .  he tried to smile .     a nurse whispered anxiously .   only a minute  now .  he doesn t know what s happened  so don t say anything about it .       i understand   said grant .     to benes  in a low voice  he said   how are you .      benes tried again to smile .   i m not sure .  very tired .     have a headache and my right eye hurts  but i seem to  have survived .       good .       it takes more than a knock on the head to kill a scientist   said benes .   all that mathematics makes the skull as hard as a rock  eh .       we re all glad of that   said cora  gently .      now i must remember what i came here to tell .  it s a little hazy  but it s coming back .  it s all in me  all of it .  and now he did smile .     and grant said   you d be surprised at what s in you  professor .      the nurse ushered them out and grant and cora left  hand in warm hand  into a world that suddenly seemed to hold no terrors for them  but only the prospect of great joy .       the end
