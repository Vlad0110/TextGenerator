about the publisher      chapter        a clang well done      some things start before other things .   it was a summer shower but didn   t appear to know it  and it was pouring rain as fast as a winter storm .   miss perspicacia tick sat in what little shelter a raggedy hedge could give her and explored the universe .  she didn   t notice the rain .  witches dried out quickly .   the exploring of the universe was being done with a couple of twigs tied together with string  a stone with a hole in it  an egg  one of miss tick   s stockings  which also had a hole in it   a pin  a piece of paper  and a tiny stub of pencil .  unlike wizards  witches learn to make do with a little .   the items had been tied and twisted together to make a   device .  it moved oddly when she prodded it .  one of the sticks seemed to pass right through the egg  for example  and came out the other side without leaving a mark .      yes     she said quietly  as rain poured off the rim of her hat .     there it is .  a definite ripple in the walls of the world .  very worrying .  there   s probably another world making contact .  that   s never good .  i ought to go there .  but   according to my left elbow  there   s a witch there already .         she   ll sort it out  then     said a small and  for now  mysterious voice from somewhere near her feet .      no  it can   t be right .  that   s chalk country over that way     said miss tick .     you can   t grow a good witch on chalk .  the stuff   s barely harder than clay .  you need good hard rock to grow a witch  believe me .     miss tick shook her head  sending raindrops flying .     but my elbows are generally very reliable .          why talk about it .  let   s go and see     said the voice .     we   re not doing very well around here  are we .      that was true .  the lowlands weren   t good to witches .  miss tick was making pennies by doing bits of medicine and misfortune telling    and slept in barns most nights .  she   d twice been thrown into ponds .      i can   t barge in     she said .     not on another witch   s territory .  that never  ever works .  but       she paused .     witches don   t just turn up out of nowhere .  let   s have a look    .      she pulled a cracked saucer out of her pocket and tipped into it the rainwater that had collected on her hat .  then she took a bottle of ink out of another pocket and poured in just enough to turn the water black .   she cupped it in her hands to keep the raindrops out and listened to her eyes .       tiffany aching was lying on her stomach by the river  tickling trout .  she liked to hear them laugh .  it came up in bubbles .   a little way away  where the riverbank became a sort of pebble beach  her brother  wentworth  was messing around with a stick  and almost certainly making himself sticky .   anything could make wentworth sticky .  washed and dried and left in the middle of a clean floor for five minutes  wentworth would be sticky .  it didn   t seem to come from anywhere .  he just got sticky .  but he was an easy child to mind  provided you stopped him from eating frogs .   there was a small part of tiffany   s brain that wasn   t too certain about the name tiffany .  she was nine years old and felt that tiffany was going to be a hard name to live up to .  besides  she   d decided only last week that she wanted to be a witch when she grew up  and she was certain tiffany just wouldn   t work .  people would laugh .   another and larger part of tiffany   s brain was thinking of the word susurrus .  it was a word that not many people have thought about  ever .  as her fingers rubbed the trout under its chin  she rolled the word round and round in her head .   susurrus   according to her grandmother   s dictionary  it meant    a low soft sound  as of whispering or muttering .     tiffany liked the taste of the word .  it made her think of mysterious people in long cloaks whispering important secrets behind a door  susurruss susurrusss     she   d read the dictionary all the way through .  no one told her you weren   t supposed to .   as she thought this  she realized that the happy trout had swum away .  but something else was in the water  only a few inches from her face .   it was a round basket  no bigger than half a coconut shell  coated with something to block up the holes and make it float .  a little man  only six inches high  was standing up in it .  he had a mass of untidy red hair into which a few feathers  beads  and bits of cloth had been woven .  he had a red beard  which was pretty much as bad as the hair .  the rest of him that wasn   t covered with blue tattoos was covered with a tiny kilt .  and he was waving a fist at her and shouting      crivens .  gang awa    oot o    here  ye daft wee hinny .     ware the green heid .      with that he pulled at a piece of string that was hanging over the side of his boat  and a second red headed man surfaced  gulping air .      nae time for fishin    .     said the first man  hauling him aboard .     the green heid   s coming .         crivens .     said the swimmer  water pouring off him .     let   s offski .      and with that he grabbed one very small oar and  with rapid back and forth movements  made the basket speed away .      excuse me .     tiffany shouted .     are you fairies .      but there was no answer .  the little round boat had disappeared in the reeds .   probably not  tiffany decided .   then  to her dark delight  there was a susurrus .  there was no wind  but the leaves on the alder bushes by the riverbank began to shake and rustle .  so did the reeds .  they didn   t bend  they just blurred .  everything blurred  as if something had picked up the world and was shaking it .  the air fizzed .  people whispered behind closed doors    .   the water began to bubble  just under the bank .  it wasn   t very deep here   it would only have reached tiffany   s knees if she   d waded   but it was suddenly darker and greener and  somehow  much deeper    .   she stood and took a couple of steps backward just before long skinny arms fountained out of the water and clawed madly at the bank where she had been .  for a moment she saw a thin face with long sharp teeth  huge round eyes  and dripping green hair like waterweed  and then the thing plunged back into the depths .   by the time the water closed over it  tiffany was already running along the bank to the little beach where wentworth was making frog pies .  she snatched up the child just as a stream of bubbles came around the curve in the bank .  once again the water boiled  the green haired creature shot up  and the long arms clawed at the mud .  then it screamed and dropped back into the water .      i wanna go a toy lut .     screamed wentworth .   tiffany ignored him .  she was watching the river with a thoughtful expression .   i   m not scared at all  she thought .  how strange .  i ought to be scared  but i   m just angry .  i mean  i can feel the scared  like a red hot ball  but the angry isn   t letting it out    .      wenny wanna wanna wanna go a toy lut .     wentworth shrieked .      go on  then     said tiffany absentmindedly .  the ripples were still sloshing against the bank .   there was no point in telling anyone about this .  everyone would just say     what an imagination the child has     if they were feeling in a good mood  or     don   t tell stories .     if they weren   t .   she was still very angry .  how dare a monster turn up in the river .  especially one so   so   ridiculous .  who did it think she was .   this is tiffany  walking back home .  start with the boots .  they are big and heavy boots  much repaired by her father  and they belonged to various sisters before her  she wears several pairs of socks to keep them on .  they are big .  tiffany sometimes feels she is nothing more than a way of moving boots around .   then there is the dress .  it has been owned by many sisters as well and has been taken up  taken out  taken down  and taken in by her mother so many times that it really ought to have been taken away .  but tiffany rather likes it .  it comes down to her ankles and  whatever color it had been to start with  is now a milky blue that is  incidentally  exactly the same color as the butterflies skittering beside the path .   then there is tiffany   s face .  light pink  with brown eyes  and brown hair .  nothing special .  her head might strike anyone watching   in a saucer of black water  for example   as being just slightly too big for the rest of her  but perhaps she   ll grow into it .   and then go farther up  and farther  until the track becomes a ribbon and tiffany and her brother two little dots  and there is her country .   they call it the chalk .  green downlands roll under the hot midsummer sun .  from up here the flocks of sheep  moving slowly  drift over the short turf like clouds on a green sky .  here and there sheepdogs speed over the grass like shooting stars .   and then  as the eyes pull back  it is a long green mound  lying like a great whale on the world        surrounded by the inky rainwater in the saucer .       miss tick looked up .      that little creature in the boat was a nac mac feegle .     she said .     the most feared of all the fairy races .  even trolls run away from the wee free men .  and one of them warned her .         she   s the witch  then  is she .     said the voice .      at that age .  impossible .     said miss tick .     there   s been no one to teach her .  there   re no witches on the chalk .  it   s too soft .  and yet   she wasn   t scared    .      the rain had stopped .  miss tick looked up at the chalk  rising above the low  wrung out clouds .  it was about five miles away .      this child needs watching     she said .     but chalk   s too soft to grow a witch on    .          only the mountains were higher than the chalk .  they stood sharp and purple and gray  streaming long trails of snow from their tops even in summer .     brides o    the sky     granny aching had called them once  and it was so rare that she ever said anything at all  let alone anything that didn   t have to do with sheep  that tiffany had remembered it .  besides  it was exactly right .  that   s what the mountains looked like in the winter  when they were all in white and the snow streams blew like veils .   granny used old words and came out with odd  old sayings .  she didn   t call the downland the chalk  she called it    the wold .     up on the wold the wind blows cold  tiffany had thought  and the word had stuck that way .   she arrived at the farm .   people tended to leave tiffany alone .  there was nothing particularly cruel or unpleasant about this  but the farm was big and everyone had their jobs to do  and she did hers very well and so she became  in a way  invisible .  she was the dairymaid  and good at it .  she made better butter than her mother did  and people commented about how good she was with cheese .  it was a talent .  sometimes  when the wandering teachers came to the village  she went and got a bit of education .  but mostly she worked in the dairy  which was dark and cool .  she enjoyed it .  it meant she was doing something for the farm .   it was actually called the home farm .  her father rented it from the baron  who owned the land  but there had been achings farming it for hundreds of years and so  her father said  quietly  sometimes  after he   d had a beer in the evenings   as far as the land knew  it was owned by the achings .  tiffany   s mother used to tell him not to speak like that  although the baron was always very respectful to mr .  aching since granny had died two years ago  calling him the finest shepherd in these hills  and was generally held by the people in the village to be not too bad these days .  it paid to be respectful  said tiffany   s mother  and the poor man had sorrows of his own .   but sometimes her father insisted that there had been achings  or akins  or archens  or akens  or akenns   spelling had been optional  mentioned in old documents about the area for hundreds and hundreds of years .  they had these hills in their bones  he said  and they   d always been shepherds .   tiffany felt quite proud of this  in an odd way  because it might also be nice to be proud of the fact that your ancestors moved around a bit  too  or occasionally tried new things .  but you   ve got to be proud of something .  and for as long as she could remember  she   d heard her father  an otherwise quiet  slow man  make the joke  the one that must have been handed down from aching to aching for hundreds of years .   he   d say     another day of work and i   m still aching     or    i get up aching and i go to bed aching     or even    i   m aching all over .     they weren   t particularly funny after about the third time  but she   d miss it if he didn   t say at least one of them every week .  they didn   t have to be funny   they were father jokes .  anyway  however they were spelled  all her ancestors had been aching to stay  not aching to leave .   there was no one around in the kitchen .  her mother had probably gone up to the shearing pens with a bite of lunch for the men  who were shearing this week .  her sisters hannah and fastidia were up there too  rolling fleeces and paying attention to some of the younger men .  they were always quite eager to work during shearing .   near the big black stove was the shelf that was still called granny aching   s library by her mother  who liked the idea of having a library .  everyone else called it granny   s shelf .   it was a small shelf  since the books were wedged between a jar of crystallized ginger and the china shepherdess that tiffany had won at a fair when she was six .   there were only five books if you didn   t include the big farm diary  which in tiffany   s view didn   t count as a real book because you had to write it yourself .  there was the dictionary .  there was the almanack  which got changed every year .  and next to that was diseases of the sheep  which was fat with the bookmarks that her grandmother had put there .   granny aching had been an expert on sheep  even though she called them    just bags of bones  eyeballs  and teeth  lookin    for new ways to die .     other shepherds would walk miles to get her to come and cure their beasts of ailments .  they said she had the touch  although she just said that the best medicine for sheep or man was a dose of turpentine  a good cussin     and a kick .  bits of paper with granny   s own recipes for sheep cures stuck out all over the book .  mostly they involved turpentine  but some included cussin    .   next to the book on sheep was a thin little volume called flowers of the chalk .  the turf of the downs was full of tiny  intricate flowers  like cowslips and harebells  and even smaller ones that somehow survived the grazing .  on the chalk flowers had to be tough and cunning to survive the sheep and the winter blizzards .   someone had colored in the flowers a long time ago .  on the flyleaf of the book was written in neat handwriting sarah grizzel  which had been granny   s name before she was married .  she had probably thought that aching was at least better than grizzel .   and finally there was the goode childe   s booke of faerie tales  so old that it belonged to an age when there were far more e   s around .   tiffany stood on a chair and took it down .  she turned the pages until she found the one she was looking for and stared at it for a while .  then she put the book back  replaced the chair  and opened the crockery cupboard .   she found a soup plate  went over to a drawer  took out the tape measure her mother used for dressmaking  and measured the plate .      hmm     she said .     eight inches .  why didn   t they just say .      she unhooked the largest frying pan  the one that could cook breakfast for half a dozen people all at once  and took some candies from the jar on the dresser and put them in an old paper bag .  then  to wentworth   s sullen bewilderment  she took him by a sticky hand and headed back down toward the stream .   things still looked very normal down there  but she was not going to let that fool her .  all the trout had fled  and the birds weren   t singing .   she found a place on the riverbank with the right sized bush .  then she found a stone and hammered a piece of wood into the ground as hard as she could  close to the edge of the water  and tied the bag of sweets to it .  tiffany was the kind of child who always carried a piece of string .      candy  wentworth     she shouted .   she gripped the frying pan and stepped smartly behind the bush .   wentworth trotted over to the sweets and tried to pick up the bag .  it wouldn   t move .      i wanna go a toy lut .     he yelled  because it was a threat that usually worked .  his fat fingers scrabbled at the knots .   tiffany watched the water carefully .  was it getting darker .  was it getting greener .  was that just waterweed down there .  were those bubbles just a trout  laughing .   no .   she ran out of her hiding place with the frying pan swinging like a bat .  the screaming monster  leaping out of the water  met the frying pan coming the other way with a clang .   it was a good clang  with the oiyoiyoioioioioioinnnnnggggggg that is the mark of a clang well done .   the creature hung there for a moment  a few teeth and bits of green weed splashing into the water  then slid down slowly and sank with some massive bubbles .   the water cleared and was once again the same old river  shallow and icy cold and floored with pebbles .      wanna wanna sweeties .     screamed wentworth  who never noticed anything else in the presence of sweets .   tiffany undid the string and gave them to him .  he ate them far too quickly  as he always did with sweets .  she waited until he was sick  then went back home in a thoughtful state of mind .   in the reeds  quite low down  small voices whispered      crivens  wee bobby  did yer no    see that .         aye .  we   d better offski an    tell the big man we   ve found the hag .          miss tick was running up the dusty road .  witches don   t like to be seen running .  it looks unprofessional .  it   s also not done to be seen carrying things  and she had her tent on her back .   she was also trailing clouds of steam .  witches dry out from the inside .      it had all those teeth .     said the mystery voice  this time from her hat .      i know .     snapped miss tick .      and she just hauled off and hit it .         yes .  i know .         just like that .         yes .  very impressive     said miss tick .  she was getting out of breath .  besides  they were already on early slopes of the downs now  and she wasn   t good on chalk .  a wandering witch likes firm ground under her  not a rock so soft you could cut it with a knife .      impressive .     said the voice .     she used her brother as bait .         amazing  wasn   t it .     said miss tick .     such quick thinking   oh  no       she stopped running and leaned against a field wall as a wave of dizziness hit her .      what   s happening .  what   s happening .     said the voice from the hat .     i nearly fell off .         it   s this wretched chalk .  i can feel it already .  i can do magic on honest soil  and rock is always fine  and i   m not too bad on clay  even   but chalk   s neither one thing nor the other .  i   m very sensitive to geology  you know .         what are you trying to tell me .     said the voice .      chalk   is a hungry soil .  i don   t really have much power on chalk .      the owner of the voice  who was hidden  said     are you going to fall over .         no  no .  it   s just the magic that doesn   t work .      miss tick did not look like a witch .  most witches don   t  at least the ones who wander from place to place .  looking like a witch can be dangerous when you walk among the uneducated .  and for that reason she didn   t wear any occult jewelry  or have a glowing magical knife or a silver goblet with a pattern of skulls all around it  or carry a broomstick with sparks coming out of it  all of which are tiny hints that there may be a witch around .  her pockets never carried anything more magical than a few twigs  maybe a piece of string  a coin or two  and  of course  a lucky charm .   everyone in the country carried lucky charms  and miss tick had worked out that if you didn   t have one  people would suspect that you were a witch .  you had to be a bit cunning to be a witch .   miss tick did have a pointy hat  but it was a stealth hat and pointed only when she wanted it to .   the one thing in her bag that might have made anyone suspicious was a very small  grubby booklet entitled an introduction to escapology  by the great williamson .  if one of the risks of your job is being thrown into a pond with your hands tied together  then the ability to swim thirty yards underwater  fully clothed  plus the ability to lurk under the weeds breathing air through a hollow reed  count as nothing if you aren   t also amazingly good with knots .      you can   t do magic here .     said the voice in the hat .      no  i can   t     said miss tick .   she looked up at the sounds of jingling .  a strange procession was coming up the white road .  it was mostly made up of donkeys pulling small carts with brightly painted covers on them .  people walked alongside the carts  dusty to the waist .  they were all men  they wore bright robes   or robes  at least  that had been bright before being trailed through mud and dust for years   and every one of them wore a strange black square hat .   miss tick smiled .   they looked like tinkers  but there wasn   t one among them  she knew  who could mend a kettle .  what they did was sell invisible things .  and after they   d sold what they had  they still had it .  they sold what everyone needed but often didn   t want .  they sold the key to the universe to people who didn   t even know it was locked .      i can   t do     said miss tick  straightening up .     but i can teach .          tiffany worked for the rest of the morning in the dairy .  there was cheese that needed doing .   there was bread and jam for lunch .  her mother said     the teachers are coming to town today .  you can go  if you   ve done your chores .      tiffany agreed that  yes  there were one or two things she   d quite like to know more about .      then you can have half a dozen carrots and an egg .  i daresay they could do with an egg  poor things     said her mother .   tiffany took them with her after lunch and went to get an egg   s worth of education .   most boys in the village grew up to do the same jobs as their fathers or  at least  some other job somewhere in the village where someone   s father would teach them as they went along .  the girls were expected to grow up to be somebody   s wife .  they were also expected to be able to read and write  those being considered soft indoor jobs that were too fiddly for the boys .   however  everyone also felt that there were a few other things that even the boys ought to know  to stop them wasting time wondering about details like    what   s on the other side of the mountains .     and    how come rain falls out of the sky .      every family in the village bought a copy of the almanack every year  and a sort of education came from that .  it was big and thick and printed somewhere far off  and it had lots of details about things like phases of the moon and the right time to plant beans .  it also contained a few prophesies about the coming year  and mentioned faraway places with names like klatch and hersheba .  tiffany had seen a picture of klatch in the almanack .  it showed a camel standing in a desert .  she   d only found out what both those names were because her mother had told her .  and that was klatch  a camel in a desert .  she   d wondered if there wasn   t a bit more to it  but it seemed that    klatch   camel  desert    was all anyone knew .   and that was the trouble .  if you didn   t find some way of stopping it  people would go on asking questions .   the teachers were useful there .  bands of them wandered through the mountains  along with the tinkers  portable blacksmiths  miracle medicine men  cloth peddlers  fortune tellers  and all the other travelers who sold things the people didn   t need every day but occasionally found useful .   they went from village to village delivering short lessons on many subjects .  they kept apart from the other travelers and were quite mysterious in their ragged robes and strange square hats .  they used long words  like corrugated iron .  they lived rough lives  surviving on what food they could earn from giving lessons to anyone who would listen .  when no one would listen  they lived on baked hedgehog .  they went to sleep under the stars  which the math teachers would count  the astronomy teachers would measure  and the literature teachers would name .  the geography teachers got lost in the woods and fell into bear traps .   people were usually quite pleased to see them .  they taught children enough to shut them up  which was the main thing  after all .  but they always had to be driven out of the villages by nightfall in case they stole chickens .   today the brightly colored little booths and tents were pitched in a field just outside the village .  behind them small square areas had been fenced off with high canvas walls and were patrolled by apprentice teachers looking for anyone trying to overhear education without paying .   the first tent tiffany saw had a sign that read       jograffy .  jograffy .  jograffy .   for today only  all major land masses and oceans  plus everything you need to kno about glassiers .   one penny  or all major vejtables acsepted .       tiffany had read enough to know that  while he might be a whiz at major land masses  this particular teacher could have done with some help from the man running the stall next door       the wonders of punctuation and spelling    absolute certainty about the comma .     i before e completely sorted out .     the mystery of the semicolon revealed .  .  .     see the ampersand .   small extra charge     fun with brackets .      will accept vegetables  eggs  and clean used clothing         the next stall along was decorated with scenes out of history  generally of kings cutting one another   s heads off and similar interesting highlights .  the teacher in front was dressed in ragged red robes with rabbit skin trimmings and wore an old top hat with flags stuck in it .  he had a small megaphone that he aimed at tiffany .      the death of kings through the ages .     he said .     very educational  lots of blood .         not really     said tiffany .      oh  you   ve got to know where you   ve come from  miss     said the teacher .     otherwise how will you know where you   re going .         i come from a long line of aching people     said tiffany .     and i think i   m moving on .      she found what she was looking for at a booth hung with pictures of animals including  she was pleased to see  a camel .  the sign said       useful creatures   today  our friend the hedgehog .       she wondered how useful the thing in the river had been  but this looked like the only place to find out .  a few children were waiting on the benches inside the booth for the lesson to begin  but the teacher was still standing out in front  in the hope of filling up the empty spaces .      hello  little girl     he said  which was only his first big mistake .     i   m sure you want to know all about hedgehogs  eh .         i did this one last summer     said tiffany .   the man looked closer  and his grin faded .     oh  yes     he said .     i remember .  you asked all those   little questions .         i would like a question answered today     said tiffany .      provided it   s not the one about how you get baby hedgehogs     said the man .      no     said tiffany patiently .     it   s about zoology .         zoology  eh .  that   s a big word  isn   t it .         no  actually it isn   t     said tiffany .     patronizing is a big word .  zoology is really quite short .      the teacher   s eyes narrowed further .  children like tiffany were bad news .     i can see you   re a clever one     he said .     but i don   t know any teachers of zoology in these parts .  vetin   ry  yes  but not zoology .  any particular animal .         jenny green teeth .  a water dwelling monster with big teeth and claws and eyes like soup plates     said tiffany .      what size of soup plates .  do you mean big soup plates  a whole full portion bowl with maybe some biscuits  possibly even a bread roll  or do you mean the little cup you might get if  for example  you just ordered soup and a salad .         the size of soup plates that are eight inches across     said tiffany  who   d never ordered soup and a salad anywhere in her life .     i checked .         hmm  that is a puzzler     said the teacher .     don   t think i know that one .  it   s certainly not useful  i know that .  it sounds made up to me .         yes  that   s what i thought     said tiffany .     but i   d still like to know more about it .         well  you could try her .  she   s new .      the teacher jerked his thumb toward a little tent at the end of the row .  it was black and quite shabby .  there weren   t any posters  and absolutely no exclamation marks .      what does she teach .     tiffany asked .      couldn   t say     said the teacher .     she says it   s thinking  but i don   t know how you teach that .  that   ll be one carrot  thank you .      when she went closer  tiffany saw a small notice pinned to the outside of the tent .  it said  in letters that whispered rather than shouted       i can teach you a lesson you won   t forget in a hurry .       chapter        miss tick      tiffany read the sign and smiled .      aha     she said .  there was nothing to knock on  so she added    knock  knock    in a louder voice .   a woman   s voice from within said     who   s there .         tiffany     said tiffany .      tiffany who .     said the voice .      tiffany who isn   t trying to make a joke .         ah .  that sounds promising .  come in .      she pushed aside the flap .  it was dark inside the tent  as well as stuffy and hot .  a skinny figure sat behind a small table .  she had a very sharp  thin nose and was wearing a large black straw hat with paper flowers on it .  it was completely unsuitable for a face like that .      are you a witch .     said tiffany .     i don   t mind if you are .         what a strange question to spring on someone     said the woman  looking slightly shocked .     your baron bans witches in this country  you know that  and the first thing you say to me is    are you a witch .     why would i be a witch .         well  you   re wearing all black     said tiffany .      anyone can wear black     said the woman .     that doesn   t mean a thing .         and you   re wearing a straw hat with flowers in it     tiffany went on .      aha .     said the woman .     that proves it  then .  witches wear tall pointy hats .  everyone knows that  foolish child .         yes  but witches are also very clever     said tiffany calmly .  there was something about the twinkle in the woman   s eyes that told her to continue .     they sneak about .  probably they often don   t look like witches .  and a witch coming here would know about the baron  and so she   d wear the kind of hat that everyone knows witches don   t wear .      the woman stared at her .     that was an incredible feat of reasoning     she said at last .     you   d make a good witch finder .  you know they used to set fire to witches .  whatever kind of hat i   ve got on  you   d say it proves i   m a witch  yes .         well  the frog sitting on your hat is a bit of a clue  too     said tiffany .      i   m a toad  actually     said the creature  which had been peering at tiffany from between the paper flowers .      you   re very yellow for a toad .         i   ve been a bit ill     said the toad .      and you talk     said tiffany .      you only have my word for it     said the toad  disappearing into the paper flowers .     you can   t prove anything .         you don   t have matches on you  do you .     said the woman to tiffany .      no .         fine  fine .  just checking .      again there was a pause while the woman gave tiffany a long stare  as if making up her mind about something .      my name     she said at last     is miss tick .  and i am a witch .  it   s a good name for a witch  of course .         you mean blood sucking parasite .     said tiffany  wrinkling her forehead .      i   m sorry .     said miss tick  coldly .      ticks     said tiffany .     sheep get them .  but if you use turpentine           i meant that it sounds like    mystic        said miss tick .      oh  you mean a pune  or play on words     said tiffany .      in that case it would be even better if you were miss teak  a dense foreign wood  because that would sound like    mystique     or you could be miss take  which would           i can see we   re going to get along like a house on fire     said miss tick .     there may be no survivors .         you really are a witch .         oh  puh lease     said miss tick .     yes  yes  i am a witch .  i have a talking animal  a tendency to correct other people   s pronunciation   it   s pun  by the way  not    pune      and a fascination for poking my nose into other people   s affairs and  yes  a pointy hat .         can i operate the spring now .     said the toad .      yes     said miss tick  her eyes still on tiffany .     you can operate the spring .         i like operating the spring     said the toad  crawling around to the back of the hat .   there was a click  and a slow thwap thwap noise  and the center of the hat rose slowly and jerkily up out of the paper flowers  which fell away .      er       said tiffany .      you have a question .     said miss tick .   with a last thwop  the top of the hat made a perfect point .      how do you know i won   t run away right now and tell the baron .     said tiffany .      because you haven   t the slightest desire to do so     said miss tick .     you   re absolutely fascinated .  you want to be a witch  am i right .  you probably want to fly on a broomstick  yes .         oh  yes .     she   d often dreamed of flying .  miss tick   s next words brought her down to earth .      really .  you like having to wear really  really thick pants .  believe me  if i   ve got to fly  i wear two pairs of woolen ones and a canvas pair on the outside which  i may tell you  are not very feminine no matter how much lace you sew on .  it can get cold up there .  people forget that .  and then there   s the bristles .  don   t ask me about the bristles .  i will not talk about the bristles .         but can   t you use a keeping warm spell .     said tiffany .      i could .  but a witch doesn   t do that sort of thing .  once you use magic to keep yourself warm  then you   ll start using it for other things .         but isn   t that what a witch is supposed to       tiffany began .      once you learn about magic  i mean really learn about magic  learn everything you can learn about magic  then you   ve got the most important lesson still to learn     said miss tick .      what   s that .         not to use it .  witches don   t use magic unless they really have to .  it   s hard work and difficult to control .  we do other things .  a witch pays attention to everything that   s going on .  a witch uses her head .  a witch is sure of herself .  a witch always has a piece of string           i always do have a piece of string .     said tiffany .     it   s always handy .         good .  although there   s more to witchcraft than string .  a witch delights in small details .  a witch sees through things and around things .  a witch sees farther than most .  a witch sees things from the other side .  a witch knows where she is  who she is  and when she is .  a witch would see jenny green teeth     she added .     what happened .         how did you know i saw jenny green teeth .         i   m a witch .  guess     said miss tick .   tiffany looked around the tent .  there wasn   t much to see  even now that her eyes were getting accustomed to the gloom .  the sounds of the outside world filtered through the heavy material .      i think           yes .     said the witch .      i think you heard me telling the teacher .         correct .  i just used my ears     said miss tick  saying nothing at all about saucers of ink .     tell me about this monster with eyes the size of the kind of soup plates that are eight inches across .  where do soup plates come into it .         the monster is mentioned in a book of stories i   ve got     explained tiffany .     it said jenny green teeth has eyes the size of soup plates .  there   s a picture  but it   s not a good one .  so i measured a soup plate  so i could be exact .      miss tick put her chin on her hand and gave tiffany an odd sort of smile .      that was all right  wasn   t it .     said tiffany .      what .  oh  yes .  yes .  um   yes .  very   exact .  go on .      tiffany told her about the fight with jenny  although she didn   t mention wentworth in case miss tick got funny about it .  miss tick listened carefully .      why the frying pan .     she said .     you could   ve found a stick .         a frying pan just seemed a better idea     said tiffany .      hah .  it was .  jenny would   ve eaten you up if you   d used a stick .  a frying pan is made of iron .  creatures of that kidney can   t stand iron .         but it   s a monster out of a storybook .     said tiffany .     what   s it doing turning up in our little river .      miss tick stared at tiffany for a while and then said     why do you want to be a witch  tiffany .      it had started with the goode childe   s booke of faerie tales .  actually  it had probably started with a lot of things  but the stories most of all .   her mother had read them to her when she was little  and then she   d read them to herself .  and all the stories had  somewhere  the witch .  the wicked old witch .   and tiffany had thought  where   s the evidence .   the stories never said why she was wicked .  it was enough to be an old woman  enough to be all alone  enough to look strange because you had no teeth .  it was enough to be called a witch .   if it came to that  the book never gave you the evidence of anything .  it talked about    a handsome prince      was he really  or was it just because he was a prince that people called him handsome .  as for    a girl who was as beautiful as the day was long      well  which day .  in midwinter it hardly ever got light .  the stories didn   t want you to think  they just wanted you to believe what you were told    .   and you were told that the old witch lived all by herself in a strange cottage that was made of gingerbread or ran around on giant hen   s feet  and talked to animals  and could do magic .   tiffany only ever knew one old woman who lived all alone in a strange cottage    .   well  no .  that wasn   t quite true .  but she had only ever known one old woman who lived in a strange house that moved about  and that was granny aching .  and she could do magic  sheep magic  and she talked to animals and there was nothing wicked about her .  that proved you couldn   t believe the stories .   and there had been the other old woman  the one who everyone said was a witch .  and what had happened to her had made tiffany very   thoughtful .   anyway  she preferred the witches to the smug handsome princes and especially to the stupid smirking princesses  who didn   t have the sense of a beetle .  they had lovely golden hair  too  and tiffany didn   t .  her hair was brown  plain brown .  her mother called it chestnut  or sometimes auburn  but tiffany knew it was brown  brown  brown  just like her eyes .  brown as earth .  and did the book have any adventures for people who had brown eyes and brown hair .  no  no  no   it was the blond people with blue eyes and the redheads with green eyes who got the stories .  if you had brown hair you were probably just a servant or a woodcutter or something .  or a dairymaid .  well  that was not going to happen  even if she was good at cheese .  she couldn   t be the prince  and she   d never be a princess  and she didn   t want to be a woodcutter  so she   d be the witch and know things  just like granny aching        who was granny aching .     said a voice .       who was granny aching .  people would start asking that now .  and the answer was  what granny aching was  was there .  she was always there .  it seemed that the lives of all the achings revolved around granny aching .  down in the village decisions were made  things were done  life went on in the knowledge that in her old wheeled shepherding hut on the hills granny aching was there  watching .   and she was the silence of the hills .  perhaps that   s why she liked tiffany  in her awkward  hesitant way .  her older sisters chattered  and granny didn   t like noise .  tiffany didn   t make noise when she was up at the hut .  she just loved being there .  she   d watch the buzzards and listen to the noise of the silence .   it did have a noise  up there .  sounds  voices  animal noises floating up onto the downs somehow made the silence deep and complex .  and granny aching wrapped this silence around herself and made room inside it for tiffany .  it was always too busy on the farm .  there were a lot of people with a lot to do .  there wasn   t enough time for silence .  there wasn   t time for listening .  but granny aching was silent and listened all the time .          what .     said tiffany  blinking .      you just said     granny aching listened to me all the time        said miss tick .   tiffany swallowed .     i think my grandmother was slightly a witch     she said  with a touch of pride .      really .  how do you know .         well  witches can curse people  right .     said tiffany .      so it is said     said miss tick diplomatically .      well  my father said granny aching cussed the sky blue     said tiffany .   miss tick coughed .     well  cussing  now  cussing isn   t like genuine cursing .  cussing   s more like dang and botheration and darned and drat  you know .  cursing is more on the lines of    i hope your nose explodes and your ears go flying away .            i think granny   s cussing was a bit more than that     said tiffany  in a very definite voice .     and she talked to her dogs .         and what kind of things did she say to them .     said miss tick .      oh  things like    come by    and    away to me    and    that   ll do        said tiffany .     they always did what she told them .         but those are just sheepdog commands     said miss tick dismissively .     that   s not exactly witchcraft .         well  that still makes them familiars  doesn   t it .     tiffany retorted  feeling annoyed .     witches have animals they can talk to  called familiars .  like your toad there .         i   m not familiar     said a voice from among the paper flowers .     i   m just slightly presumptuous .         and she knew about all kinds of herbs     tiffany persisted .  granny aching was going to be a witch even if tiffany had to argue all day .     she could cure anything .  my father said she could make a shepherd   s pie stand up and baa .     tiffany lowered her voice .     she could bring lambs back to life    .          you hardly ever saw granny aching indoors in the spring and summer .  she spent most of the year sleeping in the old wheeled hut  which could be dragged across the downs after the flocks .  but the first time tiffany could remember seeing the old woman in the farmhouse  she was kneeling in front of the fire  putting a dead lamb in the big black oven .   tiffany had screamed and screamed .  and granny had gently picked her up  a little awkwardly  and sat her on her lap and shushed her and called her    my little jiggit     while on the floor her sheepdogs  thunder and lightning  watched her in doggish amazement .  granny wasn   t particularly at home around children  because they didn   t baa .   when tiffany had stopped crying out of sheer lack of breath  granny had put her down on the rug and opened the oven  and tiffany had watched the lamb come alive again .   when tiffany got a little older  she found out that jiggit meant    twenty    in the yan tan tethera  the ancient counting language of the shepherds .  the older people still used it when they were counting things they thought of as special .  she was granny aching   s twentieth grandchild .   and when she was older still  she also understood all about the warming oven  which never got more than  well  warm .  her mother would let the bread dough rise in it  and ratbag the cat would sleep in it  sometimes on the dough .  it was just the place to revive a weak lamb that had been born on a snowy night and was near death from the cold .  that was how it worked .  no magic at all .  but that time it had been magic .  and it didn   t stop being magic just because you found out how it was done .          good  but still not exactly witchcraft     said miss tick  breaking the spell again .     anyway  you don   t have to have a witch ancestor to be a witch .  it helps  of course  because of heredity .         you mean like having talents .     said tiffany  wrinkling her brow .      partly  i suppose     said miss tick .     but i was thinking of pointy hats  for example .  if you have a grandmother who can pass on her pointy hat to you  that saves a great deal of expense .  they are incredibly hard to come by  especially ones strong enough to withstand falling farmhouses .  did mrs .  aching have anything like that .         i don   t think so     said tiffany .     she hardly ever wore a hat except in the very cold weather .  she wore an old grain sack as a sort of hood .  um   does that count .      for the first time  miss tick looked a little less flinty .     possibly  possibly     she said .     do you have any brothers and sisters  tiffany .         i have six sisters     said tiffany .     i   m the youngest .  most of them don   t live with us now .         and then you weren   t the baby anymore because you had a dear little brother     said miss tick .     the only boy  too .  that must have been a nice surprise .      suddenly  tiffany found miss tick   s faint smile slightly annoying .      how do you know about my brother .     she said .   the smile faded .  miss tick thought  this child is sharp .     just a guess     she said .  no one likes admitting to spying .      are you using persykology on me .     said tiffany hotly .      i think you mean psychology     said miss tick .      whatever     said tiffany .     you think i don   t like him because my parents make a fuss of him and spoil him  yes .         well  it did cross my mind     said miss tick  and gave up worrying about the spying .  she was a witch  and that was all there was to it .     i think it was the bit when you used him as bait for a slobbering monster that gave me a hint     she added .      he   s just a nuisance .     said tiffany .     he takes up my time and i   m always having to look after him and he always wants sweets .  anyway     she added     i had to think fast .         quite so     said miss tick .      granny aching would have done something about monsters in our river     said tiffany  ignoring that .     even if they are out of books .     and she   d have done something about what happened to old mrs .  snapperly  she added to herself .  she   d have spoken up  and people would have listened    .  they always listened when grannyspoke up .  speak up for those who don   t have voices  she always said .      good     said miss tick .     so she should .  witches deal with things .  you said the river was very shallow where jenny leaped up .  and the world looked blurred and shaky .  was there a susurrus .      tiffany beamed .     yes  there certainly was .         ah .  something bad is happening .      tiffany looked worried .      can i stop it .         and now i   m slightly impressed     said miss tick .     you said     can i stop it .     and not    can anyone stop it .     or    can we stop it .     that   s good .  you accept responsibility .  that   s a good start .  and you keep a cool head .  but no  you can   t stop it .         i walloped jenny green teeth .         lucky hit     said miss tick .     there are worse than her on the way  believe me .  i believe an incursion of major proportions is going to start here  and clever though you are  my girl  you have as much chance as one of your lambs on a snowy night .  you keep clear .  i   ll try to fetch help .         what  from the baron .         good gracious  no .  he   d be no use at all .         but he protects us     said tiffany .     that   s what my mother says .         does he .     said miss tick .     who from .  i mean  from whom .         well  from  you know   attack  i suppose .  from other barons  my father says .         has he got a big army .         well  er  he   s got sergeant roberts  and kevin and neville and trevor     said tiffany .     we all know them .  they mostly guard the castle .         any of them got magical powers .     said miss tick .      i saw neville do card tricks once     said tiffany .      a wow at parties  but probably not much use even against something like jenny     said miss tick .     are there no oth   are there no witches here at all .      tiffany hesitated .      there was old mrs .  snapperly     she said .  oh  yes .  she   d lived all alone in a strange cottage  all right    .      good name     said miss tick .     can   t say i   ve heard it before  though .  where is she .         she died in the snow last winter     said tiffany slowly .      and now tell me what you   re not telling me     said miss tick  sharp as a knife .      er   she was begging  people think  but no one opened their doors to her and  er   it was a cold night  and   she died .         and she was a witch  was she .         everyone said she was a witch     said tiffany .  she really did not want to talk about this .  no one in the villages around here wanted to talk about it .  no one went near the ruins of the cottage in the woods  either .      you don   t think so .         um       tiffany squirmed .     you see   the baron had a son called roland .  he was only twelve  i think .  and he went riding in the woods by himself last summer and his dogs came back without him .         mrs .  snapperly lived in those woods .     said miss tick .      yes .         and people think she killed him .     said miss tick .  she sighed .     they probably think she cooked him in the oven  or something .         they never actually said     said tiffany .     but i think it was something like that  yes .         and did his horse turn up .     said miss tick .      no     said tiffany .     and that was strange  because if it   d turned up anywhere along the hills  the people would have noticed it    .      miss tick folded her hands  sniffed  and smiled a smile with no humor in it at all .      easily explained     she said .     mrs .  snapperly must have had a really big oven  eh .         no  it was really quite small     said tiffany .     only ten inches deep .         i bet mrs .  snapperly had no teeth and talked to herself  right .     said miss tick .      yes .  and she had a cat .  and a squint     said tiffany .  and it all came out in a rush     and so after he vanished  they went to her cottage and they looked in the oven and they dug up her garden and they threw stones at her old cat until it died and they turned her out of her cottage and piled up all her old books in the middle of the room and set fire to them and burned the place to the ground and everyone said she was an old witch .         they burned the books     said miss tick in a flat voice .      because they said they had old writing in them     said tiffany .     and pictures of stars .         and when you went to look  did they .     said miss tick .   tiffany suddenly felt cold .     how did you know .     she said .      i   m good at listening .  well  did they .      tiffany sighed .     yes  i went to the cottage next day  and some of the pages  you know  had kind of floated up in the heat .  and i found a part of one  and it had all old lettering and gold and blue edging .  and i buried her cat .         you buried the cat .         yes .  someone had to .     said tiffany hotly .      and you measured the oven     said miss tick .     i know you did  because you just told me what size it was .     and you measure soup plates  miss tick added to herself .  what have i found here .      well  yes .  i did .  i mean   it was tiny .  and if she could magic away a boy and a whole horse  why didn   t she magic away the men who came for her .  it didn   t make any sense .      miss tick waved her into silence .     and then what happened .         then the baron said no one was to have anything to do with her     said tiffany .     he said any witches found in the country would be tied up and thrown in the pond .  er  you could be in danger     she added  uncertainly .      i can untie knots with my teeth and i have a gold swimming certificate from the quirm college for young ladies     said miss tick .     all that practice at jumping into the swimming pool with my clothes on was time well spent .     she leaned forward .      let me guess what happened to mrs .  snapperly     she said .     she lived from the summer until the snow  right .  she stole food from barns  and probably women gave her food at the back door if the men weren   t around .  i expect the bigger boys threw things at her if they saw her .         how do you know all this .     said tiffany .      it doesn   t take a huge leap of imagination  believe me     said miss tick .     and she wasn   t a witch  was she .         i think she was just a sick old lady who was no use to anyone and smelled a bit and looked odd because she had no teeth     said tiffany .     she just looked like a witch in a story .  anyone with half a mind could see that .      miss tick sighed .     yes .  but sometimes it   s so hard to find half a mind when you need one .         can   t you teach me what i need to know to be a witch .     said tiffany .      tell me why you still want to be a witch  bearing in mind what happened to mrs .  snapperly .         so that sort of thing doesn   t happen again     said tiffany .   she even buried the old witch   s cat  thought miss tick .  what kind of child is this .      good answer .  you might make a decent witch one day     she said .     but i don   t teach people to be witches .  i teach people about witches .  witches learn in a special school .  i just show them the way  if they   re any good .  all witches have special interests  and i like children .         why .         because they   re much easier to fit in the oven     said miss tick .   but tiffany wasn   t frightened  just annoyed .      that was a nasty thing to say     she said .      well  witches don   t have to be nice     said miss tick  pulling a large black bag from under the table .     i   m glad to see you pay attention .         there really is a school for witches .     said tiffany .      in a manner of speaking  yes     said miss tick .      where .         very close .         it is magical .         very magical .         a wonderful place .         there   s nowhere quite like it .         can i go there by magic .  does  like  a unicorn turn up to carry me there or something .         why should it .  a unicorn is nothing more than a big horse that comes to a point  anyway .  nothing to get so excited about     said miss tick .     and that will be one egg  please .         exactly where can i find the school .     said tiffany  handing over the egg .      aha .  a root vegetable question  i think     said miss tick .     two carrots  please .      tiffany handed them over .      thank you .  ready .  to find the school for witches  go to a high place near here  climb to the top  open your eyes       miss tick hesitated .      yes .            and then open your eyes again .         but       tiffany began .      got any more eggs .         no  but           no more education  then .  but i have a question to ask you .         got any eggs .     said tiffany  instantly .      hah .  did you see anything else by the river  tiffany .      silence suddenly filled the tent .  the sound of bad spelling and erratic geography filtered through from outside as tiffany and miss tick stared into each other   s eyes .      no     lied tiffany .      are you sure .     said miss tick .      yes .      they continued the staring match .  but tiffany could outstare a cat .      i see     said miss tick  looking away .     very well .  in that case  please tell me   when you stopped outside my tent just now  you said    aha    in what i considered to be a smug tone of voice .  were you thinking     this is a strange little black tent with a mysterious little sign on the door  so going inside could be the start of an adventure     or were you thinking     this could be the tent of some wicked witch like they thought mrs .  snapperly was  who   ll put some horrible spell on me as soon as i go in    .  it   s all right  you can stop staring now .  your eyes are watering .         i thought both those things     said tiffany  blinking .      but you came in anyway .  why .         to find out .         good answer .  witches are naturally nosy     said miss tick  standing up .     well  i must go .  i hope we shall meet again .  i will give you some free advice  though .         will it cost me anything .         what .  i just said it was free .     said miss tick .      yes  but my father said that free advice often turns out to be expensive     said tiffany .   miss tick sniffed .     you could say this advice is priceless     she said .     are you listening .         yes     said tiffany .      good .  now   if you trust in yourself           yes .            and believe in your dreams           yes .            and follow your star       miss tick went on .      yes .            you   ll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren   t so lazy .  good bye .      the tent seemed to grow darker .  it was time to leave .  tiffany found herself back in the square where the other teachers were taking down their stalls .   she didn   t look around .  she knew enough not to look around .  either the tent would still be there  which would be a disappointment  or it would have mysteriously disappeared  and that would be worrying .   she headed home and wondered if she should have mentioned the little red haired men .  she hadn   t for a whole lot of reasons .  she wasn   t sure  now  that she   d really seen them  she had a feeling that they wouldn   t have wanted her to  and it was nice to have something miss tick didn   t know .  yes .  that was the best part .  miss tick was a bit too clever  in tiffany   s opinion .   on the way home she climbed to the top of arken hill  which was just outside the village .  it wasn   t very big  not even as high as the downs above the farm and certainly nothing like as high as the mountains .   the hill was more   modest .  there was a flat place at the top where nothing ever grew  and tiffany knew there was a story that a hero had once fought a dragon up there and its blood had burned the ground where it fell .  there was another story that said there was a heap of treasure under the hill  defended by the dragon  and another story that said a king was buried there in armor of solid gold .  there were lots of stories about the hill  it was surprising it hadn   t sunk under the weight of them .   tiffany stood on the bare soil and looked at the view .   she could see the village and the river and home farm and the baron   s castle  and beyond the fields she knew  she could see gray woods and heathlands .   she closed her eyes and opened them again .  and blinked  and opened them again .   there was no magic door  no hidden building revealed  no strange signs .   for a moment  though  the air buzzed and smelled of snow .   when she got home  she looked up incursion in the dictionary .  it meant    invasion .      an incursion of major proportions  miss tick had said .   and now little unseen eyes watched tiffany from the top of the shelf    .       chapter        hunt the hag      miss tick removed her hat  reached inside  and pulled a piece of string .  with little clicks and flapping noises the hat took up the shape of a rather elderly straw hat .  she picked up the paper flowers from the ground and stuck them on  carefully .   then she said     phew .         you can   t just let the kid go like that     said the toad  who was sitting on the table .      like what .         she   s clearly got first sight and second thoughts .  that   s a powerful combination .         she   s a little know it all     said miss tick .      right .  just like you .  she impressed you  right .  i know she did because you were quite nasty to her  and you always do that to people who impress you .         do you want to be turned into a frog .         well  now  let me see       said the toad sarcastically .     better skin  better legs  likelihood of being kissed by a princess one hundred percent improved   why  yes .  whenever you   re ready  madam .         there   re worse things than being a toad     said miss tick darkly .      try it sometime     said the toad .     anyway  i rather liked her .         so did i     said miss tick briskly .     she hears about an old lady dying because these idiots thought she was a witch  and she decides to become a witch so that they don   t try that again .  a monster roars up out of her river  and she bashes it with a frying pan .  have you ever heard the saying    the land finds its witch    .  it   s happened here  i   ll bet .  but a chalk witch .  witches like granite and basalt  hard rock all the way down .  do you know what chalk is .         you   re going to tell me     said the toad .      it   s the shells of billions and billions of tiny  helpless little sea creatures that died millions of years ago     said miss tick .     it   s   tiny  tiny bones .  soft .  soggy .  damp .  even limestone is better than that .  but   she   s grown up on chalk and she is hard  and sharp  too .  she   s a born witch .  on chalk .  which is impossible .         she bashed jenny .     said the toad .     the girl has got talent .         maybe  but she needs more than that .  jenny isn   t clever     said miss tick .     she   s only a grade   prohibitory monster .  and she was probably bewildered to find herself in a stream  when her natural home is in stagnant water .  there   ll be much  much worse than her .         what do you mean     a grade   prohibitory monster    .     asked the toad .     i   ve never heard her called that .         i am a teacher as well as a witch     said miss tick  adjusting her hat carefully .     therefore i make lists .  i make assessments .  i write things down in a neat  firm hand with pens of two colors .  jenny is one of a number of creatures invented by adults to scare children away from dangerous places .     she sighed .     if only people would think before they make up monsters .         you ought to stay and help her     said the toad .      i   ve got practically no power here     said miss tick .     i told you .  it   s the chalk .  and remember the redheaded men .  a nac mac feegle spoke to her .  warned her .  i   ve never seen one in my life .  if she   s got them on her side  who knows what she can do .      she picked up the toad .     d   you know what   ll be turning up .     she continued .     all the things they locked away in those old stories .  all those reasons why you shouldn   t stray off the path  or open the forbidden door  or say the wrong word  or spill the salt .  all the stories that gave children nightmares .  all the monsters from under the biggest bed in the world .  somewhere  all stories are real and all dreams come true .  and they   ll come true here if they   re not stopped .  if it wasn   t for the nac mac feegle  i   d be really worried .  as it is  i   m going to try and get some help .  that   s going to take me at least two days without a broomstick .         it   s unfair to leave her alone with them     said the toad .      she won   t be alone     said miss tick .     she   ll have you .         oh     said the toad .       tiffany shared a bedroom with fastidia and hannah .  she woke up when she heard them come to bed  and she lay in the dark until she heard their breathing settle down and they started to dream of young sheep shearers with their shirts off .   outside  summer lightning flashed around the hills  and there was a rumble of thunder    .       thunder and lightning .  she knew them as dogs before she knew them as the light and sound of a storm .  granny always had her sheepdogs with her  indoors and out .  one moment they would be black and white streaks across the distant turf  and then they were suddenly there  panting  eyes never leaving granny   s face .  half the dogs on the hills were lightning   s puppies  trained by granny aching .   tiffany had gone with the family to the big sheepdog trials .  every shepherd on the chalk went to them  and the very best entered the arena to show how well they could work their dogs .  the dogs would round up sheep  separate them  drive them into the pens   or sometimes run off  or snap at one another  because even the best dog can have a bad day .  but granny never entered with thunder and lightning .  she   d lean on the fence with the dogs lying in front of her  watching the show intently and puffing her foul pipe .  and tiffany   s father had said that after each shepherd had worked his dogs  the judges would look nervously across at granny aching to see what she thought .  in fact all the shepherds watched her .  granny never  ever entered the arena  because she was the trials .  if granny thought you were a good shepherd   if she nodded at you when you walked out of the arena  if she puffed at her pipe and said     that   ll do      you walked like a giant for a day  you owned the chalk    .   when she was small and up on the wold with granny  thunder and lightning would baby sit tiffany  lying attentively a few feet away as she played .  and she   d been so proud when granny had let her use them to round up a flock .  she   d run about excitedly in all directions  shouting    come by .     and    there .     and    walk up .     and  glory be  the dogs had worked perfectly .   she knew now that they   d have worked perfectly whatever she   d shouted .  granny was just sitting there  smoking her pipe  and by now the dogs could read her mind .  they only ever took orders from granny aching    .       the storm died down after a while  and there was the gentle sound of rain .   at some point ratbag the cat pushed open the door and jumped onto the bed .  he was big to start with  but ratbag flowed .  he was so fat that  on any reasonably flat surface  he gradually spread out in a great puddle of fur .  he hated tiffany but would never let personal feelings get in the way of a warm place to sleep .   she must have slept  because she woke up when she heard the voices .   they seemed very close but  somehow  very small .      crivens .  it   s a    verra well sayin       find the hag     but what should we be lookin    for  can ye tell me that .  all these bigjobs look just the same tae me .         not totally wee geordie doon at the fishin    said she was a big  big girl .         a great help that is  i dinna think .  they   re all big  big girls .         ye paira dafties .  everyone knows a hag wears a pointy bonnet .         so they canna be a hag if they   re sleepin     then .         hello .     whispered tiffany .   there was silence  embroidered with the breathing of her sisters .  but in a way tiffany couldn   t quite describe  it was the silence of people trying hard not to make any noise .   she leaned down and looked under the bed .  there was nothing there but the guzunder .   the little man in the river had talked just like that .   she lay back in the moonlight  listening until her ears ached .   then she wondered what the school for witches would be like and why she hadn   t seen it yet .   she knew every inch of the country for two miles around .  she liked the river best  with the backwaters where striped pike sun bathed just above the weeds and the banks where kingfishers nested .  there was a heronry a mile or so upriver  and she liked to creep up on the birds when they came down here to fish in the reeds  because there   s nothing funnier than a heron trying to get airborne in a hurry .   she drifted off to sleep again  thinking about the land around the farm .  she knew all of it .  there were no secret places that she didn   t know about .   but maybe there were magical doors .  that   s what she   d make  if she had a magical school .  there should be secret doorways everywhere  even hundreds of miles away .  look at a special rock by  say  moonlight  and there would be yet another door .   but the school  now  the school .  there would be lessons in broomstick riding and how to sharpen your hat to a point  and magical meals  and lots of new friends .      is the bairn asleep .         aye  i canna hear her movin    .      tiffany opened her eyes in the darkness .  the voices under the bed had a slightly echoey edge .  thank goodness the guzunder was nice and clean .      right  let   s get oot o    this wee pot  then .      the voices moved off across the room .  tiffany   s ears tried to swivel to follow them .      hey  see here  it   s a hoose .  see  with wee chairies and things .      they   ve found the doll   s house  tiffany thought .   it was quite a large one  made by mr .  block the farm carpenter when tiffany   s oldest sister  who already had two babies of her own now  was a little girl .  it wasn   t the most fragile of items .  mr .  block did not go in for delicate work .  but over the years the girls had decorated it with bits of material and some rough and ready furniture .   by the sound of it the owners of the voices thought it was a palace .      hey  hey  hey  we   re in the cushy stuff noo .  there   s a beid in this room .  wi    pillows .         keep it doon   we don   t want any o    them to wake up .         crivens  i   m as quiet as a wee moose .  aargh .  there   s sojers .         whut d   ye mean  sojers .         there   s redcoats in the room .      they   ve found the toy soldiers  thought tiffany  trying not to breathe loudly .   strictly speaking  they had no place in the doll   s house  but wentworth wasn   t old enough for them  and so they   d got used as innocent bystanders back in those days when tiffany had made tea parties for her dolls .  well  what passed for dolls .  such toys as there were in the farmhouse had to be tough to survive intact through the generations and didn   t always manage it .  last time tiffany had tried to arrange a party  the guests had been a rag doll with no head  two wooden soldiers  and three quarters of a small teddy bear .   thuds and bangs came from the direction of the doll   s house .      i got one .  hey  pal  can yer mammie sew .  stitch this .  aargh .  he   s got a heid on him like a tree .         crivens .  there   s a body here wi    no heid at a    .         aye  nae wonder     cause here   s a bear .  feel ma boot  ye washoon .      it seemed to tiffany that although the owners of the three voices were fighting things that couldn   t possibly fight back  including a teddy bear with only one leg  the fight still wasn   t going all one way .      i got    im .  i got    im .  i got    im .  yer gonna get a gummer  ye wee hard disease .         someone bit ma leg .  someone bit ma leg .         come here .  ach  yer fightin    yersels  ye eejits .  ah   m fed up wi    the pairy yees .      tiffany felt ratbag stir .  he might be fat and lazy  but he was lightning fast when it came to leaping on small creatures .  she couldn   t let him get the   whatever they were  however bad they sounded .   she coughed loudly .      see .     said a voice from the doll   s house .     yer woked them up .  ah   m offski .      silence fell again  and this time  tiffany decided after a while  it was the silence of no one there rather than the silence of people being incredibly quiet .  ratbag went back to sleep  twitching occasionally as he disemboweled something in his fat cat dreams .   tiffany waited a little while and then got out of bed and crept toward the bedroom door  avoiding the two squeaky floorboards .  she went downstairs in the dark  found a chair by moonlight  fished the book of fairy tales off granny   s shelf  then lifted the latch on the back door and stepped out into the warm midsummer night .   there was a lot of mist around  but a few stars were visible overhead and there was a gibbous moon in the sky .  tiffany knew it was gibbous because she   d read in the almanack that gibbous meant what the moon looked like when it was just a bit fatter than half full  and so she made a point of paying attention to it around those times just so that she could say to herself     ah  i see the moon   s very gibbous tonight    .      it   s possible that this tells you more about tiffany than she would want you to know .   against the rising moon the downs were a black wall that filled half the sky .  for a moment she looked for the light of granny aching   s lantern    .       granny never lost a lamb .  that was one of tiffany   s first memories  of being held by her mother at the window one frosty night in early spring  with a million brilliant stars glinting over the mountains and  on the darkness of the downs  the one yellow star in the constellation of granny aching zigzagging through the night .  she wouldn   t go to bed while a lamb was lost  however bad the weather    .       there was only one place where it was possible for someone in a large family to be private  and that was in the privy .  it was a three holer  and it was where everyone went if they wanted to be alone for a while .   there was a candle in there  and last year   s almanack hanging on a string .  the printers knew their readership and printed the almanack on soft  thin paper .   tiffany lit the candle  made herself comfortable  and looked at the book of fairy tales .  the moon gibbous   d at her through the crescent shaped hole cut in the door .   she   d never really liked the book .  it seemed to her that it tried to tell her what to do and what to think .  don   t stray from the path  don   t open that door  but hate the wicked witch because she is wicked .  oh  and believe that shoe size is a good way of choosing a wife .   a lot of the stories were highly suspicious  in her opinion .  there was the one that ended when the two good children pushed the wicked witch into her own oven .  tiffany had worried about that after all that trouble with mrs .  snapperly .  stories like this stopped people thinking properly  she was sure .  she   d read that one and thought  excuse me .  no one has an oven big enough to get a whole person in  and what made the children think they could just walk around eating people   s houses in any case .  and why does some boy too stupid to know a cow is worth a lot more than five beans have the right to murder a giant and steal all his gold .  not to mention commit an act of ecological vandalism .  and some girl who can   t tell the difference between a wolf and her grandmother must either have been as dense as teak or come from an extremely ugly family .  the stories weren   t real .  but mrs .  snapperly had died because of stories .   she flicked past page after page  looking for the right picture .  because although the stories made her angry  the pictures  ah  the pictures were the most wonderful things she   d ever seen .   she turned a page and there it was .   most of the pictures of fairies were not very impressive .  frankly  they looked like a small girls    ballet class that   d just had to run through a bramble patch .  but this one   was different .  the colors were strange  and there were no shadows .  giant grasses and daisies grew everywhere  so the fairies must have been quite small  but they looked big .  they looked like rather strange humans .  they certainly didn   t look much like fairies .  hardly any of them had wings .  they were odd shapes  in fact .  in fact  some of them looked like monsters .  the girls in the tutus wouldn   t have stood much chance .   and the odd thing was that  alone of all the fairy pictures in the book  this one looked as if it had been done by an artist who had painted what was in front of him .  the other pictures  the ballet girls and the romper suit babies  had a made up  syrupy look .  this one didn   t .  this one said that the artist had been there        at least in his head  tiffany thought .   she concentrated on the bottom left hand corner  and there it was .  she   d seen it before  but you had to know where to look .  it was definitely a little red haired man  naked except for a kilt and a skinny vest  scowling out of the picture .  he looked very angry .  and   tiffany moved the candle to see more clearly   he was definitely making a gesture with his hand .   even if you didn   t know it was a rude one  it was easy to guess .   she heard voices .  she pushed the door open with her foot to hear them better  because a witch always listens to other people   s conversations .   the sound was coming from the other side of the hedge  where there was a field that should have been full of nothing but sheep waiting to go to market .  sheep are not known for their conversation .  she snuck out carefully in the misty dawn and found a small gap that had been made by rabbits  which just gave her a good enough view .   there was a ram grazing near the hedge  and the conversation was coming from it or  rather  somewhere in the long grass underneath it .  there seemed to be at least four speakers  who sounded bad tempered .      crivens .  we wanna coo beastie  no    a ship beastie .         ach  one   s as goo    as t   other .  c   mon  lads  a    grab aholt o    a leg .         aye  all the coos are inna shed  we tak what we can .         keep it doon  keep it doon  will ya .         ach  who   s listenin    .  okay  lads   yan   tan   teth   ra .      the sheep rose a little in the air  and bleated in alarm as it started to go across the field backward .  tiffany thought she saw a hint of red hair in the grass around its legs  but that vanished as the ram was carried away into the mist .   she pushed her way through the hedge  ignoring the twigs that scratched at her .  granny aching wouldn   t have let anyone get away with stealing a sheep  even if they were invisible .   but the mist was thick  and now tiffany heard noises from the henhouse .   the disappearing backward sheep could wait .  now the hens needed her .  a fox had got in twice in the last two weeks  and the hens that hadn   t been taken were barely laying .   tiffany ran through the garden  catching her nightdress on pea sticks and gooseberry bushes  and flung open the henhouse door .   there were no flying feathers  and nothing like the panic a fox would cause .  but the chickens were clucking excitedly  and prunes  the cockerel  was strutting nervously up and down .  one of the hens looked a bit embarrassed .  tiffany lifted it up quickly .   there were two tiny blue  red haired men underneath .  they were each holding an egg clasped in their arms .  they looked up with very guilty expressions .      ach  no .     said one .     it   s the bairn .  she   s the hag           you   re stealing our eggs     said tiffany .     how dare you .  and i   m not a hag .      the little men looked at one another  and then at the eggs .      whut eiggs .     said one .      the eggs you are holding     said tiffany meaningfully .      whut .  oh  these .  these are eiggs  are they .     said the one who   d spoken first  looking at the eggs as if he   d never seen them before .     there   s a thing .  and there was us thinking they was  er  stones .         stones     said the other one nervously .      we crawled under yon chookie for a wee bitty warmth     said the first one .     and there was all these things  we though    they was stones  which was why the puir fowl was clucking all the time           clucking     said the second one  nodding vigorously .         so we took pity on the puir thing and           put   the   eggs   back     said tiffany slowly .   the one who hadn   t been doing much talking nudged the other one .     best do as she says     he said .     it   s a    gang agley .  ye canna cross an aching  an    this one   s a hag .  she dinged jenny  an    no one ha    ever done that afore .         aye  i didna think o    that    .      both of the tiny men put the eggs back very carefully .  one of them even breathed on the shell of his and made a show of polishing it with the ragged hem of his kilt .      no harm done  mistress     he said .  he looked at the other man .  and then they vanished .  but there was a suspicion of a red blur in the air  and some straw by the henhouse door flew up in the air .      and i   m a miss .     shouted tiffany .  she lowered the hen back onto the eggs and went to the door .     and i   m not a hag .  are you fairies of some sort .  and what about our ship .  i mean  sheep .     she added .   there was no answer but a clanking of buckets near the house  which meant that other people were getting up .   she rescued the fairy tales  blew out the candle  and made her way into the house .  her mother was lighting the fire and asked what she was doing up  and she said that she   d heard a commotion in the henhouse and had gone out to see if it was the fox again .  that wasn   t a lie .  in fact  it was completely true .   tiffany was on the whole quite a truthful person  but it seemed to her that there were times when things didn   t divide easily into    true    and    false     but instead could be things that people needed to know at the moment and things that they didn   t need to know at the moment .   besides  she wasn   t sure what she knew at the moment .   there was porridge for breakfast .  she ate it hurriedly  meaning to get back out into the paddock and see about that sheep .  there might be tracks in the grass  or something    .   she looked up  not knowing why .   ratbag had been asleep in front of the oven .  now he was sitting up  alert .  tiffany felt a prickling on the back of her neck and tried to see what the cat was looking at .   on the dresser was a row of blue and white jars that weren   t very useful for anything .  they   d been left to her mother by an elderly aunt  and she was proud of them because they looked nice but were completely useless .  there was little room on the farm for useless things that looked nice  so they were treasured .   ratbag was watching the lid of one of them .  it was rising very slowly  and under it was a hint of red hair and two beady  staring eyes .   it lowered again when tiffany gave it a long stare .  a moment later she heard a faint rattle  and when she looked up  the pot was wobbling back and forth and there was a little cloud of dust rising along the top of the dresser .  ratbag was looking around in bewilderment .   they certainly were very fast .   she ran out into the paddock and looked around .  the mist was off the grass now  and skylarks were rising on the downs .      if that sheep doesn   t come back this minute     she shouted at the sky     there will be a reckoning .      the sound bounced off the hills .  and then she heard  very faint but close by  the sound of small voices      whut did the hag say .     said the first voice .      she said there   d be a reck   ning    .         oh  waily  waily  waily .  we   re in trouble noo .      tiffany looked around  face red with anger .      we have a duty     she said  to the air and the grass .   it was something granny aching had said once  when tiffany had been crying about a lamb .  she   d said     we are as gods to the beasts o    the field  my jiggit .  we order the time o    their birth and the time o    their death .  between times  we ha    a duty .         we have a duty     tiffany repeated  more softly .  she glared around the field .     i know you can hear me  whoever you are .  if that sheep doesn   t come back  there will be   trouble    .      the larks sang over the sheepfolds  making the silence deeper .   tiffany had to do the chores before she had any more time to herself .  that meant feeding the chickens and collecting the eggs  and feeling slightly proud of the fact that there were two more than there might otherwise have been .  it meant fetching six buckets of water from the well and filling the log basket by the stove  but she put those jobs off because she didn   t like doing them much .  she did quite like churning butter  though .  it gave her time to think .   when i   m a witch with a pointy hat and a broomstick  she thought as she pumped the handle  i   ll wave my hand and the butter will come just like that .  and any little red headed devils who even think about taking our beasts will be     there was a slopping sound behind her  where she   d lined up the six buckets to take to the well .   one of them was now full of water  which was still sloshing backward and forward .   she went back to the churning as if nothing had happened but stopped after a while and went over to the flour bin .  she took a small handful of flour and dusted it over the doorstep  and then went back to the churning .   a few minutes later there was another watery sound behind her .  when she turned around  there was  yes  another full bucket .  and in the flour on the stone doorstep were just two lines of footprints  one leading out of the dairy and one coming back .   it was all tiffany could do to lift one of the heavy wooden buckets when it was full .   so  she thought  they are immensely strong as well as being incredibly fast .  i   m really being very calm about this .   she looked up at the big wooden beams that ran across the room  and a little dust fell down  as if something had quickly moved out of the way .   i think i ought to put a stop to this right now  she thought .  on the other hand  there   s no harm in waiting until all the buckets are filled up .      and then i   ll have to fill the log box in the scullery     she said aloud .  well  it was worth a try .   she went back to the churning and didn   t bother to turn her head when she heard four more sloshes behind her .  nor did she look around when she heard little whooshwhoosh noises and the clatter of logs in the box .  she turned to see only when the noise stopped .   the log box was full up to the ceiling  and all the buckets were full .  the patch of flour was a mass of footprints .   she stopped churning .  she had a feeling that eyes were watching her  a lot of eyes .      er   thank you     she said .  no  that wasn   t right .  she sounded nervous .  she let go of the butter paddle and stood up  trying to look as fierce as possible .      and what about our sheep .     she said .     i won   t believe you   re really sorry until i see the sheep come back .      there was a bleating from the paddock .  she ran out to the bottom of the garden and looked through the hedge .   the sheep was coming back  backward and at high speed .  it jerked to a halt a little way from the hedge and dropped down as the little men let it go .  one of the red headed men appeared for a moment on its head .  he huffed on a horn  polished it with his kilt  and vanished in a blur .   tiffany walked back to the dairy looking thoughtful .   when she got back  the butter had been churned .  not just churned  in fact  but patted into a dozen fat golden oblongs on the marble she used when she did it .  there was even a sprig of parsley on each one .   are they brownies .  she wondered .  according to the faerie tales  brownies hung around the house doing chores in exchange for a saucer of milk .  but in the picture they   d been cheery little creatures with long pointy hoods .  the red haired men didn   t look as if they   d ever drunk milk in their lives  but perhaps it was worth a try .      well     she said aloud  still aware of the hidden watchers .     that   ll do .  thank you .  i   m glad you   re sorry for what you did .      she took one of the cat   s saucers from the pile by the sink  washed it in the sink  filled it with milk from today   s churn  then put it down on the floor and stood back .     are you brownies .     she said .   the air blurred .  milk splashed across the floor  and the saucer spun around and around .      i   ll take that as a no  then     said tiffany .     so what are you .      there were unlimited supplies of no answer at all .   she lay down and looked under the sink  and then peered behind the cheese shelves .  she stared up into the dark  spidery shadows of the room .  it felt empty .   and she thought  i think i need a whole egg   s worth of education  in a hurry .       tiffany had walked along the steep track from the farm into the village hundreds of times .  it was less than half a mile long  and over the centuries the carts had worn it down so that it was more like a gully in the chalk and ran like a milky stream in wet weather .   she was halfway down when the susurrus started .  the hedges rustled without a wind .  the skylarks stopped singing  and while she hadn   t really noticed their song  their silence was a shock .  nothing   s louder than the end of a song that   s always been there .   when she looked up at the sky  it was like looking through a diamond .  it sparkled  and the air went cold so quickly that it was like stepping into an icy bath .   then there was snow underfoot  snow on the hedges .  and the sound of hooves .   they were in the field beside her .  a horse was galloping through the snow  behind the hedge that was now  suddenly  just a wall of white .   the hoofbeats stopped .  there was a moment of silence and then a horse landed in the lane  skidding on the snow .  it pulled itself upright  and the rider turned it to face tiffany .   the rider himself couldn   t face tiffany .  he had no face .  he had no head to hang it on .   she ran .  her boots slipped on the snow as she moved  but suddenly her mind was cold as the ice .   she had two legs  slipping on ice .  a horse had twice as many legs to slip .  she   d seen horses try to tackle this hill in icy weather .  she had a chance .   she heard a breathy  whistling noise behind her  and a whinny from the horse .  she risked a glance .  the horse was coming after her  but slowly  half walking and half sliding .  steam poured off it .   about halfway down the slope the lane passed under an arch of trees  looking like crashed clouds now under their weight of snow .  and beyond them  tiffany knew  the lane flattened out .  the headless man would catch her on the flat .  she didn   t know what would happen after that  but she was sure it would be unpleasantly short .   flakes of snow dropped on her as she passed under the trees  and she decided to make a run for it .  she might reach the village .  she was good at running .   but if she got there  then what .  she   d never reach a door in time .  and people would shout  and run about .  the dark horseman didn   t look like someone who   d take much notice of that .  no  she had to deal with it .   if only she   d brought the frying pan .      here  wee hag .  stannit ye still  right noo .      she stared up .   a tiny blue man had poked his head up out of the snow on top of the hedge .      there   s a headless horseman after me .     she shouted .      he   ll no    make it  hinny .  stand ye still .  look him in the eye .         he hasn   t got any eyes .         crivens .  are ye a hag or no    .  look him in the eyes he hasna got .      the blue man disappeared into the snow .   tiffany turned around .  the horseman was trotting under the trees now  the horse more certain as the ground leveled .  he had a sword in his hand  and he was looking at her  with the eyes he didn   t have .  there was the breathy noise again  not good to hear .   the little men are watching me  she thought .  i can   t run .  granny aching wouldn   t have run from a thing with no head .   she folded her arms and glared .   the horseman stopped  as if puzzled  and then urged the horse forward .   a blue and red shape  larger than the other little men  dropped out of the trees .  he landed on the horse   s forehead  between its eyes  and grabbed an ear in each hand .   tiffany heard the man shout     here   s a face full o    dandruff for ye  yer bogle  courtesy of big yan .     and then the man hit the horse between the eyes with his head .   to her amazement the horse staggered sideways .      aw right .     shouted the tiny fighter .     big toughie  is ye .  once more wi    feelin    .      this time the horse danced uneasily the other way  and then its back legs slid from under it and it collapsed in the snow .   little blue men erupted from the hedge .  the horseman  trying to get to his feet  disappeared under a blue and red storm of screaming creatures     and vanished .  the snow vanished .  the horse vanished .   the blue men  for a moment  were in a pile on the hot  dusty road .  one of them said     aw  crivens .  i kicked meself in me own heid .     and then they  too  vanished  but for a moment tiffany saw blue and red blurs disappearing into the hedge .   then the skylarks were back .  the hedges were green and full of flowers .  not a twig was broken  not a flower disturbed .  the sky was blue  with no flashes of diamond .   tiffany looked down .  on the toes of her boots  snow was melting .  she was  strangely  glad about that .  it meant that what had just happened was magical  not madness .  because if she closed her eyes  she could still hear the wheezy breathing of the headless man .   what she needed right now was people  and ordinary things happening .  but more than anything else  she wanted answers .   actually  what she wanted more than anything else was not to hear the wheezy breathing when she shut her eyes    .       the tents had gone .  except for a few pieces of broken chalk  apple cores  some stamped down grass  and  alas  a few chicken feathers  there was nothing at all to show that the teachers had ever been there .   a small voice said     psst .      she looked down .  a toad crept out from under a dock leaf .      miss tick said you   d be back     it said .     i expect there   s some things you need to know  right .         everything     said tiffany .     we   re swamped with tiny men .  i can   t understand half of what they say .  they keep calling me a hag .         ah  yes     said the toad .     you   ve got nac mac feegles .         it snowed  and then it hadn   t .  i was chased by a horseman with no head .  and one of the   what did you say they were .         nac mac feegles     said the toad .     also known as pictsies .  they call themselves the wee free men .         well  one of them head butted the horse .  it fell over .  it was a huge horse  too .         ah  that sounds like a feegle     said the toad .      i gave them some milk and they tipped it over .         you gave the nac mac feegle milk .         well  you said they   re pixies .         not pixies  pictsies .  they certainly don   t drink milk .         are they from the same place as jenny .     tiffany demanded .      no .  they   re rebels     said toad .      rebels .  against who .         everyone .  anything     said the toad .     now pick me up .         why .         because there   s a woman at the well over there giving you a funny look .  put me in your apron pocket  for goodness    sake .      tiffany snatched up the toad and smiled at the woman .     i   m making a collection of pressed toads     she said .      that   s nice  dear     said the woman  and hurried away .      that wasn   t very funny     said the toad from her apron .      people don   t listen anyway     said tiffany .   she sat down under a tree and took the toad out of her pocket .      the feegles tried to steal some of our eggs and one of our sheep     she said .     but i got them back .         you got something back from the nac mac feegle .     said the toad .     were they ill .         no .  they were a bit   well  sweet  actually .  they even did the chores for me .         the feegle did chores .     said the toad .     they never do chores .  they   re not helpful at all .         and then there was the headless horseman .     said tiffany .     he had no head .         well  that is the major job qualification     said the toad .      what   s going on  toad .     said tiffany .     is it the feegles who are invading .      the toad looked a bit shifty .     miss tick doesn   t really want you to handle this     it said .     she   ll be back soon with help           is she going to be in time .     tiffany demanded .      i don   t know .  probably .  but you shouldn   t           i want to know what is happening .         she   s gone to get some other witches     said the toad .     uh   she doesn   t think you should           you   d better tell me what you know  toad     said tiffany .     miss tick isn   t here .  i am .         another world is colliding with this one     said the toad .     there .  happy now .  that   s what miss tick thinks .  but it   s happening faster than she expected .  all the monsters are coming back .         why .         there   s no one to stop them .      there was silence for a moment .      there   s me     said tiffany .       chapter        the wee free men      nothing happened on the way back to the farm .  the sky stayed blue  none of the sheep in the home paddocks appeared to be traveling backward very fast  and an air of hot emptiness lay over everything .   ratbag was on the path leading up to the back door  and he had something trapped in his paws .  as soon as he saw tiffany  he picked it up and exited around the corner of the house urgently  legs spinning in the high speed slink of a guilty cat .  tiffany was too good a shot with a clod of earth .   but at least there wasn   t something red and blue in his mouth .      look at him     she said .     great cowardly blob .  i really wish i could stop him catching baby birds   it   s so sad .         you haven   t got a hat you can wear  have you .     said the toad  from her apron pocket .     i hate not being able to see .      they went into the dairy  which tiffany normally had to herself for most of the day .   in the bushes by the door there was a muffled conversation .  it went like this      whut did the wee hag say .         she said she wants yon cat to stop scraffin    the puir wee burdies .         is that a    .  crivens .  nae problemo .          tiffany put the toad on the table as carefully as possible .      what do you eat .     she said .  it was polite to offer guests food  she knew .      i   ve got used to slugs and worms and stuff     said the toad .     it wasn   t easy .  don   t worry if you don   t have any .  i expect you weren   t expecting a toad to drop in .         how about some milk .         you   re very kind .      tiffany fetched some and poured it into a saucer .  she watched while the toad crawled in .      were you a handsome prince .     she asked .      yeah  right  maybe     said the toad  dribbling milk .      so why did miss tick put a spell on you .         her .  huh  she couldn   t do that     said the toad .     it   s serious magic  turning someone into a toad but leaving them thinking they   re human .  no  it was a fairy godmother .  never cross a woman with a star on a stick  young lady .  they   ve got a mean streak .         why did she do it .      the toad looked embarrassed .     i don   t know     it said .     it   s all a bit   foggy .  i just know i   ve been a person .  at least  i think i know .  it gives me the willies .  sometimes i wake up in the night and i think  was i ever really human .  or was i just a toad that got on her nerves and she made me think i was human once .  that   d be a real torture  right .  supposing there   s nothing for me to turn back into .     the toad turned worried yellow eyes on her .     after all  it can   t be very hard to mess with a toad   s head  yeah .  it must be much simpler than turning  oh  a one hundred and sixty pound human into eight ounces of toad  yes .  after all  where   s the rest of the mass going to go  i ask myself .  is it just sort of  you know  left over .  very worrying .  i mean  i   ve got one or two memories of being a human  of course  but what   s a memory .  just a thought in your brain .  you can   t be sure it   s real .  honestly  on nights when i   ve eaten a bad slug  i wake up screaming  except all that comes out is a croak .  thank you for the milk  it was very nice .      tiffany stared in silence at the toad .      you know     she said     magic is a lot more complicated than i thought .         flappitty flappitty flap .  cheep  cheep .  ach  poor wee me  cheepitty cheep .      tiffany ran over to the window .   there was a feegle on the path .  it had made itself some crude wings out of a piece of rag  and a kind of beaky cap out of straw  and was wobbling around in a circle like a wounded bird .      ach  cheepitty cheep .  fluttery flutter .  i certainly hope dere   s no    a pussycat aroound .  ach  dearie me .     it yelled .   and down the path ratbag  archenemy of all baby birds  slunk closer  drooling .  as tiffany opened her mouth to yell  he leaped and landed with all four feet on the little man .   or at least where the little man had been  because he had somersaulted in midair and was now right in front of ratbag   s face and had grabbed a cat ear with each hand .      ach  see you  pussycat  scunner that y   are .     he yelled .     here   s a giftie from the t    wee burdies  yah schemie .      he butted the cat hard on the nose .  ratbag spun in the air and landed on his back with his eyes crossed .  he squinted in cold terror as the little man leaned down at him and shouted     cheep .      then he levitated in the way that cats do and became a ginger streak  rocketing down the path through the open door  and shooting past tiffany to hide under the sink .   the feegle looked up  grinning  and saw tiffany .      please don   t go       she began quickly  but he went  in a blur .   tiffany   s mother was hurrying down the path .  tiffany picked up the toad and put it back in her apron pocket just in time .  the door was flung open .      where   s wentworth .  is he here .     her mother asked urgently .     did he come back .  answer me .         didn   t he go up to the shearing with you  mum .     said tiffany  suddenly nervous .  she could feel the panic pouring off her mother like steam .      we can   t find him .     there was a wild look in her mother   s eyes .     i turned my back for only a minute .  are you sure you haven   t seen him .         but he couldn   t come all the way back here           go and look in the house .  go on .      mrs .  aching hurried away .  hastily  tiffany put the toad on the floor and urged him under the sink .  she heard him croak  and ratbag  mad with fear and bewilderment  came out from under the sink in a whirl of legs and rocketed out of the door .   she stood up .  her first  shameful thought was  he wanted to go up to watch the shearing .  how could he get lost .  he went with mum and hannah and fastidia .   and how closely would fastidia and hannah watch him with all those young men up there .   she tried to pretend she hadn   t thought that  but she was treacherously good at spotting when she was lying .  that   s the trouble with a brain   it thinks more than you sometimes want it to .   but he   s never interested in moving far away from people .  it   s half a mile up to the shearing pens .  and he doesn   t move that fast .  after a few feet he flops down and demands sweets .   but it would be a bit more peaceful around here if he did get lost    .   there it went again  a nasty  shameful thought  which she tried to drown out by getting busy .  but first she took some candy out of the jar  as bait  and rustled the bag as she ran from room to room .   she heard boots in the yard as some of the men came down from the shearing sheds  but she got on with looking under beds and in cupboards  even ones so high that a toddler couldn   t possibly reach them  and then looked again under beds that she   d already looked under  because it was that kind of search .  it was the kind of search where you go and look in the attic  even though the door is always locked .   after a few minutes there were two or three voices outside  calling for wentworth  and she heard her father say     try down by the river .         and that meant he was frantic too  because wentworth would never walk that far without a bribe .  he was not a child who was happy away from people with sweets .   it   s your fault .   the thought felt like a piece of ice in her mind .   it   s your fault because you didn   t love him very much .  he turned up and you weren   t the youngest anymore  and you had to have him trailing around after you  and you kept wishing  didn   t you  that he   d go away .      that   s not true .     tiffany whispered to herself .     i   quite liked him    .      not very much  admittedly .  not all the time .  he didn   t know how to play properly  and he never did what he was told .  you thought it would be better if he did get lost .   anyway  she added in her head  you can   t love people all the time when they have a permanently runny nose .  any anyway   i wonder        i wish i could find my brother     she said aloud .   this seemed to have no effect .  but the house was full of people  opening and shutting doors and calling out and getting in one another   s way  and the   feegles were shy  despite many of them having faces like a hatful of knuckles .   don   t wish  miss tick had said .  do things .   she went downstairs .  even some of the women who   d been packing fleeces up at the shearing had come down .  they were clustered around her mother  who was sitting at the table crying .  no one noticed tiffany .  that often happened .   she slipped into the dairy  closed the door carefully behind her  and leaned down to peer under the sink .   the door burst open again and her father ran in .  he stopped .  tiffany looked up guiltily .      he can   t be under there  girl .     her father said .      well  er       said tiffany .      did you look upstairs .         even the attic  dad           well .     her father looked panicky and impatient at the same time .     go and   do something .         yes  dad .      when the door had shut  tiffany peered under the sink again .      are you there  toad .         very poor pickings under here     the toad answered  crawling out .     you keep it very clean .  not even a spider .         this is urgent .     snapped tiffany .     my little brother has gone missing .  in broad daylight .  up on the downs  where you can see for miles .         oh  croap     said the toad .      pardon .     said tiffany .      er  that was  er  swearing in toad     said the toad .     sorry  but           has what   s going on got something to do with magic .     said tiffany .     it has  hasn   t it    .         i hope it hasn   t     said the toad     but i think it has .         have those little men stolen wentworth .         who  the feegles .  they don   t steal children .      there was something in the way the toad said it .  they don   t steal        do you know who has taken my brother  then .     tiffany demanded .      no .  but   they might     said the toad .     look  miss tick told me that you were not to           my brother has been stolen     said tiffany sharply .     are you going to tell me not to do anything about it .         no  but           good .  where are the feegles now .         lying low  i expect .  the place is full of people searching  after all  but           how can i bring them back .  i need them .         um  miss tick said           how can i bring them back .         er   you want to bring them back  then .     said the toad  looking mournful .      yes .         it   s just that   s something not many people have ever wanted to do     said the toad .     they   re not like brownies .  if you get nac mac feegle in the house  it   s usually best to move away .     he sighed .     tell me  is your father a drinking man .         he has a beer sometimes     said tiffany .     what   s that got to do with anything .         only beer .         well  i   m not supposed to know about what my father calls the special sheep liniment     said tiffany .     granny aching used to make it in the old cowshed .         strong stuff  is it .         it dissolves spoons     said tiffany .     it   s for special occasions .  father says it   s not for women because it puts hairs on your chest .         then if you want to be sure of finding the nac mac feegle  go and fetch some     said the toad .     it will work  believe me .      five minutes later tiffany was ready .  few things are hidden from a quiet child with good eyesight  and she knew where the bottles were stored and she had one now .  the cork was hammered in over a piece of rag  but it was old and she was able to lever it out with the tip of a knife .  the fumes made her eyes water .   she went to pour some of the golden brown liquid into a saucer        no .  we   ll be trampled to death if you do that     said the toad .     just leave the cork off .      fumes rose from the top of the bottle  wavering like the air over rocks on a hot day .   she felt it   a sensation  in the dim  cool room  of riveted attention .   she sat down on a milking stool and said     all right  you can come out now .      there were hundreds .  they rose up from behind buckets .  they lowered themselves on string from the ceiling beams .  they sidled sheepishly from behind the cheese racks .  they crept out from under the sink .  they came out of places where you   d think a man with hair like an orange gone nova couldn   t possibly hide .   they were all about six inches tall and mostly colored blue  although it was hard to know if that was the actual color of their skins or just the dye from their tattoos  which covered every inch that wasn   t covered with red hair .  they wore short kilts  and some wore other bits of clothing too  like skinny vests .  a few of them wore rabbit or rat skulls on their heads  as a sort of helmet .  and every single one of them carried  slung across his back  a sword nearly as big as he was .   however  what tiffany noticed more than anything else was that they were scared of her .  mostly they were looking at their own feet  which was no errand for the faint hearted because their feet were large  dirty  and half tied up with animal skins to make very bad shoes .  none of them wanted to look her in the eye .      you were the people who filled the water buckets .     she said .   there was a lot of foot shuffling and coughing and a chorus of ayes .      and the wood box .      there were more ayes .   tiffany glared at them .      and what about the sheep .      this time they all looked down .      why did you steal the sheep .      there was a lot of muttering and nudging  and then one of the tiny men removed his rabbit skull helmet and twiddled it nervously in his hands .      we wuz hungerin     mistress     he muttered .     but when we kenned it was thine  we did put the beastie back in the fold .      they looked so crestfallen that tiffany took pity on them .      i expect you wouldn   t have stolen it if you weren   t so hungry  then     she said .   there were several hundred astonished looks .      oh  we would  mistress     said the helmet twiddler .      you would .      tiffany sounded so surprised that the twiddler looked around at his colleagues for support .  they all nodded .      yes  mistress .  we have tae .  we are a famously stealin    folk .  aren   t we  lads .  whut   s it we   re famous for .         stealin    .     shouted the blue men .      and what else  lads .         fightin    .         and what else .         drinkin    .         and what else .      there was a certain amount of thought about this  but they all reached the same conclusion .      drinkin    and fightin    .         and there was summat else     muttered the twiddler .     ach  yes .  tell the hag  lads .         stealin    an    drinkin    an    fightin    .     shouted the blue men cheerfully .      tell the wee hag who we are  lads     said the helmet twiddler .   there was the scrape of many small swords being drawn and thrust into the air .      nac mac feegle .  the wee free men .  nae king .  nae quin .  nae laird .  nae master .  we willna be fooled again .      tiffany stared at them .  they were all watching her to see what she was going to do next  and the longer she said nothing  the more worried they become .  they lowered their swords  looking embarrassed .      but we wouldna dare deny a powerful hag  except mebbe for strong drink     said the twiddler  his helmet spinning desperately in his hands and his eyes on the bottle of special sheep liniment .     will ye no    help us .         help you .     said tiffany .     i want you to help me .  someone has taken my brother in broad daylight .         oh waily  waily waily .     said the helmet twiddler .     she   s come  then .  she   s come a fetchin    .  we   re too late .  it   s the quin .         what  there were four of them .     said tiffany .      they mean the queen     said the toad .     the queen of the           hush yer gob .     shouted the helmet twiddler  but his voice was lost in the wails and groans of the nac mac feegle .  they were pulling at their hair and stamping on the ground and shouting     alackaday .     and    waily waily waily .     and the toad was arguing with the helmet twiddler and everyone was getting louder to make themselves heard     tiffany stood up .     everybody shut up right now .     she said .   silence fell  except for a few sniffs and faint wailys from the back .      we wuz only dreeing our weird  mistress     said the helmet twiddler  almost crouching in fear .      but not in here .     snapped tiffany  shaking with anger .     this is a dairy .  i have to keep it clean .         er   dreeing your weird means    facing your fate        said the toad .         cause if the quin is here  then it means our kelda is weakenin    fast     said the helmet twiddler .     an    we   ll ha    naeone tae look after us .      no one to look after us  thought tiffany .  hundreds of tough little men who could each win the worst broken nose contest need someone to look after them .   she took a deep breath .      my mother   s in the house crying     she said     and       i don   t know how to comfort her  she added to herself .  i   m no good at this sort of thing  i never know what i should be saying .  out loud she said     and she wants him back .  er .  a lot .     she added  hating to say it     he   s her favorite .      she pointed to the helmet twiddler  who backed away .      first of all     she said     i can   t keep thinking of you as the helmet twiddler  so what is your name .      a gasp went up from the nac mac feegle  and tiffany heard one of them murmur     aye  she   s the hag  sure enough .  that   s a hag   s question .      the helmet twiddler looked around at them as if seeking help .      we dinna give oour names     he muttered .  but another feegle  somewhere safe at the back said     wheest .  you canna refuse a hag .      the little man looked up  very worried .      i   m the big man o    the clan  mistress     he said .     an    my name it is       he swallowed .     rob anybody feegle  mistress .  but i beg ye not to use it agin me .      the toad was ready for this .      they think names have magic in them     he murmured .     they don   t tell them to people in case they are written down .         aye  an    put upon comp li cated documents     said a feegle .      an    summonses and such things     said another .      or    wanted    posters .     said another .      aye  an    bills an    affidavits     said another .      writs of distrainment  even .     the feegles looked around in panic at the very thought of written down things .      they think written words are even more powerful     whispered the toad .     they think all writing is magic .  words worry them .  see their swords .  they glow blue in the presence of lawyers .         all right     said tiffany .     we   re getting somewhere .  i promise not to write his name down .  now tell me about this queen who   s taken wentworth .  queen of what .         canna say it aloud  mistress     said rob anybody .     she hears her name wherever it   s said  and she comes callin    .         actually  that   s true     said the toad .     you do not want to meet her  ever .         she   s bad .         worse .  just call her the queen .         aye  the quin     said rob anybody .  he looked at tiffany with bright  worried eyes .     ye dinna ken o    the quin .  an    you the wean o    granny aching  who had these hills in her bones .  ye dinna ken the ways .  she did not show ye the ways .  ye   re no    a hag .  how can this be .  ye slammered jenny green teeth and stared the heidless horseman in the eyes he hasna got  and you dinna ken .      tiffany gave him a brittle smile and then whispered to the toad     who   s ken .  and what about his dinner .  and what   s a wean of granny aching .         as far as i can make out     said the toad     they   re amazed that you don   t know about the queen and   er  the magical ways  what with you being a child of granny aching and standing up to the monsters .  ken means    know .            and his dinner .         forget about his dinner for now     said the toad .     they thought granny aching told you her magic .  hold me up to your ear  will you .     tiffany did so  and the toad whispered     best not to disappoint them  eh .      she swallowed .     but she never told me about any magic       she began .  and stopped .  it was true .  granny aching hadn   t told her about any magic .  but she showed people magic every day .       there was the time when the baron   s champion hound was caught killing sheep .  it was a hunting dog  after all  but it had got out onto the downs and  because sheep run  it had chased    .   the baron knew the penalty for sheep worrying .  there were laws on the chalk  so old that no one remembered who made them  and everyone knew this one  sheep killing dogs were killed .   but this dog was worth five hundred gold dollars  and so   the story went   the baron sent his servant up onto the downs to granny   s hut on wheels .  she was sitting on the step  smoking her pipe and watching the flocks .   the man rode up on his horse and didn   t bother to dismount .  that was not a good thing to do if you wanted granny aching to be your friend .  iron shod hooves cut the turf .  she didn   t like that .   he said     the baron commands that you find a way to save his dog  mistress aching .  in return  he will give you a hundred silver dollars .      granny had smiled at the horizon  puffed at her pipe for a while  and replied     a man who takes arms against his lord  that man is hanged .  a starving man who steals his lord   s sheep  that man is hanged .  a dog that kills sheep  that dog is put to death .  those laws are on these hills and these hills are in my bones .  what is a baron  that the law be brake for him .      she went back to staring at the sheep .      the baron owns this country     said the servant .     it is his law .      the look granny aching gave him turned the man   s hair white .  that was the story  anyway .  but all stories about granny aching had a bit of fairy tale about them .      if it is  as ye say  his law  then let him break it and see how things may then be     she said .   a few hours later the baron sent his bailiff  who was far more important but had known granny aching for longer .  he said     mrs .  aching  the baron requests that you use your influence to save his dog .  he will happily give you fifty gold dollars to help ease this difficult situation .  i am sure you can see how this will benefit everyone concerned .      granny smoked her pipe and stared at the new lambs and said     ye speak for your master  your master speaks for his dog .  who speaks for the hills .  where is the baron  that the law be brake for him .      they said that when the baron was told this  he went very quiet .  but although he was pompous  and often unreasonable  and far too haughty  he was not stupid .  in the evening he walked up to the hut and sat down on the turf nearby .  after a while granny aching said     can i help you  my lord .         granny aching  i plead for the life of my dog     said the baron .      bring ye siller .  bring ye gilt .     said granny aching .      no silver .  no gold     said the baron .      good .  a law that is brake by siller or gilt is no worthwhile law .  and so  my lord .         i plead  granny aching .         ye try to break the law with a word .         that   s right  granny aching .      granny aching  the story went  stared at the sunset for a while and then said     then be down at the little old stone barn at dawn tomorrow  and we   ll see if an old dog can learn new tricks .  there will be a reckoning .  good night to ye .      most of the village was hanging around the old stone barn the next morning .  granny arrived with one of the smaller farm wagons .  it held a ewe with her newborn lamb .  she put them in the barn .   some of the men turned up with the dog .  it was nervous and snappy  having spent the night chained up in a shed  and kept trying to bite the men who were holding it by two leather straps .  it was hairy .  it had fangs .   the baron rode up with the bailiff .  granny aching nodded at them and opened the barn door .      you   re putting the dog into the barn with a sheep  mrs .  aching .     said the bailiff .     do you want it to choke to death on lamb .      this didn   t get much of a laugh .  no one liked the bailiff much .      we shall see     said granny .  the men dragged the dog to the doorway  threw it inside the barn  and slammed the door quickly .  people rushed to the little windows .   there was the bleating of the lamb  a growl from the dog  and then a baa from the lamb   s mother .  but this wasn   t the normal baa of a sheep .  it had an edge to it .   something hit the door and it bounced on its hinges .  inside  the dog yelped .   granny aching picked up tiffany and held her to a window .   the shaken dog was trying to get to its feet  but it didn   t manage it before the ewe charged again  seventy pounds of enraged sheep slamming into it like a battering ram .   granny lowered tiffany again and lit her pipe .  she puffed it peacefully as the building behind her shook and the dog yelped and whimpered .   after a couple of minutes she nodded at the men .  they opened the door .   the dog came out limping on three legs  but it hadn   t managed to get more than a few feet before the ewe shot out behind it and butted it so hard that it rolled over .   it lay still .  perhaps it had learned what would happen if it tried to get up again .   granny aching had nodded to the men  who picked the sheep up and dragged it back into the barn .   the baron had been watching with his mouth open .      he killed a wild boar last year .     he said .     what did you do to him .         he   ll mend     said granny aching  carefully ignoring the question .        tis mostly his pride that   s hurt .  but he won   t look at a sheep again  you have my thumb on that .     and she licked her right thumb and held it out .   after a moment   s hesitation  the baron licked his thumb  reached down  and pressed it against hers .  everyone knew what it meant .  on the chalk  a thumb bargain was unbreakable .      for you  at a word  the law was brake     said granny aching .     will ye mind that  ye who sit in judgment .  will ye remember this day .  ye   ll have cause to .      the baron nodded to her .      that   ll do     said granny aching  and their thumbs parted .   next day the baron technically did give granny aching gold  but it was only the gold colored foil on an ounce of jolly sailor  the cheap and horrible pipe tobacco that was the only one granny aching would ever smoke .  she was always in a bad mood if the peddlers were late and she   d run out .  you   d couldn   t bribe granny aching for all the gold in the world  but you could definitely attract her attention with an ounce of jolly sailor .   things were a lot easier after that .  the bailiff was a little less unpleasant when rents were late  the baron was a little more polite to people  and tiffany   s father said one night after two beers that the baron had been shown what happens when sheep rise up  and things might be different one day  and her mother hissed at him not to talk like that because you never knew who was listening .   and one day tiffany heard him telling her mother  quietly        twas an old shepherds    trick  that   s all .  an old ewe will fight like a lion for her lamb  we all know that .      that was how it worked .  no magic at all .  but that time it had been magic .  and it didn   t stop being magic just because you found out how it was done    .   the nac mac feegle were watching tiffany carefully  with occasional longing glances at the bottle of special sheep liniment .   i haven   t even found the witches    school  she thought .  i don   t know a single spell .  i don   t even have a pointy hat .  my talents are an instinct for making cheese and not running around panicking when things go wrong .  oh  and i   ve got a toad .   and i don   t understand half of what these little men are saying .  but they know who   s taken my brother .   somehow i don   t think the baron would have a clue how to deal with this .  i don   t  either  but i think i can be clueless in more sensible ways .      i   remember a lot of things about granny aching     she said .     what do you want me to do .         the kelda sent us     said rob anybody .     she sensed the quin comin    .  she kenned there wuz going to be trouble .  she tole us  it   s gonna be bad  find the new hag who   s kin to granny aching  she   ll ken what to do .      tiffany looked at the hundreds of expectant faces .  some of the feegle had feathers in their hair and necklaces of mole teeth .  you couldn   t tell someone with half his face dyed dark blue and a sword as big as he was that you weren   t really a witch .  you couldn   t disappoint someone like that .      and will you help me get my brother back .     she said .  the feegles    expressions didn   t change .  she tried again .     can you help me steal my brother back from the quin .      hundred of small yet ugly faces brightened up considerably .      ach  noo yer talkin    oour language     said rob anybody .      not   quite     said tiffany .     can you all just wait a moment .  i   ll just pack some things     she said  trying to sound as if she knew what she was doing .  she put the cork back on the bottle of special sheep liniment .  the nac mac feegle sighed .   she darted back into the kitchen  took some bandages and ointments out of the medicine box  put the bottle of special sheep liniment into her apron pocket  because her father said it always did him good  and  as an afterthought  added the book diseases of the sheep and picked up the frying pan .  both might come in useful .   the little men were nowhere to be seen when she went back into the dairy .   she knew she ought to tell her parents what was happening .  but it wouldn   t work .  it would be    telling stories .     anyway  with any luck she could get wentworth back before she was even missed .  but  just in case     she kept a diary in the dairy .  cheese needed to be kept track of  and she always wrote down details of the amount of butter she   d made and how much milk she   d been using .   she turned to a fresh page  picked up her pencil  and  with her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth  began to write .   the nac mac feegle gradually reappeared .  they didn   t obviously step out from behind things  and they certainly didn   t pop magically into existence .  they appeared in the same way that faces appear in clouds and fires  they seemed to turn up if you just looked hard enough and wanted to see them .   they watched the moving pencil in awe  and she could hear them murmuring .      look at that writin    stick noo  will ye  bobbin    along .  that   s hag business .         ach  she has the kenning o    the writin     sure enough .         but you   ll no    write doon oour names  eh  mistress .         aye  a body can be put in the pris   n if they have written evidence .      tiffany stopped writing and read the note       dear mum and dad  i have gone to look for wentworth .  i am perfectly probably quite safe  because i am with some friends acquaintances people who knew granny .  ps the cheeses on rack three will need turning tomorrow if i   m not back .     love  tiffany      tiffany looked up at rob anybody  who had shinned up the table leg and was watching the pencil intently  in case it wrote something dangerous .      you could have just come and asked me right at the start     she said .      we didna ken it was thee we were lookin    for  mistress .  lots of bigjob women walkin    aroond this farm .  we didna ken it was thee until you caught daft wullie .      it might not be  thought tiffany .      yes  but stealing the sheep and the eggs  there was no need for that     she said sternly .      but they wasna nailed doon  mistress     said rob anybody  as if that was an excuse .      you can   t nail down an egg .     snapped tiffany .      ach  well  you   d have the kennin    o    wise stuff like that  mistress     said rob anybody .     i see you   s done wi    the writin     so we   d best be goin    .  ye hae a besom .         broomstick     murmured the toad .      er  no     said tiffany .     the important thing about magic     she added haughtily     is to know when not to use it .         fair enough     said rob anybody  sliding back down the table leg .     come here  daft wullie .     one of the feegles who looked very much like that morning   s egg thief came and stood by rob anybody  and they both bent over slightly .     if you   d care to step on us  mistress     said rob anybody .   before tiffany could open her mouth  the toad said out of the corner of its mouth  and being a toad that means quite a lot of corner     one feegle can lift a grown man .  you couldn   t squash one if you tried .         i don   t want to try .      tiffany very cautiously raised a big boot .  daft wullie ran underneath it  and she felt the boot being pushed upward .  she might as well have trodden on a brick .      now t   other wee bootie     said rob anybody .      i   ll fall over .         nae  we   re good at this    .      and then tiffany was standing up on two pictsies .  she felt them moving backward and forward underneath her  keeping her balanced .  she felt quite secure  though .  it was just like wearing really thick soles .      let   s gae     said rob anybody  down below .     an    don   t worry about yon pussycat scraffin    the wee burdies .  some of the lads is stayin    behind to mind things .          ratbag crept along a branch .  he wasn   t a cat who was good at changing the ways he thought .  but he was good at finding nests .  he   d heard the cheeping from the other end of the garden  and even from the bottom of the tree he   d been able to see three little yellow beaks in the nest .  now he advanced  drooling .  nearly there     three nac mac feegle pulled off their straw beaks and grinned happily at him .      hello  mister pussycat     said one of them .     ye dinna learn  do ye .  cheep .          chapter        the green sea      tiffany flew a few inches above the ground  standing still .  wind rushed around her as the feegles sped out of the farmyard   s top gate and onto the turf of the downs    .   this is the girl  flying .  at the moment there   s a toad on her head  holding on to her hair .   pull back  and here is the long green whaleback of the downs .  now she   s a pale blue dot against the endless grass  mowed by the sheep to the height of a carpet .  but the green sea isn   t unbroken .  here and there humans have been .   last year tiffany had spent three carrots and an apple on half an hour of geology  although she   d been refunded a carrot after explaining to the teacher that    geology    shouldn   t be spelled on his sign as    g olly g .     he said that the chalk had been formed underwater millions of years before from tiny seashells .   that made sense to tiffany .  sometimes you found little fossils in the chalk .  but the teacher didn   t know much about the flint .  you found flints  harder than steel  in chalk  the softest of rocks .  sometimes the shepherds chipped the flints  one flint against another  into knives .  not even the best steel knives could take an edge as sharp as flint .   and men in what was called on the chalk    the olden days    had dug pits for it .  they were still there  deep holes in the rolling green  filled with thickets of thorn and brambles .   huge  knobbly flints still turned up in the village gardens .  sometimes they were larger than a man   s head .  they often looked like heads  too .  they were so melted and twisted and curved that you could look at a flint and see almost anything   a face  a strange animal  a sea monster .  sometimes the more interesting ones would be put on garden walls  for show .   the old people called those calkins  which meant    chalk children .     they   d always seemed   odd to tiffany  as if the stone was striving to become alive .  some flints looked like bits of meat  or bones  or something off a butcher   s slab .  in the dark  under the sea  it looked as though the chalk had been trying to make the shapes of living creatures .   there weren   t just the chalk pits .  men had been everywhere on the chalk .  there were stone circles  half fallen down  and burial mounds like green pimples where  it was said  chieftains of the olden days had been buried with their treasure .  no one fancied digging into them to find out .   there were odd carvings in the chalk  too  which the shepherds sometimes weeded when they were out on the downs with the flocks and there was not a lot to do .  the chalk was only a few inches under the turf .  hoofprints could last a season  but the carvings had lasted for thousands of years .  they were pictures of horses and giants  but the strange thing was that you couldn   t see them properly from anywhere on the ground .  they looked as if they   d been made for viewers in the sky .   and then there were the weird places  like old man   s forge  which was just four big flat rocks placed so they made a kind of half buried hut in the side of a mound .  it was only a few feet deep .  it didn   t look like anything special  but if you shouted your name into it  it was several seconds before the echo came back .   there were signs of people everywhere .  the chalk had been important .   tiffany left the shearing sheds way behind .  no one was watching .  sheared sheep took no notice at all of a girl moving without her feet touching the ground .   the lowlands dropped away behind her  and now she was properly on the downs .  only the occasional baa of a sheep or scream of a buzzard disturbed a busy silence  made up of bee buzzes and breezes and the sound of a ton of grass growing every minute .   on either side of tiffany the nac mac feegle ran in a spread out ragged line  staring grimly ahead .   they passed some of the mounds without stopping  and ran up and down the sides of shallow valleys without a pause .  and it was then that tiffany saw a landmark ahead .   it was a small flock of sheep .  there were only a few  freshly sheared  but there were always a handful of sheep at this place .  strays would turn up there  and lambs would find their way to it when they   d lost their mothers .   this was a magic place .   there wasn   t much to see now  just the iron wheels sinking into the turf and the pot bellied stove with its short chimney    .       on the day granny aching died  the men had cut and lifted the turf around the hut and stacked it neatly some way away .  then they   d dug a deep hole in the chalk  six feet deep and six feet long  lifting out the chalk in great damp blocks .   thunder and lightning had watched them carefully .  they didn   t whine or bark .  they seemed more interested than upset .   granny aching had been wrapped in a woolen blanket  with a tuft of raw wool pinned to it .  that was a special shepherd thing .  it was there to tell any gods who might get involved that the person being buried there was a shepherd  and spent a lot of time on the hills  and what with lambing and one thing and another couldn   t always take much time out for religion  there being no churches or temples up there  and therefore it was generally hoped that the gods would understand and look kindly on them .  granny aching  it had to be said  had never been seen to pray to anyone or anything in her life  and it was agreed by all that  even now  she wouldn   t have any time for a god who didn   t understand that lambing came first .   the chalk had been put back over her  and granny aching  who always said that the hills were in her bones  now had her bones in the hills .   then they burned the hut .  that wasn   t usual  but her father had said that there wasn   t a shepherd anywhere on the chalk who   d use it now .   thunder and lightning wouldn   t come when he called  and he knew better than to be angry  so they were left sitting quite contentedly by the glowing embers of the hut .   next day  when the ashes were cold and blowing across the raw chalk  everyone went up onto the downs and with very great care put the turf back  so all that was left to see were the iron wheels on their axles  and the pot bellied stove .   at which point   so everyone said   the two sheepdogs had looked up  their ears pricking  and had trotted away over the turf and were never seen again .       the pictsies carrying her slowed down gently  and tiffany flailed her arms as they dropped her onto the grass .  the sheep lumbered away slowly  then stopped and turned to watch her .      why   re we stopping .  why   re we stopping here .  we   ve got to catch her .         got to wait for hamish  mistress     said rob anybody .      why .  who   s hamish .         he might have the knowin    of where the quin went with your wee laddie     said rob anybody soothingly .     we canna just rush in  ye ken .      a big  bearded feegle raised his hand .     point    o order  big man .  ye can just rush in .  we always just rush in .         aye  big yan  point well made .  but ye gotta know where ye   re just gonna rush in .  ye canna just rush in anywhere .  it looks bad  havin    to rush oout again straight awa    .      tiffany saw that all the feegles were staring intently upward and paying her no attention at all .   angry and puzzled  she sat down on one of the rusty wheels and looked at the sky .  it was better than looking around .  there was granny aching   s grave somewhere around here  although you couldn   t find it now  not precisely .  the turf had healed .   there were a few little clouds above her and nothing else at all  except the distant circling dots of the buzzards .  there were always buzzards over the chalk .   the shepherds had taken to calling them granny aching   s chickens  and some of them called clouds like those up there today    granny   s little lambs .     and tiffany knew that even her father called the thunder    granny aching cussin    .      and it was said that some of the shepherds  if wolves were troublesome in the winter  or a prize ewe had got lost  would go to the site of the old hut in the hills and leave an ounce of jolly sailor tobacco  just in case    .   tiffany hesitated .  then she shut her eyes .  i want that to be true  she whispered to herself .  i want to know that other people think she hasn   t really gone too .   she looked under the wide rusted rim of the wheels and shivered .  there was a brightly colored little packet there .   she picked it up .  it looked quite fresh  so it had probably been there for only a few days .  there was the jolly sailor on the front  with his big grin and big yellow rain hat and big beard  with big blue waves crashing behind him .   tiffany had learned about the sea from granny aching and the jolly sailor wrappings .  she   d heard it was big  and roared .  there was a tower in the sea  which was a lighthouse that carried a big light on it at night to stop boats from crashing into the rocks .  in the pictures the beam of the lighthouse was a brilliant white .  she knew about it so well  she   d dreamed about it  and had woken up with the roar of the sea in her ears .   she   d heard one of her uncles say that if you looked at the tobacco label upside down  then part of the hat and the sailor   s ear and a bit of his collar made up a picture of a woman with no clothes on  but tiffany had never been able to make it out and couldn   t see what the point would be in any case .   she carefully pulled the label off the packet and sniffed at it .  it smelled of granny .  she felt her eyes begin to fill with tears .  she   d never cried for granny aching before  never .  she   d cried for dead lambs and cut fingers and for not getting her own way  but never for granny .  it hadn   t seemed right .   and i   m not crying now  she thought  carefully putting the label in her apron pocket .  not for granny being dead    .       it was the smell .  granny aching smelled of sheep  turpentine  and jolly sailor tobacco .  the three smells mixed together and become one smell  which was  to tiffany  the smell of the chalk .  it followed granny aching like a cloud  and it meant warmth  and silence  and a space around which the whole world revolved    .       a shadow passed overhead .  a buzzard was diving down from the sky toward the nac mac feegle .   she leaped up and waved her arms .     run away .  duck .  it   ll kill you .      they turned and looked at her for a moment as though she   d gone mad .      dinna fash yersel     mistress     said rob anybody .   the bird curved up at the bottom of its dive  and as it climbed again a dot dropped from it .  as it fell  it seemed to grow two wings and started to spin like a sycamore leaf  which slowed down the fall somewhat .   it was a pictsie  still spinning madly when he hit the turf a few feet away  where he fell over .  he got up  swearing loudly  and fell over again .  the swearing continued .      a good landin     hamish     said rob anybody .     the spinnin    certainly slows ye doon .  ye didna drill right into the ground this time hardly at a    .      hamish got up more slowly this time and managed to stay upright .  he had a pair of goggles over his eyes .      i dinna think i can tak    much more o    this     he said  trying to untie a couple of thin bits of wood from his arms .     i feel like a fairy wi    the wings on .         how can you survive that .     tiffany asked .   the very small pilot tried to look her up and down  but only managed to look her up and farther up .      who   s the wee bigjob who knows sich a lot aboot aviation .     he said .   rob anybody coughed .     she   s the hag  hamish .  spawn o    granny aching .      hamish   s expression changed to a look of terror .     i didna mean to speak out o    turn  mistress     he said  backing away .     o    course  a hag   d have the knowing of anythin    .  but    tis nae as bad as it looks  mistress .  i allus make sure i lands on my heid .         aye  we   re very resilient in the heid department     said rob anybody .      have you seen a woman with a small boy .     tiffany demanded .  she hadn   t much liked being called    spawn .      hamish gave rob anybody a panicky look  and rob nodded .      aye  i did     said hamish .     onna black horse .  riding up from the lowlan   s goin    hell for           we dinna use bad language in front o    a hag .     rob anybody thundered .      begging your pardon  mistress .  she was ridin    heck for leather     said hamish  looking more sheepish than the sheep .     but she kenned i was spyin    her and called up a mist .  she   s gone to the other side  but i dinna ken where .            tis a perilous place  the other side     said rob anybody slowly .     evil things there .  a cold place .  not a place to tak    a wee babbie .      it was hot on the downs  but tiffany felt a chill .  however bad it is  she thought  i   m going to have to go there .  i know it .  i don   t have a choice .      the other side .     she said .      aye .  the magic world     said rob anybody .     there   s   bad things there .         monsters .     said tiffany .      as bad as ye can think of     said rob anybody .     exactly as bad as ye can think of .      tiffany swallowed hard and closed her eyes .     worse than jenny .  worse than the headless horseman .     she said .      oh  aye .  they were wee pussycats compared to the scunners over there .     tis an ill fared country that   s come callin     mistress .     tis a land where dreams come true .  that   s the quin   s world .         well  that doesn   t sound too       tiffany began .  then she remembered some of the dreams she   d had  the ones where you were so glad to wake up    .     we   re not talking about nice dreams  are we .     she said .   rob anybody shook his head .     nay  mistress .  the other kind .      and me with my frying pan and diseases of the sheep  thought tiffany .  and she had a mental picture of wentworth among horrible monsters .  they probably wouldn   t have any sweeties at all .   she sighed .     all right     she said .     how do i get there .         ye dinna ken the way .     said rob anybody .   it wasn   t what she   d been expecting .  what she had been expecting was more like    ach  ye canna do that  a wee lass like you  oh deary us no .     she wasn   t so much expecting that as hoping it  in fact .  but  instead  they were acting as if it was a perfectly reasonable idea    .      no .     she said .     i don   t dinna any ken at all .  i haven   t done this before .  please help me .         that   s true  rob     said a feegle .     she   s new to the haggin    .  tak    her to the kelda .         not e   en granny aching ever went to see the kelda in her ain cave .     snapped rob anybody .     it   s no a           quiet .     hissed tiffany .     can   t you hear that .      the feegles looked around .      hear what .     said hamish .      it   s a susurration .      the turf was trembling .  the sky looked as though tiffany was inside a diamond .  and there was the smell of snow .   hamish pulled a pipe out of his waistcoat and blew it .  tiffany couldn   t hear anything  but there was a scream from high above .      i   ll let ye know what   s happenin    .     cried the pictsie  and started to run across the turf .  as he ran  he raised his arms over his head .   he was moving fast by then  but the buzzard sped down and across the turf even faster and plucked him neatly into the air .  as it beat at the air to rise again  tiffany saw hamish climbing up through the feathers .   the other feegles had formed a circle around tiffany  and this time they   d drawn their swords .      whut   s the plan  rob .     said one of them .      okay  lads  this is what we   ll do .  as soon as we see somethin     we   ll attack it .  right .      this caused a cheer .      ach     tis a good plan     said daft wullie .   snow formed on the ground .  it didn   t fall  it   did the opposite of melting  rising up fast until the nac mac feegle were waist deep  and then buried up to their necks .  some of the smaller ones began to disappear  and there was muffled cursing from under the snow .   and then the dogs appeared  lumbering toward tiffany with a nasty purpose .  they were big  black  and heavily built  with orange eyebrows  and she could hear the growling from where she stood .   she plunged her hand into her apron pocket and pulled out the toad .  it blinked in the sharp light .      wazzup .      tiffany turned him around to face the things .     what are these .     she said .      oh  doak .  grimhounds .  bad .  eyes of fire and teeth of razor blades .         what should i do about them .         not be here .         thank you .  you   ve been very helpful .     tiffany dropped him back in her pocket and gripped the frying pan .   it wasn   t going to be good enough  she knew that .  the black dogs were big  and their eyes were flames  and when they opened their mouths to snarl  she could see the light glint on steel .  she   d never been afraid of dogs  but these dogs weren   t from anywhere outside of a nightmare .   there were three of them  but they circled so that no matter how she turned  she could only see two at once .  she knew it would be the one behind her that attacked first .      tell me something more about them .     she said  turning the other way to the circle so that she could watch all three .      said to haunt graveyards .     said a voice from her apron .      why is there snow on the ground .         this has become the queen   s land .  it   s always winter there .  when she puts out her power  it comes here too .      but tiffany could see green some way off  beyond the circle of snow .   think  think     the queen   s land .  a magical place where there really were monsters .  anything you could dream of in nightmares .  dogs with eyes of flame and teeth of razors  yes .  you didn   t get them in the real world  they wouldn   t work    .   they were drooling now  red tongues hanging out  enjoying her fear .  and part of tiffany thought  it   s amazing their teeth don   t rust    .      and took charge of her legs .  she dived between two of the dogs and ran toward the distant green .   there was a growl of triumph behind her  and she heard the crunch of paws on snow .   the green didn   t seem to be getting nearer .   she heard yells from the pictsies and a snarl that turned into a wail  but there was something behind her as she jumped over the last of the snow and rolled on the warm turf .   a grimhound leaped after her .  she jerked herself away as it snapped  but it was already in trouble .   no eyes of fire  no teeth of razors .  not here  not in the real world  on the home turf .  it was blind here and blood was already dripping from its mouth .  you shouldn   t jump with a mouthful of razors    .   tiffany almost felt sorry for it as it whined in pain  but the snow was creeping toward her and she hit the dog with the frying pan .  it went down heavily and lay still .   there was a fight going on back in the snow  which was flying up like a mist  but she could see two dark shapes in the middle  spinning around and snapping .   she banged on the pan and shouted  and a grimhound sprang from the whirling snow and landed in front of her  a feegle hanging from each ear .   the snow flowed toward tiffany .  she backed away  watching the advancing  snarling dog .  she held the pan like a bat .      come on     she whispered .     jump .      the eyes flamed at her  and then the dog looked down at the snow .   and vanished .  the snow sank into the ground .  the light changed .   tiffany and the wee free men were alone on the downs .  feegles were picking themselves up around her .      are you fine  mistress .     said rob anybody .      yes .     said tiffany .     it   s easy .  if you get them off the snow  they   re just dogs .         we   d best move on .  we lost some of the lads .      the excitement drained away .      you mean they   re dead .     tiffany whispered .  the sun was shining brightly again  the skylarks were back   and people were dead .      ach  no     said rob .     we   re the one   s who   s deid .  did ye not know that .          chapter        the shepherdess         you   re dead .     said tiffany .  she looked around .  feegles were picking themselves up and grumbling  but no one was going    waily waily waily .     and rob anybody wasn   t making any sense at all .      well  if you think you   re dead  then what are they .     she went on  pointing to a couple of small bodies .      oh  they   ve gone back to the land o    the livin        said rob anybody cheerfully .     it   s nae as good as this one  but they   ll bide fine and come back before too long .  no sense in grievin    .      the achings were not very religious  but tiffany thought she knew how things ought to go  and they started out with the idea that you were alive and not dead yet .      but you are alive .     she said .      ach  no  mistress     said rob  helping another pictsie to his feet .     we wuz alive .  and we wuz good boys back in the land o    the livin     and so when we died there  we wuz borned into this place .         you mean   you think   that you sort of died somewhere else and then came here .     said tiffany .     you mean this is like   heaven .         aye .  just as advertised .     said rob anybody .     lovely sunshine  good huntin     nice pretty flowers  and wee burdies goin    cheep .         aye  and then there   s the fightin        said another feegle .  and then they all joined in .      an    the stealin    .         an    the drinkin    and fightin    .         an    the kebabs .     said daft wullie .      but there   s bad things here .     said tiffany .     there   s monsters .         aye     said rob  beaming happily .     grand  isn   t it .  everythin    you could ever ask for  even things to fight .         but we live here .     said tiffany .      ach  well  mebbe all you humans wuz good in the last world  too     said rob anybody generously .     i   ll just round up the lads  mistress .      tiffany reached into her apron and pulled out the toad as rob walked away .      oh .  we survived     it said .     amazing .  there are very definite grounds for an action against the owner of those dogs  by the way .         what .     said tiffany  frowning .     what are you talking about .         i   i   don   t know     said the toad .     the thought just popped into my head .  perhaps i knew something about dogs when i was human .         listen  the feegle think they   re in heaven .  they think they died and came here .         and .     said the toad .      well  that can   t be right .  you   re supposed to be alive here and then die and end up in some heaven somewhere else .         well  that   s just saying the same thing in a different way  isn   t it .  anyway  lots of warrior tribes think that when they die  they go to a heavenly land somewhere     said the toad .     you know  where they can drink and fight and feast forever .  so maybe this is theirs .         but this is a real place .         so .  it   s what they believe .  besides  they   re only small .  maybe the universe is a bit crowded and they have to put heavens anywhere there   s room .  i   m a toad  so you   ll appreciate that i   m having to guess a lot here .  maybe they   re just wrong .  maybe you   re just wrong .  maybe i   m just wrong .      a small foot kicked tiffany on the boot .      we   d best be moving on  mistress     said rob anybody .  he had a dead feegle over his shoulder .  quite a few of the others were carrying bodies  too .      er   are you going to bury them .     said tiffany .      aye  they dinna need these ol    bodies noo  an    it   s no    tidy to leave    em lyin    aboot     said rob anybody .     besides  if the bigjobs find little wee skulls and bones aroound  they   ll start to wonder  and we don   t want anyone pokin    aboot .  savin    your presence  mistress     he added .      no  that   s very  er   practical thinking     said tiffany  giving up .   the feegle pointed to a distant mound with a thicket of thorn trees growing on it .  a lot of the mounds had thickets on them .  the trees took advantage of the deeper soil .  it was said to be unlucky to cut them down .      it   s nae very far noo     he said .      you live in one of the mounds .     tiffany asked .     i thought they were  you know  the graves of ancient chieftains .         ach  aye  there   s some ol    dead kingie in the chamber next door  but he   s nae trouble     said rob .     dinna fret  there   s nae skelingtons or any such in oour bit .  it   s quite roomy  we   ve done it up a treat .      tiffany looked up at the endless blue sky over the endlessly green downland .  it was all so peaceful again  a world away from headless men and big savage dogs .   what if i hadn   t taken wentworth down to the river .  she thought .  what would i be doing now .  getting on with the cheese  i suppose    .   i never knew about all this .  i never knew i lived in heaven  even if it   s only heaven to a clan of little blue men .  i didn   t know about people who flew on buzzards .   i never killed monsters before .      where do they come from .     she said .     what   s the name of the place the monsters come from .         ach  ye prob   ly ken the place well     said rob anybody .  as they grew nearer to the mound  tiffany thought she could smell smoke in the air .      do i .     she said .      aye .  but it   s no    a name i   ll say in open air .  it   s a name to be whispered in a safe place .  i   ll no    say it under this sky .          it was too big to be a rabbit hole and badgers didn   t live up here  but the entrance to the mound was tucked among the thorn roots  and no one would have thought it was anything but the home of some kind of animal .   tiffany was slim  but even so she had to take off her apron and crawl on her stomach under the thorns to reach it  dragging the apron behind her .  and it still needed several feegles to push her through .   at least it didn   t smell bad and  once you were through the hole  it opened up a lot .  really  the entrance was just a disguise .  underneath  the space was the size of quite a large room  open in the center but with feegle sized galleries around the walls from floor to ceiling .  they were crowded with pictsies of all sizes  washing clothes  arguing  sewing and  here and there  fighting  and doing everything as loudly as possible .  some had hair and beards tinged with white .  much younger ones  only a few inches tall  were running around with no clothes on  and yelling at one another at the tops of their little voices .  after a couple of years of helping to bring up wentworth  tiffany knew what that was all about .   there were no girls  though .  no wee free women .   no   there was one .   the squabbling  bustling crowds parted to let her through .  she came up to tiffany   s ankle .  she was prettier than the male feegles  although the world was full of things prettier than  say  daft wullie .  but  like them  she had red hair and an expression of determination .   she curtsied  then said     are ye the bigjob hag  mistress .      tiffany looked around .  she was the only person in the cavern who was over seven inches tall .      er  yes     she said .     er   more or less .  yes .         i am fion .  the kelda says to tell you the wee boy will come to nae harm yet .         she   s found him .     said tiffany quickly .     where is he .         nae  nae  but the kelda knows the way of the quin .  she didna want you to fash yersel    on that score .         but she stole him .         aye .     tis comp li cate ed .  rest a wee while .  the kelda will see you presently .  she is   not strong now .      fion turned around with a swirl of skirts  strode back across the chalk floor as if she was a queen herself  and disappeared behind a large round stone that leaned against the far wall .   tiffany  without looking down  carefully lifted the toad out of her pocket and held it close to her lips .     am i fashing myself .     she whispered .      no  not really     said the toad .      you would tell me if i was  wouldn   t you .     said tiffany urgently .     it   d be terrible if everyone could see i was fashing and i didn   t know .         you haven   t a clue what it means  have you    .     said the toad .      not exactly  no .         she just doesn   t want you to get upset  that   s all .         yes  i thought it was probably something like that     lied tiffany .     can you sit on my shoulder .  i think i might need some help here .      the ranks of the nac mac feegle were watching her with interest  but at the moment it appeared that she had nothing to do but hurry up and wait .  she sat down carefully  drumming her fingers on her knees .      whut d   ye think of the wee place  eh .     said a voice from below .     it   s great  yeah .      she looked down .  rob anybody feegle and a few of the pictsies she   d already met were lurking there  watching her nervously .      very   cozy     said tiffany  because that was better than saying    how sooty    or    how delightfully noisy .     she added     do you cook for all of you on that little fire .      the big space in the center held a small fire  under a hole in the roof that let the smoke get lost in the bushes above and in return brought in a little extra light .      aye  mistress     said rob anybody .      the small stuff  bunnies an    that     added daft wullie .     the big stuff we roasts in the chalk pi   mmph mmph           sorry  what was that .     said tiffany .      what .     said rob anybody innocently  his hand firmly over the mouth of the struggling wullie .      what was wullie saying about roasting    big stuff    .     tiffany demanded .     you roast    big stuff    in the chalk pit .  is this the kind of big stuff that goes    baa    .  because that   s the only big stuff you   ll find in these hills .      she knelt down on the grimy floor and brought her face to within an inch of rob anybody   s face  which was grinning madly and sweating .      is it .         ach   ah   weel   in a manner o    speakin              it is .            tis not thine  mistress .     shrieked rob anybody .     we ne   er took an aching ship wi   out the leave o    granny .         granny aching let you have sheep .         aye  she did  did  did that .  as p payment .         payment .  for what .         no aching ship ever got caught by wolves .     rob anybody gabbled .     no foxes took an aching lamb  right .  nor no lamb e   er had its een pecked out by corbies  not wi    hamish up in the sky .      tiffany looked sideways at the toad .      crows     said the toad .     they sometimes peck out the eyes of           yes  yes  i know what they do     said tiffany .  she calmed down a little .     oh .  i see .  you kept away the crows and wolves and foxes for granny  yes .         aye  mistress .  no    just kept    em awa     neither .     said rob anybody triumphantly .     there   s good eatin    on a wolf .         aye  they kebabs up a treat  but they   re no    as good as a ship  tho   mmph mmph       wullie managed  before a hand was clamped over his mouth again .      from a hag ye only tak    what ye   s given     said rob anybody  holding his struggling brother firmly .     since she   s gone  though  weel   we tak    the odd old ewe that would   ve deid anywa     but ne   er one wi    the aching mark  on my honor .         on your honor as a drunken rowdy thief .     said tiffany .   rob anybody beamed .     aye .     he said .     an    i got a lot of good big reputation to protect there .  that   s the truth o    it  mistress .  we keeps an eye on the ships of the hills  in mem   ry o    granny aching  an    in return we tak    what is hardly worth a thing .         and the baccy too  o    course   mmph mmph       and then  once again  daft wullie was struggling to breathe .   tiffany took a deep breath  not a wise move in a feegle colony .  rob anybody grinned nervously .      you take the tobacco .  the tobacco the shepherds leave for   my grandmother .         ach  i forgot about that     squeaked rob anybody .     but we allus wait a few days in case she comes to collect it hersel    .  ye can ne   er tell wi a hag  after all .  and we do mind the ships  mistress .  and she wouldna grudge us  mistress .  many   s a night she   d share a pipe wi    the kelda outside o    her house on the wheelies .  she   d not be one to let good baccy get all rainy .  please  mistress .      tiffany felt intensely angry  and what made it worse was that she was angry with herself .      when we find lost lambs and suchlike  we drives    em here for when the shepherds come lookin        rob anybody added anxiously .   what did i think happened .  tiffany thought .  did i think she   d come back for a packet of jolly sailor .  did i think she was still somehow walking the hills  looking after the sheep .  did i think she   was still here  watching for lost lambs .   yes .  i want that to be true .  i don   t want to think she   s just   gone .  someone like granny aching can   t just   not be there anymore .  and i want her back so much  because she didn   t know how to talk to me and i was too scared to talk to her  and so we never talked and we turned silence into something to share .   i know nothing about her .  just some books  and some stories she tried to tell me  and things i didn   t understand  and i remember big red soft hands and that smell .  i never knew who she really was .  i mean  she must have been nine too  once .  she was sarah grizzel .  she got married and had children  two of them in the shepherding hut .  she must   ve done all sorts of things i don   t know about .   and into tiffany   s mind  as it always did sooner or later  came the figure of the blue and white china shepherdess  swirling in red mists of shame    .       tiffany   s father took her to the fair at the town of yelp one day not long before her seventh birthday  when the farm had some rams to sell .  that was a ten mile journey  the farthest she   d ever been .  it was off the chalk .  everything looked different .  there were far more fenced fields and lots of cows and the buildings had tiled roofs instead of thatch .  she considered that this was foreign travel .   granny aching had never been there  said her father on the way .  she hated leaving the chalk  he said .  she said it made her dizzy .   it was a great day .  tiffany was sick on cotton candy  had her fortune told by a little old lady who said that many  many men would want to marry her  and won the shepherdess  which was made of china painted white and blue .   she was the star prize on the hoop la stall  but tiffany   s father had said that it was all cheating  because the base was so wide that not one throw in a million could ever drop the hoop right over it .   she   d thrown the ring any old how  and it had been the one in a million .  the stall holder hadn   t been very happy about it landing over the shepherdess rather than the gimcrack rubbish in the rest of the stall .  he handed it over when her father spoke sharply to him  though  and she   d hugged it all the way home on the cart  while the stars came out .   next morning she   d proudly presented it to granny aching .  the old woman had taken it very carefully in her wrinkled hands and stared at it for some time .   tiffany was sure  now  that it had been a cruel thing to do .   granny aching had probably never heard of shepherdesses .  people who cared for sheep on the chalk were all called shepherds  and that was all there was to it .  and this beautiful creature was as much unlike granny aching as anything could be .   the china shepherdess had an old fashioned long dress  with the bulgy bits at the side that made it look as though she had saddlebags in her knickers .  there were blue ribbons all over the dress  and all over the rather showy straw bonnet  and on the shepherd   s crook  which was a lot more curly than any crook tiffany had ever seen .   there were even blue bows on the dainty foot poking out from the frilly hem of her dress .   this wasn   t a shepherdess who   d ever worn big old boots stuffed with wool and tramped the hills in the howling wind with the sleet being driven along like nails .  she   d never tried in that dress to pull out a ram who   d got his horns tangled in a thorn patch .  this wasn   t a shepherdess who   d kept up with the champion shearer for seven hours  sheep for sheep  until the air was hazy with grease and wool and blue with cussing  and the champion gave up because he couldn   t cuss sheep as well as granny aching .  no self respecting sheepdog would ever    come by    or    walk up    for a simpering girl with saddlebags in her pants .  it was a lovely thing but it was a joke of a shepherdess  made by someone who   d probably never seen a sheep up close .   what had granny aching thought about it .  tiffany couldn   t guess .  she   d seemed happy  because it   s the job of grandmothers to be happy when grandchildren give them things .  she   d put it up on her shelf and then taken tiffany on her knee and called her    my little jiggit    in a nervous sort of way  which she did when she was trying to be grandmotherly .   sometimes  in the rare times granny was down at the farm  tiffany would see her take down the statue and stare at it .  but if she saw tiffany watching  she   d put it back quickly and pretend she   d meant to pick up the sheep book .   perhaps  tiffany thought wretchedly  the old lady had seen it as a sort of insult .  perhaps she thought she was being told that this was what a shepherdess should look like .  she shouldn   t be an old lady in a muddy dress and big boots  with an old sack around her shoulders to keep the rain off .  a shepherdess should sparkle like a starry night .  tiffany hadn   t meant to  she   d never meant to  but perhaps she had been telling granny that she wasn   t    right .   and then a few months after that granny had died  and in the years since then everything had gone wrong .  wentworth had been born  and then the baron   s son had vanished  and then there had been that bad winter when mrs .  snapperly died in the snow .   tiffany kept worrying about the statue .  she couldn   t talk about it .  everyone else was busy  or not interested .  everyone was edgy .  they   d have said that worrying about a silly statue was   silly .   several times she nearly smashed the shepherdess  but she didn   t because people would notice .   she wouldn   t have given something as wrong as that to granny aching now  of course .  she   d grown up .   she remembered that the old lady would smile oddly  sometimes  when she looked at the statue .  if only she   d said something .  but granny liked silence .       and now it turned out that she made friends with a lot of little blue men  who walked the hills looking after the sheep  because they liked her  too .  tiffany blinked .   it made a kind of sense .  in memory of granny aching  the men left the tobacco .  and in memory of granny aching  the nac mac feegle minded the sheep .  it all worked  even if it wasn   t magic .  but it took granny away .      daft wullie .     she said  staring hard at the struggling pictsie and trying not to cry .      mmph .         is it true what rob anybody told me .         mmph .     daft wullie   s eyebrows went up and down furiously .      mr .  feegle  you can please take your hand away from his mouth     said tiffany .  daft wullie was released .  rob anybody had looked worried  but daft wullie was terrified .  he dragged his hat off and stood holding it in his hands  as if it was some kind of shield .      is all that true  daft wullie .     said tiffany .      oh waily waily           just a simple yes or   a simple aye or nay  please .         aye .  it is .     blurted out daft wullie .     oh waily waily           yes  thank you     said tiffany  sniffing and trying to blink the tears away .     all right .  i understand .      the feegles eyed her cautiously .      ye   re nae gonna get nasty aboot it .     said rob anybody .      no .  it all   works .      she heard it echo around the cavern  the sound of hundreds of little men sighing with relief .      she didna turn me intae a pismire .     said daft wullie  grinning happily at the rest of the pictsies .     hey  lads  i talked wi    the hag and she didna e   en look at me crosswise .  she smiled at me .     he beamed at tiffany and went on     an    d   ye ken  mistress  that if   n you hold the baccy label upside doon  then part o    the sailor   s bonnet and his ear became a lady wi    nae mmph mmph           ach  there i goes again  accidentally nearly throttlin    ye     said rob anybody  his hand clamping over wullie   s mouth .   tiffany opened her mouth  but stopped when her ears tickled strangely .   in the roof of the cave  several bats woke up and hastily flew out of the smoke hole .   some of the feegles were busy on the far side of the chamber .  what tiffany had thought was a strange round stone was being rolled aside  revealing a large hole .   now her ears squelched and felt as though all the wax was running out .  the feegles were forming up in two rows  leading to the hole .   tiffany prodded the toad .     do i want to know what a pismire is .     she whispered .      it   s an ant     said the toad .      oh .  i   m   slightly surprised .  and this sort of high pitched noise .         i   m a toad .  we   re not good at ears .  but it   s probably him over there .      there was a feegle walking out of the hole from which came  now that tiffany   s eyes had become accustomed to the gloom  a faint golden light .   the newcomer   s hair was white instead of red  and while he was tall for a pictsie  he was as skinny as a twig .  he was holding some sort of fat skin bag  bristling with pipes .      now there   s a sight i don   t reckon many humans have seen and lived     said the toad .     he   s playing the mousepipes .         they make my ears tingle .     tiffany tried to ignore the two little ears still on the bag of pipes .      high pitched  see .     said the toad .     of course  the pictsies hear sounds differently than humans do .  he   s probably their battle poet  too .         you mean he makes up heroic songs about famous battles .         no  no .  he recites poems that frighten the enemy .  remember how important words are to the nac mac feegle .  well  when a well trained gonnagle starts to recite  the enemy   s ears explode .  ah  it looks as though they   re ready for you .      in fact rob anybody was tapping politely on tiffany   s toecap .     the kelda will see you now  mistress     he said .   the piper had stopped playing and was standing respectfully beside the hole .  tiffany felt hundreds of bright little eyes watching her .      special sheep liniment     whispered the toad .      pardon .         take it in with us     the toad said insistently .     it   d be a good gift .      the pictsies watched her carefully as she lay down again and crawled through the hole behind the stone  the toad hanging on tightly .  as she got closer  she realized that what she   d thought was a stone was an old round shield  green blue and corroded with age .  the hole it had covered was indeed wide enough for her to go through  but she had to leave her legs outside because it was impossible to get all of her into the room beyond .  one reason was the bed  small though it was  which held the kelda .  the other reason was that what the room was mostly full of  piled up around the walls and spilling across the floor  was gold .       chapter        first sight and second thoughts      glint  glisten  glitter  gleam     tiffany thought a lot about words  in the long hours of churning butter .     onomatopoeic     she   d discovered in the dictionary  meant words that sounded like the noise of the thing they were describing  like cuckoo .  but she thought there should be a word meaning a word that sounds like the noise a thing would make if that thing made a noise even though  actually  it doesn   t  but would if it did .   glint  for example .  if light made a noise as it reflected off a distant window  it   d go glint .  and the light of tinsel  all those little glints chiming together  would make a noise like glitterglitter .  gleam was a clean  smooth noise from a surface that intended to shine all day .  and glisten was the soft  almost greasy sound of something rich and oily .   the little cave contained all of these at once .  there was only one candle  which smelled of sheep fat  but gold plates and cups gleamed  glistened  glinted  and glittered the light back and forth until the one little flame filled the air with a light that even smelled expensive .   the gold surrounded the bed of the kelda  who was sitting up against a pile of pillows .  she was much  much fatter than the male pictsies  she looked as if she   d been made of round balls of slightly squashy dough  and was the color of chestnuts .   her eyes were closed as tiffany slid in  but they flicked open the moment she   d stopped pulling herself forward .  they were the sharpest eyes she   d ever seen  much sharper even than miss tick   s .      soo   you   ll be sarah aching   s wee girl .     said the kelda .      yes .  i mean  aye     said tiffany .  it wasn   t very comfortable lying on her stomach .     and you   re the kelda .         aye .  i mean  yes     said the kelda  and the round face became a mass of lines as the kelda smiled .     what was your name  now .         tiffany  er  kelda .     fion had turned up from some other part of the cave and was sitting down on a stool by the bed  watching tiffany intently with a disapproving expression .      a good name .  in our tongue you   d be tir far th  inn  land under wave     said the kelda .  it sounded like    tiffan .         i don   t think anyone meant to name           ach  what people mean to do and what is done are two different things     said the kelda .  her little eyes shone .     your wee brother is   safe  child .  ye could say he   s safer where he is noo than he has ever been .  no mortal ills can touch him .  the quin wouldna harm a hair o    his heid .  and there   s the evil o    it .  help me up here  girl .      fion leaped up immediately and helped the kelda struggle up higher among her cushions .      where wuz i .     the kelda continued .     ah  the wee laddie .  aye  ye could say he bides well where he is  in the quin   s own country .  but i daresay there   s a mother grievin    .         and our father  too     said tiffany .      an    his wee sister .     said the kelda .   tiffany felt the words yes  of course trot automatically onto her tongue .  she also knew that it would be very stupid to let them go any further .  the little old woman   s dark eyes were seeing right into her head .      aye  you   re a born hag  right enough     said the kelda  holding her gaze .     ye got that little bitty bit inside o    you that holds on  right .  the bitty bit that watches the rest o    ye .     tis the first sight and second thoughts ye have  and    tis a wee gift an    a big curse to ye .  you see and hear what others canna  the world opens up its secrets to ye  but ye   re always like the person at the party with the wee drink in the corner who canna join in .  there   s a little bitty bit inside ye that willna melt and flow .  ye   re sarah aching   s line  right enough .  the lads fetched the right one .      tiffany didn   t know what to say to that  so she didn   t say anything .  the kelda watched her  eyes twinkling  until tiffany felt awkward .      why would the queen take my brother .     she asked eventually .     and why is she after me .         ye think she is .         well  yes  actually .  i mean  jenny might have been a coincidence  but the horseman .  and the grimhounds .  and taking wentworth .         she   s bending her mind to ye     said the kelda .     when she does  something of her world passes into this one .  mebbe she just wants to test you .         test me .         to see how good you are .  ye   re the hag noo  the witch who guards the edges and the gateways .  so wuz yer granny  although she wouldna ever call hersel    one .  and so wuz i until noo  and i   ll pass the duty to ye .  she   ll ha    to get past ye  if she wants this land .  ye have the first sight and the second thoughts  just like yer granny .  that   s rare in a bigjob .         don   t you mean second sight .     tiffany asked .     like people who can see ghosts and stuff .         ach  no .  that   s typical bigjob thinking .  first sight is when you can see what   s really there  not what your heid tells you ought to be there .  ye saw jenny  ye saw the horseman  ye saw them as real thingies .  second sight is dull sight  it   s seeing only what you expect to see .  most bigjobs ha    that .  listen to me  because i   m fadin    noo and there   s a lot you dinna ken .  ye think this is the whole world .  that is a good thought for sheep and mortals who dinna open their eyes .  because in truth there are more worlds than stars in the sky .  understand .  they are everywhere  big and small  close as your skin .  they are everywhere .  some ye can see an    some ye canna  but there are doors  tiffan .  they might be a hill or a tree or a stone or a turn in the road  or they might e   en be a thought in yer heid  but they are there  all aroound ye .  you   ll have to learn to see    em  because you walk among them and dinna know it .  and some of them   is poisonous .      the kelda stared at tiffany for a moment and then continued     ye asked why the quin should take your boy .  the quin likes children .  she has none o    her own .  she dotes on them .  she   ll give the wee boy everything he wants  too .  only what he wants .         he only wants sweets .     said tiffany .      is that so .  an    did ye gi    them to him .     asked the kelda  as if she was looking into tiffany   s mind .     but what he needs is love an    care an    teachin    an    people sayin    no to him sometimes an    things o    that nature .  he needs to be growed up strong .  he willna get that fra    the quin .  he willna grow up .  he   ll get sweeties .  forever .      tiffany wished the kelda would stop looking at her like that .     but i see he has a sister willin    to take any pains to bring him back     said the little old woman  taking her eyes away from tiffany .     what a lucky wee boy he is  to be so fortunate .  ye ken how to be strong  do ye .         yes  i think so .         good .  d   ye ken how to be weak .  can ye bow to the gale  can ye bend to the storm .     the kelda smiled again .     nay  ye needna answer that .  the wee burdie always has tae leap from the nest to see if it can fly .  anyway  ye have the feel o    sarah aching about ye  and no word e   en o    mine could turn her once she had set her mind to something .  ye   re no   a woman yet  and that   s no    bad thing  because where ye   ll be goin    is easy for children  hard for adults .         the world of the queen .     ventured tiffany  trying to keep up .      aye .  i can feel it noo  lyin    over this one like a fog  as far awa    as the other side o    a mirror .  i   m weakenin     tiffan .  i canna defend this place .  so here is my bargain  child .  i   ll point ye toward the quin an     in return  ye   ll tak    over as kelda .      that surprised fion as much as tiffany .  her head shot up sharply and her mouth opened  but the kelda had raised a wrinkled hand .      when ye are a kelda somewhere  my girl  ye   ll expect people to do your biddin    .  so dinna give me the argument .  that   s my offer  tiffan .  ye won   t get a better .         but she canna       fion began .      can she not .     said the kelda .      she   s nae a pictsie  mother .         she   s a bit on the large side  aye     said the kelda .     dinna fret  tiffan .  it willna be for long .  i just need ye to mind things for a wee while .  mind the land like yer granny did  and mind my boys .  then when yer wee boy is back home  hamish   ll fly up to the mountains and let it be known that the chalk hill clan has want o    a kelda .  we   ve got a good place here  and the girls   ll come flockin    .  what d   ye say .         she disna know our ways .     fion protested .     ye   re overtired  mother .         aye  i am     said the kelda .     but a daughter canna run her mother   s clan  ye know that .  ye   re a dutiful girl  fion  but it   s time ye were picking    your bodyguard and going awa    seeking a clan of your own .  ye canna stay here .     the kelda looked up at tiffany again .     will ye  tiffan .     she held up a thumb the size of a match head and waited .      what will i have to do .     said tiffany .      the thinkin        said the kelda  still holding up her thumb .     my lads are good lads  there   s none braver .  but they think their heids is most useful as weapons .  that   s lads for ye .  we pictsies aren   t like you big folk  ye ken .  ye have many sisters .  fion here has none .  she   s my only daughter .  a kelda might be blessed wi    only one daughter in her whole life  but she   ll have hundreds and hundreds o    sons .         they are all your sons .     said tiffany  aghast .      oh aye     said the kelda  smiling .     oh  dinna look so astonished .  the bairns are really wee when they   re borned  like little peas in a pod .  and they grow up fast .     she sighed .     but sometimes i think all the brains is saved for the daughters .  they   re good boys  but they   re no    great thinkers .  you   ll have to help them help ye .         mother  she canna carry oot the duties o    a kelda .     fion protested .      i don   t see why not  if they   re explained to me     said tiffany .      oh  do you not .     said fion sharply .     weel  that   s gonna be most interesting .         i recall sarah aching talkin    aboot ye     said the kelda .     she said ye were a strange wee one  always watchin    and listenin    .  she said ye had a heid full o   words that ye ne   er spoke aloud .  she wondered what   d become o    ye .  time for ye to find oot  aye .      aware of fion glaring at her  and maybe because of fion glaring at her  tiffany licked her thumb and touched it gently against the kelda   s tiny thumb .      it is done  then     said the kelda .  she lay back suddenly  and just as suddenly seemed to shrink .  there were more lines in her face now .     never let it be said i left my sons wi   oot a kelda to mind them     she muttered .     now i can go back to the last world .  tiffan is the kelda for now  fion .  in her hoose  ye   ll do what she says .      fion looked down at her feet .  tiffany could see that she was angry .   the kelda lay back .  she beckoned tiffany closer  and in a weaker voice said     there .     tis done .  and now for my part o    the bargain .  listen .  find   the place where the time disna fit .  there   s the way in .  it   ll shine out to ye .  bring him back to ease yer puir mother   s heart and mebbe also your ain head        her voice faltered  and fion leaned quickly toward the bed .   the kelda sniffed .   she opened one eye .      not quite yet     she murmured to fion .     do i smell a wee drop of special sheep liniment on ye  kelda .      tiffany looked puzzled for a moment and then said     oh  me .  oh .  yes .  er   here    .      the kelda struggled to sit up again .     the best thing humans ever made     she said .     i   ll just have a large wee drop  fion .         it puts hairs on your chest     tiffany warned .      ach  weel  for a drop of sarah aching   s special sheep liniment i   ll risk a curl or two     said the old kelda .  she took from fion a leather cup about the size of a thimble and held it up .      i dinna think it would be good for ye  mother     said fion .      i   ll be the judge o    that at this time     said the kelda .     one drop afore i go  please  kelda tiffan .      tiffany tipped the bottle slightly .  the kelda shook the cup irritably .      it was a larger drop i had in mind  kelda     she said .     a kelda has a generous heart .      she took something too small to be a gulp but too large to be a sip .      aye  it   s a lang time since i tasted this brose     she said .     your granny and i used to ha    a sip or two in front o    the fire on cold nights    .      tiffany saw it clearly in her head  granny aching and this little fat woman  sitting around the pot bellied stove in the hut on wheels  while the sheep grazed under the stars .      ah  ye can see it     said the kelda .     i can feel yer eyes on me .  that   s the first sight workin    .     she lowered the cup .     fion  go and fetch rob anybody and william the gonnagle .         the bigjob is blockin    the hole     said fion sulkily .      i daresay there   s room to wriggle past     said the old kelda in the kind of calm voice that said a stormy voice could follow if people didn   t do what they were told .   with a smoldering glance at tiffany  fion squeezed past .      ye ken anyone who keeps bees .     said the kelda .  when tiffany nodded  the little old woman went on     then you   ll know why we dinna have many daughters .  you canna ha    two quins in one hive wi   oot a big fight .  fion must take her pick o    them that will follow her and seek a clan that needs a kelda .  that is our way .  she thinks there   s another way  as gels sometimes do .  be careful o    her .      tiffany felt something move past her  and rob anybody and the bard came into the room .  there was more rustling and whispering  too .  an unofficial audience was gathering outside .   when things had settled down a little  the old kelda said     it is a bad thing for a clan to left wi   oot a kelda to watch o   er it e   en for an hour .  so tiffan will be your kelda until a new one can be fetched .      there was a murmur beside and behind tiffany .  the old kelda looked at william the gonnagle .      am i right that this has been done before .     she said .      aye .  the songs say twice before     said william .  he frowned  and added     or you could say it was three times if you include the time when the quin was        he was drowned out by the cry that went up behind tiffany      nae quin .  nae king .  nae laird .  nae master .  we willna be fooled again .      the old kelda raised a hand .     tiffan is the spawn of granny aching     she said .     ye all ken of her .         aye  and ye saw the wee hag stare the heidless horseman in the eyes he hasna got     said rob anybody .     not many people can do that .         and i have been your kelda for seventy years and my words canna be gainsaid     said the old kelda .     so the choice is made .  i tell ye  too  that ye   ll help her steal back her wee baby brother .  that is the fate i lay on you all in memory of me and sarah aching .      she lay back in her bed and in a quieter voice added     an    now i would have the gonnagle play    the bonny flowers     and hope to see yez all again in the last world .  to tiffan i say be wary .     the kelda took a deep breath .     somewhere  a    stories are real  a    songs are true    .      the old kelda fell silent .  william the gonnagle inflated the bag of his mousepipes and blew into one of the tubes .  tiffany felt the bubbling in her ears of music too high pitched to hear .   after a few moments fion leaned over the bed to look at her mother  then started to cry .   rob anybody turned and looked up at tiffany  his eyes running with tears .     could i just ask ye to go out intae the big chamber  kelda .     he said  quietly .     we ha    things to do  ye ken how it is    .      tiffany nodded and  with great care  feeling pictsies scuttle out of her way  backed out of the room .  she found a corner where she didn   t seem to be in anyone   s way and sat there with her back to the wall .   she   d expected a lot of    waily waily waily     but it seemed the death of the kelda was too serious for that .  some feegles were crying  and some were staring at nothing  and as the news spread  the tiered hall filled up with a wretched  sobbing silence    .          the hills had been silent on the day granny aching died .   someone went up every day with fresh bread and milk and scraps for the dogs .  it didn   t need to be quite so often  but tiffany had heard her parents talking and her father had said     we ought to keep an eye on mam now .      today had been tiffany   s turn  but she   d never thought of it as a chore .  she liked the journey .   but she   d noticed the silence .  it was no longer the silence of many little noises  but a dome of quiet all around the hut .   she knew then  even before she went in at the open door and found granny lying on the narrow bed .   she   d felt coldness spread though her .  it even had a sound   it was like a thin  sharp musical note .  it had a voice  too .  her own voice .  it was saying  it   s too late  tears are no good  no time to say anything  there are things to be done .   and   then she fed the dogs  who were waiting patiently for their breakfast .  it would have helped if they   d done something soppy  like whine or lick granny   s face  but they hadn   t .  and still tiffany heard the voice in her mind  no tears  don   t cry .  don   t cry for granny aching .   now  in her head  she watched the slightly smaller tiffany move around the hut like a little puppet .   she   d tidied up the hut .  besides the bed and the stove there really wasn   t much there .  there was the clothes sack and the big water barrel and the food box  and that was it .  oh  stuff to do with sheep was all over the place   pots and bottles and sacks and knives and shears   but there was nothing there that said a person lived here  unless you counted the hundreds of blue and yellow jolly sailor wrappers pinned on one wall .   she   d taken one of them down   it was still underneath her mattress at home   and remembered the story .   it was very unusual for granny aching to say more than a sentence .  she used words as if they cost money .  but there   d been one day when she   d taken food up to the hut  and granny had told her a story .  a sort of a story .  she   d unwrapped the tobacco  and looked at the wrapper  and then looked at tiffany with that slightly puzzled look she used  and said     i must   ve looked at a thousand o    these things  and i never once saw his bo ut .     that was how she pronounced boat .   of course tiffany had rushed to have a look at this label  but she couldn   t see any boat  any more than she could see the naked lady .      that   s    cause the bo ut is just where you can   t see it     granny had said .     he   s got a bo ut for chasin    the great white whale fish on the salt sea .  he   s always chasing it  all round the world .  it   s called mopey .  it   s a beast like a big cliff of chalk  i heard tell .  in a book .         why   s he chasing it .     tiffany had asked .      to catch it     granny had said .     but he never will  the reason being  the world is round like a big plate and so is the sea  and so they   re chasing one another  so it is almost like he is chasing hisself .  ye never want to go to sea  jiggit .  that   s where worse things happen .  everyone says that .  you stop along here  where   s the hills is in yer bones .      and that was it .  it was one of the very few times granny aching had ever said anything to tiffany that wasn   t  in some way  about sheep .  it was the only time she ever acknowledged that there was a world beyond the chalk .  tiffany used to dream about the jolly sailor chasing the whale fish in his boat .  and sometimes the whale fish would chase her  but the jolly sailor always arrived in his mighty ship just in time and their chase would start again .   sometimes she   d run to the lighthouse  and wake up just as the door swung open .  she   d never seen the sea  but one of the neighbors had an old picture on the wall that showed a lot of men clinging to a raft in what looked like a huge lake full of waves .  she hadn   t been able to see the lighthouse at all .   and tiffany had sat by the narrow bed and thought about granny aching  and about the little girl sarah grizzel very carefully painting the flowers in the book  and about the world losing its center .   she missed the silence .  what there was now wasn   t the same kind of silence there had been before .  granny   s silence was warm  and brought you inside .  granny aching might sometimes have had trouble remembering the difference between children and lambs  but in her silence you were welcome and belonged .  all you had to bring was a silence of your own .   tiffany wished that she   d had a chance to say sorry about the shepherdess .   then she   d gone home and told everyone that granny was dead .  she was seven  and the world had ended .   someone was tapping politely on her boot .  she opened her eyes and saw the toad .  it was holding a small rock in its mouth .  it spat it out .      sorry about that     it said .     i   d have used my arms  but we   re a very soggy species .         what am i supposed to do .     said tiffany .      well  if you hit your head on this low ceiling  you would have a definite claim for damages     said the toad .     er   did i just say that .         yes  and i hope you wish you hadn   t     said tiffany .     why did you say it .         i don   t know  i don   t know     moaned the toad .     sorry  what were we talking about .         i meant what do the pictsies want me to do now .         oh  i don   t think it works like that     said the toad .     you   re the kelda .  you say what   s to be done .         why can   t fion be kelda .  she   s a pictsie .         can   t help you there     said the toad .      can i be of serrrvice .     said a voice by tiffany   s ear .   she turned her head and saw  on one of the galleries that ran around the cave  william the gonnagle .   up close  he was noticeably different from the other feegles .  his hair was neater  and braided into one pigtail .  he didn   t have as many tattoos .  he spoke differently too  more clearly and slowly than the others  sounding his rs like a drumroll .      er  yes     said tiffany .     why can   t fion be kelda here .      william nodded .     a good question     he said politely .     but  ye ken  a kelda cannot wed her brrrrotherrrr .  she must go to a new clan and wed a warrrrior there .         well  why couldn   t that warrior come here .         because the feegles here would not know him .  they   d have no rrrrespect for him .     william made    respect    sound like an avalanche .      oh .  well   what was that about the queen .  you were going to say something and they stopped you .      william looked embarrassed .     i don   t think i can tell you aboot           i am the temporary kelda     said tiffany stiffly .      aye .  well   there was a time when we lived in the queen   s world and served her  before she grew so cold .  but she tricked us  and we rrrrebelled .  it was a dark time .  she does not like us .  and that is all i will say     william added .   tiffany watched feegles going in and out of the kelda   s chamber .  something was going on in there .      they   re burying her in the other part of the mound     said william without being asked .     wi    the other keldas o    this clan .         i thought they would be more   noisy     said tiffany .      she was their motherrr     said william .     they do not want to shout .  their hearts are too full for worrrrds .  in time we will hold a wake to help her back to the land o    the living  and that   ll be a loud one  i can promise ye .  we   ll dance the fivehundredandtwelvesome reel to the tune o       the devil among the lawyers    and eat and drink  and i daresay my nephews will ha    headaches the size o    a sheep .     the old feegle smiled briefly .     but for now  each feegle remembers her in silence .  we dinna mourn like ye do  ye ken .  we mourn for them that has tae stay behind .         was she your mother too .     said tiffany quietly .      nay .  she was my sister .  did she no    tell ye that when a kelda goes to a new clan  she takes a few o    her brothers with her .  to be alone among strangers would be too much for a heart to bear .     the gonnagle sighed .     of course  in time  after the kelda weds  the clan is full of her sons and is no    so lonely for her .         it must be for you  though     said tiffany .      you   re a quick one  i   ll grant ye that     said william .     i am the last o    those who came .  when this is o   er  i   ll seek the leave of the next kelda to return to my ain folk in the mountains .  this is a fiiine fat country and this is a fiiine bonny clan my nephews have  but i would like to die in the heather where i was borrrned .  if you will excuse me  kelda        he walked away and was lost in the shadows of the mound .   tiffany suddenly wanted to go home .  perhaps it was just william   s sadness  but now she felt shut up in the mound .      i   ve got to get out of here     she muttered .      good idea     said the toad .     you   ve got to find the place where the time is different  for one thing .         but how can i do that .     wailed tiffany .     you can   t see time .      she stuck her arms through the entrance hole and pulled herself up into the fresh air .   there was a big old clock in the farmhouse  and the time on it got set once a week .  that is  when her father went to the market in creel springs  he made a note of the position of the hands on the big clock there  and when he got home  he moved the hands on their clock to the same position .  it was really just for show  anyway .  everyone took their time from the sun  and the sun couldn   t go wrong .   now tiffany lay among the trunks of the old thorn bushes  whose leaves rustled continuously in the breeze .  the mound was like a little island in the endless turf  late primroses and even a few ragged foxgloves grew up here in the shelter of the thorn roots .      she could have just told me where to look     she said .      but she didn   t know where it would be     said the toad .     she just knew the signs to look for .      tiffany rolled over carefully and stared up at the sky between the low branches .  it   ll shine out  the kelda had said    .      i think i ought to talk to hamish     she said .      right ye are  mistress     said a voice by her ear .  she turned her head .      how long have you been there .     she said .      a    the time  mistress     said the pictsie .  others poked their heads around the trees and out from under leaves .  there were at least twenty on the mound .      you   ve been watching me all the time .         aye  mistress .     tis oour task to watch o   er our kelda .  i   m up here most o    the time anyway  because i   m studying to become a gonnagle .     the young feegle flourished a set of mousepipes .     an    they willna let me play doon there on account o    them sayin    my playin    sounds like a spider tryin    to fart through its ears  mistress .         but what happens if i want to spend a   have a   go to the   what happens if i say i don   t want you to guard me .         if it   s a wee call o    nature ye   re talkin    aboout  mistress  the cludgie is o   er there in the chalk pit .  ye   ll just sing oot to us where ye   re goin    and no one   ll go peeking  ye   ll have oour word on it     said the attendant feegle .   tiffany glared at him as he stood in the primroses  beaming with pride and anxious duty .  he was younger than most of them  without as many scars and lumps .  even his nose wasn   t broken .      what   s your name  pictsie .     she said .      no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  mistress .  there   s no    that many feegle names  ye ken  so we ha    to share .         well  not as big as little jock       tiffany began .      that   d be medium sized jock  mistress     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .      well  not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock  i can           that   s no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  mistress     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .     ye were one jock short     he added helpfully .      you wouldn   t be happier with  say  henry .     said tiffany  helplessly .      ach  nay  mistress .     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock wrinkled his face .     there   s nay history tae the name  ye ken .  but there have been a number o    brave warriors called no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .  why     tis nearly as famous a name as wee jock itself .  an     o    course  should wee jock hisself be taken back to the last world  then i   ll get the name o   wee jock  which isna to say that i mislike the name o    no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  ye ken .  there   s been many a fine story o    the exploits o    no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock     the pictsie added  looking so earnest that tiffany didn   t have the heart to say that they must have been very long stories .   instead she said     well  er  please  i want to talk to hamish the aviator .         nae problem     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .     he   s up there right noo .      he vanished .  a moment later tiffany heard   or  rather  felt with her ears   the bubbling sensation of a feegle whistle .   tiffany pulled diseases of the sheep  which was now looking very battered  out of her apron .  there was a blank page at the back .  she tore it out  feeling like a criminal for doing so  and took out her pencil .      dear mum and dad     she wrote carefully .     how are you  i am well .  wentworth is also well but i have to go and fetch him from the qu where he is staying .  hope to be back soon  tiffany .  ps i hope the cheese is all right .      she was just considering this when she heard a rush of wings overhead .  there was a whirring noise  a moment of silence  and then a small  weary  and rather muffled voice said     ach  crivens        she looked out onto the turf .  the body of hamish was upside down a few feet away .  his arms with their twirlers were still outstretched .    it took some time to get him out .  if he landed headfirst and spinning  tiffany was told  he had to be unscrewed in the opposite direction so that his ears wouldn   t come off .   when he was upright and swaying unsteadily  tiffany said     can you wrap this letter in a stone and drop it in front of the farmhouse where people will see it .         aye  mistress .         and   er   does it hurt when you land headfirst like that .         nay  mistress  but it is awfu    embarrassing .         then there   s a sort of toy we used to make that might help you     said tiffany .     you make a kind of   bag of air           bag o    air .     said the aviator  looking puzzled .      well  you know how things like shirts billow out on a clothesline when it   s windy .  well  you just make a cloth bag and tie some strings to it and a stone to the strings  and when you throw it up  the bag fills with air and the stone floats down .      hamish stared at her .      do you understand me .     said tiffany .      oh  aye .  i wuz just waitin    to see if you wuz goin    to tell me anything else     said hamish politely .      do you think you could  er  borrow some fine cloth .         nay  mistress  but i ken well where i can steal some     said hamish .   tiffany decided not to comment on this .  she said     where was the queen when the mist came down .      hamish pointed .     aboot a half mile yonder  mistress .      in the distance tiffany could see some more mounds  and a few stones from the old days .   trilithons  they were called  which just meant    three stones .     the only stones found naturally on the downs were flints .  but the giant stones of the trilithons had been dragged from at least ten miles away  and were stacked like a child stacks toy bricks .  here and there the big stones had been stood in circles  sometimes one stone had been placed all alone .  it must have taken a lot of people a long time to do all that .  some people said there   d been human sacrifices up there .  some said they were part of some old religion .  some said they marked ancient graves .   some said they were a warning  avoid this place .   tiffany hadn   t .  she   d been there with her sisters a few times  as a dare  just in case there were any skulls .  but the mounds around the stones were thousands of years old .  all that you found there now were rabbit holes .      anything else  mistress .     said hamish politely .     nay .  then i   ll just be goin       .      he raised his arms over his head and started to run across the turf .  tiffany jumped as the buzzard skimmed down a few feet away from her and snatched him back up into the sky .      how can a man six inches high train a bird like that .     she asked as the buzzard circled again for height .      ach  all it takes is a wee drop o    kindness  mistress     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .      really .         aye  an    a big dollop o    cruelty     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock said .     hamish trains    em by runnin    aroound in a rabbit skin until a bird pounces on him .         that sounds awful .     said tiffany .      ach  he   s not too nasty aboot it .  he just knocks them out wi    his heid  and then he   s got a special oil he makes which he blows up their beak     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock went on .     when they wakes up  they thinks he   s their mammy and   ll do his biddin    .      the buzzard was already a distant speck .      he hardly seems to spend any time on the ground .     said tiffany .      oh  aye .  he sleeps in the buzzard   s nest at night  mistress .  he says it   s wunnerfully warm .  an    he spends all his time in the air     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock added .     he   s ne   er happy unless he   s got the wind under his kilt .         and the birds don   t mind .         ach  no  mistress .  all the birds and beasts up here know it   s good luck to be friends wi    the nac mac feegle  mistress .         they do .         well  to tell ye the truth  mistress  it   s more that they know it   s unlucky not to be friends wi    the nac mac feegle .      tiffany looked at the sun .  it was only a few hours away from setting .      i must find the way in     she said .     look  not as small as           no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  mistress     said the pictsie  patiently .      yes  yes  thank you .  where is rob anybody .  where is everybody  in fact .      the young pictsie looked a bit embarrassed .      there   s a bit o    a debate goin    on down below  mistress     he said .      well  we have got to find my brother  okay .  i am the kelda in this vicinity  yes .         it   s a wee bit more comp li cat ed than that  mistress .  they   re  er  discussin    ye           discussing what about me .      not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock looked as if he really didn   t want to be standing there .      um  they   re discussing   er   they        tiffany gave up .  the pictsie was blushing .  since he was blue to begin with  this turned him an unpleasant violet color .     i   ll go back down the hole .  give my boots a push  will you  please .      she slid down the dry dirt  and feegles scattered in the cave below as she landed .   when her eyes got accustomed to the gloom once more  she saw that the galleries were crowded with pictsies again .  some of them were in the middle of washing  and many of them had  for some reason  smoothed down their red hair with grease .  they all stared at her as if caught in the act of something dreadful .      we ought to be going if we   re to follow the queen     she said  looking down at rob anybody  who   d been washing his face in a basin made of half a walnut shell .  water dripped off his beard  which he   d braided up .  there were three braids in his long hair now too .  if he turned suddenly  he could probably whip somebody to death .      ach  weel     he said     there   s a wee matter we got tae sort oout  kelda .     he twiddled the tiny washcloth in his hands .  when rob anybody twiddled  he was worried .      yes .     said tiffany .      er   will ye no ha    a cup o    tea .     said rob anybody  and a pictsie staggered forward with a big gold cup that must have been made for a king .   tiffany took it .  she was thirsty  after all .  there was a sigh from the crowd when she sipped the tea .  it was actually quite good .      we stole a bag o    it fra    a peddler who was asleep down by the high road     said rob anybody .     good stuff  eh .     he patted down his hair with his wet hands .   tiffany   s cup stopped halfway to her lips .  perhaps the pictsies didn   t realize how loudly they whispered  because her ear was on a level with a conversation .      ach  she   s a bit on the big side  no offense to her .         aye  but a kelda has to be big  ye ken  to have lots of wee babbies .         aye  fair enough  big wimmin is a    very well  but if a laddie was tae try tae cuddle this one  he   d have tae leave a chalk mark to show where he left off yesterday .         an    she   s a bit young .         she needna have any babbies yet  then .  or mebbe not too many at a time  say .  nae more than ten  mebbe .         crivens  lads  what   re ye talkin    aboout .     tis rob anybody she   ll choose anyway .  ye can see the big man   s poor wee knees knocking fra    here .      tiffany lived on a farm .  any little beliefs that babies are delivered by storks or found under bushes tend to get sorted out early on if you live on a farm  especially when a cow is having a difficult calving in the middle of the night .  and she   d helped with the lambing  when small hands could be very useful in difficult cases .  she knew all about the bags of red chalk the rams had strapped to their chests  and why you knew later on that the ewes with the red smudges on their backs were going to be mothers in the spring .  it   s amazing what a child who is quiet and observant can learn  and this includes things people don   t think she is old enough to know .   her eye spotted fion  on the other side of the hall .  she was smiling  in a worrying way .      what   s happening  rob anybody .     she said  laying the words down carefully .      ah  weel   it   s the clan rules  ye ken     said the feegle awkwardly .     ye being the new kelda an     an     weel  we   re bound to ask ye  see  nae matter what we feel  we gotta ask ye mutter mutter mutter       he stepped back quickly .      i didn   t quite catch that     said tiffany .      we   ve scrubbed up nice  ye ken     rob anybody said .     some o    the lads actually had a bath in the dewpond  e   en though    tis only may  and big yan washed under his arms for the first time ever  and daft wullie has picked ye a bonny bunch of flowers        daft wullie stepped forward  swollen with nervous pride  and thrust the aforesaid bouquet into the air .  they probably had been nice flowers  but he didn   t have much idea of what a bunch was or how you picked one .  stems and leaves and dropping petals stuck out of his fist in all directions .      very nice     said tiffany  taking another sip of the tea .      guid  guid     said rob anybody  wiping his forehead .     so mebbe you   d like tae tell us mutter mutter mutter           they want to know which one of them you   re going to marry     said fion loudly .     it   s the rules .  ye have to choose  or quit as kelda .  ye have to choose yer man an    name the day .         aye     said rob anybody  not meeting tiffany   s eye .   tiffany held the cup perfectly steady  but only because suddenly she couldn   t move a muscle .  she was thinking  aaargh .  this is not happening to me .  i can   t   he couldn   t   we wouldn   t   they   re not even   this is ridiculous .  run away .   but she was aware of hundreds of nervous faces in the shadows .  how you deal with this is going to be important  said her second thoughts .  they   re all watching you .  and fion wants to see what you   ll do .  you really oughtn   t to dislike a girl four feet shorter than you  but you do .      well  this is very unexpected     she said  forcing herself to smile .     a big honor  of course .         aye  aye     said rob anybody  looking at the floor .      and there   s so many of you  it   d be so hard to choose     tiffany went on  still smiling .  and her second thoughts said  he   s not happy about it either .      aye  it will that     said rob anybody .      i   d just like to have a little fresh air while i think about it     said tiffany  and didn   t let the smile fade until she was out on the mound again .   she crouched down and peered among the primrose leaves .     toad .     she yelled .   the toad crawled out  chewing something .     hm .     it said .      they want to marry me .         mm phmm ffm mm .         what are you eating .      the toad swallowed .     a very undernourished slug     it said .      i said they want to marry me .         and .         and .  well  just   just think .         oh  right  yeah  the height thing     said the toad .     it might not seem much now  but when you   re five feet seven he   ll still be six inches high           don   t laugh at me .  i   m the kelda .         well  of course  that   s the point  isn   t it     said the toad .     as far as they   re concerned  there   s rules .  the new kelda marries the warrior of her choice and settles down and has lots and lots of feegles .  it   d be a terrible insult to refuse           i am not going to marry a feegle .  i can   t have hundreds of babies .  tell me what to do .         me .  tell the kelda what to do .  i wouldn   t dare     said the toad .     and i don   t like being shouted at .  even toads have their pride  you know .     he crawled back into the leaves .   tiffany took a deep breath  ready to shout  and then closed her mouth .   the old kelda must   ve known about this  she thought .  so   she must have thought i   d be able to deal with it .  it   s just the rules  and they didn   t know what to do about them .  none of them wanted to marry a big girl like her  even if none of them would admit it .  it was just the rules .   there must be a way round it .  there had to be .  but she had to accept a husband and she had to name the day .  they   d told her that .   she stared at the thorn trees for a moment .  hmm  she thought .   she slid back down the hole .   the pictsies were waiting nervously  every scarred and bearded face watching hers .      i accept you  rob anybody     she said .   rob anybody   s face became a mask of terror .  she heard him mutter     aw crivens .     in a tiny voice .      but of course  it   s the bride who names the day  isn   t it .     said tiffany cheerfully .     everyone knows that .         aye     rob anybody quavered .     that   s the tradition  right enough .         then i shall .     tiffany took a deep breath .     at the end of the world is a great big mountain of granite rock a mile high     she said .     and every year  a tiny bird flies all the way to the rock and wipes its beak on it .  well  when the little bird has worn the mountain down to the size of a grain of sand   that   s the day i   ll marry you  rob anybody feegle .      rob anybody   s terror turned to outright panic  but then he hesitated and  very slowly  started to grin .      aye  guid idea     he said slowly .     it doesna do tae rush these things .         absolutely     said tiffany .      and that   d gi    us time tae sort oout the guest list an a    that     the pictsie went on .      that   s right .         plus there   s a    that business wi    the wedding dress and buckets o    flowers and a    that kind of stuff     said rob anybody  looking more cheerful by the second .     that sort thing can tak    forever  ye ken .         oh yes     said tiffany .      but she   s really just said no .     fion burst out .     it   d take millions of years for the bird to           she said aye .     rob anybody shouted .     ye a    heard her  lads .  an    she   s named the day .  that   s the rules .         nae problem aboot the mountain  neither     said daft wullie  still holding out the flowers .     just ye tell us where it is and i reckon we could ha    it doon a lot faster than any wee burdie           it   s got to be the bird .     yelled rob anybody desperately .     okay .  the wee burdie .  nae more arguin    .  anyone feelin    like arguin    will feel ma boot .  some o    us ha    got a wee laddie to steal back fra    the quin .     he drew his sword and waved it in the air .     who   s coming wi    me .      that seemed to work .  the nac mac feegle liked clear goals .  hundreds of swords and battleaxes  and one bunch of battered flowers in the case of daft wullie  were thrust into the air  and the war cry of the nac mac feegle echoed around the chamber .  the period of time it takes a pictsie to go from normal to mad fighting mood is so tiny  it can   t be measured on the smallest clock .   unfortunately  since the pictsies were very individualistic  each one had his own cry and tiffany could only make out a few over the din      they can tak    oour lives but they canna tak    oour troousers .         ye   ll tak    the high road an    i   ll tak    yer wallet .         there can only be one t   ousand .         ach  stick it up yer trakkans .      but the voices gradually came together in one roar that shook the walls      nae king .  nae quin .  nae laird .  nae master .  we willna be fooled again .      this died away  a cloud of dust dropped from the roof  and there was silence .      let   s gae .     cried rob anybody .   as one feegle  the pictsies swarmed down the galleries and across the floor and up the slope to the hole .  in a few seconds the chamber was empty  except for the gonnagle and fion .      where have they gone .     said tiffany .      ach  they just go     said fion  shrugging .     i   m going tae stay here and look after the fire .  someone ought to act like a proper kelda .     she glared at tiffany .      i do hope you find a clan for yourself soon  fion     said tiffany sweetly .  the pictsie scowled at her .      they   ll run arroond for a while  mebbe stun a few bunnies and fall over a few times     said william .     they   ll slow down when they find oout they don   t ken what they   re supposed to do yet .         do they always just run off like this .     said tiffany .      ach  well  rob anybody disna want too much talk about marryin        said william  grinning .      yes  we have a lot in common in that respect     said tiffany .   she pulled herself out of the hole and found the toad waiting for her .      i listened in     he said .     well done .  very clever .  very diplomatic .      tiffany looked around .  there were a few hours to sunset  but the shadows were already lengthening .      we   d better be going     she said  tying on her apron .     and you   re coming  toad .         well  i don   t know much about how to get into       the toad began  trying to back away .  but toads can   t back up easily  and tiffany grabbed him and put him in her apron pocket .   she headed for the mounds and stones .  my brother will never grow up  she thought  as she ran across the turf .  that   s what the old lady said .  how does that work .  what kind of a place is it where you never grow up .   the mounds got nearer .  she saw william and not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock running along beside her  but there was no sign of the rest of the nac mac feegle .   and then she was among the mounds .  her sisters had told her that there were more dead kings buried under there  but it had never frightened her .  nothing on the downs had ever frightened her .   but it was cold here .  she   d never noticed that before .   find a place where the time doesn   t fit .  well  the mounds were history .  so were the old stones .  did they fit here .  well  yes  they belonged to the past  but they   d ridden on the hills for thousands of years .  they   d grown old here .  they were part of the landscape .   the low sun made the shadows lengthen .  that was when the chalk revealed its secrets .  at some places  when the light was right  you could see the edges of old fields and tracks .  the shadows showed up what brilliant noonlight couldn   t see .   tiffany had made up noonlight .   she couldn   t even see hoof prints .  she wandered around the trilithons  which looked a bit like huge stone doorways  but even when she tried walking through them both ways  nothing happened .   this wasn   t according to plan .  there should have been a magic door .  she was sure of that .   a bubbling feeling in her ear suggested that someone was playing the mousepipes .  she looked around and saw william the gonnagle standing on a fallen stone .  his cheeks were bulging  and so was the bag of the mousepipes .   she waved at him .     can you see anything .     she called .   william took the pipe out of his mouth  and the bubbling stopped .     oh  aye     he said .      the way to the queen   s land .         oh  aye .         well  would you care to tell me .         i dinna need to tell a kelda     said william .     a kelda would see the clear way hersel    .         but you could tell me .         aye  and you coulda said please     said william .     i   m ninety six years old .  i   m nae a dolly in yer dolly hoose .  yer granny was a fiiine wuman  but i   ll no    be ordered about by a wee chit of a girl .      tiffany stared for a moment and then lifted the toad out of her apron pocket .      chit .     she said .      it means something very small     said the toad .     trust me .         he   s calling me small .         i   m biggerrr on the inside .     said william .     and i daresay your da    wouldna be happy if a big giant of a wee girl came stampin    aroound ordering him aboout .         the old kelda ordered people about .         aye .  because she   d earned rrrespect .     the gonnagle   s voice seemed to echo around the stones .      please  i don   t know what to do .     wailed tiffany .   william stared at her .     ach  weel  yer no    doin    too badly so far     he said  in a nicer tone of voice .     ye got rob anybody out of marryin    ye wi   oout breakin    the rules  and ye   re a game lass  i   ll gi    ye that .  ye   ll find the way if ye tak    yer time .  just don   t stamp yer foot and expect the world to do yer biddin    .  a    ye   re doing is shoutin    for sweeties  ye ken .  use yer eyes .  use yer heid .      he put the pipe back in his mouth  puffed his cheeks until the skin bag was full  and made tiffany   s ears bubble again .      what about you  toad .     said tiffany .      you   re on your own  i   m afraid     said the toad .     whoever i used to be  i didn   t know much about finding invisible doors .  and i resent being press ganged  too  i may say .         but   i don   t know what to do .  is there a magic word i should say .         i don   t know  is there a magic word you should say .     said the toad  and turned over .   tiffany was aware that the nac mac feegle were turning up .  they had a nasty habit of being really quiet when they wanted to .   oh  no  she thought .  they think i know what to do .  this isn   t fair .  i haven   t got any training for this .  i haven   t been to the witch school .  i can   t even find that .  the opening must be somewhere around here  and there must be clues  but i don   t know what they are .   they   re watching me to see if i   m any good .  and i   m good at cheese  and that   s all .  but a witch deals with things    .   she put the toad back in her pocket and felt the weight of the book diseases of the sheep .   when she pulled it out  she heard a sigh go up from the assembled pictsies .   they think words are magical    .   she opened the book at random  and frowned .      cloggets     she said aloud .  around her  the pictsies nodded their heads and nudged one another .      cloggets are a trembling of the greebs in hoggets     she read     which can lead to inflammation of the lower pasks .  if untreated  it may lead to the more serious condition of sloke .  recommended treatment is the daily dosing with turpentine until there is no longer either any trembling  or turpentine  or sheep .      she risked looking up .  feegles were watching her from every stone and mound .  they looked impressed .   however  the words in diseases of the sheep cut no ice with magic doorways .      scrabbity     said tiffany .  there was a ripple of anticipation .      scrabbity is a flaky skin condition  particularly around the lollets .  turpentine is a useful remedy        and then she saw  out of the corner of her eye  the teddy bear .   it was very small  and the kind of red you don   t quite get in nature .  tiffany knew what it was .  wentworth loved the teddy bear candies .  they tasted like glue mixed with sugar and were made of      artificial additives .      ah     she said aloud .     my brother was certainly brought here        this caused a stir .   she walked forward  reading aloud about garget of the nostrils and the staggers but keeping an eye on the ground .  and there was another teddy bear  green this time and quite hard to see against the turf .   o kay  tiffany thought .   there was one of the three stone arches a little way away  two big stones with another one laid across the top of them .  she   d walked through it before and nothing had happened .   but nothing should happen  she thought .  you can   t leave a doorway into your world that anyone can walk through  otherwise people would wander in and out by accident .  you   d have to know it was there .   perhaps that   s the only way it would work .   fine .  then i   ll believe that this is the entrance .   she stepped through and saw an astonishing sight  green grass  blue sky becoming pink around the setting sun  a few little white clouds late for bed  and a general warm  honey colored look to everything .  it was amazing that there could be a sight like this .  the fact that tiffany had seen it nearly every day of her life didn   t make it any less fantastic .  as a bonus  you didn   t even have to look through any kind of stone arch to see it .  you could see it by standing practically anywhere .   except        something was wrong .  tiffany walked through the arch several times and still wasn   t quite sure .  she held up a hand at arm   s length  trying to measure the sun   s height against the horizon .   and then she saw the bird .  it was a swallow  hunting flies  and a swoop took it behind the stones .   the effect was   odd  and almost upsetting .  it passed behind the stone and she felt her eyes move to follow the swoop   but it was late .  there was a moment when the swallow should have appeared  and it didn   t .   then it passed across the gap and for a moment was on both sides of the other stone at the same time .   seeing it made tiffany feel that her eyeballs had been pulled out and turned around .   look for a place where the time doesn   t fit    .      the world seen through that gap is at least one second behind the time here     she said  trying to sound as certain as possible .     i thi   i know this is the entrance .      there was some whooping and clapping from the nac mac feegle  and they surged across the turf toward her .      that was great  a    that reading    ye did .     said rob anybody .     i didna understand a single word o    it .         aye  it must be powerful language if you canna make oout what the heel it   s goin    on aboot .     said another pictsie .      ye definitely ha    got the makin   s of a kelda  mistress     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .      aye .     said daft wullie .     it was smashin    the way you spotted them candies and didna let on .  we didna think you   d see the wee green one  too .      the rest of the pictsies stopped cheering and glared at him .      what did i say .  what did i say .     he said .   tiffany sagged .     you all knew that was the way through  didn   t you     she said .      oh  aye     said rob anybody .     we ken that kind of stuff .  we used tae live in the quin   s country  ye ken  but we rebelled against her evil rule           and we did that  an    then she threw us oout on account o    bein    drunk an    stealin    and fightin    a    the time     said daft wullie .      it wasna like that at a    .     roared rob anybody .      and you were waiting to see if i could find the way  right .     said tiffany  before a fight could start .      aye .  ye did well  lassie .      tiffany shook her head .     no  i didn   t     she said .     i didn   t do any real magic .  i don   t know how .  i just looked at things and worked them out .  it was cheating  really .      the pictsies looked at one another .      ah  weel     said rob anybody .     what   s magic  eh .  just wavin    a stick an    sayin    a few wee magical words .  an    what   s so clever aboot that  eh .  but lookin    at things  really lookin    at    em  and then workin       em oout  now  that   s a real skill .         aye  it is     said william the gonnagle  to tiffany   s surprise .     ye used yer eyes and used yer heid .  that   s what a real hag does .  the magicking is just there for advertisin    .         oh     said tiffany  cheering up .     really .  well  then   there   s our door  everyone .         right     said rob anybody .     now show us the way through .      tiffany hesitated and then thought  i can feel myself thinking .  i   m watching the way i   m thinking .  and what am i thinking .  i   m thinking  i walked through this arch before  and nothing happened .   but i wasn   t looking then .  i wasn   t thinking  either .  not properly .   the world i can see through the arch isn   t actually real .  it just looks as though it is .  it   s a sort of   magical picture  put there to disguise the entrance .  and if you don   t pay attention  well  you just walk in and out of it and you don   t realize it .   aha     she walked through the arch .  nothing happened .  the nac mac feegle watched her solemnly .   okay  she thought .  i   m still being fooled  aren   t i .      she stood in front of the stones and stretched out her hands on either side of her  and shut her eyes .  very slowly she stepped forward     something crunched under her boots  but she didn   t open her eyes until she couldn   t feel the stones anymore .  when she did open them        it was a black and white landscape .       chapter        land of winter         aye  she   s got first sight  sure enough     said william   s voice behind tiffany as she stared into the world of the queen .     she   s seein    what   s really there    .      snow stretched away under a sky so dirty white that tiffany might have been standing inside a ping pong ball .  only black trunks and scribbly branches of the trees  here and there  told her where the land stopped and the sky began .   those  and  of course  the hoofprints .  they stretched away toward a forest of black trees  boughed with snow .   the cold was like little needles all over her skin .   she looked down and saw the nac mac feegle pouring through the gate  waist deep in the snow .  they spread out without speaking .  some of them had drawn their swords .   they weren   t laughing and joking now .  they were watchful .      right  then     said rob anybody .     well done .  you wait here for us and we   ll get your wee brother back  nae problemo           i   m coming too .     snapped tiffany .      nay  the kelda disna           this one dis .     said tiffany  shivering .     i mean does .  he   s my brother .  and where are we .      rob anybody glanced up at the pale sky .  there was no sun anywhere .     ye   re here noo     he said     so mebbe there   s nae harm in tellin    ye .  this is what ye call fairyland .         fairyland .  no  it   s not .  i   ve seen pictures .  fairyland is   is all trees and flowers and sunshine and  and tinklyness .  dumpy little babies in romper suits with horns .  people with wings .  er   and weird people .  i   ve seen pictures .         it isna always like this     said rob anybody shortly .     an    ye canna come wi    us because ye ha    nae weapon  mistress .         what happened to my frying pan .     said tiffany .   something bumped against her heels .  she looked around and saw not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock hold up the pan triumphantly .      okay  ye have the pan     said rob anybody     but what ye need here is a sword of thunderbolt iron .  that   s like the  you know  official weapon for invadin    fairyland    .         i know how to use the pan     said tiffany .     and i   m           incomin    .     yelled daft wullie .   tiffany saw a line of black dots in the distance and felt someone climb up her back and stand on her head .      it   s the black dogs     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock announced .     dozens o       em  big man .         we   ll never outrun the dogs .     tiffany cried  grabbing her pan .      dinna need to     said rob anybody .     we got the gonnagle wi    us this time .  ye might like to stick yer fingers in yer ears  though .      william  with his eyes fixed on the approaching pack  was unscrewing some of the pipes from the mousepipes and putting them in a bag he carried hanging from his shoulder .   the dogs were much closer now .  tiffany could see the razor teeth and the burning eyes .   slowly william took out some much shorter  smaller pipes that had a silvery look to them and screwed them into place .  he had the look of someone who wasn   t going to rush .   tiffany gripped the handle of her pan .  the dogs weren   t barking .  it would have been slightly less scary if they were .   william swung the mousepipes under his arm and blew into one until the bag bulged .      i shall play     he announced  as the dogs got close enough for tiffany to see the drool     that firrrrm favorite     the king underrrr waterrrr .         as one pictsie  the nac mac feegle dropped their swords and put their hands over their ears .   william put the mouthpiece to his lips  tapped his foot once or twice  and  as a dog gathered itself to leap at tiffany  began to play .   a lot of things happened at more or less the same time .  all tiffany   s teeth started to buzz .  the pan vibrated in her hands and dropped onto the snow .  the dog in front of her went cross eyed and  instead of leaping  tumbled forward .   the grimhounds paid no attention to the pictsies .  they howled .  they spun around .  they tried to bite their own tails .  they stumbled and ran into one another .  the line of panting death broke into dozens of desperate animals  twisting and writhing and trying to escape from their own skins .   the snow was melting in a circle around william  whose cheeks were red with effort .  steam was rising .   he took the pipe from his mouth .  the grimhounds  struggling in the slush  raised their heads .  and then  as one dog  they put their tails between their legs and ran like greyhounds back across the snow .      weel  they ken we   re here noo     said rob anybody  wiping tears from his eyes .      ot aggened .     said tiffany  touching her teeth to check that they were all still there .      he played the notes o    pain     rob anybody explained .     ye canna hear    em    cause they   re pitched so high  but the doggies can .  hurts    em in their heids .  now we   d better get movin    before she sends somethin    else .         the queen sent them .  but they   re like something out of nightmares .     said tiffany .      oh aye     said rob anybody .     that   s where she got them .      tiffany looked at william the gonnagle .  he was calmly replacing the pipes .  he saw her staring at him  looked up  and winked .      the nac mac feegle tak    music verrrrrra seriously     he said .  and then he nodded at the snow near tiffany   s foot .   there was a sugary yellow teddy bear in the snow  made of      artificial additives .   and the snow  all around tiffany  was melting away .       two pictsies carried tiffany easily .  she skimmed across the snow  the clan running beside her .   no sun in the sky .  even on the dullest days you could generally see where the sun was  but not here .  and there was something else that was strange  something she couldn   t quite give a name to .  this didn   t feel like a real place .  she didn   t know why she felt that  but something was wrong with the horizon .  it looked close enough to touch  which was silly .   and things were not   finished .  like the trees in the forest they were heading toward  for example .  a tree is a tree  she thought .  close up or far away  it   s a tree .  it has bark and branches and roots .  and you know they   re there  even if the tree is so far away that it   s a blob .   the trees here  though  were different .  she had a strong feeling that they were blobs  and were growing the roots and twigs and other details as she got closer  as if they were thinking     quick  someone   s coming .  look real .      it was like being in a painting where the artist hadn   t bothered much with the things in the distance  but quickly rushed a bit of realness anywhere you were looking .   the air was cold and dead  like the air in old cellars .   the light grew dimmer as they reached the forest .  in between the trees it became blue and eerie .   no birds  she thought .      stop     she said .   the pictsies lowered her to the ground  but rob anybody said     we shouldna hang aroound here too long .  heids up  lads .      tiffany lifted out the toad .  it blinked at the snow .      oh  shoap     it muttered .     this is not good .  i should be hibernating .         why is everything so   strange .         can   t help you there     said the toad .     i just see snow  i just see ice  i just see freezing to death .  i   m listening to my inner toad here .         it   s not that cold .         feels cold   to   me    .     the toad shut his eyes .  tiffany sighed and lowered him into her pocket .      i   ll tell ye where ye are     said rob anybody  his eyes still scanning the blue shadows .     ye ken them wee bitty bugs that cling on to the sheeps and suck theirsel    full o    blood and then drop off again .  this whole world is like one o    them .         you mean like a  a tick .  a parasite .  a vampire .         oh  aye .  it floats aroound until it finds a place that   s weak on a world where no one   s payin    attention  and opens a door .  then the quin sends in her folk .  for the stealin     ye ken .  raidin    o    barns  rustlin    of cattle           we used to like stealin    the coo beasties     said daft wullie .      wullie     said rob anybody  pointing his sword     you ken i said there wuz times you should think before opening yer big fat gob .         aye  rob .         weel  that wuz one o    them times .     rob turned and looked up at tiffany rather bashfully .     aye  we wuz wild champion robbers for the quin     he said .     people wouldna e   en go a huntin    for fear o    little men .  but    twas ne   er enough for her .  she always wanted more .  but we said it   s no    right to steal an ol    lady   s only pig  or the food from them as dinna ha    enough to eat .  a feegle has nae worries about stealin    a golden cup from a rich bigjob  ye ken  but takin    awa    the           cup an old man kept his false teeth in made them feel ashamed  they said .  the nac mac feegle would fight and steal  certainly  but who wanted to fight the weak and steal from the poor .   tiffany listened  at the end of the shadowy wood  to the story of a little world where nothing grew  where no sun shone  and where everything had to come from somewhere else .  it was a world that took  and gave nothing back except fear .  it raided   and people learned to stay in bed when they heard strange noises at night  because if anyone gave her trouble  the queen could control their dreams .   tiffany couldn   t quite pick up how she did this  but that   s where things like the grimhounds and the headless horseman came from .  these dreams were   more real .  the queen could take dreams and make them more   solid .  you could step inside them and vanish .  and you didn   t wake up just as the monsters caught up with you .   the queen   s people wouldn   t just take food .  they   d take people  too           like pipers     said william the gonnagle .     fairies can   t make music  ye ken .  she   ll steal a man awa    for the music he makes .         and she takes children     said tiffany .      aye .  your wee brother   s not the first     said rob anybody .     there   s no    a lot of fun and laughter here  ye ken .  she thinks she   s good wi    children .         the old kelda said she wouldn   t harm him     said tiffany .     that   s true  isn   t it .      you could read the nac mac feegle like a book .  and it would be a big  simple book with pictures of spot the dog and a big red ball and one or two short sentences on each page .  what they were thinking turned up right there on their faces  and now they were all wearing a look that said  crivens  i hope she disna ask us the question we dinna want tae answer    .      that is true  isn   t it .     she said .      oh  aye     said rob anybody  slowly .     she didna lie to ye there .  the quin   ll try to be kind to him  but she disna know how .  she   s an elf .  they   re no    very good at thinking of other people .         what will happen to him if we don   t get him back .      again there was that    we dinna like the way this is going    look .      i said       tiffany repeated .      i darrresay she   ll send him back  in due time     said william .     an    he willna be any olderr .  nothing grows old here .  nothing grows .  nothing at all .         so he   ll be all right .      rob anybody made a noise in his throat .  it sounded like a voice that was trying to say aye but was being argued with by a brain that knew the answer was no .      tell me what you   re not telling me     said tiffany .   daft wullie was the first to speak .     that   s a lot o    stuff     he said .     for example  the meltin    point o    lead is           time passes slower the deeper you go intae this place     said rob anybody quickly .     years pass like days .  the quin   ll get tired o    the wee lad after a coupla months  mebbe .  a coupla months here  ye ken  where the time is slow an    heavy .  but when he comes back into the mortal world  you   ll be an old lady  or mebbe you   ll be deid .  so if youse has bairns o    yer own  you   d better tell them to watch out for a wee sticky kid wanderin    the hills shoutin    for sweeties     cause that   ll be their uncle wentworth .  that wouldna be the worst o    it  neither .  live in dreams for too long and ye go mad   ye can never wake up prop   ly  ye can never get the hang o    reality again .      tiffany stared at him .      it   s happened before     said william .      i will get him back     said tiffany quietly .      we doon   t doubt it     said rob anybody .     an    where   er ye go  we   ll come with ye .  the nac mac feegle are afeared o    nothing .      a cheer went up  but it seemed to tiffany that the blue shadows sucked all the sound away .      aye  nothin    exceptin    lawyers mmph mmph     daft wullie tried to say  before rob managed to shut him up .   tiffany turned back to the line of hoofprints and began to walk .   the snow squeaked unpleasantly underfoot .   she went a little way  watching the trees get realer as she approached them  and then looked around .   all the nac mac feegle were creeping along behind her .  rob anybody gave her a cheery nod .  and all her footprints had become holes in the snow  with grass showing through .   the trees began to annoy her .  the way things changed was more frightening than any monster .  you could hit a monster  but you couldn   t hit a forest .  and she wanted to hit something .   she stopped and scraped some snow away from the base of a tree  and just for a moment there was nothing but grayness where it had been .  as she watched  the bark grew down to where the snow was .  then it just stayed there  pretending it had been there all the time .   it was a lot more worrying than the grimhounds .  they were just monsters .  they could be beaten .  this was   frightening .   she was second thinking again .  she felt the fear grow  she felt her stomach become a red hot lump  she felt her elbows begin to sweat .  but it was   not connected .  she watched herself being frightened  and that meant that there was still this part of herself  the watching part  that wasn   t .   the trouble was  it was being carried on legs that were .  it had to be very careful .   and that was where it went wrong .  fear gripped her  all at once .  she was in a strange world  with monsters  being followed by hundreds of little blue thieves .  and   black dogs .  headless horsemen .  monsters in the river .  sheep whizzing backward across fields .  voices under the bed     the terror took her .  but because she was tiffany  she ran toward it  raising the pan .  she had to get through the forest  find the queen  get her brother  leave this place .   somewhere behind her  voices started to shout     she woke up .   there was no snow  but there was the whiteness of the bedsheet and the plaster ceiling of her bedroom .  she stared at it for a while  then leaned down and peered under the bed .   there was nothing there but the guzunder .  when she flung open the door of the doll   s house  there was no one inside but the two toy soldiers and the teddy bear and the headless dolly .   the walls were solid .  the floor creaked as it always did .  her slippers were the same as they always were  old  comfortable  and with all the pink fluff worn off .   she stood in the middle of the floor and said  very quietly     is there anybody there .      sheep baa   d on the distant hillside  but they probably hadn   t heard her .   the door squeaked open and the cat  ratbag  came in .  he rubbed up against her legs  purring like a distant thunderstorm  and then went and curled up on her bed .   tiffany got dressed thoughtfully  daring the room to do something strange .   when she got downstairs  breakfast was cooking .  her mother was busy at the sink .   tiffany darted out through the scullery and into the dairy .  she scrambled on hands and knees around the floor  peering under the sink and behind cupboards .      you can come out now  honestly     she said .   no one came .  she was alone in the room .  she   d often been alone in the room  and had enjoyed it .  it was almost her private territory .  but now  somehow  it was too empty  too clean .   when she wandered back into the kitchen  her mother was still standing by the sink  washing dishes  but a plate of steaming porridge had been put down in the one set place on the table .      i   ll make some more butter today     said tiffany carefully  sitting down .     i might as well  while we   re getting all this milk .      her mother nodded and put a plate on the drainboard beside the sink .      i haven   t done anything wrong  have i .     said tiffany .   her mother shook her head .   tiffany sighed .     and then she woke up and it was all a dream .     it was just about the worst ending you could have to any story .  but it had all seemed so real .  she could remember the smoky smell in the pictsies    cave  and the way   who was it   oh  yes  he   d been called rob anybody   the way rob anybody had always been so nervous about talking to her .   it was strange  she thought  that ratbag had rubbed up against her .  he   d sleep on her bed if he could get away with it  but during the day he kept well out of tiffany   s way .  how odd .   there was a rattling noise near the mantelpiece .  the china shepherdess on granny   s shelf was moving sideways of its own accord  and as tiffany watched with her porridge spoon halfway to her mouth  it slid off and smashed on the floor .   the rattling went on .  now it was coming from the big oven .  she could see the door actually shaking on its hinges .   she turned to her mother and saw her put another plate down by the sink .  but it wasn   t being held in a hand .   the oven door burst off the hinges and slid across the floor .      dinna eat the porridge .      nac mac feegles spilled out into the room  hundreds of them  pouring across the tiles .   the walls were shifting .  the floor moved .  and now the thing turning around at the sink was not even human but just   stuff  no more human than a gingerbread man  gray as old dough  changing shape as it lumbered toward tiffany .   the pictsies surged past her in a flurry of snow .   she looked up at the thing   s tiny black eyes .   the scream came from somewhere deep inside .  there was no second thought  no first thought  just a scream .  it seemed to spread out as it left tiffany   s mouth until it became a black tunnel in front of her  and as she fell into it  she heard  in the commotion behind her      who d   yer think ye   re lookin    at  pal .  crivens  but ye   re gonna get sich a kickin    .          tiffany opened her eyes .   she was lying on damp ground in the snowy  gloomy wood .  pictsies were watching her carefully but  she saw  there were others behind them staring outward  into the gloom among the tree trunks .   there was   stuff in the trees .  lumps of stuff .  it was gray  and it hung there like old cloth .   she turned her head and saw william standing beside her  looking at her with concern .      that was a dream  wasn   t it .     she said .      weel  noo     said william .     it was  ye ken  and therrre again  it wasna    .      tiffany sat up suddenly  causing the pictsies to leap back .      but that   thing was in it  and then you all came out of the oven .     she said .     you were in my dream .  what is   was that creature .      william the gonnagle stared at her as if trying to make up his mind .      that was what we call a drome     he said .     nothing here really belongs here  remember .  everything is a reflection from outside  or something kidnaped from another worrrld  or mebbe something the quin has made outa magic .  it was hidin    in the trees  and ye was goin    so fast  ye didna see it .  ye ken spiders .         of course .         well  spiders spin webs .  dromes spin dreams .  it   s easy in this place .  the world you come from is nearly real .  this place is nearly unreal  so it   s almost a dream anywa    .  and the drome makes a dream for ye  wi    a trap in it .  if ye eats anything in the dream  ye   ll never want tae    leave it .      he looked as though tiffany should have been impressed .      what   s in it for the drome .     she asked .      it likes watchin    dreams .  it has fun watching ye ha    fun .  an    it   ll watch ye eatin    dream food  until ye starve to death .  then the drome   ll eat ye .  not right away  o    course .  it   ll wait until ye   ve gone a wee bit runny  because it hasna teeth .         so how can anyone get out .         the best way is to find the drome     said rob anybody .     it   ll be in the dream with you  in disguise .  then ye just gives it a good kickin    .         by kicking you mean    .         choppin    its heid off generally works .      now  tiffany thought  i am impressed .  i wish i wasn   t .     and this is fairyland .     she said .      aye .  ye could say it   s the bit the tourists dinna see     said william .     an    ye did well .  ye were fightin    it .  ye knew it wasna right .      tiffany remembered the friendly cat  and the falling shepherdess .  she   d been trying to send messages to herself .  she should have listened .      thank you for coming after me     she said  meekly .     how did you do it .         ach  we can generally find a way intae anywhere  even a dream     said william  smiling .     we   re a stealin    folk  after all .     a piece of the drome fell out of the tree and flopped onto the snow .      one of them won   t get me again .     said tiffany .      aye .  i believe you .  ye have murrrder in yer eyes     said william  with a touch of admiration .     if i was a drome  i   d be pretty fearful noo  if i had a brain .  there   ll be more of them  mark you  and some of    em are cunning .  the quin uses    em as guards .         i won   t be fooled .     tiffany remembered the horror of the moment when the thing had lumbered around changing shape .  it was worse because it was in her house  her place .  she   d felt real terror as the big shapeless thing crashed across the kitchen  but the anger had been there too .  it was invading her place .   the thing wasn   t just trying to kill her  it was insulting her .   william was watching her .      aye  ye   re lookin    mighty fierce     he said .     ye must love your wee brother to face a    these monsters for him .      and tiffany couldn   t stop her thoughts .  i don   t love him .  i know i don   t .  he   s just so   sticky  and can   t keep up  and i have to spend too much time looking after him  and he   s always screaming for things .  i can   t talk to him .  he just wants all the time .   but her second thinking said  he   s mine .  my place  my home  my brother .  how dare anything touch what   s mine .   she   d been brought up not to be selfish .  she knew she wasn   t  not in the way people meant .  she tried to think of other people .  she never took the last slice of bread .  this was a different feeling .   she wasn   t being brave or noble or kind .  she was doing this because it had to be done  because there was no way that she could not do it .  she thought of          granny aching   s light  weaving slowly across the downs  on freezing  sparkly nights or in storms like a raging war  saving lambs from the creeping frost or rams from the precipice .  she froze and struggled and tramped through the night for idiot sheep that never said thank you and would be just as stupid tomorrow  and get into the same trouble again .  and she did it because not doing it was unthinkable .   there had been the time when they met the peddler and the donkey in the lane .  it was a small donkey and could hardly be seen under the pack piled on it .  and the peddler was thrashing it because it had fallen over .   tiffany had cried to see that  and granny had looked at her and then said something to thunder and lightning .   the peddler had stopped when he heard the growling .  the sheepdogs had taken up positions on either side of the man  so that he couldn   t quite see them both at once .  he raised his stick as if to hit lightning  and thunder   s growl grew louder .      i   d advise ye not to do that     said granny .   he wasn   t a stupid man .  the eyes of the dogs were like steel balls .  he lowered his arm .      now throw down the stick     said granny .  the man did so  dropping it into the dust as though it had suddenly grown red hot .   granny aching walked forward and picked it up .  tiffany remembered that it was a willow twig  long and whippy .   suddenly  so fast that her hand was a blur  granny sliced it across the man   s face twice  leaving two long red marks .  he began to move  and some desperate thought must have saved him  because now the dogs were almost frantic for the command to leap .      hurts  don   t it .     said granny  pleasantly .     now  i knows who you are  and i reckon you knows who i am .  you sell pots and pans and they ain   t bad  as i recall .  but if i put out the word  you   ll have no business in my hills .  be told .  better to feed your beast than whip it .  you hear me .      with his eyes shut and his hands shaking  the man nodded .      that   ll do     said granny aching  and instantly the dogs became  once more  two ordinary sheepdogs  who came and sat on either side of her with their tongues hanging out .   tiffany watched the man unpack some of the load and strap it to his own back and then  with great care  urge the donkey on along the road .  granny watched him go while filling her pipe with jolly sailor .  then  as she lit it  she said  as if the thought had just occurred to her      them as can do has to do for them as can   t .  and someone has to speak up for them as has no voices .          tiffany thought  is this what being a witch is .  it wasn   t what i expected .  when do the good bits happen .   she stood up .     let   s keep going     she said .      aren   t ye tired .     said rob .      we   re going to keep going .         aye .  weel  she   s probably headed for her place beyond the wood .  if we dinna carry ye  it   ll tak    aboout a coupla hours           i   ll walk .     the memory of the huge dead face of the drome was trying to come back into her mind  but fury gave it no space .     where   s the frying pan .  thank you .  let   s go .      she set off through the strange trees .  the hoofprints almost glowed in the gloom .  here and there other tracks crossed them  tracks that could have been bird feet  rough round footprints that could have been made by anything  squiggly lines that a snake might make  if there were such things as snow snakes .   the pictsies were running in line with her on either side .   even with the edge of the fury dying away  it was hard looking at things here without her head aching .  things that seemed far off got closer too quickly  trees changed shape as she passed them .   almost unreal  william had said .  nearly a dream .  this world didn   t have enough reality in it for distances and shapes to work properly .  once again the magic artist was painting madly .  if she looked hard at a tree  it changed and became more treelike and less like something drawn by wentworth with his eyes shut .   this is a made up world  tiffany thought .  almost like a story .  the trees don   t have to be very detailed because who looks at trees in a story .   she stopped in a small clearing and stared hard at a tree .  it seemed to know it was being watched .  it became more real .  the bark roughened  and proper twigs grew on the ends of the branches .   the snow was melting around her feet  too .  although melting was the wrong word .  it was just disappearing  leaving leaves and grass .   if i was a world that didn   t have enough reality to go around  tiffany thought  then snow would be quite handy .  it doesn   t take a lot of effort .  it   s just white stuff .  everything looks white and simple .  but i can make it complicated .  i   m more real than this place .   she heard a buzzing overhead and looked up .   and suddenly the air was filling with small people  smaller than the feegle  with wings like dragonflies    .  there was a golden glow around them .  tiffany  entranced  reached out a hand     at the same moment what felt like the entire clan of nac mac feegle landed on her back and sent her sliding into a snowdrift .   when she struggled out  the clearing was a battlefield .  the pictsies were jumping and slashing at the flying creatures  which buzzed around them like wasps .  as she stared  two of them dived onto rob anybody and lifted him off his feet by his hair .   he rose in the air  yelling and struggling .  tiffany leaped up and grabbed him around the waist  flailing at the creatures with her other hand .  they let go of the pictsie and dodged easily  zipping through the air as fast as hummingbirds .  one of them bit her on the finger before buzzing away .   somewhere a voice went     oooooooooooooeeerrrrrr        rob struggled in tiffany   s grip .     quick  put me doon .     he yelled .     there   s gonna be poetry .          chapter        lost boys      the moan rolled around the clearing  as mournful as a month of mondays .         rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaoooooooo        it sounded like some animal in terrible pain .  but it was  in fact  not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  who was standing on a snowdrift with one hand pressed to his heart and the other outstretched  very theatrically .   he was rolling his eyes  too .         oooooooooooooooooooooo           ach  the muse is a terrible thing to have happen to ye     said rob anybody  putting his hands over his ears .         oooooiiiiiit is with grreat lamentation and much worrying dismay     the pictsie groaned     that we rrregard the doleful prospect of fairyland in considerrrable decay        in the air the flying creatures stopped attacking and began to panic .  some of them flew into one another .         with quite a large number of drrrrrrreadful incidents happening everrry day     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock recited     including  i am sorrrry to say  an aerial attack by the otherwise quite attractive fey        the fliers screeched .  some crashed into the snow  but the ones still capable of flight swarmed off among the trees .         witnessed by all of us at this time  and celebrated in this hasty rhyme .     not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock shouted after them .   and they were gone .   feegles were picking themselves up off the ground .  some were bleeding where the fairies had bitten them .  several were lying curled up and groaning .   tiffany looked at her own finger .  the bite of the fairy had left two tiny holes .      it isna too bad     rob anybody shouted up from below .     no one taken by them  just a few cases where the lads didna put their hands o   er their ears in time .         are they all right .         oh  they   ll be fine wi    counsellin    .      on the mound of snow william clapped not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock on the shoulder in a friendly way .      that  lad     he said proudly     was some of the worst poetry i have heard for a long time .  it was offensive to the ear and a torrrture to the soul .  the last couple of lines need some work  but ye has the groanin    off fiiine .  all in all  a verrry commendable effort .  we   ll make a gonnagle out of ye yet .      not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock blushed happily .   in fairyland words really have power  tiffany thought .  and i am more real .  i   ll remember that .   the pictsies assembled into battle order again  although it was pretty disorderly  and set off .  tiffany didn   t rush too far ahead this time .      that   s yer little people wi    wings     said rob  as tiffany sucked at her finger .     are ye happier now .         why were they trying to carry you away .         ach  they carries their victims off to their nest  where their young ones           stop .     said tiffany .     this is going to be horrible  right .         oh  aye .  gruesome     said rob  grinning .      and you used to live here .         ah  but it wasna so bad then .  it wasna perfect  mark you  but the quin wasna as cold in them days .  the king was still aroound .  she was always happy then .         what happened .  did the king die .         no .  they had words  if ye tak    my meanin        said rob .      oh  you mean like an argument           a bit  mebbe     said rob .     but they was magical words .  forests destroyed  mountains explodin     a few hundred deaths  that kind of thing .  and he went off to his own world .  fairyland was never a picnic  ye ken  even in the old days .  but it was fine if you kept alert  an    there was flowers and burdies and summertime .  now there   s the dromes and the hounds and the stinging fey and such stuff creepin    in from their own worlds  and the whole place has gone doon the tubes .      things taken from their own worlds  thought tiffany  as she tramped through the snow .  worlds all squashed together like peas in a sack  or hidden inside one another like bubbles inside other bubbles .   she had a picture in her head of things creeping out of their own world and into another  in the same way that mice invaded the larder .  only there were worse things than mice .   what would a drome do if it got into our world .  you   d never know it was there .  it   d sit in the corner and you   d never see it  because it wouldn   t let you .  and it   d change the way you saw the world  give you nightmares  make you want to die .   her second thoughts added  i wonder how many have got in already and we don   t know .   and i   m in fairyland  where dreams can hurt .  somewhere all stories are real  all songs are true .  i thought that was a strange thing for the kelda to say    .   tiffany   s second thoughts said  hang on  was that a first thought .   and tiffany thought  no  that was a third thought .  i   m thinking about how i think about what i   m thinking .  at least  i think so .   her second thoughts said  let   s all calm down  please  because this is quite a small head .   the forest went on .  or perhaps it was a small forest and  somehow  moved around them as they walked .  this was fairyland  after all .  you couldn   t trust it .   and the snow still vanished where tiffany walked  and she had only to look at a tree for it to smarten up and make an effort to look like a real tree .   the queen is   well  a queen  tiffany thought .  she   s got a world of her own .  she could do anything with it .  and all she does is steal things  mess up people   s lives     there was the thud of hoofbeats in the distance .   it   s her .  what shall i do .  what shall i say .   the nac mac feegles leaped behind the trees .      come away oot o    the path .     whispered rob anybody .      she might still have him .     said tiffany  gripping the pan handle nervously and staring at the blue shadows between the trees .      so .  we   ll find a wa    to steal him .  she   s the quin .  ye canna beat the quin face to face .      the hoofbeats were louder  and now it sounded as though there was more than one animal .   a stag appeared through the trees  steam pouring off it .  it stared at tiffany with wild red eyes and then  bunching up  leaped over her .  she smelled the stink of it as she ducked  she felt its sweat on her neck .   it was a real animal .  you couldn   t imagine a reek like that .   and here came the dogs .   the first one she caught with the edge of the pan  bowling it over .  the other turned to snap at her  then looked down in amazement as pictsies erupted from the snow under each paw .  it was hard to bite anyone when all four of your feet were moving away in different directions  and then other pictsies landed on its head and biting anything ever again soon became   impossible .  the nac mac feegle hated grimhounds .   tiffany looked up at a white horse .  that was real  too  as far as she could tell .  and there was a boy on it .      who are you .     he said .  he made it sound like    what sort of thing are you .         who are you .     said tiffany  pushing her hair out of her eyes .  it was the best she could do right now .      this is my forest     said the boy .     i command you to do what i say .      tiffany peered at him .  the dull  secondhand light of fairyland was not very good  but the more she looked  the more certain she was .     your name is roland  isn   t it .     she said .      you will not speak to me like that .         yes  it is .  you   re the baron   s son .         i demand that you stop talking .     the boy   s expression was strange now  creased up and pink  as if he was trying not to cry .  he raised his hand with a riding whip in it     there was a very faint thwap .  tiffany glanced down .  the nac mac feegle had formed a pile under the horse   s belly  and one of them  climbing up on their shoulders  had just cut through the saddle girth .   she held up a hand quickly .     stand still .     she shouted  trying to sound commanding .     if you move  you   ll fall off your horse .         is that a spell .  are you a witch .     the boy dropped the whip and pulled a long dagger from his belt .     death to witches .      he urged the horse forward with a jerk  and then there was one of those long moments  a moment when the whole universe said     uh oh    and  still holding the dagger  the boy swiveled around the horse and landed in the snow .   tiffany knew what would happen next .  rob anybody   s voice echoed among the trees      you   re in trouble noo  pal .  get him .         no .     tiffany yelled .     get away from him .      the boy scrambled backward  staring at tiffany in horror .      i do know you     she said .     your name is roland .  you   re the baron   s son .  they said you   d died in the forest           you mustn   t talk about that .         why not .         bad things happen .         they   re already happening     said tiffany .     look  i   m here to rescue my        but the boy had got to his feet and was running back through the forest .  he turned and shouted     stay away from me .      tiffany ran after him  jumping over snow covered logs  and saw him ahead  dodging from tree to tree .  then he paused and looked back .   she ran up to him  saying     i know how to get you out           and danced .   she was holding the hand of a parrot or  at least someone with the head of a parrot .   her feet moved under her  perfectly .  they twirled her around  and this time her hand was caught by a peacock  or at least someone with the head of a peacock .  she glanced over his shoulder and saw that she was now in a room  no  a ballroom full of masked people  dancing .   ah  she thought .  another dream .  i should have looked where i was going .   the music was strange .  there was a kind of rhythm to it  but it sounded muffled and odd  as if it was being played backward  underwater  by musicians who   d never seen their instruments before .   and she hoped the dancers were wearing masks .  she realized she was looking out through the eyeholes of one and wondered what she was .  she was also wearing a long dress  which glittered .   o kay  she thought carefully .  there was a drome there  and i didn   t stop to look .  and now i   m in a dream .  but it   s not mine .  it must make use of what it finds in your head  and i   ve never been to anything like this .      fwa waa fwah waa wha .     said the peacock .  the voice was like the music .  it sounded almost like a voice  but it wasn   t .      oh  yes     said tiffany .     fine .         fwaa .         oh .  er   wuff fawf fwaff .      this seemed to work .  the peacock headed dancer bobbed a little bow  said    mwa waf waf    sadly  and wandered off .   somewhere in here is the drome  said tiffany to herself .  and it must be a pretty good one .  this is a big dream .   little things were wrong  though .  there were hundreds of people in the room  but the ones in the distance  although they were moving about in quite a natural way  seemed the same as the trees   blobs and swirls of color .  you had to look hard to notice this  though .   first sight  tiffany thought .   people in brilliant costumes and still more masks walked arm in arm past her  as if she was just another guest .  those who weren   t joining the new dance were heading for the long tables at one side of the hall  which were piled with food .   tiffany had seen such food only in pictures .  people didn   t starve on the farm  but even when food was plentiful  at hogswatch or after harvest  it never looked like this .  the farm food was mostly shades of white or brown .  it was never pink and blue  and never wobbled .   there were things on sticks  and things that gleamed and glistened in bowls .  nothing was simple .  everything had cream on it  or chocolate whirls  or thousands of little colored balls .  everything was spun or glazed or added to or mixed up .  this wasn   t food   it was what food became if it had been good and had gone to food heaven .   it wasn   t just for eating  it was for show .  it was piled up against mounds of greenery and enormous arrangements of flowers .  here and there huge transparent carvings were landmarks in this landscape of food .  tiffany reached up and touched a glittering cockerel .  it was ice  damp under her fingertips .  there were others  too   a jolly fat man  a bowl of fruits all carved in ice  a swan .   tiffany was  for a moment  tempted .  it seemed a very long time since she had eaten anything .  but the food was too obviously not food at all .  it was bait .  it was supposed to say  hello  little kiddie .  eat me .   i   m getting the hang of this  thought tiffany .  good thing it didn   t think of cheese        and there was cheese .  suddenly  cheese had always been there .   she   d seen pictures of lots of different cheeses in the almanack .  she was good at cheese and had always wondered what the others tasted like .  they were faraway cheeses with strange sounding names  cheeses like treble wibbley  waney tasty  old argg  red runny  and the legendary lancre blue  which had to be nailed to the table to stop it attacking other cheeses .   just a taste wouldn   t hurt  surely .  it wasn   t the same as eating  was it .  after all  she was in control  wasn   t she .  she   d seen right through the dream straight away  hadn   t she .  so it couldn   t have any effect  could it .   and   well  cheese was hardly temptation for anyone .   okay  the drome must   ve put the cheese in as soon as she   d thought of it  but     she was already holding the cheese knife .  she didn   t quite remember picking it up .   a drop of cold water landed on her hand .  it made her glance up at the nearest glittering ice carving .   it showed a shepherdess  with a saddlebag dress and a big bonnet .  tiffany was sure it had been a swan when she   d looked at it before .   the anger came back .  she   d nearly been fooled .  she looked at the cheese knife .     be a sword     she said .  after all  the drome was making her dream  but she was doing the dreaming .  she was real .  part of her wasn   t asleep .   there was a clang .      correction     said tiffany .     be a sword that isn   t so heavy .     and this time she got something she could actually hold .   there was a rustling in the greenery and a red haired face poked out .      psst     it whispered .     dinna eat the canap  s .         you   re a bit late .         ach  weel  it   s a cunnin    ol    drome ye   re dealin    with here     said rob anybody .     the dream wouldna let us in unless we wuz properly dressed .      he stepped out  looking very sheepish in a black suit with a bow tie .  there was more rustling and other pictsies pushed their way out of the greenery .  they looked a bit like redheaded penguins .      properly dressed .     said tiffany .      aye     said daft wullie  who had a piece of lettuce on his head .     an    these troosers are a wee bit chafin    around the nethers  i don   t mind tellin    ye .         have ye spotted the creature yet .     said rob anybody .      no .  it   s so crowded .         we   ll help ye look     said rob anybody .     the thing canna hide if ye   re right up close .  be careful  mind you .  if it thinks ye   re gonna whap it one  there   s nae tellin    what it   ll try .  spread oot  lads  and pretend ye   re enjoying the cailey .         whut .  d   ye mean get drunk and fight an    that .     said daft wullie .      crivens  ye wouldna believe it     said rob anybody  rolling his eyes .     nae  ye pudden .  this is a posh party  ye ken .  that means ye mak    small talk an    mingle .         ach  i   m a famous mingler .  they won   t even know we   re here .     said daft wullie .     c   mon .      even in a dream  even at a posh ball  the nac mac feegle knew how to behave .  you charged in madly  and you screamed   politely .      lovely weather for the time o    year  is it not  ye wee scunner .         hey  jimmy  ha    ye no got a pommes frites for an ol    pal .         the band is playin    divinely  i dinna think .         make my caviar deep fried  wilya .      there was something wrong with the crowd .  no one was panicking or trying to run away  which was certainly the right response to an invasion of feegles .   tiffany set off again through the crowd .  the masked people at the party paid her no attention either .  and that   s because they   re background people  she thought  just like the background trees .  she walked along the room to a pair of double doors and pulled them open .   there was nothing but blackness beyond it .   so   the only way out was to find the drome .  she hadn   t really expected anything else .  it could be anywhere .  it could be behind a mask  it could be a table .  it could be anything .   tiffany stared at the crowd .  and it was then she saw roland .   he was sitting at a table by himself .  it was spread with food  and he had a spoon in his hand .   she ran over and knocked it onto the floor .     haven   t you got any sense at all .     she said  pulling him upright .     do you want to stay here forever .      and then she felt the movement behind her .  later on  she was sure she hadn   t heard anything .  she   d just known .  it was a dream  after all .   she glanced around  and there was the drome .  it was almost hidden behind a pillar .   roland just stared at her .      are you all right .     said tiffany desperately  trying to shake him .     have you eaten anything .         fwa fwa faff     murmured the boy .   tiffany turned back to the drome .  it was moving toward her  but very slowly  trying to stay in the shadows .  it looked like a little snowman made of dirty snow .   the music was getting louder .  the candles were getting brighter .  out on the huge dance floor the animal headed couples whirled faster and faster .  and the floor shook .  the dream was in trouble .   the nac mac feegles were running to her from every part of the floor  trying to be heard above the din .   the drome was lurching toward her  pudgy white fingers grasping the air .      first sight     breathed tiffany .   she cut roland   s head off .       the snow had melted all across the clearing  and the trees looked real and properly treelike .   in front of tiffany the drome fell backward .  she was holding the old frying pan in her hand  but it had cut beautifully .  odd things  dreams .   she turned and faced roland  who was staring at her with a face so pale  he might as well have been a drome .      it was frightened     she said .     it wanted me to attack you instead .  it tried to look like you and made you look like a drome .  but it didn   t know how to speak .  you do .         you might have killed me .     he said hoarsely .      no     said tiffany .     i just explained .  please don   t run away .  have you seen a baby boy here .      roland   s face wrinkled .     what .     he said .      the queen took him     said tiffany .     i   m going to fetch him home .  i   ll take you too  if you like .         you   ll never get away     whispered roland .      i got in  didn   t i .         getting in is easy .  no one gets out .         i mean to find a way     said tiffany  trying to sound a lot more confident than she felt .      she won   t let you .     roland started to back away again .      please don   t be so   so stupid     said tiffany .     i   m going to find the queen and get my brother back  whatever you say .  understand .  i   ve got this far .  and i   ve got help  you know .         where .     said roland .   tiffany looked around .  there was no sign of the nac mac feegle .      they always turn up     she said .     just when i need them .      it struck her that there was suddenly something very   empty about the forest .  it seemed colder  too .      they   ll be here any minute     she added  hopefully .      they got trapped in the dream     said roland flatly .      they can   t have .  i killed the drome .         it   s more complicated than that     said the boy .     you don   t know what it   s like here .  there   s dreams inside dreams .  there   s   other things that live inside dreams  horrible things .  you never know if you   ve really woken up .  and the queen controls them all .  they   re fairy people  anyway .  you can   t trust them .  you can   t trust anyone .  i don   t trust you .  you   re probably just another dream .      he turned his back and walked away  following the line of hoofprints .   tiffany hesitated .  the only other real person was going away  leaving her here with nothing but the trees and the shadows .   and  of course  anything horrible that was running toward her through them .      er       she said .     hello .  rob anybody .  william .  daft wullie .      there was no reply .  there wasn   t even an echo .  she was alone  except for her heartbeats .   well  of course she   d fought things and won  hadn   t she .  but the nac mac feegle had been there and  somehow  that   d made it easy .  they never gave up  they   d attack absolutely anything  and they didn   t know the meaning of the word fear .   tiffany  who had read her way through the dictionary  had a second thought there .  fear was only one of thousands of words the pictsies probably didn   t know the meaning of .  unfortunately  she did know what it meant .  and the taste and feel of fear  too .  she felt it now .   she gripped the pan .  it didn   t seem quite such a good weapon anymore .   the cold blue shadows between the trees seemed to be spreading out .  they were darkest ahead of her  where the hoofprints led .  strangely enough  the wood behind her seemed almost light and inviting .   someone doesn   t want me to go on  she thought .  that was   quite encouraging .  but the twilight was misty and shimmered unpleasantly .  anything could be waiting .   she was waiting  too .  she realized that she was waiting for the nac mac feegle  hoping against hope that she   d hear a sudden cry  even of    crivens .      she was sure it was a swearword .    she pulled out the toad  which lay snoring on the palm of her hand  and gave it a prod .      whp .     it croaked .      i   m stuck in a wood of evil dreams and i   m all alone and i think it   s getting darker     said tiffany .     what should i do .      the toad opened one bleary eye and said     leave .         that is not a lot of help .         best advice there is     said the toad .     now put me back   the cold makes me lethargic .      reluctantly  tiffany put the creature back in her apron pocket  and her hand touched diseases of the sheep .   she pulled it out and opened it at random .  there was a cure for the steams  but it had been crossed out in pencil .  written in the margin  in granny aching   s big  round  careful handwriting was   this dunt work .  one desert spoonfull of terpentine do .   tiffany closed the book with care and put it back gently so as not to disturb the sleeping toad .  then  gripping the pan   s handle tightly  she stepped into the long blue shadows .   how do you get shadows when there   s no sun in the sky .  she thought  because it was better to think about things like this than all the other  much worse things that were on her mind .   but these shadows didn   t need light to create them .  they crawled around on the snow of their own accord  and backed away when she walked toward them .  that  at least  was a relief .   they piled up behind her .  they were following her .  she turned and stamped her foot a few times  and they scurried off behind the trees  but she knew they were flowing back when she wasn   t looking .   she saw a drome in the distance ahead of her  standing half hidden behind a tree .  she screamed at it and waved the pan threateningly  and it lumbered off quickly .   when she looked around  she saw two more behind her  a long way back .   the track led uphill a little  into what looked like a much thicker mist .  it glowed faintly .  she headed for it .  there was no other way to go .   when she reached the top of the rise  she looked down into a shallow valley .   there were four dromes in it   big ones  bigger than any she   d seen so far .  they were sitting down in a square  their dumpy legs stretched out in front of them .  each one had a gold collar around its neck  attached to a chain .      tame ones .     tiffany wondered  aloud .     but        who could put a collar around the neck of a drome .  only someone who could dream as well as they could .   we tamed the sheepdogs to help us herd sheep  she thought .  the queen uses dromes to herd dreams .   in the center of the square formed by the dromes the air was full of mist .  the hoof tracks  and the tracks of roland  led down past the tame dromes and into the cloud .   tiffany spun around .  the shadows darted back .   there was nothing else nearby .  no birds sang  nothing moved in the woods .  but she could make out three more dromes now  their big round soggy faces peering at her around tree trunks .   she was being herded .   at a time like this it would be nice to have someone around to say something like    no .  it   s too dangerous .  don   t do it .      unfortunately  there wasn   t .  she was going to commit an act of extreme bravery and no one would know if it all went wrong .  that was frightening  but also   annoying .  that was it   annoying .  this place annoyed her .  it was all stupid and strange .   it was the same feeling she   d had when jenny had leaped out of the river .  out of her river .  and the queen had taken her brother .  maybe it was selfish to think like that  but anger was better than fear .  fear was a damp cold mess  but anger had an edge .  she could use it .   they were herding her .  like a   a sheep .   well  an angry sheep could send a vicious dog away  whimpering .   so     four big dromes  sitting in a square .   it was going to be a big dream .   raising the pan to shoulder height  to swipe at anything that came near  and suppressing a dreadful urge to go to the toilet  tiffany walked slowly down the slope  across the snow  through the mist        and into summer .       chapter         master stroke      the heat struck like a blowtorch  so sharp and sudden that she gasped .   she   d had sunstroke once  up on the downs  when she   d gone without a bonnet .  and this was like that  the world around here was in worrying shades of dull green  yellow  and purple  without shadows .  the air was so full of heat that she felt she could squeeze smoke out of it .   she was in   reeds  they looked like  much taller than her        with sunflowers growing in them  except        the sunflowers were white        because they weren   t  in fact  sunflowers at all .   they were daisies .  she knew it .  she   d stared at them dozens of times  in that strange picture in the faerie tales .  they were daisies  and these weren   t giant reeds around her  they were blades of grass and she was very  very small .   she was in the weird picture .  the picture was the dream  or the dream was the picture .  which way around didn   t matter  because she was right in the middle of it .  if you fell off a cliff  it wouldn   t matter if the ground was rushing up or you were rushing down .  you were in trouble either way .   somewhere in the distance there was a loud crack .  and a ragged cheer .  someone clapped and said  in a sleepy sort of voice     well done .  good man .  ver    well done .      with some effort tiffany pushed her way between the blades of grass .   on a flat rock a man was cracking nuts half as big as he was  with a two handed hammer .  he was being watched by a crowd of people .  tiffany used the word people because she couldn   t think of anything else that was suitable  but it was stretching the word a bit to make it fit all the   people .   they were different sizes  for one thing .  some of the men were taller than her  even if you allowed for the fact that everyone was shorter than the grass .  but others were tiny .  some of them had faces that you wouldn   t look at twice .  others had faces that no one would want to look at even once .   this is a dream  after all  tiffany told herself .  it doesn   t have to make sense  or be nice .  it   s a dream  not a daydream .  people who say things like    may all your dreams come true    should try living in one for five minutes .   she stepped out into the bright  stiflingly hot clearing just as the man raised his hammer again  and said     excuse me .         yes .     he said .      is there a queen around here .     said tiffany .   the man wiped his forehead and nodded toward the other side of the clearing .      her majesty has gone to her bower     he said .      that being a nook or resting place .     said tiffany .   the man nodded and said     correct again  miss tiffany .      don   t ask how he knows your name  tiffany told herself .      thank you     she said  and because she had been brought up to be polite  she added     best of luck with the nut cracking .         this one   s the toughest yet     said the man .   tiffany walked off  trying to look as if this collection of strange nearly people was just another crowd .  probably the scariest ones were the big women  two of them .   big women were valued on the chalk .  farmers liked big wives .  farmwork was hard  and there was no call for a wife who couldn   t carry a couple of piglets or a bale of hay .  but these two could have carried a horse each .  they stared haughtily at her as she walked past .   they had tiny  stupid little wings on their backs .      nice day for watching nuts being cracked .     said tiffany cheerfully as she went past .  their huge pale faces wrinkled  as if they were trying to work out what she was .   sitting down near them  watching the nut cracker with an expression of concern  was a little man with a large head  a fringe of white beard  and pointy ears .  he was wearing very old fashioned clothes  and his eyes followed tiffany as she went past .      good morning     she said .      sneebs .     he said  and in her head appeared the words     get away from here .         excuse me .     she said .      sneebs .     said the man  wringing his hands .  and the words appeared  floating in her brain     it   s terribly dangerous .      he waved a pale hand as if to brush her away .  shaking her head  tiffany walked on .   there were lords and ladies  people in fine clothes and even a few shepherds .  but some of them had a pieced together look .  they looked  in fact  like a picture book back in her bedroom .   it was made of thick card  its edges worn raggedy by generations of aching children .  each page showed a character  and each was cut into four strips that could be turned over independently .  the point of the whole thing was that a bored child could turn over parts of the pages and change the way the characters were dressed .  you could end up with a soldier   s head on a baker   s chest wearing a maid   s dress and a farmer   s big boots .   tiffany had never been bored enough .  she considered that even things that spend their whole lives hanging from the undersides of branches would never be bored enough to spend more than five seconds with that book .   the people around here looked as though they   d either been taken from that book or had dressed for a fancy dress party in the dark .  one or two of them nodded to her as she passed but didn   t seem surprised to see her .   she ducked under a round leaf much bigger than she was and took out the toad again .      whap .  it   s sti    cooold     said the toad  hunching down on her hand .      cold .  the air   s baking .         there   s just snow     said the toad .     put me back  i   m freezing .      just a minute  thought tiffany .     do toads dream .     she said .      no .         oh   so it   s not really hot .         no .  you just think it is .         psst     said a voice .   tiffany put the toad away and wondered if she dared to turn her head .      it   s me .     said the voice .   tiffany turned toward a clump of daisies twice the height of a man .     that   s not a lot of help .         are you crazy .     said the daisies .      i   m looking for my brother     said tiffany sharply .      the horrible child who screams for candy all the time .      the daisy stems parted and the boy roland darted out and joined her under the leaf .      yes     she said  edging away and feeling that only a sister has a right to call even a brother like wentworth horrible .      and threatens to go to the toilet if he   s left alone .     said roland .      yes .  where is he .         that   s your brother .  the one who   s permanently sticky .         i told you .         and you really want him back .         yes .         why .      he   s my brother  tiffany thought .  what   s why got to do with it .      because he   s my brother .  now tell me where he is .         are you sure you can get out of here .     said roland .      of course     tiffany lied .      and you can take me with you .         yes .     well  she hoped so .      all right .  i   ll let you do that     said roland  relaxing .      oh  you   ll let me  will you .     said tiffany .      look  i didn   t know what you were  all right .     said roland .     there   s always weird things in the forest .  lost people  bits of dreams that   re still lying around   you have to be careful .  but if you really know the way  then i ought to get back before my father worries too much .      tiffany felt the second thoughts starting .  they said  don   t change your expression .  just   check .      how long have you been here .     she asked carefully .     exactly .         well  the light doesn   t really change much     said the boy .     it feels like i   ve been here   oh  hours .  maybe a day .      tiffany tried hard not to let her face give anything away  but it didn   t work .  roland   s eyes narrowed .      i have  haven   t i .     he said .      er   why do you ask .     said tiffany  desperately .      because in a way it   feels like   longer .  i   ve only been hungry two or three times  and been to the   you know   twice  so it can   t be very long .  but i   ve done all kinds of things   it   s been a busy day    .     his voice trailed off .      um .  you   re right     said tiffany .     time goes slowly here .  it   s been   a bit longer .         a hundred years .  don   t tell me it   s a hundred years .  something magical has happened and it   s a hundred years  yes .         what .  no .  um   nearly a year .      the boy   s reaction was surprising .  this time he looked really frightened .     oh  no .  that   s worse than a hundred years .         how .     said tiffany  bewildered .      if it was a hundred years  i wouldn   t get a thrashing when i got home .      hmm  thought tiffany .     i don   t think that   s going to happen     she said aloud .     your father has been very miserable .  besides  it   s not your fault you were stolen by the queen       she hesitated  because this time it was his expression that gave it all away .     was it .         well  there was this fine lady on a horse with bells all over its harness  and she galloped past me when i was out hunting and she was laughing  so of course i spurred my horse and chased after her  and       he fell silent .      that probably wasn   t a good decision     said tiffany .      it   s not   bad here     said roland .     it just keeps changing .  there   s   doorways everywhere .  i mean  entrances into other places       his voice tailed off .      you   d better start at the beginning     said tiffany .          it was great at first     said roland .     i thought it was  you know  an adventure .  she fed me sweetmeats           what are they  exactly .     said tiffany .  her dictionary hadn   t included that one .     are they like sweetbreads .         i don   t know .  what are sweetbreads .         the pancreas or thymus gland of a cow     said tiffany .     not a very good name  i think .      roland   s face went red with the effort of thought .     these were more like nougat .         right .  go on     said tiffany .      and then she told me to sing and dance and skip and play     said roland .     she said that   s what children were supposed to do .         did you .         would you .  i   d feel like an idiot .  i   m twelve  you know .     roland hesitated .     in fact  if what you say is true  i   m thirteen now  right .         why did she want you to skip and play .     said tiffany  instead of saying     no  you   re still twelve and act like you   re eight .         she just said that   s what children do     said roland .   tiffany wondered about this .  as far as she could see  children mostly argued  shouted  ran around very fast  laughed loudly  picked their noses  got dirty  and sulked .  any seen dancing and skipping and singing had probably been stung by a wasp .      strange     she said .      and then when i wouldn   t  she gave me more sweets .         more nougat .         sugarplums     said roland .     they   re like plums .  you know .  with sugar on .  she   s always trying to feed me sugar .  she thinks i like it .      a small bell rang in tiffany   s memory .     you don   t think she   s trying to fatten you up before she bakes you in an oven and eats you  do you .         of course not .  only wicked witches do that .      tiffany   s eyes narrowed .     oh yes     she said carefully .     i forgot .  so you   ve been living on sweeties .         no  i know how to hunt .  real animals get in here .  i don   t know how .  sneebs thinks they find the doorways in by accident .  and then they starve to death  because it   s always winter here .  sometimes the queen sends out robbing parties if a door opens into an interesting world  too .  this whole place is like   a pirate ship .         yes  or a sheep tick     said tiffany  thinking aloud .      what   re they .         they   re insects that bite sheep and suck blood and don   t drop off until they   re full     said tiffany .      yuck .  i suppose that   s the kind of thing peasants have to know about     said roland .     i   m glad i don   t .  i   ve seen through the doorways to one or two worlds .  they wouldn   t let me out  though .  we got potatoes from one  and fish from another .  i think they frighten people into giving them stuff .  oh  and there was the world where the dromes come from .  they laughed about that and said if i wanted to go in there  i was welcome .  i didn   t .  it   s all red  like a sunset .  a great huge sun on the horizon  and a red sea that hardly moves  and red rocks  and long shadows .  and those horrible creatures sitting on the rocks .  they live off crabs and spidery things and little scribbity creatures .  it was awful .  there was this sort of ring of little claws and shells and bones around every one of them .         who are they .     said tiffany  who had noted the word peasants .      what do you mean .         you keep talking about    they        said tiffany .     who do you mean .  the people out there .         those .  most of them aren   t even real     said roland .     i mean the elves .  the fairies .  that   s who she   s queen of .  didn   t you know .         i thought they were small .         i think they can be any size they like     said roland .     they   re not exactly real .  they   re like   dreams of themselves .  they can be thin as air or solid as a rock .  sneebs says .         sneebs .     said tiffany .     oh   the little man that just says sneebs but real words turn up in your head .         yes  that   s him .  he   s been here for years .  that   s how i knew about the time being wrong .  sneebs got back to his own world once  and it was all different .  he was so miserable  he found another doorway and came straight back .         he came back .     said tiffany  astonished .      he said it was better to belong where you don   t belong than not to belong where you used to belong  remembering when you used to belong there     said roland .     at least  i think that   s what he said .  he said it   s not too bad here if you keep out of the queen   s way .  he says you can learn a lot .      tiffany looked back at the hunched figure of sneebs  who was still watching the nut cracking .  he didn   t look as though he was learning anything .  he just looked like someone who   d been frightened for so long  it had become part of his life  like freckles .      but you mustn   t make the queen angry     said roland .     i   ve seen what happens to people who make her angry .  she sets the bumblebee women on them .         are you talking about those huge women with the tiny wings .         yes .  they   ve vicious .  and if the queen gets really angry with someone  she just stares at them  and   they change .         into what .         other things .  i don   t want to have to draw you a picture .     roland shuddered .     and if i did  i   d need a lot of red and purple crayon .  then they get dragged off and left for the dromes .     he shook his head .     listen  dreams are real here .  really real .  when you   re inside them you   re not   exactly here .  the nightmares are real  too .  you can die .      this doesn   t feel real  tiffany told herself .  this feels like a dream .  i could almost wake up from it .   i must always remember what   s real .   she looked down at her faded blue dress  with the bad stitching around the hem caused by it being let out and taken in as its various owners had grown .  that was real .   and she was real .  cheese was real .  somewhere not far away was a world of green turf under a blue sky  and that was real .   the nac mac feegle were real  and once again she wished they were here .  there was something about the way they shouted    crivens .     and attacked everything in sight that was so very comforting .   roland was probably real .   almost everything else was really a dream  in a robber world that lived off the real worlds and where time nearly stood still and horrible things could happen at any moment .  i don   t want to know anything more about it  she decided .  i just want to get my brother and go home  while i   m still angry .   because when i stop being angry  that   ll be the time to get frightened again  and i   ll be really frightened this time .  too frightened to think .  as frightened as sneebs .  and i must think    .      the first dream i fell into was like one of mine     she said .     i   ve had dreams where i wake up and i   m still asleep .  but the ballroom  i   ve never           oh  that was one of mine     said roland .     from when i was young .  i woke up one night and went down to the big hall and there were all these people with masks on  dancing .  it was just so   bright .     he looked wistful for a moment .     that was when my mother was still alive .         this one   s a picture from a book i   ve got     said tiffany .     she must have got that from me           no  she often uses it     said roland .     she likes it .  she picks up dreams from everywhere .  she collects them .      tiffany stood and picked up the frying pan again .     i   m going to see the queen     she said .      don   t     said roland .     you   re the only other real person here except sneebs  and he   s not very good company .         i   m going to get my brother and go home     said tiffany flatly .      i   m not going to come with you  then     said roland .     i don   t want to see what she turns you into .      tiffany stepped out into the heavy  shadowless light and followed the path up the slope .  giant grasses arched overhead .  here and there more strangely dressed  strangely shaped people turned to watch her but then acted as though she was just a passing wanderer  of no interest whatsoever .   she glanced behind her .  in the distance the nut cracker had found a bigger hammer and was getting ready to strike .      wanna wanna wanna sweetie .      tiffany   s head shot around like a weathercock in a tornado .  she ran along the path  head down  ready to swing the pan at anything that stood in her way  and burst through a clump of grass into a space lined with daisies .  it could well have been a bower .  she didn   t bother to check .   wentworth was sitting on a large  flat stone  surrounded by sweets .  many of them were bigger than he was .  smaller ones were in piles  large ones lay like logs .  and they were in every color sweets can be  such as not really raspberry red  fake lemon yellow  curiously chemical orange  some kind of acidy green  and who knows what blue .   tears were falling off his chin in blobs .  since they were landing among the sweets  serious stickiness was already taking place .   wentworth howled .  his mouth was a big red tunnel with the wobbly thing that no one knows the name of bouncing up and down in the back of his throat .  he stopped crying only when it was time to either breathe in or die  and even then it was only for one huge sucking moment before the howl came back again .   tiffany knew what the problem was immediately .  she   d seen it before  at birthday parties .  her brother was suffering from tragic sweet deprivation .  yes  he was surrounded by sweets .  but the moment he took any sweet at all  said his sugar addled brain  that meant he was not taking all the rest .  and there were so many sweets he   d never be able to eat them all .  it was too much to cope with .  the only solution was to burst into tears .   the only solution at home was to put a bucket over his head until he calmed down  and to take almost all the sweets away .  he could deal with a few handfuls at a time .   tiffany dropped the pan and swept him up in her arms .     it   s tiffy     she whispered .     and we   re going home .      and this is where i meet the queen  she thought .  but there was no scream of rage  no explosion of magic   nothing .   there was just the buzz of bees in the distance  and the sound of wind in the grass  and the gulping of wentworth  who was too shocked to cry .   she could see now that the far side of the bower contained a couch of leaves  surrounded by hanging flowers .  but there was no one there .      that   s because i   m behind you     said the voice of the queen in her ear .   tiffany turned around quickly .   there was no one there .      still behind you     said the queen .     this is my world  child .  you   ll never be as fast as me  or as clever as me .  why are you trying to take my boy away .         he isn   t yours .  he   s ours .     said tiffany .      you never loved him .  you have a heart like a little snowball .  i can see it .      tiffany   s forehead wrinkled .     love .     she said .     what   s that got to do with it .  he   s my brother .  my brother .         yes  that   s a very witchy thing  isn   t it     said the voice of the queen .     selfishness .  mine  mine  mine .  all a witch cares about is what   s hers .         you stole him .         stole .  you mean you thought you owned him .      tiffany   s second thoughts said  she   s finding your weaknesses .  don   t listen to her .      ah  you have second thoughts     said the queen .     i expect you think that makes you very witchy  do you .         why won   t you let me see you .     said tiffany .     are you frightened .         frightened .     said the voice of the queen .     of something like you .      and the queen was there  in front of her .  she was much taller than tiffany  but just as slim  her hair was long and black  her face pale  her lips cherry red  her dress black and white and red .  and it was all  very slightly  wrong .   tiffany   s second thoughts said  it   s because she   s perfect .  completely perfect .  like a doll .  no one real is as perfect as that .      that   s not you     said tiffany  with absolute certainty .     that   s just your dream of you .  that   s not you at all .      the queen   s smile disappeared for a moment and came back all edgy and brittle .      such rudeness  and you hardly know me     she said  sitting down on the leafy seat .  she patted the space beside her .      do sit down     she said .     standing there like that is so confrontational .  i will put your bad manners down to simple disorientation .     she gave tiffany a beautiful smile .   look at the way her eyes move  said tiffany   s second thoughts .  i don   t think she   s using them to see you with .  they   re just beautiful ornaments .      you have invaded my home  killed some of my creatures  and generally acted in a mean and despicable way     said the queen .     this offends me .  however  i understand that you have been badly led by disruptive elements           you stole my brother     said tiffany  holding wentworth tightly .     you steal all sorts of things .     but her voice sounded weak and tinny in her ears .      he was wandering around lost     said the queen calmly .     i brought him home and comforted him .      and what there was about the queen   s voice was this  it said  in a friendly  understanding way  that she was right and you were wrong .  and this wasn   t your fault  exactly .  it was probably the fault of your parents  or your food  or something so terrible you   ve completely forgotten about it .  it wasn   t your fault  the queen understood  because you were a nice person .  it was just such a terrible thing that all these bad influences had made you make the wrong choices .  if only you   d admit that  tiffany  then the world would be a much happier place        this cold place  guarded by monsters  in a world where nothing grows older  or up  said her second thoughts .  a world with the queen in charge of everything .  don   t listen .   she managed to take a step backward .      am i a monster .     said the queen .     all i wanted was a little bit of company .      and tiffany   s second thoughts  quite swamped by the queen   s wonderful voice  said  miss female infant robinson         she   d come to work as a maid at one of the farms many years ago .  they said that she   d been brought up in a home for the destitute in yelp .  they said she   d been born there after her mother had arrived during a terrible storm and the master had written in his big black diary     to miss robinson  female infant     and her young mother hadn   t been very bright and was dying in any case and had thought that was the baby   s name .  after all  it had been written down in an official book .   miss robinson was quite old now  never said much  never ate much  but you never saw her not doing something .  no one could scrub a floor like miss female infant robinson .  she had a thin  wispy face with a pointed red nose  and thin  pale hands with red knuckles  which were always busy .  miss robinson worked hard .   tiffany hadn   t understood a lot of what was going on when the crime happened .  the women talked about it in twos and threes at garden gates  their arms folded  and they   d stop and look indignant if a man walked past .   she picked up bits of conversation  though sometimes they seemed to be in a kind of code  like     never really had anyone of her own  poor old soul .  wasn   t her fault she was skinnier   n a rake     and    they say that when they found her  she was cuddling it and said it was hers     and    the house was full of baby clothes she   d knitted .     that last one had puzzled tiffany at the time  because it was said in the same tone of voice that someone   d use to say     and the house was full of human skulls .      but they all agreed on one thing  we can   t have this .  a crime   s a crime .  the baron   s got to be told .   miss robinson had stolen a baby  punctuality riddle  who had been much loved by his young parents even though they   d named him punctuality  reasoning that if children could be named after virtues like patience  faith  and prudence  what was wrong with a little good time keeping .   .   he   d been left in his crib in the yard and had vanished .  and there had been all the usual searchings and weepings  and then someone had mentioned that miss robinson had been taking home extra milk .   it was kidnaping .  there weren   t many fences on the chalk  and very few doors with locks .  theft of all kinds was taken very seriously .  if you couldn   t turn your back on what was yours for five minutes  where would it all end .  the law   s the law .  a crime   s a crime .   tiffany had overheard bits of arguments all over the village  but the same phrases cropped up over and over again .  poor thing never meant no harm .  she was a hard worker  never complained .  she   s not right in the head .  the law   s the law .  a crime   s a crime .   and so the baron was told  and he held a court in the great hall  and everyone who wasn   t wanted up on the hills turned up  including mr .  and mrs .  riddle  she looking worried  he looking determined  and miss robinson  who just stared at the ground with her red knuckled hands on her knees .   it was hardly a trial .  miss robinson was confused about what she was accused of  and it seemed to tiffany that so was everyone else .  they weren   t certain why they were there  and they   d come to find out .   the baron had been uneasy  too .  the law was clear .  theft was a dreadful crime  and stealing a human being was much worse .  there was a prison in yelp  right beside the home for the destitute  some said there was even a connecting door .  that was where thieves went .   and the baron wasn   t a big thinker .  his family had held the chalk by not changing their mind about anything for hundreds of years .  he sat and listened and drummed his fingers on the table and looked at people   s faces and acted like a man sitting on a very hot chair .   tiffany was in the front row .  she was there when the man started to give his verdict  umming and ahhing  trying not to say the words he knew he   d have to say  when the door at the back of the hall opened and the sheepdogs thunder and lightning trotted in .   they came down the aisle between the rows of benches and sat down in front of the baron  looking bright eyed and alert .   only tiffany craned to see back up the aisle .  the doors were still slightly ajar .  they were far too heavy even for a strong dog to push them open .  and she could just make out someone looking through the crack .   the baron stopped and stared .  he  too  looked at the other end of the hall .   and then  after a few moments  he pushed the law book aside and said     perhaps we should do this a different way .      and there was a different way  involving people paying a little more attention to miss robinson .  it wasn   t perfect  and not everyone was happy  but it worked .   tiffany smelled the scent of jolly sailor outside the hall when the meeting was over  and thought about the baron   s dog .     remember this day     granny aching had said  and     ye   ll have cause to .      barons needed reminding .          who will speak up for you .     tiffany said aloud .      speak up for me .     answered the queen  her fine eyebrows arching .   and tiffany   s third thoughts said  watch her face when she is worried .      there isn   t anyone  is there .     said tiffany  backing away .     is there anyone you   ve been kind to .  anyone who   ll say you   re not just a thief and a bully .  because that   s what you are .  you   ve got a   you   re like the dromes  you   ve just got one trick .      and there it was .  now she could see what her third thoughts had spotted .  the queen   s face flickered for a moment .      and that   s not your body     said tiffany  plunging on .     that   s just what you want people to see .  it   s not real .  it   s just like everything else here  it   s hollow and empty        the queen ran forward and slapped her much harder than a dream should be able to .  tiffany landed in the moss and wentworth rolled away  yelling     wanna go a toy lut .      good  said tiffany   s third thoughts .      good .     said tiffany aloud .      good .     said the queen .   yes  said her third thoughts  because she doesn   t know you can have third thoughts and your hand is only a few inches from the frying pan and things like her hate iron  don   t they .  she   s angry .  now make her furious  so that she doesn   t think .  hurt her .      you just live here in a land full of winter and all you do is dream of summers     said tiffany .     no wonder the king went away .      the queen stood still for a moment  like the beautiful statue she so much resembled .  again  the walking dream flickered and tiffany thought she saw   something .  it was not much bigger than her  and almost human  and a little shabby and  just for a moment  shocked .  then the queen was back  tall and angry  and she drew a deep breath     tiffany grabbed the pan and swung it as she rolled onto her feet .  it hit the tall figure only a glancing blow  but the queen wavered like air over a hot road  and screamed .   tiffany didn   t wait to see what else was going to happen .  she grabbed her brother again  and ran away  down through the grass  past the strange figures looking around at the sound of the queen   s anger .   now shadows moved in the shadowless grasses .  some of the people   the joke people  the ones that looked like a flap the pages picture book   changed shape and started to move after tiffany and her screaming brother .   there was a booming noise on the other side of the clearing .  the two huge creatures that roland had called the bumblebee women were rising off the ground  their tiny wings blurring with the effort .   somebody grabbed her and pulled her into the grasses .  it was roland .      can you get out now .     he demanded  his face red .      er       tiffany began .      then we   d better just run     he said .     give me your hand .  come on .         do you know a way out .     tiffany panted  as they dashed through giant daisies .      no     roland panted back .     there isn   t one .  you saw   the dromes outside   this is a really strong dream .         then why are we running .         to keep out of her way .  if you hide long enough   sneebs says she   forgets .      i don   t think she   s going to forget me very quickly  tiffany thought .   roland had stopped  but she pulled her hand away and ran onward  with wentworth clinging to her in silent amazement .      where are you going .     shouted roland behind her .      i really want to keep out of her way .         come back .  you   re running right back .         no i   m not .  i   m running in a straight line .         this is a dream .     roland shouted  but it was louder now because he was catching up to her .     you   re running right around        tiffany burst into a clearing      the clearing .   the bumblebee women landed on either side of her  and the queen stepped forward .      you know     said the queen     i really expected better of you  tiffany .  now  give me back the boy  and i shall decide what to do next .         it   s not a big dream     mumbled roland behind her .     if you go too far  you end up coming back           i could make a dream for you that   s even smaller than you are     said the queen pleasantly .     that can be quite painful .      the colors were brighter .  and sounds were louder .  tiffany could smell something  too  and what was strange about that was that up until now there had been no smells .   it was a sharp  bitter smell that you never forgot .  it was the smell of snow .  and underneath the insect buzzings in the grass  she heard the faintest of voices .      crivens .  i canna find the way oot .          chapter         awakening      on the other side of the clearing  where the nut cracking man had been at work  was the last nut  half as high as tiffany .  and it was rocking gently .  the cracker took a swipe at it with the hammer  and it rolled out of the way .   see what   s really there  said tiffany to herself  and laughed .   the queen gave her a puzzled look .     you find this funny .     she demanded .     what   s funny about this .  what is amusing about this situation .         i just had a funny thought     said tiffany .  the queen glared  as people without a sense of humor do when they   re confronted with a smile .   you   re not very clever  thought tiffany .  you   ve never needed to be .  you can get what you want just by dreaming it .  you believe in your dreams  so you never have to think .   she turned and whispered to roland     crack the nut .  don   t worry about what i do  crack the nut .     the boy looked at her blankly .      what did you say to him .     snapped the queen .      i said good bye     said tiffany  holding on tightly to her brother .     i   m not handing my brother over  no matter what you do .         do you know what color your insides are .     said the queen .   tiffany shook her head mutely .      well  now you   ll find out     said the queen  smiling sweetly .      you   re not powerful enough to do anything like that     said tiffany .      you know  you are right     said the queen .     that kind of physical magic is  indeed  very hard .  but i can make you think i   ve done the most   terrible things .  and that  little girl  is all i need to do .  would you like to beg for mercy now .  you may not be able to later .      tiffany paused .     no o     she said at last .     i don   t think i will .      the queen leaned down .  her gray eyes filled tiffany   s world .     people here will remember this for a long time     she said .      i hope so     said tiffany .     crack   the   nut .      for a moment the queen looked puzzled again .  she was not good at dealing with sudden changes .     what .         eh .  oh .  right     muttered roland .      what did you say to him .     the queen demanded  as the boy ran toward the hammer man .   tiffany kicked her on the leg .  it wasn   t a witch thing .  it was so nine years old  and she wished she could have thought of something better .  on the other hand  she had hard boots and it was a good kick .   the queen shook her .     why did you do that .     she said .     why won   t you do what i say .  everyone could be so happy if only they   d do what i say .      tiffany stared at the woman   s face .  the eyes were gray now  but the pupils were like silver mirrors .   i know what you are  said her third thoughts .  you   re something that   s never learned anything .  you don   t know anything about people .  you   re just   a child that   s got old .      want a sweetie .     she whispered .   there was a shout behind her .  she twisted in the queen   s grip and saw roland fighting for the hammer .  as she watched  he turned desperately and raised the heavy thing over his head  knocking over the elf behind him .   the queen pulled her around savagely as the hammer fell .     sweetie .     she hissed .     i   ll show you swe           crivens .  it   s the quin .  an    she   s got oour kelda  the ol    topher .         nae quin .  nae laird .  wee free men .         i could murrrder a kebab .         get her .      tiffany might have been the only person  in all the worlds that there are  to be happy to hear the sound of the nac mac feegle .   they poured out of the smashed nut .  some were still wearing bow ties .  some were back in their kilts .  but they were all in a fighting mood and  to save time  were fighting with one another to get up to speed .   the clearing   cleared .  real or dreams  the people could see trouble when it rolled toward them in a roaring  cursing  red and blue tide .   tiffany ducked out of the queen   s grasp and hurried into the grasses to watch .   big yan ran past  carrying a struggling full sized elf over his head .  then he stopped suddenly and tossed it high over the clearing .      an    away he goes  right on his heid .     he yelled  then turned and ran back into the battle .   the nac mac feegle couldn   t be trodden on or squeezed .  they worked in groups  running up one another   s backs to get high enough to punch an elf or  preferably  bash it with their heads .  and once anyone was down  it was all over bar the kicking .   there was some method in the way the nac mac feegle fought .  for example  they always chose the biggest opponent because  as rob anybody said later     it makes them easier to hit  ye ken .     and they simply didn   t stop .  it was that which wore people down .  it was like being attacked by wasps with fists .   it took them a little while to realize that they   d run out of people to fight .  they went on fighting one another for a bit anyway  since they   d come all this way  and then settled down and began to go through the pockets of the fallen in case there was any loose change .   tiffany stood up .      ach  weel  no    a bad job though i says it mysel        said rob anybody  looking around .     a very neat fight  an    we didna e   en ha    to resort to usin    poetry .         how did you get into the nut .     said tiffany .     i mean  it was   a nut .         only way we could find in     said rob anybody .     it   s got to be a way that fits .     tis difficult work  navigatin    in dreams .         especially when ye   re a wee bittie sloshed     said daft wullie  grinning broadly .      what .  you   ve been   drinking .     said tiffany .     i   ve been facing the queen and you   ve been in a pub .         ach  no .     said rob anybody .     ye ken that dream wi    the big party .  when you had the pretty frock an    a    .  we got stuck in it .         but i killed the drome .      rob looked a little shifty .     weeeel     he said     we didna get oout as easily as you .  it took us a wee while .         until we finished all the drink     said daft wullie helpfully .   rob glared at him .     ye didna ha    to put it like that .     he snapped .      you mean the dream keeps on going .     said tiffany .      if ye   re thirsty enough     said daft wullie .     an    it wasna just the drink   there was can a pays as well .         but i thought if you ate or drank in a dream  you stayed there .     said tiffany .      aye  for most creatures     said rob anybody .     not for us  though .  hooses  banks  dreams     tis a    the same to us .  there   s nothing we canna get in or oot of .         except maybe pubs     said big yan .      oh  aye     said rob anybody cheerfully .     gettin    oot o    pubs sometimes causes us a cerrrtain amount o    difficulty  i   ll grant ye that .         and where did the queen go .     she said .      ach  she did an offski as soon as we arrived     said rob anybody .     an    so should we  kelda  afore the dream changes .     he nodded at wentworth .     is this the wee bairn .  ach  what a noseful o    bogeys .         wanna sweetie .     shouted wentworth  on automatic candy pilot .      weeel  ye canna ha    none .     shouted rob anybody .     an    stop snivelin    and come awa    wi    us and stop bein    a burden to your wee sister .      tiffany opened her mouth to protest   and shut it again when wentworth  after a moment of shock  chuckled .      funny .     he said .     wee man .  weewee man .         oh dear     said tiffany .     you   ve got him started now .      but she was very surprised  nonetheless .  wentworth never showed this much interest in anyone who wasn   t a jelly baby .      rob  we   ve got a real one here     a pictsie called out .  to her horror  tiffany saw that several of the nac mac feegle were holding up roland   s unconscious head .  he was full length on the ground .      ah  that was the laddie who wuz rude to ye     said rob .     an    he tried to hit big yan wi    a hammer  too .  that wasna a clever thing to try .  what shall we do with him .      the grasses trembled .  the light was fading from the sky .  the air was growing colder  too .      we can   t leave him here .     said tiffany .      okay  we   ll drag him along     said rob anybody .     let   s move right noo .         wee wee man .  wee wee man .     shouted wentworth gleefully .      he   ll be like this all day  i   m afraid     said tiffany .     sorry .         run for the door     said rob anybody .     can ye no    see the door .      tiffany looked around desperately .  the wind was bitter now .      see the door .     rob anybody commanded .  she blinked and spun around .      er   er       she said .  the sense of a world beneath that had come to her when she was frightened of the queen did not turn up so easily now .  she tried to concentrate .  the smell of snow     it was ridiculous to talk about the smell of snow .  it was just pure frozen water .  but tiffany always knew  when she woke up  if it had snowed in the night .  snow had a smell like the taste of tin .  tin did have a taste  although admittedly it tasted like the smell of snow .   she thought she heard her brain creak with the effort of thinking .  if she was in a dream  she had to wake up .  but it was no use running .  dreams were full of running .  but there was one direction that looked   thin  and white .   she shut her eyes and thought about snow  crisp and white as fresh bed sheets .  she concentrated on the feel of it under her feet .  all she had to do was wake up    .   she was standing in snow .      right     said rob anybody .      i got out .     said tiffany .      ach  sometimes the door   s in yer ain heid     said rob anybody .     noo let   s move .      tiffany felt herself lifted into the air .  nearby  a snoring roland rose up on dozens of small blue legs as the feegles got underneath him .      nae stoppin    until we get right oout o    here .     said rob anybody .     feegles wha hae .      they skimmed over the snow  with parties of feegles running on ahead .  after a minute or two tiffany looked behind them and saw the blue shadows spreading .  they were getting darker  too .      rob       she said .      aye  i ken     said rob .     run  lads .         they   re moving fast  rob .         i ken that  too .      snow stung tiffany   s face .  trees blurred with the speed .  the forest sped past .  but the shadows were spreading across the path ahead  and every time the party ran through them  they seemed to have a certain solidity  like fog .   now the shadows behind were night black in the middle .   but the pictsies has passed the last tree  and the snowfields stretched ahead .   they stopped  so quickly that tiffany almost toppled into the snow .      what   s happened .         where   s all oour old footprints gone .     said daft wullie .     they wuz there a moment ago .  which way noo .      the trampled track  which had led them on like a line  had vanished .   rob anybody spun around and looked back at the forest .  darkness curled above it like smoke  spreading along the horizon .      she   s sendin    nightmares after us     he growled .     this is gonna be a toughie  lads .      tiffany saw shapes in the spreading night .  she hugged wentworth tightly .      nightmares     repeated rob anybody  turning to her .     ye wouldna want to know about them .  we   ll hold    em off .  ye must mak    a run for it .  get awa    wi    ye  noo .         i   ve got nowhere to run to .     said tiffany .   she heard a high pitched noise  a sort of chittering  insect noise  coming from the forest .  the pictsies had drawn together .  usually they grinned like anything if they thought a fight was coming up  but this time they looked deadly serious .      ach  she   s a bad loser  the quin     said rob .   tiffany turned to look at the horizon behind her .  the boiling blackness was there  too  a ring that was closing in from all sides .   doors everywhere  she thought .  the old kelda said there   s doors everywhere .  i must find a door .  but there   s just snow and a few trees    .   the pictsies drew their swords .      what  er  kind of nightmares are coming .     said tiffany .      ach  long leggity things with muckle legs and huge teeth  and flappy wings and a hundred eyes  that kinda stuff     said daft wullie .      aye  and wuss than that     said rob anybody  staring at the speeding dark .      what   s worse than that .     said tiffany .      normal stuff gone wrong     said rob .   tiffany looked blank for a moment  and then shuddered .  oh yes  she knew about those nightmares .  they didn   t happen often  but they were horrible when they did .  she   d woken up once shaking at the thought of granny aching   s boots  which had been chasing her  and another time it was a box of sugar .  anything could be a nightmare .   she could put up with monsters .  but she didn   t want to face mad boots .      er   i have an idea     she said .      so do i     said rob anybody .     dinna be here   that   s my idea .         there   s a clump of trees over there     said tiffany .      so what .     said rob .  he was staring at the line of nighmares .  things were visible in it now   teeth  claws  eyes  ribs .  from the way he was glaring  it was obvious that whatever happened later  the first few monsters were going to face a serious problem .  if they had faces  anyway .      can you fight nightmares .     said tiffany .  the chittering noise was getting a lot louder .      there   s no    a thing we canna fight     growled big yan .     if it   s got a heid  we can gie it a faceful o    dandruff .  if it disna have a heid  it   s due a good kickin    .      tiffany stared at the onrushing   things .      some of them have got more than one head .     she said .      it   s oour lucky day  then     said daft wullie .   the pictsies shifted their weight  ready to fight .      piper     said rob anybody to william the gonnagle     play us a lament .  we   ll fight to the sound of the mousepipes           no .     said tiffany .     i   m not standing for this .  the way to fight nightmares is to wake up .  i am your kelda .  this is an order .  we   re heading for those trees right now .  do what i say .         weewee man .     yelled wentworth .   the pictsies glanced at the trees and then at tiffany .      do it .     she yelled  so loudly that some of them flinched .     right now .  do what i tell you .  there   s a better way .         ye canna cross a hag  rob     muttered william .      i   m going to get you home .     snapped tiffany .  i hope  she added to herself .  but she   d seen a small  round  pale face staring at them around a tree trunk .  there was a drome in those trees .      ach  aye  but       rob anybody glanced past tiffany and added     aw no  look at that        there was a pale dot in front of the racing line of monstrousness .   sneebs was making a break for it .  his arms pumped like pistons .  his little legs seemed to spin .  his cheeks were like balloons .   the tide of nightmares rolled over him and kept coming .   rob sheathed his sword .     ye heard oour kelda  lads .     he shouted .     grab her .  we   rrre offski .      tiffany was lifted up .  feegles raised the unconscious roland .  and everyone ran for the trees .   tiffany pulled her hand out of her apron pocket and looked at the crumpled wrapper of jolly sailor tobacco .  it was something to focus on  to remind her of a dream     people said you could see the sea from the very top of the downs  but tiffany had stared hard on a fine winter   s day  when the air was clear  and seen nothing but the hazy blue of distance .  but the sea on the jolly sailor packet was deep blue  with white crests on the waves .  it was the sea  for tiffany .   it had looked like a small drome in the trees .  that meant it wasn   t very powerful .  she hoped so .  she had to hope so    .   the trees got closer .  so did the ring of nightmares .  some of the sounds were horrible  of cracking bones and crushing rocks and stinging insects and screaming cats  getting nearer and nearer and nearer .       chapter         jolly sailor      there was sand around her  and white waves crashing  and water draining off the pebble beach and sounding like an old woman sucking a hard mint .      crivens .  where are we noo .     said daft wullie .      aye  and why   re we all lookin    like yellow mushrooms .     rob anybody added .   tiffany looked down and giggled .  every pictsie was wearing a jolly sailor outfit  with an oilskin coat and a huge yellow oilskin rain hat that covered most of his face .  they started to wander about  bumping into one another .   my dream .  tiffany thought .  the drome uses what it can find in your head   but this is my dream .  i can use it .   wentworth had gone quiet .  he was staring at the waves .   there was a boat pulled up on the beach .  as one pictsie  or small yellow mushroom  the nac mac feegle were flocking toward it and clambering up the sides .      what are you doing .     said tiffany .      best if we wuz leavin        said rob anybody .     it   s a good dream ye   ve found us  but we canna stay here .         but we should be safe here .         ach  the quin finds a way in everywhere     said rob  as a hundred pictsies raised an oar .     dinna fash yersel     we know all about boats .  did ye no    see not totally wee georgie pike fishin    wi    wee bobby in the stream the other day .  we is no strangers to the piscatorial an    nautical arts  ye ken .      and they did indeed seem to know about boats .  the oars were heaved into the oarlocks  and a party of feegles pushed the boat down the stones and into the waves .      now you just hand us the wee bairn     shouted rob anybody from the stern .  uncertainly  her feet slipping on the wet stones  tiffany waded through the cold water and handed wentworth over .   he seemed to think it was very funny .      weewee mens .     he yelled as they lowered him into the boat .  it was his only joke  so he wasn   t going to stop .      aye  that   s right     said rob anybody  tucking him under the seat .     noo just you bide there like a good boy and no yellin    for sweeties or uncle rob   ll gie ye a skelpin    across the earhole  okay .      wentworth chuckled .   tiffany ran back up the beach and hauled roland to his feet .  he opened his eyes and looked blearily at her .      wha   s happening .     he said .     i had this strange drea       and then he shut his eyes again and sagged .      get in the boat .     tiffany shouted  dragging him across the shingle .      crivens  are we takin    this wee streak o    uselessness .     said rob  grabbing roland   s trousers and heaving him aboard .      of course .     tiffany hauled herself in afterward and landed in the bottom of the boat as a wave took it .  the oars creaked and splashed  and the boat jerked forward .  it jolted once or twice  as more waves hit it  and then began to plunge across the sea .  the pictsies were strong  after all .  even though each oar was a battleground as pictsies hung from it  or piled up on one another   s shoulders or just heaved anything they could grasp  both oars were almost bending as they were dragged through the water .   tiffany picked herself up and tried to ignore the sudden uncertain feeling in her stomach .      head for the lighthouse .     she said .      aye  i ken that     said rob anybody .     it   s the only place there is .  and the quin disna like light .     he grinned .     it   s a good dream  lady .  have ye no    looked at the sky .         it   s just a blue sky     said tiffany .      it   s no    exactly a sky     said rob anybody .     look behind ye .      tiffany turned .  it was a blue sky .  very blue .  but above the retreating beach  halfway up the sky  was a band of yellow .  it looked a long way away  and hundreds of miles across .  and in the middle of it  looming over the world as big as a galaxy and gray blue with distance  was a life preserver .   on it  in letters larger than the moon  were the words        we are in the label .     said tiffany .      oh  aye     said rob anybody .      but the sea feels   real .  it   s salty and wet and cold .  it   s not like paint .  i didn   t dream it salty or so cold .         nae kiddin    .  then it   s a picture on the outside  and it   s real on the inside .     rob nodded .     ye ken  we   ve been robbin    and running aroound on all kinds o    worlds for a lang time  and i   ll tell ye this  the universe is a lot more comp li cated than it looks from the ooutside .         we are in the label .     said tiffany .      oh  aye     said rob anybody .      but the sea feels   real .  it   s salty and wet and cold .  it   s not like paint .  i didn   t dream it salty or so cold .         nae kiddin    .  then it   s a picture on the outside  and it   s real on the inside .     rob nodded .     ye ken  we   ve been robbin    and running aroound on all kinds o    worlds for a lang time  and i   ll tell ye this  the universe is a lot more comp li cated than it looks from the ooutside .      tiffany took the grubby label out of her pocket and stared at it again .  there was the life preserver  and the lighthouse .  but the jolly sailor himself wasn   t there .  what was there  so tiny as to be little bigger than a dot on the printed sea  was a tiny rowboat .   she looked up .  there were storm clouds in the sky in front of the huge  hazy life preserver .  they were long and ragged  curling as they came .      it didna take her long to find a way in     muttered william .      no     said tiffany     but this is my dream .  i know how it goes .  keep rowing .      tangling and tumbling  some of the clouds passed overhead and then swooped toward the sea .  they vanished beneath the waves like a waterspout in reverse .   it began to rain hard  so hard that a haze of mist rose over the sea .      is that it .     tiffany wondered .     is that all she can do .         i doot it     said rob anybody .     bend them oars  lads .      the boat shot forward  bouncing through the rain from wavetop to wavetop .   but  against all normal rules  it was now trying to go uphill .  the water was mounding up and up  and the boat washed backward in the streaming surf .   something was rising .  something white was pushing the seas aside .  great waterfalls poured off the shining dome that climbed toward the storm sky .   it rose higher  and still there was more .  and eventually there was an eye .  it was tiny compared to the mountainous head above it  and it rolled in its socket and focused on the tiny boat .      now  that   s a heid that   d be a day   s work e   en for big yan     said rob anybody .     i reckon we   d have to come back tomorrow .  row  boys .         it   s a dream of mine     said tiffany  as calmly as she could manage .     it   s the whale fish .      i never dreamed the smell  though  she added to herself .  but here it is  a huge  solid  world filling smell of salt and water and fish and ooze        whut does it eat .     daft wullie asked .      ah  i know that     said tiffany  as the boat rocked on the swell .     whales aren   t dangerous  because they just eat very small things           row like the blazes  lads .     rob anybody yelled .      how d   ye ken it only eats wee stuff .     said daft wullie as the whale fish   s mouth began to open .      i paid a whole cucumber once for a lesson on beasts of the deep     said tiffany as a wave washed over them .     whales don   t even have proper teeth .      there was a creaking sound and a gust of fishy halitosis about the size of a typhoon  and the view was full of enormous  pointy teeth .      aye .     said wullie .     weel  no offense meant  but i dinna think this beastie went to the same school as ye .      the surge of water was pushing them away .  and tiffany could see the whole of the head now  and in a way she couldn   t possibly describe  the whale looked like the queen .  the queen was there  somewhere .   the anger came back .      this is my dream     she shouted at the sky .     i   ve dreamed it dozens of times .  you   re not allowed in here .  and whales don   t eat people .  everyone who isn   t very stupid knows that .      a tail the size of a field rose and slapped down on the sea .  the whale shot forward .   rob anybody threw off his yellow hat and drew his sword .      ach  weel  we tried     he said .     this wee beastie   s gonna get the worst belly ache there ever wuz .         aye  we   ll cut oour way out .     shouted daft wullie .      no  keep rowing .     said tiffany .      it   s ne   er be said that the nac mac feegle turned their back on a foe .     rob yelled .      but you   re rowing facing backward .     tiffany pointed out .   the pictsie looked crestfallen .     oh  aye  i hadna thought o    it like that     he said  sitting down again .      just row .     tiffany insisted .     we   re nearly at the lighthouse .      grumbling  because even if they were facing the right way  they were still going the wrong way  the pictsies hauled on the oars .      that   s a great big heid he   s got there  ye ken     said rob anybody .     how big would you say that heid is  gonnagle .         ach  i   d say it   s verrra big  rob     said william  who was with the team on the other oar .     indeed  i might commit myself to sayin    it   s enorrrrmous .         ye   d go as far as that  would ye .         oh  aye .  enorrrrmous is fully justified .      it   s nearly on us  tiffany thought .   this has got to work .  it   s my dream .  any moment .  any moment now        an    how near us would you say it is  then .     asked rob conversationally  as the boat wallowed and jerked just ahead of the whale .      that   s a verrra good question  rob     said william .     and i   d answer it by sayin    it   s verrra close indeed .      any moment now  thought tiffany .  i know miss tick said you shouldn   t believe in your dreams  but she meant you shouldn   t just hope .   er   any moment now  i   hope .  he   s never missed    .      in fact i   d go so farrr as to say exceedingly close       william began .   tiffany swallowed and hoped that the whale wouldn   t .  there was only about thirty yards of water between the teeth and the boat .   and then it was filled with a wooden wall that blurred as it went past  making a zipzipzip noise .   tiffany looked up  her mouth open .  white sails flashed across the storm clouds  pouring rain like waterfalls .  she looked up at rigging and ropes and sailors lined up on the spars  and cheered .   and then the stern of the jolly sailor   s ship was disappearing into the rain and mist  but not before tiffany saw the big bearded figure at the wheel  dressed in yellow oilskins .  he turned and waved just once  before the ship vanished into the murk .   she managed to stand up again  as the boat rocked in the swell  and yelled at the towering whale     you   ve got to chase him .  that   s how it has to work .  you chase him  he chases you .  granny aching said so .  you can   t not do it and still be the whale fish .  this is my dream .  my rules .  i   ve had more practice at it than you .         big fishy .     yelled wentworth .   that was more surprising than the whale .  tiffany stared at her little brother as the boat rocked again .      big fishy .     said wentworth again .      that   s right .     tiffany said  delighted .     big fishy .  and what makes it particularly interesting is that a whale isn   t a fish .  it is in fact a mammal  just like a cow .      did you just say that .  said her second thoughts  as all the pictsies stared at her and the boat spun in the surf .  the first time he   s ever said anything that wasn   t about sweeties or weewee and you just corrected him .   tiffany looked at the whale .  it was having trouble .  but it was the whale  the whale she   d dreamed about many times after granny aching had told her that story  and not even the queen could control a story like that .   it turned reluctantly in the water and dived in the wake of the jolly sailor   s ship .      big fishy gone .     said wentworth .      no  it   s a mammal       tiffany   s mouth said  before she could stop it .   the pictsies were still staring at her .      it   s just that he ought to get it right     she mumbled  ashamed of herself .     it   s a mistake lots of people make    .      you   re going to turn into somebody like miss tick  said her second thoughts .  do you really want that .      yes     said a voice  and tiffany realized that it was hers again .  the anger rose up  joyfully .     yes .  i   m me .  i am careful and logical and i look up things i don   t understand .  when i hear people use the wrong words  i get edgy .  i am good with cheese .  i read books fast .  i think .  and i always have a piece of string .  that   s the kind of person i am .      she stopped .  even wentworth was staring at her now .  he blinked .      big water cow gone     he suggested meekly .      that   s right .  good boy .     said tiffany .     when we get home  you can have one sweet .      she saw the massed ranks of the nac mac feegle still looking at her with worried expressions .      is it okay wi    you if we get on .     asked rob anybody  holding up a nervous hand .     before yon whale fi   before yon whale cow comes back .      tiffany looked past them .  the lighthouse wasn   t far .  a little jetty stretched out from its tiny island .      yes  please .  er   thank you     she said  calming down a bit .  the ship and the whale had vanished into the rain  and the sea was merely lapping at the shore .   a drome was sitting on the rocks with its pale  fat legs sticking out in front of it .  it was staring out to sea and didn   t appear to notice the approaching boat .  it thinks it   s home  tiffany thought .  i   ve given it a dream it likes .   pictsies poured onto the jetty and tied up the boat .      okay  we   re here     said rob anybody .     we   ll just chop yon creature   s heid off and we   ll be right oout o    here           don   t .     said tiffany .      but it           leave it alone .  just   leave it alone  all right .  it   s not interested .     and it knows about the sea  she added to herself .  it   s probably homesick for the sea .  that   s why it   s such a real dream .  i   d have never have got it right by myself .   a crab crawled out of the surf by the drome   s feet and settled down to dream crab dreams .   it looks as though a drome can get lost in its own dream  she thought .  i wonder if it   ll ever wake up .   she turned to the nac mac feegle .     in my dream i always wake up when i reach the lighthouse     she said .   the pictsies looked up at the red and white tower and  as one feegle  drew their swords .      we dinna trust the quin     said rob .     she   ll let ye think ye   re safe  and just when ye   ve dropped your guard  she   ll leap oout .  she   ll be waitin    behind the door  ye can bet on it .  ye   ll let us go in first .      it was an instruction  not a question .  tiffany nodded and watched the nac mac feegle swarm over the rocks toward the tower .   alone on the jetty  except for wentworth and the unconscious roland  she lifted the toad out of her pocket .  it opened its yellow eyes and stared at the sea .      either i   m dreaming or i   m on a beach     it said .     and toads don   t dream .         in my dream they can     said tiffany .     and this is my dream .         then it is an extremely dangerous one .     said the toad ungratefully .      no  it   s lovely     said tiffany .     it   s wonderful .  look at the way the light dances on the waves .         where are the notices warning people they could drown .     complained the toad .     no life preservers or shark nets .  oh  dear .  do i see a qualified lifeguard .  i think not .  supposing someone was to           it   s a beach     said tiffany .     why are you talking like this .         i   i don   t know     said the toad .     can you put me down  please .  i feel a headache coming on .      tiffany put it down  and it shuffled into some seaweed .  after a while she heard it eating something .   the sea was calm .   it was peaceful .   it was exactly the moment anyone sensible should distrust .   but nothing happened .  it was followed by nothing else happening .  wentworth picked up a pebble from the beach and put it in his mouth  on the basis that anything might be a candy .   then  suddenly  there were noises from the lighthouse .  tiffany heard muffled shouts  and thuds  and once or twice the sound of breaking glass .  at one point there was a noise like something heavy falling down a long spiral staircase and hitting every step on the way .   the door opened .  the nac mac feegle came out .  they looked satisfied .      nae problemo     said rob anybody .     no one there .         but there was a lot of noise .         oh  aye .  we had to make sure     said daft wullie .      weewee men .     shouted wentworth .      i   ll wake up when i go through the door     said tiffany  pulling roland out of the boat .     i always do .  it must work .  this is my dream .     she hauled the boy upright .     can you bring wentworth .         aye .         and you won   t get lost or   or drunk or anything .      rob anybody looked offended .     we ne   er get lost .     he said .     we always ken where we are .  it   s just sometimes mebbe we aren   t sure where everything else is  but it   s no    our fault if everything else gets lost .  the nac mac feegle are never lost .         what about drunk .     said tiffany  dragging roland toward the lighthouse .      we   ve ne   er been lost in oour lives .  is that no    the case  lads .     said rob anybody .  there was a murmur of resentful agreement .     the words lost and nac mac feegle shouldna turn up in the same sentence .         and drunk .     said tiffany again  laying roland down on the beach .      gettin    lost is something that happens to other people .     declared rob anybody .     i want to make that point perfectly clear .         well  at least there shouldn   t have been anything to drink in a lighthouse     said tiffany .  she laughed .     unless you drank the lamp oil  and no one would dare do that .      the pictsies suddenly fell silent .      what would that be  then .     said daft wullie in a slow  careful voice .     would it be the stuff in a kind o    big bottle kind o    thingie .         wi    a wee skull and crossbones on it .     said rob anybody .      yes  probably  and it   s horrible stuff     said tiffany .     it   d make you terribly ill if you drank it .         really .     said rob anybody thoughtfully .     that   s verra   interesting .  what sort o    ill would that be  kind o    thing .         i think you   d probably die     said tiffany .      we   re already dead     said rob anybody .      well  you   d be very  very  sick  then     said tiffany .  she gave him a strong look .     it   s flammable  too .  it   s a good thing you didn   t drink it  isn   t it .      daft wullie belched loudly .  there was a strong smell of kerosene .      aye     he said .   tiffany went and fetched wentworth .  behind her  there was some muffled whispering as the pictsies went into a huddle .      i told yez the wee skull on it meant we shouldna touch it .         big yan said that showed it wuz strong stuff .  an    things ha    come to a pretty pass  ye ken  if people are going to leave stuff like that aroound where innocent people could accidentally smash the door doon and lever the bars aside and take the big chain off    f the cupboard and pick the lock and drink it .         what   s flammable mean .         it means it catches fire .         okay  okay  dinna panic .  no belchin     and none of youse is to tak    a leak anywhere near any naked flames  okay .  and act nat   ral .      tiffany smiled to herself .  pictsies seemed very hard to kill .  perhaps believing you were already dead made you immune .   she turned and looked toward the lighthouse door .  she had never actually seen it opened in her dream .  she   d always thought that the lighthouse was full of light  on the basis that on the farm the cowshed was full of cows and the woodshed was full of wood .      all right  all right     she said  looking down at rob anybody .     i   m going to carry roland  and i want you to bring wentworth .         don   t you want to carry the wee lad .     said rob .      weewee man .     shouted wentworth .      you bring him     said tiffany shortly .  she meant  i   m not sure this is going to work  and he might be safer with you than with me .  i hope i   m going to wake up in my bedroom .  waking up in my bedroom would be nice    .   of course  if everyone else wakes up there  too  there might be some difficult questions asked  but anything   s better than the queen     there was a rushing  rattling noise behind her .  she turned and saw the sea disappearing  very quickly .  it was pulling back down the shore .  as she watched  rocks and clumps of seaweed rose above the surf and then were suddenly high and dry .      ah     she said  after a moment .     it   s all right .  i know what this is .  it   s the tide .  the sea does this .  in goes in and out every day .         aye .     said rob anybody .     amazin    .  it looks like it   s pourin    awa    though a hole    .      about fifty yards away the last rivulets of seawater were disappearing over an edge  and some of the pictsies were already heading toward it .   tiffany suddenly had a moment of something that wasn   t exactly panic .  it was a lot slower and nastier than panic .  it began with just a nagging little doubt that said  isn   t the tide a bit slower .   the teacher  wonders of the nattral wurld  one apple  hadn   t gone into much detail .  but there were fish flapping on the exposed seabed  and surely the fish in the sea didn   t die every day .      er  i think we   d better be careful     she said  trailing after rob anybody .      why .  it   s nae as though the water   s risin        he said .     when does the tide come back .         um  not for hours  i think     said tiffany  feeling the slow  nasty panic getting bigger .     but i   m not sure this           tons o    time  then     said rob anybody .   they   d reached the edge  where the rest of the pictsies were lined up .  a little bit of water still trickled over their feet  pouring down into the gulf beyond .   it was like looking down into a valley .  at the far side  miles and miles away  the retreating sea was just a gleaming line .   below them  though  were the shipwrecks .  there were a lot of them .  galleons and schooners and clippers  masts broken  rigging hanging  hulls breached  lay strewn across the puddles in what had been the bay .   the nac mac feegle  as one pictsie  sighed happily .      sunken treasure .         aye .  gold .         bullion .         jools .         what makes you think they   ve got treasure in them .     said tiffany .   the nac mac feegle looked amazed  as if she   d suggested that rocks could fly .      there   s got to be treasure in    em     said daft wullie .     otherwise what   s the point of lettin       em sink .         that   s right     said rob anybody .     there   s got t   be gold in sunken ships  otherwise it wouldna be worth fighting all them sharkies and octopussies and stuff .  stealin    treasure fra    the ocean   s bed  that   s aboout the biggest  best thievin    ever .      and now what tiffany felt was real  honest panic .      that   s a lighthouse .     she said  pointing .     can you see it .  a lighthouse so ships don   t run into the rocks .  right .  understand .  this is a trap made just for you .  the queen   s still around .         mebbe just can we go down and look inside one wee ship .     said rob anybody wistfully .      no .  because      tiffany looked up  a gleam had caught her eye      because   the sea   is   coming   back       she said .   what looked like a cloud on the horizon was getting bigger  and glittering as it came .  tiffany could already hear the roar .   she ran back up the beach and got her hands under roland   s armpits  so that she could drag him to the lighthouse .  she looked back  and the pictsies were still watching the huge  surging wave .   and there was wentworth  watching the wave happily  and bending down slightly so that  if they stood on tiptoe  he could hold hands with two feegles .   the image branded itself on her eyes .  the little boy  and the pictsies  all with their backs to her  and all staring with interest at the rushing  glittering  sky filling wall of water .      come on .     tiffany yelled .     i was wrong  this isn   t the tide  this is the queen        sunken ships were lifted up and spun around in the hissing mountain of surf .      come on .      tiffany managed to haul roland across her shoulder and  staggering across the rocks  made it to the lighthouse door as the water crashed behind her        for a moment the world was full of white light        and snow squeaked underfoot .   it was the silent  cold land of the queen .  there was no one around and nothing to see except snow and  in the distance  the forest .  black clouds hovered over it .   ahead of her  and only just visible  was a picture in the air .  it showed some turf  and a few stones  lit with moonlight .   it was the other side of the door back home .   she turned around desperately .      please .     she shouted .  it wasn   t a request to anyone special .  she just needed to shout .     rob .  william .  wullie .  wentworth .      away toward the forest there was the barking of the grimhounds .      got to get out     muttered tiffany .     got to get away .      she grabbed roland by the collar and dragged him toward the door .  at least he slid better on snow .   no one and nothing tried to stop her .  the snow spilled a little way through the doorway between the stones and onto the turf  but the air was warm and alive with nighttime insect noises .  under a real moon  under a real sky  she pulled the boy over to a fallen stone and sat him up against it .  she sat down next to him  exhausted to the bone  and tried to get her breath back .   her dress was soaked and smelled of the sea .   she could hear her own thoughts  a long way off   they could still be alive .  it was a dream  after all .  there must be a way back .  all i have to do is find it .  i   ve got to go back in there .   the dogs sounded very loud .   she stood up again  although what she really wanted to do was sleep .   the three stones of the door were a black shape against the stars .   and as she watched  they fell down .  the one on the left slipped over  slowly  and the other two ended up leaning against it .   she ran over and hauled at the tons of stone .  she prodded the air around them in case the doorway was still there .  she squinted madly  trying to see it .   tiffany stood under the stars  alone  and tried not to cry .      what a shame     said the queen .     you   ve let everybody down  haven   t you .          chapter         land under wave      the queen walked over the turf toward tiffany .  where she   d trodden  frost gleamed for a moment .  the little part of tiffany that was still thinking thought  that grass will be dead in the morning .  she   s killing my turf .      the whole of life is but a dream  when you come to think of it     said the queen in the same infuriatingly calm  pleasant voice .  she sat down on the fallen stones .     you humans are such dreamers .  you dream that you   re clever .  you dream that you   re important .  you dream that you   re special .  you know  you   re almost better than dromes .  you   re certainly more imaginative .  i have to thank you .         what for .     said tiffany  looking at her boots .  terror clamped her body in red hot wires .  there wasn   t anywhere to run to .      i never realized how wonderful your world is     said the queen .     i mean  the dromes   well  they   re not much more than a kind of walking sponge  really .  their world is ancient .  it   s nearly dead .  they   re not really creative anymore .  with a little help from me  your people could be a lot better .  because  you see  you dream all the time .  you  especially  dream all the time .  your picture of the world is a landscape with you in the middle of it  isn   t it .  wonderful .  look at you  in that rather horrible dress and those clumpy boots .  you dreamed you could invade my world with a frying pan .  you had this dream about brave girl rescuing little brother .  you thought you were the heroine of a story .  and then you left him behind .  you know  i think being hit by a billion tons of seawater must be like having a mountain of iron drop on your head  don   t you .      tiffany couldn   t think .  her head was full of hot  pink fog .  it hadn   t worked .   her third thoughts were somewhere in the fog  trying to make themselves heard .      got roland out     she muttered  still staring at her boots .      but he   s not yours     said the queen .     he is  let us face it  a rather stupid boy with a big red face and brains made of pork  just like his father .  you left your little brother behind with a bunch of little thieves and you rescued a spoiled little fool .      there was no time .  shrieked tiffany   s third thoughts .  you wouldn   t have got to him and got back to the lighthouse .  you nearly didn   t get away as it was .  you got roland out .  it was the logical thing to do .  you don   t have to be guilty about it .  what   s better  to try to save your brother and be brave  courageous  stupid  and dead  or save the boy and be brave  courageous  sensible  and alive .   but something kept saying that stupid and dead would have been more   right .   something kept saying  would you say to mum that you could see there wasn   t time to rescue your brother so you rescued someone else instead .  would she be pleased that you   d worked that out .  being right doesn   t always work .   it   s the queen .  yelled her third thoughts .  it   s her voice .  it   s like hypnotism .  you   ve got to stop listening .      i expect it   s not your fault you   re so cold and heartless     said the queen .     it   s probably all to do with your parents .  they probably never gave you enough time .  and having wentworth was a very cruel thing to do   they really should have been more careful .  and they let you read too many books .  it can   t be good for a young brain  knowing words like paradigm and eschatological .  it leads to behavior such as using your own brother as monster bait .     the queen sighed .     sadly  that kind of thing happens all the time .  i think you should be proud of not being worse than just deeply introverted and socially maladjusted .      she walked around tiffany .      it   s so sad     she continued .     you dream that you are strong  sensible  logical   the kind of person who always has a bit of string .  but that   s just your excuse for not being really  properly human .  you   re just a brain  no heart at all .  you didn   t even cry when granny aching died .  you think too much  and now your precious thinking has let you down .  well  i think it   s best if i just kill you  don   t you .      find a stone .  her third thoughts screamed .  hit her .   tiffany was aware of other figures in the gloom .  there were some of the people from the summer pictures  but there were also dromes and the headless horseman and the bumblebee women .   around her  frost crept over the ground .      i think we   ll like it here     said the queen .   tiffany felt the cold creeping up her legs .  her third thoughts  hoarse with effort  shouted  do something .   she should have been better organized  she thought dully .  she shouldn   t have relied on dreams .  or   perhaps i should have been a real human being .  more   feeling .  but i couldn   t help not crying .  it just wouldn   t come .  and how can i stop thinking .  and thinking about thinking .  and even thinking about thinking about thinking .   she saw the smile in the queen   s eyes  and thought  which one of all those people doing all that thinking is me .   is there really any me at all .   clouds poured across the sky like a stain .  they covered the stars .  they were the inky clouds from the frozen world  the clouds of nightmare .  it began to rain  rain with ice in it .  it hit the turf like bullets  turning it into chalky mud .  the wind howled like a pack of grimhounds .   tiffany managed to take a step forward .  the mud sucked at her boots .      a bit of spirit at last .     said the queen  stepping back .   tiffany tried another step  but things were not working anymore .  she was too cold and too tired .  she could feel her self disappearing  getting lost .      so sad  to end like this     said the queen .   tiffany fell forward  into the freezing mud .   the rain grew harder  stinging like needles  hammering on her head and running like icy tears down her cheeks .  it struck so hard  it left her breathless .   she felt the cold drawing all the heat out of her .  and that was the only sensation left  apart from a musical note .   it sounded like the smell of snow  or the sparkle of frost .  it was high and thin and drawn out .   she couldn   t feel the ground under her and there was nothing to see  not even the stars .  the clouds had covered everything .   she was so cold  she couldn   t feel the cold anymore  or her fingers .  a thought managed to trickle through her freezing mind .  is there any me at all .  or do my thoughts just dream of me .   the blackness grew deeper .  night was never as black as this  and winter never as cold .  it was colder than the deep winters when the snow came down and granny aching would plod from snowdrift to snowdrift  looking for warm bodies .  the sheep could survive the snow if the shepherd had some wits  granny used to say .  the snow kept the cold away  the sheep surviving in warm hollows under roofs of snow while bitter wind blew harmlessly over them .   but this was as cold as those days when even the snow couldn   t fall  and the wind was pure cold itself  blowing ice crystals across the turf .  those were the killer days in early spring  when the lambing had begun and winter came howling down one more time .   there was darkness everywhere  bitter and starless .   there was a speck of light  a long way off .   one star .  low down .  moving     it got bigger in the stormy night .   it zigzagged as it came .   silence covered tiffany and drew her into itself .   the silence smelled of sheep  and turpentine  and tobacco .   and then came movement  as if she was falling through the ground  very fast .   and gentle warmth and  just for a moment  the sound of waves .   and her own voice  inside her head .   this land is in my bones .   land under wave .   whiteness .   it tumbled through the warm  heavy darkness around her  something like snow but as fine as dust .  it piled up somewhere below her  because she could see a faint whiteness .   a creature like an ice cream cone with lots of tentacles shot past her and jetted away .   i   m underwater  thought tiffany .   i remember     this is the million year rain under the sea  this is the new land being born underneath an ocean .  it   s not a dream .  it   s   a memory .  the land under wave .  millions and millions of tiny shells     this land was alive .   all the time there was the warm  comforting smell of the shepherding hut  and the feeling of being held in invisible hands .   the whiteness below her rose up and over her head  but it didn   t seem uncomfortable .  it was like being in a mist .   now i   m inside the chalk  like a flint  like a calkin     she wasn   t sure how long she spent in the warm deep water  or if indeed any time really had passed  or if the millions of years went past in a second  but she felt movement again  and a sense of rising .   more memories poured into her mind .   there   s always been someone watching the borders .  they didn   t decide to .  it was decided for them .  someone has to care .  sometimes they have to fight .  someone has to speak for that which has no voice    .   she opened her eyes .  she was still lying in the mud  and the queen was laughing at her  and overhead the storm still raged .   but she felt warm .  in fact  she felt hot  red hot with anger   anger at the bruised turf  anger at her own stupidity  anger at this beautiful creature whose only talent was control .   this   creature was trying to take her world .   all witches are selfish  the queen had said .  but tiffany   s third thoughts said  then turn selfishness into a weapon .  make all things yours .  make other lives and dreams and hopes yours .  protect them .  save them .  bring them into the sheepfold .  walk the gale for them .  keep away the wolf .  my dreams .  my brother .  my family .  my land .  my world .  how dare you try to take these things  because they are mine .   i have a duty .   the anger overflowed .  she stood up  clenched her fists  and screamed at the storm  putting into the scream all the rage that was inside her .   lightning struck the ground on either side of her .  it did so twice .   and it stayed there  crackling  and two dogs formed .   steam rose from their coats  and blue light sparked from their ears as they shook themselves .  they looked attentively at tiffany .   the queen gasped and vanished .      come by  lightning .     shouted tiffany .     away to me  thunder .     and she remembered the time when she   d run across the downs  falling over  shouting all the wrong things  while the two dogs had done exactly what needed to be done .   two streaks of black and white sped away across the turf and up toward the clouds .   they herded the storm .   clouds panicked and scattered  but always there was a comet streaking across the sky and they were turned .  monstrous shapes writhed and screamed in the boiling sky  but thunder and lightning had worked many flocks  there was an occasional snap of lightning sparked teeth  and a wail .  tiffany stared upward  rain pouring off her face  and shouted commands that no dog could possibly have heard .   jostling and rumbling and screaming  the storm rolled off the hills and away toward the mountains  where there were deep canyons that could pen it .   out of breath  glowing with triumph  tiffany watched until the dogs came back and settled  once again  on the turf .  and then she remembered something else  it didn   t matter what orders she gave those dogs .  they were not her dogs .  they were working dogs .   thunder and lightning didn   t take orders from a little girl .   and the dogs weren   t looking at her .   they were looking just behind her .   she   d have turned if someone had told her a horrible monster was behind her .  she   d have turned if they   d said it had a thousand teeth .  she didn   t want to turn around now .  forcing herself was the hardest thing she   d ever done .   she was not afraid of what she might see .  she was terribly  mortally frightened  afraid to the center of her bones of what she might not see .  she shut her eyes while her cowardly boots shuffled her around and then  after a deep breath  she opened them again .   there was a gust of jolly sailor tobacco  and sheep  and turpentine .   sparkling in the dark  light glittering off the white shepherdess dress and every blue ribbon and silver buckle of it  was granny aching  smiling hugely  radiant with pride .  in one hand she held the huge ornamental crook  hung with blue bows .   she pirouetted slowly  and tiffany saw that while she was a brilliant  sparkling shepherdess from hat to hem  she still had her huge old boots on .   granny aching took her pipe out of her mouth and gave tiffany the little nod that was  from her  a round of applause .  and then   she wasn   t .   real starlit darkness covered the turf  and the nighttime sounds filled the air .  tiffany didn   t know if what had just happened was a dream or had happened somewhere that wasn   t quite here or had happened only in her head .  it didn   t matter .  it had happened .  and now        but i   m still here     said the queen  stepping in front of her .     perhaps it was all a dream .  perhaps you have gone a little mad  because you are after all a very strange child .  perhaps you had help .  how good are you .  do you really think that you can face me alone .  i can make you think whatever i please           crivens .         oh no  not them     said the queen  throwing up her hands .   it wasn   t just the nac mac feegle but also wentworth  a strong smell of seaweed  a lot of water  and a dead shark .  they appeared in midair and landed in a heap between tiffany and the queen .  but a pictsie was always ready for a fight  and they bounced  rolled  and came up drawing their swords and shaking seawater out of their hair .      oh     tis you  izzut .     said rob anybody  glaring up at the queen .     face to face wi    ye at last  ye bloustie ol    callyack that ye are .  ye canna    come here  unnerstan    .  be off wi    ye .  are ye goin    to go quietly .      the queen stamped heavily on him .  when she took her foot away  only the top of his head was visible above the turf .      well  are ye .     he said  pulling himself out as if nothing had happened .     i don   t want tae have tae lose my temper wi    ye .  an    it   s no good sendin    your pets against us     cause you ken we can take    em tae the cleaners .     he turned to tiffany  who hadn   t moved .     you just leave this tae us  kelda .  us an    the quin  we go way back .      the queen snapped her fingers .     always leaping into things you don   t understand     she hissed .     well  can you face these .      every nac mac feegle sword suddenly glowed blue .   back in the crowd of eerily lit pictsies  a voice that sounded very much like that of daft wullie said      ach  we   re in real trouble noo        three figures had appeared in the air  a little way away .  the middle one  tiffany saw  had a long red gown  a strange long wig  and black tights with buckles on his shoes .  the others were just ordinary men  it seemed  in ordinary gray suits .      oh  ye are a harrrrrd wumman  quin     said william the gonnagle     to set the lawyers ontae us .         see the one on the left there     whimpered a pictsie .     see  he   s got a briefcase .  it   s a briefcase .  oh  waily  waily  a briefcase  waily        reluctantly  a step at a time  pressing together in terror  the nac mac feegle began to back away .      oh  waily waily  he   s snappin    the clasps     groaned daft wullie .     oh  waily waily waily     tis the sound o    doom when a lawyer does that .         mister rob anybody feegle and sundry others .     said one of the figures in a dreadful voice .      there   s naebody here o    that name .     shouted rob anybody .     we dinna know anythin    .         we have here a list of criminal and civil charges totaling nineteen thousand  seven hundred and sixty three separate offenses           we wasna there .     yelled rob anybody desperately .     isn   t that right  lads .            including more than two thousand cases of making an affray  causing a public nuisance  being found drunk  being found very drunk  using offensive language  taking into account ninety seven counts of using language that was probably offensive if anyone else could understand it   committing a breach of the peace  malicious lingering           it   s mistaken identity .     shouted rob anybody .     it   s no    oour fault .  we wuz only standing there an    someone else did it and ran awa    .            grand theft  petty theft  burglary  housebreaking  loitering with intent to commit a felony           we wuz misunderstood when we was wee bairns .     yelled rob anybody .     ye   re only pickin    on us    cause we   re blue .  we always get blamed for everythin    .  the polis hate us .  we wasna even in the country .      but  to groans from the cowering pictsies  one of the lawyers produced a big roll of paper from his briefcase .  he cleared his throat and read out     angus  big  angus  not as big as big angus  angus  wee  archie  big  archie  one eyed  archie  wee mad           they   ve got oour names .     sobbed daft wullie .     they   ve got oour names .  it   s the pris   n hoose for us .         objection .  i move for a writ of habeas corpus     said a small voice .     and enter a plea of vis ne faciem capite repletam  without prejudice .      there was absolute silence for a moment .  rob anybody turned to look at the frightened nac mac feegle and said     okay  okay  which of youse said that .      the toad crawled out of the crowd and sighed .     it suddenly all came back to me     he said .     i remember what i was now .  the legal language brought it all back .  i   m a toad now  but      he swallowed      once i was a lawyer .  and this  people  is illegal .  these charges are a complete tissue of lies based on hearsay evidence .      he raised yellow eyes toward the queen   s lawyers .     i further move that the case be adjourned sine die on the basis of potest ne mater tua suere  amice .      the lawyers had pulled large books out of nowhere and were thumbing through them hastily .      we   re not familiar with counsel   s terminology     said one of them .      hey  they   re sweatin        said rob anybody .     you mean we can have lawyers on oour side as well .         yes  of course     said the toad .     you can have defense lawyers .         defense .     said rob anybody .     are you tellin    me we could get awa    wi    it    cause of a tishoo o    lies .         certainly     said the toad .     and with all the treasure you   ve stolen  you can pay enough to be very innocent indeed .  my fee will be        he gulped as a dozen glowing swords were swung toward him .      i   ve just remembered why that fairy godmother turned me into a toad     he said .     so  in the circumstances  i   ll take this case pro bono publico .      the swords didn   t move .      that means for free     he added .      oh  right  we like the sound o    that     said rob anybody  to the sound of swords being sheathed .     how come ye   re a lawyer an    a toad .         oh  well  it was just bit of an argument     said the toad .     a fairy godmother gave my client three wishes   the usual health  wealth  and happiness package   and when my client woke up one wet morning and didn   t feel particularly happy  she got me to bring an action for breach of contract .  it was a definite first in the history of fairy godmothering .  unfortunately  as it turned out  so was turning the client into a small hand mirror and her lawyer  as you see before you  into a toad .  i think the worst part was when the judge applauded .  that was hurtful  in my opinion .         but ye can still remember all that legal stuff .  guid     said rob anybody .  he glared at the other lawyers .     hey  youse scunners  we got a cheap lawyer and we   re no    afraid tae use him .      the other lawyers were pulling more and more paperwork out of the air now .  they looked worried  and a little frightened .  rob anybody   s eyes gleamed as he watched them .      what does all that viznee facey em stuff mean  my learned friend .     he said .      vis ne faciem capite repletam     said the toad .     it was the best i could do in a hurry  but it means  approximately      he gave a little cough         would you like a face which is full of head .            and tae think we didna know legal talkin    was that simple     said rob anybody .     we could all be lawyers  lads  if we knew the fancy words .  let   s get them .      the nac mac feegle could change mood in a moment  especially at the sound of a battle cry .  they raised their swords in the air .      twelve hundred angry men .     they shouted .      nae more courtroom drama .         we ha    the law on oour side .         the law   s made to tak    care o    raskills .         no     said the queen  and waved her hand .   lawyers and pictsies faded away .  there was just her and tiffany  facing one another on the turf at dawn  the wind hissing around the stones .      what have you done with them .     tiffany shouted .      oh  they   re around   somewhere     said the queen airily .     it   s all dreams  anyway .  and dreams within dreams .  you can   t rely on anything  little girl .  nothing is real .  nothing lasts .  everything goes .  all you can do is learn to dream .  and it   s too late for that .  and i   i have had longer to learn .      tiffany wasn   t sure which of her thoughts was operating now .  she was tired .  she felt as though she was watching herself from above and a little behind .  she saw herself set her boots firmly on the turf  and then        and then        and then  like someone rising from the clouds of a sleep  she felt the deep  deep time below her .  she sensed the breath of the downs and the distant roar of ancient  ancient seas trapped in millions of tiny shells .  she thought of granny aching  under the turf  becoming part of the chalk again  part of the land under wave .  she felt as if huge wheels  of time and stars  were turning slowly around her .   she opened her eyes and then  somewhere inside  opened her eyes again .   she heard the grass growing  and the sound of worms below the turf .  she could feel the thousands of little lives around her  smell all the scents on the breeze  and see all the shades of the night .   the wheels of stars and years  of space and time  locked into place .  she knew exactly where she was  and who she was  and what she was .   she swung a hand .  the queen tried to stop her  but she might as well have tried to stop a wheel of years .  tiffany   s hand caught her face and knocked her off her feet .      now i know why i never cried for granny     she said .     she has never left me .      she leaned down  and centuries bent with her .      the secret is not to dream     she whispered .     the secret is to wake up .  waking up is harder .  i have woken up and i am real .  i know where i come from and i know where i   m going .  you cannot fool me anymore .  or touch me .  or anything that is mine .      i   ll never be like this again  she thought  as she saw the terror in the queen   s face .  i   ll never again feel as tall as the sky and as old as the hills and as strong as the sea .  i   ve been given something for a while  and the price of it is that i have to give it back .   and the reward is giving it back  too .  no human could live like this .  you could spend a day looking at a flower to see how wonderful it is  and that wouldn   t get the milking done .  no wonder we dream our way through our lives .  to be awake  and see it all as it really is   no one could stand that for long .   she took a deep breath and picked the queen up .  she was aware of things happening  of dreams roaring around her  but they didn   t affect her .  she was real and she was awake  more aware than she   d ever been .  she had to concentrate even to think against the storm of sensations pouring into her mind .   the queen was as light as a baby and changed shape madly in tiffany   s arms   into monsters and mixed up beasts  things with claws and tentacles .  but at last she was small and gray  like a monkey  with a large head and big eyes and a little downy chest that went up and down as she panted .   she reached the stones .  the arch still stood .  it was never down  tiffany thought .  the queen had no strength  no magic  just one trick .  the worst one .      stay away from here     said tiffany .     never come back .  never touch what is mine .     and then  because the thing was so weak and babylike  she added     but i hope there   s someone who   ll cry for you .  i hope the king comes back .         you pity me .     growled the thing that had been the queen .      yes .  a bit     said tiffany .     but don   t count on it .      she put the creature down .  it scampered across the snow of fairyland  turned  and became the beautiful queen again .      you won   t win     the queen said .     there   s always a way in .  people dream .         sometimes we waken     said tiffany .     don   t come back   or there will be a reckoning    .      she concentrated  and now the stones framed nothing more   or less   than the country beyond .   i shall have to find a way of sealing that  said her third thoughts .  or her twentieth thoughts  perhaps .  her head was full of thoughts .   she managed to walk a little way and then sat down  hugging her knees .  imagine getting stuck like this  she thought .  you   d have to wear earplugs and noseplugs and a big black hood over your head  and still you   d see and hear too much     she closed her eyes  and closed her eyes again .   she felt it all draining away .  it was like falling asleep  sliding from that strange wide awakeness into just normal  everyday   well  being awake .  it felt as if everything was blurred and muffled .   this is how we always feel  she thought .  we sleepwalk through our lives  because how could we live if we were always this awake .   someone tapped her on the boot .       chapter         small  like oak trees         hey  where did you get to .     shouted rob anybody  glaring up at her .     one minute we was just aboout to give them lawyers a good legal seein    to  next minute you and the quin wuz gone .      dreams within dreams  tiffany thought  holding her head .  but they were over  and you couldn   t look at the nac mac feegle and not know what was real .      it   s over     she said .      didja kill her .         no .         she   ll be back then     said rob anybody .     she   s awfu    stupid  that one .  clever with the dreaming  i   ll grant ye  but not a brain in her heid .      tiffany nodded .  the blurred feeling was going .  the moment of wide awakeness was fading like a dream .  but i must remember that it wasn   t a dream .      how did you get away from the huge wave .     she asked .      ach  we   re fast movers     said rob anybody .     an    it was a strong lighthoose .  o    course  the water came up pretty high .         a few sharks were involved  that kind of thing     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .      oh  aye  a few sharkies     said rob anybody  shrugging .     and one o    them octopussies           it was a giant squid     said william the gonnagle .      aye  well  it was a kebab pretty quickly     said daft wullie .      ha    a heidful o    heid  you wee weewee .     shouted wentworth  overcome with wit .   william coughed politely .     and the big wave threw up a lot of sunken vessels full o    trrrreasure     he said .     we stopped off for a wee pillage .      the nac mac feegle held up wonderful jewels and big gold coins .      but that   s just dream treasure  surely .     said tiffany .     fairy gold .  it   ll turn into rubbish in the morning .         aye .     said rob anybody .  he glanced at the horizon .     okay  ye heard the kelda  lads .  we got mebbe half an hour to sell it to someone .  permission to go offski .     he added to tiffany .      er   oh  yes .  fine .  thank you        they were gone  in a split second blur of blue and red .   but william the gonnagle remained for a moment .  he bowed to tiffany .      ye didna do at all badly     he said .     we   re proud o    ye .  so would yer grrranny be .  remember that .  ye are not unloved .      then he vanished too .   there was a groan from roland  lying on the turf .  he began to move .      weewee men all gone     said wentworth sadly in the silence that followed .     crivens all gone .         what were they .     muttered roland  sitting up and holding his head .      it   s all a bit complicated     said tiffany .     er   do you remember much .         it all seems like   a dream       said roland .     i remember   the sea  and we were running  and i cracked a nut which was full of those little men  and i was hunting in this huge forest with shadows           dreams can be very funny things     said tiffany carefully .  she went to stand up and thought  i must wait here awhile .  i don   t know why i know  i just know .  perhaps i knew and have forgotten .  but i must wait for something .      can you walk down to the village .     she said .      oh  yes .  i think so .  but what did    .         then will you take wentworth with you  please .  i   d like to   rest for a while .         are you sure .     said roland  looking concerned .      yes .  i won   t be long .  please .  you can drop him off at the farm .  tell my parents i   ll be down soon .  tell them i   m fine .         weewee men     said wentworth .     crivens .  want bed .      roland was still looking uncertain .      off you go .     tiffany commanded  and waved him away .   when the two of the them had disappeared below the brow of the hill  with several backward glances  she sat between the four iron wheels and hugged her knees .   she could see  far off  the mound of the nac mac feegle .  already they were a slightly puzzling memory  and she   d seen them only a few minutes ago .  but when they   d gone  they   d left the impression of never having been there .   she could go to the mound and see if she could find the big hole .  but supposing it wasn   t there .  or supposing it was  but all there was down there was rabbits .   no  it   s all true  she said to herself .  i must remember that  too .   a buzzard screamed in the dawn grayness .  she looked up as it circled into sunlight  and a tiny dot detached itself from the bird .   that was far too high up even for a pictsie to stand the fall .   tiffany scrambled to her feet as hamish tumbled through the sky .  and then   something ballooned above him  and the fall became just a gentle floating  like thistledown .   the bulging shape above hamish was y shaped .  as it got bigger  the shape become more precise  more   familiar .   he landed  and a pair of tiffany   s pants  the long legged ones with the rosebud pattern  settled down on top of him .      that was great .     he said  pushing his way through the folds of fabric .     nae more landin    on my heid for me .         they   re my best pants     said tiffany wearily .     you stole them off our clothesline  didn   t you .         oh aye .  nice and clean     said hamish .     i had to cut the lace off    cause it got in the way  but i put it aside and ye could easily sew it on again .     he gave tiffany the big grin of someone who  for once  has not dived heavily into the ground .   she sighed .  she   d liked the lace .  she didn   t have many things that weren   t necessary .     i think you   d better keep them     she said .      aye  i will  then     said hamish .     noo  what wuz it .  oh  yes .  ye have visitors comin    .  i spotted them out over the valley .  look up there .      there were two other things up there  bigger than a buzzard  so high that they were already in full sunlight .  tiffany watched as they circled lower .   they were broomsticks .   i knew i had to wait .  tiffany thought .   her ears bubbled .  she turned and saw hamish running across the grass .  as she looked  the buzzard picked him up and sped onward .  she wondered if he was frightened or  at least  didn   t want to meet whoever was coming  the broomsticks descended .   the lowest one had two figures on it .  as it landed  tiffany saw that one of them was miss tick  clinging anxiously to a smaller figure who   d been doing the steering .  she half climbed off  half fell off  and tottered over to tiffany .      you wouldn   t believe the time i   ve had     she said .     it was just a nightmare .  we flew through the storm .  are you all right .         er   yes           what happened .      tiffany looked at her .  how did you begin to answer something like that .      the queen   s gone     she said .  that seemed to cover it .      what .  the queen has gone .  oh   er   these ladies are mrs .  ogg           mornin        said the broomstick   s other occupant  who was pulling at her long black dress  from under the folds of which came the sounds of twanging elastic .     the wind up there blows where it likes  i don   t mind telling you .     she was a short fat lady with a cheerful face like an apple that had been stored too long  all the wrinkles moved into different positions when she smiled .      and this     said miss tick     is miss           mistress     snapped the other witch .      i   m so sorry  mistress weatherwax     said miss tick .     very  very good witches     she whispered to tiffany .     i was very lucky to find them .  they respect witches up in the mountains .      tiffany was impressed that anyone could make miss tick flustered  but the other witch seemed to do it just by standing there .  she was tall   except  tiffany realized  she wasn   t that tall  but she stood tall  which could easily fool you if you weren   t paying attention   and like the other witch wore a rather shabby black dress .  she had an elderly  thin face that gave nothing away .  piercing blue eyes looked tiffany up and down  from head to toe .      you   ve got good boots     said the witch .      tell mistress weatherwax what happened     miss tick began .  but the witch held up a hand  and miss tick stopped talking immediately .  tiffany was even more impressed now .   mistress weatherwax gave tiffany a look that went right through her head and about five miles out the other side .  then she walked over to the stones and waved one hand .  it was an odd movement  a kind of wriggle in the air  but for a moment it left a glowing line .  there was a noise  a chord  as though all sorts of sounds were happening at the same time .  it snapped into silence .      jolly sailor tobacco .     said the witch .      yes     said tiffany .   the witch waved a hand again .  there was another sharp  complicated noise .  mistress weatherwax turned suddenly and stared at the distant pimple that was the pictsie mound .      nac mac feegle .  kelda .     she demanded .      er  yes .  only temporary     said tiffany .      hmmph     said mistress weatherwax .   wave .  sound .      frying pan .         yes .  it got lost  though .         hmm .      wave .  sound .  it was as if the woman was extracting her history from the air .      filled buckets .         and they filled up the log box  too     said tiffany .   wave .  sound .      i see .  special sheep liniment .         yes  my father says it puts        wave .  sound .      ah .  land of snow .     wave .  sound .     a queen .     wave .  sound .     fighting .     wave  sound .     on the sea .     wave  sound  wave  sound     mistress weatherwax stared at the flashing air  looking at pictures only she could see .  mrs .  ogg sat down beside tiffany  her little legs going up in the air as she made herself comfortable .      i   ve tried jolly sailor     she said .     smells like toenails  don   t it .         yes  it does .     said tiffany  gratefully .      to be a kelda of the nac mac feegle  you have to marry one of    em  don   t you .     said mrs .  ogg innocently .      ah  yes  but i found a way around that     said tiffany .  she told her .  mrs .  ogg laughed .  it was a sociable kind of laugh  the sort of laugh that makes you comfortable .   the noise and flashing stopped .  mistress weatherwax stood staring at nothing for a moment and then said     you beat the queen  at the end .  but you had help  i think .         yes  i did     said tiffany .      and that was    .         i don   t ask you your business     said tiffany  before she even realized she was going to say it .  miss tick gasped .  mrs .  ogg   s eyes twinkled  and she looked from tiffany to mistress weatherwax like someone watching a tennis match .      tiffany  mistress weatherwax is the most famous witch in all       miss tick began severely  but the witch waved a hand at her again .  i really must learn how to do that  tiffany thought .   then mistress weatherwax took off her pointed hat and bowed to tiffany .      well said     she said  straightening up and staring directly at tiffany .     i didn   t have no right to ask you .  this is your country   we   re here by your leave .  i show you respect as you in turn will respect me .     the air seemed to freeze for a moment and the skies to darken .  then mistress weatherwax went on  as if the moment of thunder hadn   t happened     but if one day you care to tell me more  i should be grateful to hear about it     she said  in a conversational voice .     and them creatures that look like they   re made of dough  i should like to know more about them  too .  never run across them before .  and your grandmother sounds the kind of person i would have liked to meet .     she straightened up .     in the meantime  we   d better see if there   s anything left you can still be taught .         is this where i learn about the witches    school .     said tiffany .   there was a moment of silence .      witches    school .     said mistress weatherwax .      um     said miss tick .      you were being metapahorrical  weren   t you .     said tiffany .      metapahorrical .     said mrs .  ogg  wrinkling her forehead .      she means metaphorical     mumbled miss tick .      it   s like stories     said tiffany .     it   s all right .  i worked it out .  this is the school  isn   t it .  the magic place .  the world .  here .  and you don   t realize it until you look .  do you know the pictsies think this world is heaven .  we just don   t look .  you can   t give lessons on witchcraft .  not properly .  it   s all about how you are   you  i suppose .         nicely said     said mistress weatherwax .     you   re sharp .  but there   s magic  too .  you   ll pick that up .  it don   t take much intelligence  otherwise wizards wouldn   t be able to do it .         you   ll need a job  too     said mrs .  ogg .     there   s no money in witchcraft .  can   t do magic for yourself  see .  cast iron rule .         i make good cheese     said tiffany .      cheese  eh .     said mistress weatherwax .     hmm .  yes .  cheese is good .  but do you know anything about medicines .  midwifery .  that   s a good portable skill .         well  i   ve helped deliver difficult lambs     said tiffany .     and i saw my brother being born .  they didn   t bother to turn me out .  it didn   t look too difficult .  but i think cheese is probably easier  and less noisy .         cheese is good     mistress weatherwax repeated  nodding .     cheese is alive .         and what do you really do .     said tiffany .   the thin witch hesitated for a moment  and then      we look to   the edges     said mistress weatherwax .     there   s a lot of edges  more than people know .  between life and death  this world and the next  night and day  right and wrong   an    they need watchin    .  we watch    em  we guard the sum of things .  and we never ask for any reward .  that   s important .         people give us stuff  mind you .  people can be very gen   rous to witches     said mrs .  ogg happily .     on bakin    days in our village  sometimes i can   t move for cake .  there   s ways and ways of not askin     if you get my meaning .  people like to see a happy witch .         but down here people think witches are bad .     said tiffany  but her second thoughs added  remember how rarely granny aching ever had to buy her own tobacco .      it   s amazin    what people can get used to     said mrs .  ogg .     you just have to start slow .         and we have to hurry     said mistress weatherwax .     there   s a man riding up here on a farm horse .  fair hair  red face           it sounds like my father .         well  he   s making the poor thing gallop     said mistress weatherwax .     quick  now .  you want to learn the skills .  when can you leave home .         pardon .     said tiffany .      don   t the girls here go off to work as maids and things .     said mrs .  ogg .      oh  yes .  when they   re a bit older than me .         well  when you   re a bit older than you  miss tick here will come and find you     said mistress weatherwax .  miss tick nodded .     there   re elderly witches up in the mountains who   ll pass on what they know in exchange for a bit of help around the cottage .  this place will be watched over while you   re gone  you may depend on it .  in the meantime you   ll get three meals a day  your own bed  use of broomstick   that   s the way we do it .  all right .         yes     said tiffany  grinning happily .  the wonderful moment was passing too quickly for all the questions she wanted to ask .     yes .  but  er           yes .     said mrs .  ogg .      i don   t have to dance around with no clothes on or anything like that  do i .  only i heard rumors        mistress weatherwax rolled her eyes .   mrs .  ogg grinned cheerfully .     well  that procedure does have something to recommend it       she began .      no  you don   t have to .     snapped mistress weatherwax .     no cottage made of sweets  no cackling  and no dancing .         unless you want to     said mrs .  ogg  standing up .     there   s no harm in an occasional cackle  if the mood takes you that way .  i   d teach you a good one right now  but we really ought to be going .         but   but how did you manage it .     said miss tick to tiffany .     this is all chalk .  you   ve become a witch on chalk .  how .         that   s all you know  perspicacia tick     said mistress weatherwax .     the bones of the hills is flint .  it   s hard and sharp and useful .  king of stones .     she picked up her broomstick and turned back to tiffany .     will you get into trouble  do you think .     she said .      i might     said tiffany .      do you want any help .         if it   s my trouble  i   ll get out of it     said tiffany .  she wanted to say  yes  yes .  i   m going to need help .  i don   t know what   s going to happen when my father gets here .  the baron   s probably gotten really angry .  but i don   t want them to think i can   t deal with my own problems .  i ought to be able to cope .      that   s right     said mistress weatherwax .   tiffany wondered if the witch could read minds .      minds .  no     said mistress weatherwax  climbing onto her broomstick .     faces  yes .  come here  young lady .      tiffany obeyed .      the thing about witchcraft     said mistress weatherwax     is that it   s not like school at all .  first you get the test  and then afterward you spend years findin    out how you passed it .  it   s a bit like life in that respect .     she reached out and gently raised tiffany   s chin so that she could look into her face .      i see you opened your eyes     she said .      yes .         good .  many people never do .  times ahead might be a little tricky  even so .  you   ll need this .      she stretched out a hand and made a circle in the air around tiffany   s head  then brought her hand up over the head while making little movements with her forefinger .   tiffany raised her hands to her head .  for a moment she thought there was nothing there  and then they touched   something .  it was more like a sensation in the air  if you weren   t expecting it to be there  your fingers passed straight through .      is it really there .     she said .      who knows .     said the witch .     it   s virtually a pointy hat .  no one else will know it   s there .  it might be a comfort .         you mean it just exists in my head .     said tiffany .      you   ve got lots of things in your head .  that doesn   t mean they aren   t real .  best not to ask me too many questions .         what happened to the toad .     said miss tick  who did ask questions .      he   s gone off with the wee free men     said tiffany .     it turned out he used to be a lawyer .         you   ve given a clan of the nac mac feegle their own lawyer .     said mrs .  ogg .     that   ll make the world tremble .  still  i always say the occasional tremble does you good .         come  sisters  we must away     said miss tick  who had climbed on the other broomstick behind mrs .  ogg .      there   s no need for that sort of talk     said mrs .  ogg .     that   s theater talk  that is .  cheerio  tiff .  we   ll see you again .      her stick rose gently into the air .  from the stick of mistress weatherwax  though  there was merely a sad little noise  like the thwop of miss tick   s hat point .  the broomstick went kshugagugah .   mistress weatherwax sighed .     it   s them dwarfs     she said .     they say they   ve repaired it  oh yes  and it starts first time in their workshop        they heard the sound of distant hooves .  with surprising speed  mistress weatherwax swung herself off the stick  grabbed it firmly in both hands  and ran away across the turf  skirts billowing behind her .   she was a speck in the distance when tiffany   s father came over the brow of the hill on one of the farm horses .  he hadn   t even stopped to put the leather shoes on it  great slices of earth flew up as hooves the size of large soup plates   each one shod with iron  bit into the turf .   tiffany heard a faint kshugagugahvvvvvoooom behind her as he leaped off the horse .   she was surprised to see him laughing and crying at the same time .       it was all a bit of a dream .   tiffany found that a very useful thing to say .  it   s hard to remember  it was all a bit of a dream .  it was all a bit of a dream  i can   t be certain .   the overjoyed baron  however  was very certain .  obviously this   this queen woman  whoever she was  had been stealing children but roland had beaten her  oh yes  and helped these two young children to get back as well .   her mother had insisted on tiffany   s going to bed  even though it was broad daylight .  actually  she didn   t mind .  she was tired  and lay under the covers in that nice pink world halfway between asleep and awake .   she heard the baron and her father talking downstairs .  she heard the story being woven between them as they tried to make sense of it all .  obviously the girl had been very brave  this was the baron speaking   but well  she was nine  wasn   t she .  and didn   t even know how to use a sword .  whereas roland had had fencing lessons at his school     and so it went on .  there were other things she heard her parents discussing later  when the baron had gone .  there was the way ratbag now lived on the roof  for example .   tiffany lay in bed and smelled the ointment her mother had rubbed into her temples .  tiffany must have been hit on the head  she   d said  because of the way she kept on touching it .   so   roland with the beefy face was the hero  was he .  and she was just like the stupid princess who broke her ankle and fainted all the time .  that was completely unfair .   she reached out to the little table beside her bed where she   d put the invisible hat .  her mother had put down a cup of broth right through it  but it was still there .  tiffany   s fingers felt  very faintly  the roughness of the brim .   we never ask for any reward  she thought .  besides  it was her secret  all of it .  no one else knew about the wee free men .  admittedly wentworth had taken to running through the house with a tablecloth around his waist shouting     weewee mens .  i   ll scone you in the boot .     but mrs .  aching was still so glad to see him back  and so happy that he was talking about things other than sweets  that she wasn   t paying too much attention to what he was talking about .   no  she couldn   t tell anyone .  they   d never believe her  and suppose that they did  and went up and poked around in the pictsies    mound .  she couldn   t let that happen .   what would granny aching have done .   granny aching would have said nothing .  granny aching often said nothing .  she just smiled to herself  and puffed on her pipe  and waited until the right time .   tiffany smiled to herself .   she slept  and didn   t dream .   and a day went past .       and another day .       on the third day it rained .  tiffany went into the kitchen when no one was about and took down the china shepherdess from the shelf .  she put it in a sack  then slipped out of the house and ran up onto the downs .   the worst of the weather was going to either side of the chalk  which cut through the clouds like the prow of a ship .  but when tiffany reached the spot where an old stove and four iron wheels stood out of the grass  and cut a square of turf  and carefully chipped out a hole for the china shepherdess  and then put the turf back   it was raining hard enough to soak in and give the turf a chance of surviving .  it seemed the right thing to do .  and she was sure she caught a whiff of tobacco .   then she went to the pictsies    mound .  she   d worried about that .  she knew they were there  didn   t she .  so  somehow  going to check that they were there would be sort of showing that she doubted if they would be  wouldn   t it .  they were busy people .  they had lots to do .  they had the old kelda to mourn .  they were probably very busy .  that   s what she told herself .  it wasn   t because she kept wondering if there really might be nothing down the hole but rabbits .  it wasn   t that at all .   she was the kelda .  she had a duty .   she heard music .  she heard voices .  and then sudden silence as she peered into the gloom .   she carefully took a bottle of special sheep liniment out of her sack and let it slide into darkness .   tiffany walked away and heard the faint music start up again .   she did wave at a buzzard  circling lazily under the clouds  and she was sure a tiny dot waved back .       on the fourth day tiffany made butter and did her chores .  she did have help .      and now i want you to go and feed the chickens     she said to wentworth .     what is it i want you to do .         fee    the cluck clucks     said wentworth .      chickens     said tiffany severely .      chickens     said wentworth obediently .      and wipe your nose not on your sleeve .  i gave you a handkerchief .  and on the way back see if you can carry a whole log  will you .         ach  crivens     muttered wentworth .      and what is it we don   t say .     said tiffany .     we don   t say the              the crivens word     wentworth muttered .      and we don   t say it in front of              in fron    of mummy     said wentworth .      good .  and then when i   ve finished  we   ll have time to go down to the river .      wentworth brightened up .      weewee mens .     he said .   tiffany didn   t reply immediately .   she hadn   t seen a single feegle since she   d been home .      there might be     she said .     but they   re probably very busy .  they   ve got to find another kelda  and   well  they   re very busy .  i expect .         weewee men say hit you in the head  fish face .     said wentworth happily .      we   ll see     said tiffany  feeling like a parent .     now please go and get the eggs .      when he   d wandered away  carrying the egg basket in both hands  tiffany turned out some butter onto the marble slab and picked up the paddles to pat it into  well  a pat of butter .  then she   d stamp it with one of the wooden stamps .  people appreciated a little picture on their butter .   as she began to shape the butter  she was aware of a shadow in the doorway and turned .   it was roland .   he looked at her  his face even redder than usual .  he was twiddling his very expensive hat nervously  just like rob anybody did .      yes .     she said .      look  about   well  about all that   about       roland began .      yes .         look  i didn   t   i mean  i didn   t lie to anyone or anything     he blurted out .     but my father just sort of assumed i   d been a hero  and he just wouldn   t listen to anything i said even after i told him how   how           helpful i   d been .     said tiffany .      yes   i mean  no .  he said  he said  he said it was lucky for you i was there  he said           it doesn   t matter     said tiffany  picking up the butter paddles again .      and he just kept telling everyone how brave i   d been and           i said it doesn   t matter     said tiffany .  the little paddles went patpatpat on the fresh butter .   roland   s mouth opened and shut for a moment .      you mean you don   t mind .     he said at last .      no .  i don   t mind     said tiffany .      but it   s not fair .         we   re the only ones who know the truth     said tiffany .   patapatpat .  roland stared at the fat  rich butter as she calmly patted it into shape .      oh     he said .     er   you won   t tell anyone  will you .  i mean  you   ve got every right to  but        patapatapat .      no one would believe me     said tiffany .      i did try     said roland .     honestly .  i really did .      i expect you did  tiffany thought .  but you   re not very clever  and the baron certainly is a man without first sight .  he sees the world the way he wants to see it .      one day you   ll be baron  won   t you .     she said .      well  yes .  one day .  but look  are you really a witch .         when you   re baron you   ll be good at it  i expect .     said tiffany  turning the butter around .     fair and generous and decent .  you   ll pay good wages and look after the old people .  you wouldn   t let people turn an old lady out of her house .         well  i hope i        tiffany turned to face him  a butter paddle in each hand .      because i   ll be there  you see .  you   ll look up and see my eye on you .  i   ll be there on the edge of the crowd .  all the time .  i   ll be watching everything  because i come from a long line of aching people and this is my land .  but you can be the baron for us and i hope you   re a good one .  if you are not   there will be a reckoning .         look  i know you were   were       roland began  going redder in the face .      very helpful .     said tiffany .         but you can   t talk to me like that  you know .      tiffany was sure she heard  up in the roof and on the very edge of hearing  someone say     ach  crivens  what a wee snotter        she shut her eyes for a moment and then  heart pounding  pointed a butter paddle at one of the empty buckets .      bucket  fill yourself .     she commanded .   it blurred  and then sloshed .  water dripped down the side .   roland stared at it .  tiffany gave him one of her sweetest smiles  which could be quite scary .      you won   t tell anyone  will you .     she said .   he turned to her  face pale .     no one would believe me       he stammered .      aye     said tiffany .     so we understand one another .  isn   t that nice .  and now  if you don   t mind  i   ve got to finish this and make a start on some cheese .         cheese .  but you   you could do anything you wanted .     roland burst out .      and right now i want to make cheese     said tiffany calmly .     go away .         my father owns this farm .     said roland  and then realized he   d said that out loud .   there were two little but strangely loud clicks as tiffany put down the butter paddles and turned around .      that was a very brave thing you just said     she said     but i expect you   re sorry you said it  now that you   ve had a really good think .      roland  who had shut his eyes  nodded his head .      good     said tiffany .     today i   m making cheese .  tomorrow i may do something else .  and in a while  maybe  i won   t be here and you   ll wonder  where is she .  but part of me will always be here  always .  i   ll always be thinking about this place .  i   ll have it in my eye .  and i will be back .  now  go away .      he turned and ran .   after his footsteps had died away  tiffany said     all right  who   s there .         it   s me  mistress .  no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  mistress .     the pictsie appeared from behind the bucket and added     rob anybody said we should come tae keep an eye on ye for a wee while  and tae thank ye for the offerin    .      it   s still magic even if you know how it   s done  tiffany thought .      only watch me in the dairy  then     she said .     no spying .         ach  no  mistress     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock nervously .  then he grinned .     fion   s goin    off to be the kelda for a clan over near copperhead mountain     he said     an    she   s asked me to go along as the gonnagle .         congratulations .         aye  and william says i should be fine if i just work on the mousepipes     said the pictsie .     and   er           yes .     said tiffany .      er   hamish says there   s a girl in the long lake clan who   s looking to become a kelda   er   it   s a fine clan she   s from   er       the pictsie was going violet with embarrassment .      good     said tiffany .     if i was rob anybody  i   d invite her over right away .         ye dinna mind .     asked not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock hopefully .      not at all     said tiffany .  she did a little bit  she had to admit to herself  but it was a bit she could put away on a shelf in her head somewhere .      that   s grand .     said the pictsie .     the lads were a bit worried  ye ken .  i   ll run up and tell them .     he lowered his voice .     an    would ye like me to run after that big heap o    jobbies that just left and see that he falls off his horse again .         no .     said tiffany hurriedly .     no .  don   t .  no .     she picked up the butter paddles .     you leave him to me     she added  smiling .     you can leave everything to me .      when she was alone again  she finished the butter   patapatapat    .   she paused  put the paddles down  and with the tip of a very clean finger drew a curved line in the surface  with another curved line just touching it  so that together they looked like a wave .  she traced a third  flat curve under it  which was the chalk .   land under wave .   she quickly smoothed the butter again and picked up the stamp she   d made yesterday  she   d carved it carefully out of a piece of apple wood that mr .  block  the carpenter  had given her .   she stamped it onto the butter and took it off carefully .   there  glistening on the oily rich yellow surface  was a gibbous moon and  sailing in front of the moon  a witch on a broomstick .   she smiled again  and it was granny aching   s smile .  things would be different one day .   but you had to start small  like oak trees .   then she made cheese        in the dairy  on the farm  and the fields unrolling  and becoming the downlands sleeping under the hot midsummer sun  where the flocks of sheep  moving slowly  drift over the short turf like clouds on a green sky  and here and there sheepdogs speed over the grass like shooting stars .  forever and ever  wold without end .       author   s note      the picture that tiffany    enters    in this book really exists .  it   s called the fairy feller   s master stroke  by richard dadd  and is in the tate gallery in london .  it is only about twenty one by fifteen inches .  it took the artist nine years to complete  in the middle of the nineteenth century .  i cannot think of a more famous fairy painting .  it is  indeed  very strange .  summer heat leaks out of it .   what people    know    about richard dadd is that he went mad  killed his father  was locked up in a lunatic asylum for the rest of his life  and painted a weird picture .  crudely  that   s all true  but it   s a dreadful summary of the life of a skilled and talented artist who developed a serious mental illness .   a nac mac feegle does not appear anywhere in the painting  but i suppose it   s always possible that one was removed for making an obscene gesture .  it   s the sort of thing they   d do .   oh  and the tradition of burying a shepherd with a piece of raw wool in the coffin is true  too .  even gods understand that a shepherd can   t neglect the sheep .  a god who didn   t understand that would not be worth believing in .   there is no such word as noonlight  but it would be nice if there was .       about the author      terry pratchett   s novels have sold more than thirty two million copies and

your kidneys can tell you .         ordinary fortune tellers tell you what you want to happen  witches tell you what   s going to happen whether you want it to or not .  strangely enough  witches tend to be more accurate but less popular .        tiffany had read lots of words in the dictionary that she   d never heard spoken  so she had to guess at how they were pronounced .        no words could describe what a feegle in a kilt looks like upside down  so they won   t try .        probably about eleven inches across .  tiffany didn   t measure them this time .
