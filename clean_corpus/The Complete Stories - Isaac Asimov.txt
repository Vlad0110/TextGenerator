yet quit .  in addition to the hundreds of short stories i have published  there are at least a dozen in press waiting to be published  and two stories written and not yet submitted .  so i have by no means retired .   there is  however  no way one can publish short stories for this length of time without understanding that the time left to him is limited .  in the words of the song   forevermore is shorter than before .    it is time  therefore  for doubleday to pull the strings together and get all my fiction short stories and novels  too into a definitive form and in uniform bindings  both in hard and soft covers .   it may sound conceited of me to say so  i am frequently accused of being conceited   but my fiction generally has been popular from the start and has continued to be well received through the years .  to locate any one story  however  that you no longer have and wish you did  or to find one you have heard about but have missed is no easy task .  my stories appeared originally in any one of many magazines  the original issues of which are all but unobtainable .  they then appeared in any of a multiplicity of anthologies and collections  copies of which are almost as unobtainable .   it is doubleday s intention to make this multivolume collection definitive and uniform in the hope that the science fiction public  the mystery public  for my many mysteries will also be collected   and libraries as well will seize upon them ravenously and clear their book shelves to make room for isaac asimav  the complete stories .   we begin in this volume with two of my early collections from the     s  earth is room enough and nine tomorrows .   the former includes such favorites of mine as  franchise   which deals with the ultimate election day   living space   which gives every family a world of its own   the fun they had   my most anthologized story   jokester   whose ending i bet you don t anticipate if you ve never read the story before  and  dreaming is a private thing   concerning which robert a .  heinlein accused me of making money out of my own neuroses .   nine tomorrows  the personal favorite of all my collections  contains not one story i don t consider to be excellent examples of my productions of the     s .  in particular  there is  the last question   which  of all the stories i have written  is my absolute favorite .   then there is  the ugly little boy   my third favorite story .  my tales tend to be cerebral  but i count on this one to bring about a tear or two .   to find out which is the second favorite of my stories  you ll have to read successive volumes of this collection .    the feeling of power  is another frequently anthologized piece and is rather prophetic  considering it was written before anyone was thinking of pocket computers .   all the troubles of the world  is a suspense story and  the dying night  is a mystery based  alas  on an astronomical  fact  now known to be quite mistaken .   then there is a later collection included here  nightfall and other stories  which features  nightfall   a story that many readers and the science fiction writers of america have voted the best science fiction story ever written  i don t think so  but it would be impolite to argue  .  other favorites of mine are    breeds there a man  .   .   .   .      which is rather chilling   sally   which expresses my feelings about automobiles   strikebreaker   which i consider much underappreciated  and  eyes do more than see   a short heartstring wrencher .   there ll be more volumes  but begin by reading this one .  you will make an old man very happy  you know .    isaac asimov  new york city  march       isaac asimov  the complete stories  volume    the dead past  arnold potterley  ph . d .   was a professor of ancient history .  that  in itself  was not dangerous .  what changed the world beyond all dreams was the fact that he looked like a professor of ancient history .   thaddeus araman  department head of the division of chronoscopy  might have taken proper action if dr .  potterley had been owner  . of a large  square chin  flashing eyes  aquiline nose and broad shoulders .   as it was  thaddeus araman found himself staring over his desk at a mild mannered individual  whose faded blue eyes looked at him wistfully from either side of a low bridged button nose  whose small  neatly dressed figure seemed stamped  milk and water  from thinning brown hair to the neatly brushed shoes that completed a conservative middle class costume .   araman said pleasantly   and now what can i do for you  dr .  potterley .    dr .  potterley said in a soft voice that went well with the rest of him   mr .  araman  i came to you because you re top man in chronoscopy .    araman smiled .   not exactly .  above me is the world commissioner of research and above him is the secretary general of the united nations .  and above both of them  of course  are the sovereign peoples of earth .    dr .  potterley shook his head .   they re not interested in chronoscopy .  i ve come to you  sir  because for two years i have been trying to obtain permission to do some time viewing chronoscopy  that is in connection with my researches on ancient carthage .  i can t obtain such permission .  my research grants are all proper .  there is no irregularity in any of my intellectual endeavors and yet    copyright         by street and smith publications  inc .    i m sure there is no question of irregularity   said araman soothingly .  he flipped the thin reproduction sheets in the folder to which potterley s name had been attached .  they had been produced by multivac  whose vast analogical mind kept all the department records .  when this was over  the sheets could be destroyed  then reproduced on demand in a matter of minutes .   and while araman turned the pages  dr .  potterley s voice continued in a soft monotone .   the historian was saying   i must explain that my problem is quite an important one .  carthage was ancient commercialism brought to its zenith .  pre roman carthage was the nearest ancient analogue to pre atomic america  at least insofar as its attachment to trade  commerce and business in general was concerned .  they were the most daring seamen and explorers before the vikings  much better at it than the overrated greeks .    to know carthage would be very rewarding  yet the only knowledge we have of it is derived from the writings of its bitter enemies  the greeks and romans .  carthage itself never wrote in its own defense or  if it did  the books did not survive .  as a result  the carthaginians have been one of the favorite sets of villains of history and perhaps unjustly so .  time viewing may set the record straight .    he said much more .   araman said  still turning the reproduction sheets before him   you must realize  dr .  potterley  that chronoscopy  or time viewing  if you prefer  is a difficult process .    dr .  potterley  who had been interrupted  frowned and said   i am asking for only certain selected views at times and places i would indicate .    araman sighed .   even a few views  even one  .  .  .  it is an unbelievably delicate art .  there is the question of focus  getting the proper scene in view and holding it .  there is the synchronization of sound  which calls for completely independent circuits .     surely my problem is important enough to justify considerable effort .     yes  sir .  undoubtedly   said araman at once .  to deny the importance of someone s research problem would be unforgivably bad manners .   but you must understand how long drawn out even the simplest view is .  and there is a long waiting line for the chronoscope and an even longer waiting line for the use of multivac which guides us in our use of the controls .    potterley stirred unhappily .   but can nothing be done .  for two years     a matter of priority  sir .  i m sorry .   .   .   .  cigarette .    the historian started back at the suggestion  eyes suddenly widening as he stared at the pack thrust out toward him .  araman looked surprised  withdrew the pack  made a motion as though to take a cigarette for himself and thought better of it .   potterley drew a sigh of unfeigned relief as the pack was put out of sight .   he said   is there any way of reviewing matters  putting me as far forward as possible .  i don t know how to explain    araman smiled .  some had offered money under similar circumstances which  of course  had gotten them nowhere  either .  he said   the decisions on priority are computer processed .  i could in no way alter those decisions arbitrarily .    potterley rose stiffly to his feet .  he stood five and a half feet tall .   then  good day  sir .     good day  dr .  potterley .  and my sincerest regrets .    he offered his hand and potterley touched it briefly .   the historian left  and a touch of the buzzer brought araman s secretary into the room .  he handed her the folder .    these   he said   may be disposed of .    alone again  he smiled bitterly .  another item in his quarter century s service to the human race .  service through negation .   at least this fellow had been easy to dispose of .  sometimes academic pressure had to be applied and even withdrawal of grants .   five minutes later  he had forgotten dr .  potterley .  nor  thinking back on it later  could he remember feeling any premonition of danger .   during the first year of his frustration  arnold potterley had experienced only that frustration .  during the second year  though  his frustration gave birth to an idea that first frightened and then fascinated him .  two things stopped him from trying to translate the idea into action  and neither barrier was the undoubted fact that his notion was a grossly unethical one .   the first was merely the continuing hope that the government would finally give its permission and make it unnecessary for him to do anything more .  that hope had perished finally in the interview with araman just completed .   the second barrier had been not a hope at all but a dreary realization of his own incapacity .  he was not a physicist and he knew no physicists from whom he might obtain help .  the department of physics at the university consisted of men well stocked with grants and well immersed in specialty .  at best  they would not listen to him .  at worst  they would report him for intellectual anarchy and even his basic carthaginian grant might easily be withdrawn .   that he could not risk .  and yet chronoscopy was the only way to carry on his work .  without it  he would be no worse off if his grant were lost .   the first hint that the second barrier might be overcome had come a week earlier than his interview with araman  and it had gone unrecognized at the time .  it had been at one of the faculty teas .  potterley attended these sessions unfailingly because he conceived attendance to be a duty  and he took his duties seriously .  once there  however  he conceived it to be no responsibility of his to make light conversation or new friends .  he sipped abstemiously at a drink or two  exchanged a polite word with the dean or  such department heads as happened to be present  bestowed a narrow smile on others and finally left early .   ordinarily  he would have paid no attention  at that most recent tea  to a young man standing quietly  even diffidently  in one corner .  he would never have dreamed of speaking to him .  yet a tangle of circumstance persuaded him this once to behave in a way contrary to his nature .   that morning at breakfast  mrs .  potterley had announced somberly that once again she had dreamed of laurel  but this time a laurel grown up  yet retaining the three year old face that stamped her as their child .  potterley had let her talk .  there had been a time when he fought her too frequent preoccupation with the past and death .  laurel would not come back to them  either through dreams or through talk .  yet if it appeased caroline potterley let her dream and talk .   but when potterley went to school that morning  he found himself for once affected by caroline s inanities .  laurel grown up .  she had died nearly twenty years ago  their only child  then and ever .  in all that time  when he thought of her  it was as a three year old .   now he thought  but if she were alive now  she wouldn t be three  she d be nearly twenty three .   helplessly  he found himself trying to think of laurel as growing progressively older  as finally becoming twenty three .  he did not quite succeed .   yet he tried .  laurel using make up .  laurel going out with boys .  laurel  getting married .   so it was that when he saw the young man hovering at the outskirts of the coldly circulating group of faculty men  it occurred to him quixotically that  for all he knew  a youngster just such as this might have married laurel .  that youngster himself  perhaps .   .   .   .   laurel might have met him  here at the university  or some evening when he might be invited to dinner at the potterleys  .  they might grow interested in one another .  laurel would surely have been pretty and this youngster looked well .  he was dark in coloring  with a lean intent face and an easy carriage .   the tenuous daydream snapped  yet potterley found himself staring foolishly at the young man  not as a strange face but as a possible son in law in the might have been .  he found himself threading his way toward the man .  it was almost a form of autohypnotism .   he put out his hand .   i am arnold potterley of the history department .  you re new here  i think .    the youngster looked faintly astonished and fumbled with his drink  shifting it to his left hand in order to shake with his right .   jonas foster is my name  sir .  i m a new instructor in physics .  i m just starting this semester .    potterley nodded .   i wish you a happy stay here and great success .    that was the end of it  then .  potterley had come uneasily to his senses   found himself embarrassed and moved off .  he stared back over his shoulder once  but the illusion of relationship had gone .  reality was quite real once more and he was angry with himself for having fallen prey to his wife s foolish talk about laurel .   but a week later  even while araman was talking  the thought of that young man had come back to him .  an instructor in physics .  a new instructor .  had he been deaf at the time .  was there a short circuit between ear and brain .  or was it an automatic self censorship because of the impending interview with the head of chronoscopy .   but the interview failed  and it was the thought of the young man with whom he had exchanged two sentences that prevented potterley from elaborating his pleas for consideration .  he was almost anxious to get away .   and in the autogiro express back to the university  he could almost wish he were superstitious .  he could then console himself with the thought that the casual meaningless meeting had really been directed by a knowing and purposeful fate .   jonas foster was not new to academic life .  the long and rickety struggle for the doctorate would make anyone a veteran .  additional work as a postdoctorate teaching fellow acted as a booster shot .   but now he was instructor jonas foster .  professorial dignity lay ahead .  and he now found himself in a new sort of relationship toward other professors .   for one thing  they would be voting on future promotions .  for another  he was in no position to tell so early in the game which particular member of the faculty might or might not have the ear of the dean or even of the university president .  he did not fancy himself as a campus politician and was sure he would make a poor one  yet there was no point in kicking his own rear into blisters just to prove that to himself .   so foster listened to this mild mannered historian who  in some vague way  seemed nevertheless to radiate tension  and did not shut him up abruptly and toss him out .  certainly that was his first impulse .   he remembered potterley well enough .  potterley had approached him at that tea  which had been a grizzly affair  .  the fellow had spoken two sentences to him stiffly  somehow glassy eyed  had then come to himself with a visible start and hurried off .   it had amused foster at the time  but now  .   .   .   potterley might have been deliberately trying to make his acquaintance  or  rather  to impress his own personality on foster as that of a queer sort of duck  eccentric but harmless .  he might now be probing foster s views  searching for unsettling opinions .  surely  they ought to have done so before granting him his appointment .  still  .   .   .   potterley might be serious  might honestly not realize what he was doing .   or he might realize quite well what he was doing  he might be nothing more or less than a dangerous rascal .   foster mumbled   well  now   to gain time  and fished out a package of cigarettes  intending to offer one to potterley and to light it and one for himself very slowly .   but potterley said at once   please  dr .  foster .  no cigarettes .    foster looked startled .   i m sorry  sir .        no .  the regrets are mine .  i cannot stand the odor .  an idiosyncrasy .  i m sorry .    he was positively pale .  foster put away the cigarettes .   foster  feeling the absence of the cigarette  took the easy way out .   i m flattered that you ask my advice and all that  dr .  potterley  but i m not a neutrinics man .  i can t very well do anything professional in that direction .  even stating an opinion would be out of line  and  frankly  i d prefer that you didn t go into any particulars .    the historian s prim face set hard .   what do you mean  you re not a neutrinics man .  you re not anything yet .  you haven t received any grant  have you .     this is only my first semester .     i know that .  i imagine you haven t even applied for any grant yet .    foster half smiled .  in three months at the university  he had not succeeded in putting his initial requests for research grants into good enough shape to pass on to a professional science writer  let alone to the research commission .    his department head  fortunately  took it quite well .   take your time now  foster   he said   and get your thoughts well organized .  make sure you know your path and where it will lead  for  once you receive a grant  your specialization will be formally recognized and  for better or for worse  it will be yours for the rest of your career .   the advice was trite enough  but triteness has often the merit of truth  and foster recognized that .    foster said   by education and inclination  dr .  potterley  i m a hyperop tics man with a gravities minor .  it s how i described myself in applying for this position .  it may not be my official specialization yet  but it s going to be .  it can t be anything else .  as for neutrinics  i never even studied the subject .     why not .   demanded potterley at once .   foster stared .  it was the kind of rude curiosity about another man s professional status that was always irritating .  he said  with the edge of his own politeness just a trifle blunted   a course in neutrinics wasn t given at my university .     good lord  where did you go .     m . i . t .    said foster quietly .    and they don t teach neutrinics .     no  they don t .   foster felt himself flush and was moved to a defense .    it s a highly specialized subject with no great value .  chronoscopy  perhaps  has some value  but it is the only practical application and that s a dead end .    the historian stared at him earnestly .   tell me this .  do you know where i can find a neutrinics man .     no  i don t   said foster bluntly .    well  then  do you know a school which teaches neutrinics .     no  i don t .    potterley smiled tightly and without humor .   foster resented that smile  found he detected insult in it and grew sufficiently annoyed to say   i would like to point out  sir  that you re stepping out of line .     what .     i m saying that  as a historian  your interest in any sort of physics  your professional interest  is   he paused  unable to bring himself quite to say the word .    unethical .     that s the word  dr .  potterley .     my researches have driven me to it   said potterley in an intense whisper .    the research commission is the place to go .  if they permit     i have gone to them and have received no satisfaction .     then obviously you must abandon this .   foster knew he was sounding stuffily virtuous  but he wasn t going to let this man lure him into an expression of intellectual anarchy .  it was too early in his career to take stupid risks .   apparently  though  the remark had its effect on potterley .  without any warning  the man exploded into a rapid fire verbal storm of irresponsibility .   scholars  he said  could be free only if they could freely follow their own free swinging curiosity .  research  he said  forced into a predesigned pattern by the powers that held the purse strings became slavish and had to stagnate .  no man  he said  had the right to dictate the intellectual interests of another .   foster listened to all of it with disbelief .  none of it was strange to him .  he had heard college boys talk so in order to shock their professors and he had once or twice amused himself in that fashion  too .  anyone who studied the history of science knew that many men had once thought so .   yet it seemed strange to foster  almost against nature  that a modern man of science could advance such nonsense .  no one would advocate running a factory by allowing each individual worker to do whatever pleased him at the moment  or of running a ship according to the casual and conflicting notions of each individual crewman .  it would be taken for granted that some sort of centralized supervisory agency must exist in each case .  why should direction and order benefit a factory and a ship but not scientific research .   people might say that the human mind was somehow qualitatively different from a ship or factory but the history of intellectual endeavor proved the opposite .   when science was young and the intricacies of all or most of the known was within the grasp of an individual mind  there was no need for direction  perhaps .  blind wandering over the uncharted tracts of ignorance could lead to wonderful finds by accident .   but as knowledge grew  more and more data had to be absorbed before worthwhile journeys into ignorance could be organized .  men had to specialize .  the researcher needed the resources of a library he himself could not gather  then of instruments he himself could not afford .  more and more  the individual researcher gave way to the research team and the research institution .   the funds necessary for research grew greater as tools grew more numerous .  what college was so small today as not to require at least one nuclear micro reactor and at least one three stage computer .   centuries before  private individuals could no longer subsidize research .  by       only the government  large industries and large universities or research institutions could properly subsidize basic research .   by       even the largest universities depended entirely upon government grants  while research institutions could not exist without tax concessions and public subscriptions .  by       the industrial combines had become a branch of the world government and  thereafter  the financing of research and therefore its direction naturally became centralized under a department of the government .   it all worked itself out naturally and well .  every branch of science was fitted neatly to the needs of the public  and the various branches of science were co ordinated decently .  the material advance of the last half century was argument enough for the fact that science was not falling into stagnation .   foster tried to say a very little of this and was waved aside impatiently by potterley who said   you are parroting official propaganda .  you re sitting in the middle of an example that s squarely against the official view .  can you believe that .     frankly  no .     well  why do you say time viewing is a dead end .  why is neutrinics unimportant .  you say it is .  you say it categorically .  yet you ve never studied it .  you claim complete ignorance of the subject .  it s not even given in your school     isn t the mere fact that it isn t given proof enough .     oh  i see .  it s not given because it s unimportant .  and it s unimportant because it s not given .  are you satisfied with that reasoning .    foster felt a growing confusion .   it s in the books .     that s all .  the books say neutrinics is unimportant .  your professors tell  you so because they read it in the books .  the books say so because professors write them .  who says it from personal experience and knowledge .  who does research in it .  do you know of anyone .    foster said   i don t see that we re getting anywhere  dr .  potterley .  i have work to do     one minute .  i just want you to try this on .  see how it sounds to you .  i say the government is actively suppressing basic research in neutrinics and chronoscopy .  they re suppressing application of chronoscopy .     oh  no .     why not .  they could do it .  there s your centrally directed research .  if they refuse grants for research in any portion of science  that portion dies .  they ve killed neutrinics .  they can do it and have done it .     but why .     i don t know why .  i want you to find out .  i d do it myself if i knew enough .  i came to you because you re a young fellow with a brand new education .  have your intellectual arteries hardened already .  is there no curiosity in you .  don t you want to know .  don t you want answers .    the historian was peering intently into foster s face .  their noses were only inches apart  and foster was so lost that he did not think to draw back .   he should  by rights  have ordered potterley out .  if necessary  he should have thrown potterley out .   it was not respect for age and position that stopped him .  it was certainly not that potterley s arguments had convinced him .  rather  it was a small point of college pride .   why didn t m . i . t .  give a course in neutrinics .  for that matter  now that he came to think of it  he doubted that there was a single book on neutrinics in the library .  he could never recall having seen one .   he stopped to think about that .   and that was ruin .   caroline potterley had once been an attractive woman .  there were occasions  such as dinners or university functions  when  by considerable effort  remnants of the attraction could be salvaged .   on ordinary occasions  she sagged .  it was the word she applied to herself in moments of self abhorrence .  she had grown plumper with the years  but the flaccidity about her was not a matter of fat entirely .  it was as though her muscles had given up and grown limp so that she shuffled when she walked  while her eyes grew baggy and her cheeks jowly .  even her graying hair seemed tired rather than merely stringy .  its straightness seemed to be the result of a supine surrender to gravity  nothing else .   caroline potterley looked at herself in the mirror and admitted this was one of her bad days .  she knew the reason  too .   it had been the dream of laurel .  the strange one  with laurel grown up .  she had been wretched ever since .   still  she was sony she had mentioned it to arnold .  he didn t say anything  he never did any more  but it was bad for him .  he was particularly withdrawn for days afterward .  it might have been that he was getting ready for that important conference with the big government official  he kept saying he expected no success   but it might also have been her dream .   it was better in the old days when he would cry sharply at her   let the dead past go  caroline .  talk won t bring her back  and dreams won t either .    it had been bad for both of them .  horribly bad .  she had been away from home and had lived in guilt ever since .  if she had stayed at home  if she had not gone on an unnecessary shopping expedition  there would have been two of them available .  one would have succeeded in saving laurel .   poor arnold had not managed .  heaven knew he tried .  he had nearly died himself .  he had come out of the burning house  staggering in agony  blistered  choking  half blinded  with the dead laurel in his arms .   the nightmare of that lived on  never lifting entirely .   arnold slowly grew a shell about himself afterward .  he cultivated a low voiced mildness through which nothing broke  no lightning struck .  he grew puritanical and even abandoned his minor vices  his cigarettes  his penchant for an occasional profane exclamation .  he obtained his grant for the preparation of a new history of carthage and subordinated everything to that .   she tried to help him .  she hunted up his references  typed his notes and microfilmed them .  then that ended suddenly .   she ran from the desk suddenly one evening  reaching the bathroom in bare time and retching abominably .  her husband followed her in confusion and concern .    caroline  what s wrong .    it took a drop of brandy to bring her around .  she said   is it true .  what they did .     who did .     the carthaginians .    he stared at her and she got it out by indirection .  she couldn t say it right out .   the carthaginians  it seemed  worshiped moloch  in the form of a hollow  brazen idol with a furnace in its belly .  at times of national crisis  the priests and the people gathered  and infants  after the proper ceremonies and invocations  were dextrously hurled  alive  into the flames .   they were given sweetmeats just before the crucial moment  in order that the efficacy of the sacrifice not be ruined by displeasing cries of panic .  the drums rolled just after the moment  to drown out the few seconds of infant shrieking .  the parents were present  presumably gratified  for the sacrifice was pleasing to the gods .   .   .   .   arnold potterley frowned darkly .  vicious lies  he told her  on the part of carthage s enemies .  he should have warned her .  after all  such propa   gandistic lies were not uncommon .  according to the greeks  the ancient hebrews worshiped an ass s head in their holy of holies .  according to the romans  the primitive christians were haters of all men who sacrificed pagan children in the catacombs .    then they didn t do it .   asked caroline .    i m sure they didn t .  the primitive phoenicians may have .  human sacrifice is commonplace in primitive cultures .  but carthage in her great days was not a primitive culture .  human sacrifice often gives way to symbolic actions such as circumcision .  the greeks and romans might have mistaken some carthaginian symbolism for the original full rite  either out of ignorance or out of malice .     are you sure .     i can t be sure yet  caroline  but when i ve got enough evidence  i ll apply for permission to use chronoscopy  which will settle the matter once and for all .     chronoscopy .     time viewing .  we can focus on ancient carthage at some time of crisis  the landing of scipio africanus in     b . c .   for instance  and see with our own eyes exactly what happens .  and you ll see  i ll be right .    he patted her and smiled encouragingly  but she dreamed of laurel every night for two weeks thereafter and she never helped him with his carthage project again .  nor did he ever ask her to .   but now she was bracing herself for his coming .  he had called her after arriving back in town  told her he had seen the government man and that it had gone as expected .  that meant failure  and yet the little telltale sign of depression had been absent from his voice and his features had appeared quite composed in the teleview .  he had another errand to take care of  he said  before coming home .   it meant he would be late  but that didn t matter .  neither one of them was particular about eating hours or cared when packages were taken out of the freezer or even which packages or when the selfwarming mechanism was activated .   when he did arrive  he surprised her .  there was nothing untoward about him in any obvious way .  he kissed her dutifully and smiled  took off his hat and asked if all had been well while he was gone .  it was all almost perfectly normal .  almost .   she had learned to detect small things  though  and his pace in all this was a trifle hurried .  enough to show her accustomed eye that he was under tension .   she said   has something happened .    he said   we re going to have a dinner guest night after next  caroline .  you don t mind .     well  no .  is it anyone i know .     no .  a young instructor .  a newcomer .  i ve spoken to him .   he suddenly  whirled toward her and seized her arms at the elbow  held them a moment  then dropped them in confusion as though disconcerted at having shown emotion .   he said     almost didn t get through to him .  imagine that .  terrible  terrible  the way we have all bent to the yoke  the affection we have for the harness about us .    mrs .  potterley wasn t sure she understood  but for a year she had been watching him grow quietly more rebellious  little by little more daring in his criticism of the government .  she said   you haven t spoken foolishly to him  have you .     what do you mean  foolishly .  he ll be doing some neutrinics for me .     neutrinics  was trisyllabic nonsense to mrs .  potterley  but she knew it had nothing to do with history .  she said faintly   arnold  i don t like you to do that .  you ll lose your position .  it s     it s intellectual anarchy  my dear   he said .   that s the phrase you want .  very well .  i am an anarchist .  if the government will not allow me to push my researches  i will push them on my own .  and when i show the way  others will follow .   .   .   .  and if they don t  it makes no difference .  it s carthage that counts and human knowledge  not you and i .     but you don t know this young man .  what if he is an agent for the commission of research .     not likely and i ll take that chance .   he made a fist of his right hand and rubbed it gently against the palm of his left .   he s on my side now .  i m sure of it .  he can t help but be .  i can recognize intellectual curiosity when i see it in a man s eyes and face and attitude  and it s a fatal disease for a tame scientist .  even today it takes time to beat it out of a man and the young ones are vulnerable .   .   .   .  oh  why stop at anything .  why not build our own chronoscope and tefl the government to go to    he stopped abruptly  shook his head and turned away .    i hope everything will be all right   said mrs .  potterley  feeling helplessly certain that everything would not be  and frightened  in advance  for her husband s professorial status and the security of their old age .   it was she alone  of them all  who had a violent presentiment of trouble .  quite the wrong trouble  of course .   jonas foster was nearly half an hour late in arriving at the potterleys  off campus house .  up to that very evening  he had not quite decided he would go .  then  at the last moment  he found he could not bring himself to commit the social enormity of breaking a dinner appointment an hour before the appointed time .  that  and the nagging of curiosity .   the dinner itself passed interminably .  foster ate without appetite .  mrs .  potterley sat in distant absent mindedness  emerging out of it only once to ask if he were married and to make a deprecating sound at the news that he  was not .  dr .  potterley himself asked neutrally after his professional history and nodded his head primly .   it was as staid  stodgy boring  actually as anything could be .   foster thought  he seems so harmless .   foster had spent the last two days reading up on dr .  potterley .  very casually  of course  almost sneakily .  he wasn t particularly anxious to be seen in the social science library .  to be sure  history was one of those borderline affairs and historical works were frequently read for amusement or edification by the general public .   still  a physicist wasn t quite the  general public .   let foster take to reading histories and he would be considered queer  sure as relativity  and after a while the head of the department would wonder if his new instructor were really  the man for the job .    so he had been cautious .  he sat in the more secluded alcoves and kept his head bent when he slipped in and out at odd hours .   dr .  potterley  it turned out  had written three books and some dozen articles on the ancient mediterranean worlds  and the later articles  all in  historical reviews   had all dealt with pre roman carthage from a sympathetic viewpoint .   that  at least  checked with potterley s story and had soothed foster s suspicions somewhat .   .   .   .  and yet foster felt that it would have been much wiser  much safer  to have scotched the matter at the beginning .   a scientist shouldn t be too curious  he thought in bitter dissatisfaction with himself .  it s a dangerous trait .   after dinner  he was ushered into potterley s study and he was brought up   sharply at the threshold .  the walls were simply lined with books .   not merely films .  there were films  of course  but these were far outnumbered by the books print on paper .  he wouldn t have thought so many books would exist in usable condition .   that bothered foster .  why should anyone want to keep so many books at home .  surely all were available in the university library  or  at the very worst  at the library of congress  if one wished to take the minor trouble of checking out a microfilm .   there was an element of secrecy involved in a home library .  it breathed of intellectual anarchy .  that last thought  oddly  calmed foster .  he would rather potterley be an authentic anarchist than a play acting agent provocateur .   and now the hours began to pass quickly and astonishingly .    you see   potterley said  in a clear  unflurried voice   it was a matter of finding  if possible  anyone who had ever used chronoscopy in his work .  naturally    couldn t ask baldly  since that would be unauthorized research .     yes   said foster dryly .  he was a little surprised such a small consideration would stop the man .    i used indirect methods    he had .  foster was amazed at the volume of correspondence dealing with small disputed points of ancient mediterranean culture which somehow managed to elicit the casual remark over and over again   of course  having never made use of chronoscopy   or   pending approval of my request for chronoscopic data  which appear unlikely at the moment     now these aren t blind questionings   said potterley .   there s a monthly booklet put out by the institute for chronoscopy in which items concerning the past as determined by time viewing are printed .  just one or two items .    what impressed me first was the triviality of most of the items  their insipidity .  why should such researches get priority over my work .  so i wrote to people who would be most likely to do research in the directions described in the booklet .  uniformly  as i have shown you  they did not make use of the chronoscope .  now let s go over it point by point .    at last foster  his head swimming with potterley s meticulously gathered details  asked   but why .     i don t know why   said potterley   but i have a theory .  the original invention of the chronoscope was by sterbinski you see  i know that much  and it was well publicized .  but then the government took over the instrument and decided to suppress further research in the matter or any use of the machine .  but then  people might be curious as to why it wasn t being used .  curiosity is such a vice  dr .  foster .    yes  agreed the physicist to himself .    imagine the effectiveness  then   potterley went on   of pretending that the chronoscope was being used .  it would then be not a mystery  but a commonplace .  it would no longer be a fitting object for legitimate curiosity or an attractive one for illicit curiosity .     you were curious   pointed out foster .   potterley looked a trifle restless .   it was different in my case   he said angrily .   i have something that must be done  and i wouldn t submit to the ridiculous way in which they kept putting me off .    a bit paranoid  too  thought foster gloomily .   yet he had ended up with something  paranoid or not .  foster could no longer deny that something peculiar was going on in the matter of neutrin ics .   but what was potterley after .  that still bothered foster .  if potterley didn t intend this as a test of foster s ethics  what did he want .   foster put it to himself logically .  if an intellectual anarchist with a touch of paranoia wanted to use a chronoscope and was convinced that the pow ers that be were deliberately standing in his way  what would he do .   supposing it were i  he thought .  what would i do .   he said slowly   maybe the chronoscope doesn t exist at all .    potterley started .  there was almost a crack in his general calmness .  for an  instant  foster found himself catching a glimpse of something not at all calm .   but the historian kept his balance and said   oh  no  there must be a chronoscope .     why .  have you seen it .  have i .  maybe that s the explanation of everything .  maybe they re not deliberately holding out on a chronoscope they ve got .  maybe they haven t got it in the first place .     but sterbinski lived .  he built a chronoscope .  that much is a fact .     the books say so   said foster coldly .    now listen .   potterley actually reached over and snatched at foster s jacket sleeve .     need the chronoscope .  i must have it .  don t tell me it doesn t exist .  what we re going to do is find out enough about neutrinics to be able to    potterley drew himself up short .   foster drew his sleeve away .  he needed no ending to that sentence .  he supplied it himself .  he said   build one of our own .    potterley looked sour as though he would rather not have said it point blank .  nevertheless  he said   why not .     because that s out of the question   said foster .   if what i ve read is  correct  then it took sterbinski twenty years to build his machine and several  millions in composite grants .  do you think you and i can duplicate that  illegally .  suppose we had the time  which we haven t  and suppose i could  learn enough out of books  which i doubt  where would we get the money    and equipment .  the chronoscope is supposed to fill a five story building  for    heaven s sake .     then you won t help me .     well  i ll tell you what .  i have one way in which i may be able to find out something     what is that .   asked potterley at once .    never mind .  that s not important .  but i may be able to find out enough to tell you whether the government is deliberately suppressing research by chronoscope .  i may confirm the evidence you already have or i may be able to prove that your evidence is misleading .  i don t know what good it will do you in either case  but it s as far as i can go .  it s my limit .    potterley watched the young man go finally .  he was angry with himself .  why had he allowed himself to grow so careless as to permit the fellow to guess that he was thinking in terms of a chronoscope of his own .  that was premature .   but then why did the young fool have to suppose that a chronoscope might not exist at all .   it had to exist .  it had to .  what was the use of saying it didn t .   and why couldn t a second one be built .  science had advanced in the fifty years since sterbinski .  all that was needed was knowledge .   let the youngster gather knowledge .  let him think a small gathering would be his limit .  having taken the path to anarchy  there would be no limit .  if the boy were not driven onward by something in himself  the first steps would be error enough to force the rest .  potterley was quite certain he would not hesitate to use blackmail .   potterley waved a last good by and looked up .  it was beginning to rain .   certainly .  blackmail if necessary  but he would not be stopped .   foster steered his car across the bleak outskirts of town and scarcely noticed the rain .   he was a fool  he told himself  but he couldn t leave things as they were .  he had to know .  he damned his streak of undisciplined curiosity  but he had to know .   but he would go no further than uncle ralph .  he swore mightily to himself that it would stop there .  in that way  there would be no evidence against him  no real evidence .  uncle ralph would be discreet .   in a way  he was secretly ashamed of uncle ralph .  he hadn t mentioned him to potterley partly out of caution and partly because he did not wish to witness the lifted eyebrow  the inevitable half smile .  professional science writers  however useful  were a little outside the pale  fit only for patronizing contempt .  the fact that  as a class  they made more money than did research scientists only made matters worse  of course .   still  there were times when a science writer in the family could be a convenience .  not being really educated  they did not have to specialize .  consequently  a good science writer knew practically everything .   .   .   .  and uncle ralph was one of the best .   ralph nimmo had no college degree and was rather proud of it .   a degree   he once said to jonas foster  when both were considerably younger   is a first step down a ruinous highway .  you don t want to waste it so you go on to graduate work and doctoral research .  you end up a thoroughgoing ignoramus on everything in the world except for one subdivisional sliver of nothing .    on the other hand  if you guard your mind carefully and keep it blank of any clutter of information till maturity is reached  filling it only with intelligence and training it only in clear thinking  you then have a powerful instrument at your disposal and you can become a science writer .    nimmo received his first assignment at the age of twenty five  after he had completed his apprenticeship and been out in the field for less than three months .  it came in the shape of a clotted manuscript whose language would impart no glimmering of understanding to any reader  however qualified  without careful study and some inspired guesswork .  nimmo took it apart and put it together again  after five long and exasperating interviews  with the authors  who were biophysicists   making the language taut and meaningful and smoothing the style to a pleasant gloss .    why not .   he would say tolerantly to his nephew  who countered his strictures on degrees by berating him with his readiness to hang on the fringes of science .   the fringe is important .  your scientists can t write .  why should they be expected to .  they aren t expected to be grand masters at chess or virtuosos at the violin  so why expect them to know how to put words together .  why not leave that for specialists  too .     good lord  jonas  read your literature of a hundred years ago .  discount the fact that the science is out of date and that some of the expressions are out of date .  just try to read it and make sense out of it .  it s just jaw cracking  amateurish .  pages are published uselessly  whole articles which are either noncomprehensible or both .     but you don t get recognition  uncle ralph   protested young foster  who was getting ready to start his college career and was rather starry eyed    about it .   you could be a terrific researcher .     i get recognition   said nimmo .   don t think for a minute i don t .  sure      a biochemist or a strato meteorologist won t give me the time of day  but they pay me well enough .  just find out what happens when some first class   chemist finds the commission has cut his year s allowance for science writing .  he ll fight harder for enough funds to afford me  or someone like me    than to get a recording ionograph .    he grinned broadly and foster grinned back .  actually  he was proud of his paunchy  round faced  stub fingered uncle  whose vanity made him brush his fringe of hair futilery over the desert on his pate and made him dress like an unmade haystack because such negligence was his trademark .  ashamed  but proud  too .   and now foster entered his uncle s cluttered apartment in no mood at all for grinning .  he was nine years older now and so was uncle ralph .  for nine more years  papers in every branch of science had come to him for polishing and a little of each had crept into his capacious mind .   nimmo was eating seedless grapes  popping them into his mouth one at a time .  he tossed a bunch to foster who caught them by a hair  then bent to retrieve individual grapes that had torn loose and fallen to the floor .    let them be .  don t bother   said nimmo carelessly .   someone comes in here to clean once a week .  what s up .  having trouble with your grant application write up .     i haven t really got into that yet .     you haven t .  get a move on  boy .  are you waiting for me to offer to do the final arrangement .     i couldn t afford you  uncle .     aw  come on .  it s all in the family .  grant me all popular publication rights and no cash need change hands .    foster nodded .   if you re serious  it s a deal .     it s a deal .    it was a gamble  of course  but foster knew enough of nimmo s science writing to realize it could pay off .  some dramatic discovery of public interest on primitive man or on a new surgical technique  or on any branch of spationautics could mean a very cash attracting article in any of the mass media of communication .   it was nimmo  for instance  who had written up  for scientific consumption  the series of papers by bryce and co workers that elucidated the fine structure of two cancer viruses  for which job he asked the picayune payment of fifteen hundred dollars  provided popular publication rights were included .  he then wrote up  exclusively  the same work in semidramatic form for use in trimensional video for a twenty thousand dollar advance plus rental royalties that were still coming in after five years .   foster said bluntly   what do you know about neutrinics  uncle .     neutrinics .   nimmo s small eyes looked surprised .   are you working in that .  i thought it was pseudo gravitic optics .     it is p . g . o .  i just happen to be asking about neutrinics .     that s a devil of a thing to be doing .  you re stepping out of line .  you know that  don t you .     i don t expect you to call the commission because i m a little curious about things .     maybe i should before you get into trouble .  curiosity is an occupational danger with scientists .  i ve watched it work .  one of them will be moving quietly along on a problem  then curiosity leads him up a strange creek .  next thing you know they ve done so little on their proper problem  they can t justify for a project renewal .  i ve seen more     all i want to know   said foster patiently   is what s been passing through your hands lately on neutrinics .    nimmo leaned back  chewing at a grape thoughtfully .   nothing .  nothing ever .  i don t recall ever getting a paper on neutrinics .     what .   foster was openly astonished .   then who does get the work .     now that you ask   said nimmo   i don t know .  don t recall anyone talking about it at the annual conventions .  i don t think much work is being done there .     why not .     hey  there  don t bark .  i m not doing anything .  my guess would be    foster was exasperated .   don t you know .     hmp .  i ll tell you what i know about neutrinics .  it concerns the applications of neutrino movements and the forces involved     sure .  sure .  just as electronics deals with the applications of electron movements and the forces involved  and pseudo gravities deals with the applications of artificial gravitational fields .  i didn t come to you for that .  is that all you know .     and   said nimmo with equanimity   neutrinics is the basis of time viewing and that is all i know .    foster slouched back in his chair and massaged one lean cheek with great intensity .  he felt angrily dissatisfied .  without formulating it explicitly in his own mind  he had felt sure  somehow  that nimmo would come up with some late reports  bring up interesting facets of modern neutrinics  send him back to potterley able to say that the elderly historian was mistaken  that his data was misleading  his deductions mistaken .   then he could have returned to his proper work .   but now  .   .   .   he told himself angrily  so they re not doing much work in the field .  does that make it deliberate suppression .  what if neutrinics is a sterile discipline .  maybe it is .  i don t know .  potterley doesn t .  why waste the intellectual resources of humanity on nothing .  or the work might be secret for some legitimate reason .  it might be  .  .  .   the trouble was  he had to know .  he couldn t leave things as they were now .  he couldn  t .   he said   is there a text on neutrinics  uncle ralph .  i mean a clear and simple one .  an elementary one .    nimmo thought  his plump cheeks puffing out with a series of sighs .   you ask the damnedest questions .  the only one i ever heard of was sterbinski and somebody .  i ve never seen it  but i viewed something about it once .   .   .   .  sterbinski and lamarr  that s it .     is that the sterbinski who invented the chronoscope .   i  i think so .  proves the book ought to be good .       is there a recent edition .  sterbinski died thirty years ago .    nimmo shrugged and said nothing .    can you find out .    they sat in silence for a moment  while nimmo shifted his bulk to the creaking tune of the chair he sat on .  then the science writer said   are you going to tell me what this is all about .     i can t .  will you help me anyway  uncle ralph .  will you get me a copy of the text .     well  you ve taught me all i know on pseudo gravities .  i should be grateful .  tell you what i ll help you on one condition .     which is .    the older man was suddenly very grave .   that you be careful  jonas .  you re obviously way out of line whatever you re doing .  don t blow up your career just because you re curious about something you haven t been assigned to and which is none of your business .  understand .    foster nodded  but he hardly heard .  he was thinking furiously .   a full week later  ralph nimmo eased his rotund figure into jonas foster s on campus two room combination and said  in a hoarse whisper   i ve got something .     what .   foster was immediately eager .    a copy of sterbinski and lamarr .   he produced it  or rather a corner of it  from his ample topcoat .   foster almost automatically eyed door and windows to make sure they were closed and shaded respectively  then held out his hand .   the film case was flaking with age  and when he cracked it the film was faded and growing brittle .  he said sharply   is this all .     gratitude  my boy  gratitude .   nimmo sat down with a grunt  and reached into a pocket for an apple .    oh  i m grateful  but it s so old .     and lucky to get it at that .    tried to get a film run from the congressional library .  no go .  the book was restricted .     then how did you get this .     stole it .   he was biting crunchingly around the core .   new york public .     what .     simple enough .  i had access to the stacks  naturally .  so i stepped over a chained railing when no one was around  dug this up  and walked out with it .  they re very trusting out there .  meanwhile  they won t miss it in years .   .   .   .  only you d better not let anyone see it on you  nephew .    foster stared at the film as though it were literally hot .   nimmo discarded the core and reached for a second apple .   funny thing  now .  there s nothing more recent in the whole field of neutrinics .  not a monograph  not a paper  not a progress note .  nothing since the chrono scope .     uh huh   said foster absently .   foster worked evenings in the potterley home .  he could not trust his own on campus rooms for the purpose .  the evening work grew more real to him than his own grant applications .  sometimes he worried about it but then that stopped  too .   his work consisted  at first  simply in viewing and reviewing the text film .  later it consisted in thinking  sometimes while a section of the book ran itself off through the pocket projector  disregarded  .   sometimes potterley would come down to watch  to sit with prim  eager eyes  as though he expected thought processes to solidify and become visible in all their convolutions .  he interfered in only two ways .  he did not allow foster to smoke and sometimes he talked .   it wasn t conversation talk  never that .  rather it was a low voiced monologue with which  it seemed  he scarcely expected to command attention .  it was much more as though he were relieving a pressure within himself .   carthage .  always carthage .   carthage  the new york of the ancient mediterranean .  carthage  commercial empire and queen of the seas .  carthage  all that syracuse and alexandria pretended to be .  carthage  maligned by her enemies and inarticulate in her own defense .   she had been defeated once by rome and then driven out of sicily and sardinia  but came back to more than recoup her losses by new dominions in spain  and raised up hannibal to give the romans sixteen years of terror .   in the end  she lost again a second time  reconciled herself to fate and built again with broken tools a limping life in shrunken territory  succeeding so well that jealous rome deliberately forced a third war .  and then carthage  with nothing but bare hands and tenacity  built weapons and forced rome into a two year war that ended only with complete destruction of the city  the inhabitants throwing themselves into their flaming houses rather than surrender .    could people fight so for a city and a way of life as bad as the ancient writers painted it .  hannibal was a better general than any roman and his soldiers were absolutely faithful to him .  even his bitterest enemies praised him .  there was a carthaginian .  it is fashionable to say that he was an atypical carthaginian  better than the others  a diamond placed in garbage .  but then why was he so faithful to carthage  even to his death after years of exile .  they talk of moloch    foster didn t always listen but sometimes he couldn t help himself and he shuddered and turned sick at the bloody tale of child sacrifice .   but potterley went on earnestly   just the same  it isn t true .  it s a twenty five hundred year old canard started by the greeks and romans .  they had their own slaves  their crucifixions and torture  their gladiatorial contests .  they weren t holy .  the moloch story is what later ages would have called war propaganda  the big lie .  i can prove it was a lie .  i can prove it and  by heaven  i will i will    he would mumble that promise over and over again in his earnestness .   mrs .  potterley visited him also  but less frequently  usually on tuesdays and thursdays when dr .  potterley himself had an evening course to take care of and was not present .   she would sit quietly  scarcely talking  face slack and doughy  eyes blank  her whole attitude distant and withdrawn .   the first time  foster tried  uneasily  to suggest that she leave .   she said tonelessly   do i disturb you .     no  of course not   lied foster restlessly .   it s just that that   he couldn t complete the sentence .   she nodded  as though accepting an invitation to stay .  then she opened a cloth bag she had brought with her and took out a quire of vitron sheets which she proceeded to weave together by rapid  delicate movements of a  pair of slender  tetra faceted depolarizers  whose battery fed wires made her look as though she were holding a large spider .   one evening  she said softly   my daughter  laurel  is your age .    foster started  as much at the sudden unexpected sound of speech as at the words .  he said     didn t know you had a daughter  mrs .  potterley .     she died .  years ago .    the vitron grew under the deft manipulations into the uneven shape of some garment foster could not yet identify .  there was nothing left for him to do but mutter inanely   i m sorry .    mrs .  potterley sighed .     dream about her often .   she raised her blue  distant eyes to him .   foster winced and looked away .   another evening she asked  pulling at one of the vitron sheets to loosen its gentle clinging to her dress   what is time viewing anyway .    that remark broke into a particularly involved chain of thought  and foster said snappishly   dr .  potterley can explain .     he s tried to .  oh  my  yes .  but i think he s a little impatient with me .  he calls it chronoscopy most of the time .  do you actually see things in the past  like the trimensionals .  or does it just make little dot patterns like the computer you use .    foster stared at his hand computer with distaste .  it worked well enough  but every operation had to be manually controlled and the answers were obtained in code .  now if he could use the school computer  .   .   .  well  why dream  he felt conspicuous enough  as it was  carrying a hand computer under his arm every evening as he left his office .   he said   i ve never seen the chronoscope myself  but i m under the impression that you actually see pictures and hear sound .     you can hear people talk  too .     i think so .   then  half in desperation   look here  mrs .  potterley  this must be awfully dull for you .  i realize you don t like to leave a guest all to himself  but really  mrs .  potterley  you mustn t feel compelled     i don t feel compelled   she said .   i m sitting here  waiting .     waiting .  for what .    she said composedly   i listened to you that first evening .  the time you first spoke to arnold .  i listened at the door .    he said   you did .     i know i shouldn t have  but i was awfully worried about arnold .  i had a notion he was going to do something he oughtn t and i wanted to hear what .  and then when i heard   she paused  bending close over the vitron and peering at it .    heard what  mrs .  potterley .     that you wouldn t build a chronoscope .     well  of course not .     i thought maybe you might change your mind .    f foster glared at her .   do you mean you re coming down here hoping i ll build a chronoscope  waiting for me to build one .   i  i hope you do  dr .  foster .  oh  i hope you do .    it was as though  all at once  a fuzzy veil had fallen off her face  leaving all her features clear and sharp  putting color into her cheeks  life into her eyes  the vibrations of something approaching excitement into her voice .    wouldn t it be wonderful   she whispered   to have one .  people of the past could live again .  pharaohs and kings and just people .  i hope you build one  dr .  foster .  i really hope    she choked  it seemed  on the intensity of her own words and let the vitron sheets slip off her lap .  she rose and ran up the basement stairs  while foster s eyes followed her awkwardly fleeing body with astonishment and distress .   it cut deeper into foster s nights and left him sleepless and painfully stiff with thought .  it was almost a mental indigestion .   his grant requests went limping in  finally  to ralph nimmo .  he scarcely had any hope for them .  he thought numbly  they won t be approved .   if they weren t  of course  it would create a scandal in the department and probably mean his appointment at the university would not be renewed  come the end of the academic year .   he scarcely worried .  it was the neutrino  the neutrino  only the neutrino .  its trail curved and veered sharply and led him breathlessly along uncharted pathways that even sterbinski and lamarr did not follow .   he called nimmo .   uncle ralph  i need a few things .  i m calling from off the campus .    nimmo s face in the video plate was jovial  but his voice was sharp .  he said   what you need is a course in communication .  i m having a hell of a time pulling your application into one intelligible piece .  if that s what you re calling about    foster shook his head impatiently .   that s not what i m calling about .  i need these .   he scribbled quickly on a piece of paper and held it up before the receiver .   nimmo yiped .   hey  how many tricks do you think i can wangle .     you can get them  uncle .  you know you can .    nimmo reread the list of items with silent motions of his plump lips and looked grave .    what happens when you put those things together .   he asked .  foster shook his head .   you ll have exclusive popular publication rights to whatever turns up  the way it s always been .  but please don t ask any questions now .     i can t do miracles  you know .     do this one .  you ve got to .  you re a science writer  not a research man .  you don t have to account for anything .  you ve got friends and connections .   they can look the other way  can t they  to get a break from you next publication time .     your faith  nephew  is touching .  i ll try .    nimmo succeeded .  the material and equipment were brought over late one evening in a private touring car .  nimmo and foster lugged it in with the grunting of men unused to manual labor .   potterley stood at the entrance of the basement after nimmo had left .  he asked softly   what s this for .    foster brushed the hair off his forehead and gently massaged a sprained wrist .  he said     want to conduct a few simple experiments .     really .   the historian s eyes glittered with excitement .   foster felt exploited .  he felt as though he were being led along a dangerous highway by the pull of pinching fingers on his nose  as though he could see the ruin clearly that lay in wait at the end of the path  yet walked eagerly and determinedly .  worst of all  he felt the compelling grip on his nose to be his own .   it was potterley who began it  potterley who stood there now  gloating  but the compulsion was his own .   foster said sourly   i ll be wanting privacy now  potterley .  i can t have you and your wife running down here and annoying me .    he thought  if that offends him  let him kick me out .  let him put an end to this .   in his heart  though  he did not think being evicted would stop anything .   but it did not come to that .  potterley was showing no signs of offense .  his mild gaze was unchanged .  he said   of course  dr .  foster  of course .  all the privacy you wish .    foster watched him go .  he was left still marching along the highway  perversely glad of it and hating himself for being glad .   he took to sleeping over on a cot in potterley s basement and spending his weekends there entirely .   during that period  preliminary word came through that his grants  as doctored by nimmo  had been approved .  the department head brought the word and congratulated him .   foster stared back distantly and mumbled   good .  i m glad   with so little conviction that the other frowned and turned away without another word .   foster gave the matter no further thought .  it was a minor point  worth no notice .  he was planning something that really counted  a climactic test for that evening .   one evening  a second and third and then  haggard and half beside himself with excitement  he called in potterley .   potterley came down the stairs and looked about at the homemade gad   getry .  he said  in his soft voice   the electric bills are quite high .  i don t mind the expense  but the city may ask questions .  can anything be done .    it was a warm evening  but potterley wore a tight collar and a semijacket .  foster  who was in his undershirt  lifted bleary eyes and said shakily   it won t be for much longer  dr .  potterley .  i ve called you down to tell you something .  a chronoscope can be built .  a small one  of course  but it can be built .    potterley seized the railing .  his body sagged .  he managed a whisper .   can it be built here .     here in the basement   said foster wearily .    good lord .  you said     i know what i said   cried foster impatiently .   i said it couldn t be done .  i didn t know anything then .  even sterbinski didn t know anything .    potterley shook his head .   are you sure .  you re not mistaken  dr .  foster .  i couldn t endure it if    foster said   i m not mistaken .  damn it  sir  if just theory had been enough  we could have had a time viewer over a hundred years ago  when the neutrino was first postulated .  the trouble was  the original investigators considered it only a mysterious particle without mass or charge that could not be detected .  it was just something to even up the bookkeeping and save the law of conservation of mass energy .    he wasn t sure potterley knew what he was talking about .  he didn t care .  he needed a breather .  he had to get some of this out of his clotting thoughts .   .   .   .  and he needed background for what he would have to tell potterley next .   he went on .   it was sterbinski who first discovered that the neutrino broke through the space time cross sectional barrier  that it traveled through time as well as through space .  it was sterbinski who first devised a method for stopping neutrinos .  he invented a neutrino recorder and learned how to interpret the pattern of the neutrino stream .  naturally  the stream had been affected and deflected by all the matter it had passed through in its passage through time  and the deflections could be analyzed and converted into the images of the matter that had done the deflecting .  time viewing was possible .  even air vibrations could be detected in this way and converted into sound .    potterley was definitely not listening .  he said   yes .  yes .  but when can you build a chronoscope .    foster said urgently   let me finish .  everything depends on the method used to detect and analyze the neutrino stream .  sterbinski s method was difficult and roundabout .  it required mountains of energy .  but i ve studied pseudo gravities  dr .  potterley  the science of artificial gravitational fields .  i ve specialized in the behavior of light in such fields .  it s a new science .  sterbinski knew nothing of it .  if he had  he would have seen anyone would have a much better and more efficient method of detecting neutrinos  using a pseudo gravitic field .  if i had known more neutrinics to begin with  i would have seen it at once .    potterley brightened a bit .   i knew it   he said .   even if they stop research in neutrinics there is no way the government can be sure that discoveries in other segments of science won t reflect knowledge on neutrinics .  so much for the value of centralized direction of science .    thought this long ago  dr .  foster  before you ever came to work here .       congratulate you on that   said foster   but there s one thing     oh  never mind all this .  answer me .  please .  when can you build a chronoscope .     i m trying to tell you something  dr .  potterley .  a chronoscope won t do you any good .    this is it  foster thought .    slowly  potterley descended the stairs .  he stood facing foster .   what do you mean .  why won t it help me .     you won t see carthage .  it s what i ve got to tell you .  it s what i ve been leading up to .  you can never see carthage .    potterley shook his head slightly .   oh  no  you re wrong .  if you have the chronoscope  just focus it properly     no  dr .  potterley .  it s not a question of focus .  there are random factors affecting the neutrino stream  as they affect all subatomic particles .  what we call the uncertainty principle .  when the stream is recorded and interpreted  the random factor comes out as fuzziness  or  noise  as the communications boys speak of it .  the further back in time you penetrate  the more pronounced the fuzziness  the greater the noise .  after a while  the noise drowns out the picture .  do you understand .     more power   said potterley in a dead kind of voice .    that won t help .  when the noise blurs out detail  magnifying detail magnifies the noise  too .  you can t see anything in a sun bumed film by enlarging it  can you .  get this through your head  now .  the physical nature of the universe sets limits .  the random thermal motions of air molecules set limits to how weak a sound can be detected by any instrument .  the length of a light wave or of an electron wave sets limits to the size of objects that can be seen by any instrument .  it works that way in chronoscopy  too .  you can only time view so far .     how far .  how far .    foster took a deep breath .   a century and a quarter .  that s the most .     but the monthly bulletin the commission puts out deals with ancient history almost entirely .   the historian laughed shakily .   you must be wrong .  the government has data as far back as      b . c .     when did you switch to believing them .   demanded foster  scornfully .   you began this business by proving they were lying  that no historian had made use of the chronoscope .  don t you see why now .  no historian  except one interested in contemporary history  could .  no chronoscope can possibly see back in time further than      under any conditions .       you re wrong .  you don t know everything   said potterley .    the truth won t bend itself to your convenience either .  face it .  the ij vernment s part in this is to perpetuate a hoax .     f why .     i don t know why .    potterley s snubby nose was twitching .  his eyes were bulging .  he pleaded   it s only theory  dr .  foster .  build a chronoscope .  build one and try .    foster caught potterley s shoulders in a sudden  fierce grip .   do you think i haven t .  do you think i would tell you this before i had checked it every way i knew .  i have built one .  it s all around you .  look .    he ran to the switches at the power leads .  he flicked them on  one by one .  he turned a resistor  adjusted other knobs  put out the cellar lights .   wait .  let it warm up .    there was a small glow near the center of one wall .  potterley was gibbering incoherently  but foster only cried again   look .    the light sharpened and brightened  broke up into a light and dark pattern .  men and women .  fuzzy .  features blurred .  arms and legs mere streaks .  an old fashioned ground car  unclear but recognizable as one of the kind that had once used gasoline powered internal combustion engines  sped by .   foster said   mid twentieth century  somewhere .  i can t hook up an audio yet so this is soundless .  eventually  we can add sound .  anyway  mid twentieth is almost as far back as you can go .  believe me  that s the best focusing that can be done .    potterley said   build a larger machine  a stronger one .  improve your circuits .     you can t lick the uncertainty principle  man  any more than you can live on the sun .  there are physical limits to what can be done .     you re lying .  i won t believe you .  i    a new voice sounded  raised shrilly to make itself heard .    arnold .  dr .  foster .      the young physicist turned at once .  dr .  potterley froze for a long moment  then said  without turning   what is it  caroline .  leave us .     no .   mrs .  potterley descended the stairs .   i heard .  i couldn t help hearing .  do you have a time viewer here  dr .  foster .  here in the basement .     yes  i do  mrs .  potterley .  a kind of time viewer .  not a good one .  i can t get sound yet and the picture is darned blurry  but it works .    mrs .  potterley clasped her hands and held them tightly against her breast .   how wonderful .  how wonderful .     it s not at all wonderful   snapped potterley .   the young fool can t reach further back than     now  look   began foster in exasperation .   .   .   .    please .   cried mrs .  potterley .   listen to me .  arnold  don t you see that as long as we can use it for twenty years back  we can see laurel once again .  what do we care about carthage and ancient times .  it s laurel we can see .   she ll be alive for us again .  leave the machine here  dr .  foster .  show us how to work it .    foster stared at her then at her husband .  dr .  potterley s face had gone white .  though his voice stayed low and even  its calmness was somehow gone .  he said   you re a fool .    caroline said weakly   arnold .     you re a fool  i say .  what will you see .  the past .  the dead past .  will laurel do one thing she did not do .  will you see one thing you haven t seen .  will you live three years over and over again  watching a baby who ll never grow up no matter how you watch .    his voice came near to cracking  but held .  he stopped closer to her  seized her shoulder and shook her roughly .   do you know what will happen to you if you do that .  they ll come to take you away because you ll go mad .  yes  mad .  do you want mental treatment .  do you want to be shut up  to undergo the psychic probe .    mrs .  potterley tore away .  there was no trace of softness or vagueness about her .  she had twisted into a virago .   i want to see my child  arnold .  she s in that machine and i want her .     she s not in the machine .  an image is .  can t you understand .  an image .  something that s not real .       want my child .  do you hear me .   she flew at him  screaming  fists beating .     want my child .    the historian retreated at the fury of the assault  crying out .  foster moved to step between  when mrs .  potterley dropped  sobbing wildly  to the floor .   potterley turned  eyes desperately seeking .  with a sudden heave  he snatched at a lando rod  tearing it from its support  and whirling away before foster  numbed by all that was taking place  could move to stop him .    stand back .   gasped potterley   or i ll kill you .  i swear it .    he swung with force  and foster jumped back .   potterley turned with fury on every part of the structure in the cellar  and foster  after the first crash of glass  watched dazedly .   potterley spent his rage and then he was standing quietly amid shards and splinters  with a broken lando rod in his hand .  he said to foster in a whisper   now get out of here .  never come back .  if any of this cost you anything  send me a bill and i ll pay for it .  i ll pay double .    foster shrugged  picked up his shirt and moved up the basement stairs .  he could hear mrs .  potterley sobbing loudly  and  as he turned at the head of the stairs for a last look  he saw dr .  potterley bending over her  his face convulsed with sorrow .   two days later  with the school day drawing to a close  and foster looking wearily about to see if there were any data on his newly approved projects  that he wished to take home  dr .  potterley appeared once more .  he was standing at the open door of foster s office .   the historian was neatly dressed as ever .  he lifted his hand in a gesture that was too vague to be a greeting  too abortive to be a plea .  foster stared stonily .   potterley said   i waited till five  till you were  .   .   .  may i come in .    foster nodded .   potterley said   i suppose i ought to apologize for my behavior .  i was dreadfully disappointed  not quite master of myself .  still  it was inexcusable .     i accept your apology   said foster .   is that all .        my wife called you  i think .    .     yes  she has .       she has been quite hysterical .  she told me she had but i couldn t be quite sure     could you tell me would you be so kind as to tell me what she wanted .     she wanted a chronoscope .  she said she had some money of her own .  she was willing to pay .    .  .  .   did you make any commitments .     i said i wasn t in the manufacturing business .       good   breathed potterley  his chest expanding with a sigh of relief .    please don t take any calls from her .  she s not quite     .    .     look  dr .  potterfey   said foster   i m not getting into any domestic quarrels  but you d better be prepared for something .  chronoscopes can be built by anybody given a few simple parts that can be bought through some etherics sales center  it can be built in the home workshop .  the video part  anyway .    .   but no one else will think of it beside you  will they .  no one has .     i don t intend to keep it secret .       but you can t publish .  it s illegal research .     that doesn t matter any more  dr .  potterley .  if i lose my grants  i lose them .  if the university is displeased  i ll resign .  it just doesn t matter .      but you can t do that .     till now   said foster   you didn t mind my risking loss of grants and position .  why do you turn so tender about it now .  now let me explain something to you .  when you first came to me  i believed in organized and directed research  the situation as it existed  in other words .  i considered you an intellectual anarchist  dr .  potterley  and dangerous .  but  for one reason or another  i ve been an anarchist myself for months now and i have achieved great things .    those things have been achieved not because i am a brilliant scientist .  not at all .  it was just that scientific research had been directed from above and holes were left that could be filled in by anyone who looked in the right  direction .  and anyone might have if the government hadn t actively tried to prevent it .    now understand me .  i still believe directed research can be useful .  i m not in favor of a retreat to total anarchy .  but there must be a middle ground .  directed research can retain flexibility .  a scientist must be allowed to follow his curiosity  at least in his spare time .    potterley sat down .  he said ingratiatingly   let s discuss this  foster .  i appreciate your idealism .  you re young .  you want the moon .  but you can t destroy yourself through fancy notions of what research must consist of .  i got you into this .  i am responsible and i blame myself bitterly .  i was acting emotionally .  my interest in carthage blinded me and i was a damned fool .    foster broke in .   you mean you ve changed completely in two days .  carthage is nothing .  government suppression of research is nothing .     even a damned fool like myself can leam  foster .  my wife taught me something .  i understand the reason for government suppression of neutrin ics now .  i didn t two days ago .  and  understanding  i approve .  you saw the way my wife reacted to the news of a chronoscope in the basement .  i had envisioned a chronoscope used for research purposes .  all she could see was the personal pleasure of returning neurotically to a personal past  a dead past .  the pure researcher  foster  is in the minority .  people like my wife would outweigh us .    for the government to encourage chronoscopy would have meant that everyone s past would be visible .  the government officers would be subjected to blackmail and improper pressure  since who on earth has a past that is absolutely clean .  organized government might become impossible .    foster licked his lips .   maybe .  maybe the government has some justification in its own eyes .  still  there s an important principle involved here .  who knows what other scientific advances are being stymied because scientists are being stifled into walking a narrow path .  if the chronoscope becomes the terror of a few politicians  it s a price that must be paid .  the public must realize that science must be free and there is no more dramatic way of doing it than to publish my discovery  one way or another  legally or illegally .    potterley s brow was damp with perspiration  but his voice remained even .   oh  not just a few politicians  dr .  foster .  don t think that .  it would be my terror  too .  my wife would spend her time living with our dead daughter .  she would retreat further from reality .  she would go mad living the same scenes over and over .  and not just my terror .  there would be others like her .  children searching for their dead parents or their own youth .  we ll have a whole world living in the past .  midsummer madness .    foster said   moral judgments can t stand in the way .  there isn t one advance at any time in history that mankind hasn t had the ingenuity to pervert .  mankind must also have the ingenuity to prevent .  as for the chronoscope  your delvers into the dead past will get tired soon enough .  they ll catch their loved parents in some of the things their loved parents did and  they ll lose their enthusiasm for it all .  but all this is trivial .  with me  it s a matter of important principle .    potterley said   hang your principle .  can t you understand men and women as well as principle .  don t you understand that my wife will live through the fire that killed our baby .  she won t be able to help herself .  i know her .  she ll follow through each step  trying to prevent it .  she ll live it over and over again  hoping each time that it won t happen .  how many times do you want to kill laurel .   a huskiness had crept into his voice .   a thought crossed foster s mind .   what are you really afraid she ll find out  dr .  potterley .  what happened the night of the fire .    the historian s hands went up quickly to cover his face and they shook with his dry sobs .  foster turned away and stared uncomfortably out the window .   potterley said after a while   it s a long time since i ve had to think of it .  caroline was away .  i was baby sitting .  i went into the baby s bedroom midevening to see if she had kicked off the bedclothes .  i had my cigarette with me  .  .  .  i smoked in those days .  i must have stubbed it out before putting it in the ashtray on the chest of drawers .  i was always careful .  the baby was all right .  i returned to the living room and fell asleep before the video .  i awoke  choking  surrounded by fire .  i don t know how it started .     but you think it may have been the cigarette  is that it .   said foster .   a cigarette which  for once  you forgot to stub out .     i don t know .  i tried to save her  but she was dead in my arms when i got out .     you never told your wife about the cigarette  i suppose .    potterley shook his head .   but i ve lived with it .     only now  with a chronoscope  she ll find out .  maybe it wasn t the cigarette .  maybe you did stub it out .  isn t that possible .    the scant tears had dried on potterley s face .  the redness had subsided .  he said   i can t take the chance .   .   .   .  but it s not just myself  foster .  the past has its terrors for most people .  don t loose those terrors on the human race .    foster paced the floor .  somehow  this explained the reason for potterley s rabid  irrational desire to boost the carthaginians  deify them  most of all disprove the story of their fiery sacrifices to moloch .  by freeing them of the guilt of infanticide by fire  he symbolically freed himself of the same guilt .   so the same fire that had driven him on to causing the construction of a chronoscope was now driving him on to the destruction .   foster looked sadly at the older man .   i see your position  dr .  potterley  but this goes above personal feelings .  i ve got to smash this throttling hold on the throat of science .    potterley said  savagely   you mean you want the fame and wealth that goes with such a discovery .     i don t know about the wealth  but that  too  i suppose .  i m no more than human .     you won t suppress your knowledge .     not under any circumstances .     well  then   and the historian got to his feet and stood for a moment  glaring .   foster had an odd moment of terror .  the man was older than he  smaller  feebler  and he didn t look armed .  still  .   .   .   foster said   if you re thinking of killing me or anything insane like that  i ve got the information in a safety deposit vault where the proper people will find it in case of my disappearance or death .    potterley said   don t be a fool   and stalked out .   foster closed the door  locked it and sat down to think .  he felt silly .  he had no information in any safety deposit vault  of course .  such a melodramatic action would not have occurred to him ordinarily .  but now it had .   feeling even sillier  he spent an hour writing out the equations of the application of pseudo gravitic optics to neutrinic recording  and some diagrams for the engineering details of construction .  he sealed it in an envelope and scrawled ralph nimmo s name over the outside .   he spent a rather restless night and the next morning  on the way to school  dropped the envelope off at the bank  with appropriate instructions to an official  who made him sign a paper permitting the box to be opened after his death .   he called nimmo to tell him of the existence of the envelope  refusing querulously to say anything about its contents .   he had never felt so ridiculously self conscious as at that moment .   that night and the next  foster spent in only fitful sleep  finding himself face to face with the highly practical problem of the publication of data unethically obtained .   the proceedings of the society for pseudo gravities  which was the journal with which he was best acquainted  would certainly not touch any paper that did not include the magic footnote   the work described in this paper was made possible by grant no .  so and so from the commission of research of the united nations .    nor  doubly so  would the journal of physics .   there were always the minor journals who might overlook the nature of the article for the sake of the sensation  but that would require a little financial negotiation on which he hesitated to embark .  it might  on the whole  be better to pay the cost of publishing a small pamphlet for general distribution among scholars .  in that case  he would even be able to dispense with the services of a science writer  sacrificing polish for speed .  he would have to find a reliable printer .  uncle ralph might know one .   he walked down the corridor to his office and wondered anxiously if  perhaps he ought to waste no further time  give himself no further chance to lapse into indecision and take the risk of calling ralph from his office phone .  he was so absorbed in his own heavy thoughts that he did not notice that his room was occupied until he turned from the clothes closet and approached his desk .   dr .  potterley was there and a man whom foster did not recognize .   foster stared at them .   what s this .    potterley said   i m sorry  but i had to stop you .       foster continued staring .   what are you talking about .      the stranger said   let me introduce myself .   he had large teeth  a little uneven  and they showed prominently when he smiled .   i am thaddeus araman  department head of the division of chronoscopy .  i am here to see you concerning information brought to me by professor arnold potterley and confirmed by our own sources    potterley said breathlessly   i took all the blame  dr .  foster .  i explained that it was i who persuaded you against your will into unethical practices .  i have offered to accept full responsibility and punishment .  i don t wish you harmed in any way .  it s just that chronoscopy must not be permitted .    araman nodded .   he has taken the blame as he says  dr .  foster  but this thing is out of his hands now .    foster said   so .  what are you going to do .  blackball me from all consideration for research grants .       that is in my power   said araman .    order the university to discharge rne .     that  too  is in my power .     all right  go ahead .  consider it done .  i ll leave my office now  with you .  i can send for my books later .  if you insist  i ll leave my books .  is that all .     not quite   said araman .   you must engage to do no further research in chronoscopy  to publish none of your findings in chronoscopy and  of course  to build no chronoscope .  you will remain under surveillance indefinitely to make sure you keep that promise .     supposing i refuse to promise .  what can you do .  doing research out of my field may be unethical  but it isn t a criminal offense .     in the case of chronoscopy  my young friend   said araman patiently    it is a criminal offense .  if necessary  you will be put in jail and kept there .     why .   shouted foster .   what s magic about chronoscopy .    araman said   that s the way it is .  we cannot allow further developments in the field .  my own job is  primarily  to make sure of that  and i intend to do my job .  unfortunately  i had no knowledge  nor did anyone in the department  that the optics of pseudo gravity fields had such immediate application to chronoscopy .  score one for general ignorance  but henceforward research will be steered properly in that respect  too .    foster said   that won t help .  something else may apply that neither you  nor i dream of .  all science hangs together .  it s one piece .  if you want to stop one part  you ve got to stop it all .     no doubt that is true   said araman   in theory .  on the practical side  however  we have managed quite well to hold chronoscopy down to the original sterbinski level for fifty years .  having caught you in time  dr .  foster  we hope to continue doing so indefinitely .  and we wouldn t have come this close to disaster  either  if i had accepted dr .  potterley at something more than face value .    he turned toward the historian and lifted his eyebrows in a kind of humorous self deprecation .   i m afraid  sir  that i dismissed you as a history professor and no more on the occasion of our first interview .  had i done my job properly and checked on you  this would not have happened .    foster said abruptly   is anyone allowed to use the government chrono scope .     no one outside our division under any pretext .  i say that since it is obvious to me that you have already guessed as much .  i warn you  though  that any repetition of that fact will be a criminal  not an ethical  offense .     and your chronoscope doesn t go back more than a hundred twenty five years or so  does it .     it doesn t .     then your bulletin with its stories of time viewing ancient times is a hoax .    araman said coolly   with the knowledge you now have  it is obvious you know that for a certainty .  however  i confirm your remark .  the monthly bulletin is a hoax .     in that case   said foster   i will not promise to suppress my knowledge of chronoscopy .  if you wish to arrest me  go ahead .  my defense at the trial will be enough to destroy the vicious card house of directed research and bring it tumbling down .  directing research is one thing  suppressing it and depriving mankind of its benefits is quite another .    araman said   oh  let s get something straight  dr .  foster .  if you do not co operate  you will go to jail directly .  you will not see a lawyer  you will not be charged  you will not have a trial .  you will simply stay in jail .     oh  no   said foster   you re bluffing .  this is not the twentieth century  you know .    there was a stir outside the office  the clatter of feet  a high pitched shout that foster was sure he recognized .  the door crashed open  the lock splintering  and three intertwined figures stumbled in .   as they did so  one of the men raised a blaster and brought its butt down hard on the skull of another .   there was a whoosh of expiring air  and the one whose head was struck went limp .    uncle ralph .   cried foster .   araman frowned .   put him down in that chair   he ordered   and get some water .    ralph nimmo  rubbing his head with a gingerly sort of disgust  said   there was no need to get rough  araman .    araman said   the guard should have been rough sooner and kept you out of here  nimrno .  you d have been better off .     you know each other .   asked foster .    i ve had dealings with the man   said nimmo  still rubbing .   if he s here in your office  nephew  you re in trouble .     and you  too   said araman angrily .   i know dr .  foster consulted you on neutrinics literature .    nimmo corrugated his forehead  then straightened it with a wince as though the action had brought pain .   so .   he said .   what else do you know about me .     we will know everything about you soon enough .  meanwhile  that one item is enough to implicate you .  what are you doing here .     my dear dr .  araman   said nimmo  some of his jauntiness restored   day before yesterday  my jackass of a nephew called me .  he had placed some mysterious information     don t tell him .  don t say anything .   cried foster .   araman gknced at him coldly .   we know all about it  dr .  foster .  the safety deposit box has been opened and its contents removed .     but how can you know   foster s voice died away in a kind of furious frustration .    anyway   said nimmo   i decided the net must be closing around him and  after i took care of a few items  i came down to tell him to get off this thing he s doing .  it s not worth his career .     does that mean you know what he s doing .   asked araman .    he never told me   said nimmo   but i m a science writer with a hell of a lot of experience .  i know which side of an atom is electronified .  the boy  foster  specializes in pseudo gravitic optics and coached me on the stuff himself .  he got me to get him a textbook on neutrinics and i kind of ship viewed it myself before handing it over .  i can put the two together .  he asked me to get him certain pieces of physical equipment  and that was evidence  too .  stop me if i m wrong  but my nephew has built a semipor table  low power chronoscope .  yes  or yes .     yes .   araman reached thoughtfully for a cigarette and paid no attention to dr .  potterley  watching silently  as though all were a dream  who shied away  gasping  from the white cylinder .   another mistake for me .  i ought to resign .  i should have put tabs on you  too  nimmo  instead of concentrating too hard on potterley and foster .  i didn t have much time of course and you ve ended up safely here  but that doesn t excuse me .  you re under arrest  nimmo .           what for .   demanded the science writer .    unauthorized research .     i wasn t doing any .  i can t  not being a registered scientist .  and even if i did  it s not a criminal offense .    foster said savagely   no use  uncle ralph .  this bureaucrat is making his own laws .     like what .   demanded nimmo .    like life imprisonment without trial .     nuts   said nimmo .   this isn t the twentieth cen     i tried that   said foster .   it doesn t bother him .     well  nuts   shouted nimmo .   look here  araman .  my nephew and i have relatives who haven t lost touch with us  you know .  the professor has some also  i imagine .  you can t just make us disappear .  there ll be questions and a scandal .  this isn  t the twentieth century .  so if you re trying to scare us  it isn t working .    the cigarette snapped between araman s fingers and he tossed it away violently .  he said   damn it  i don t know what to do .  it s never been like this before .   .   .   .  look .  you three fools know nothing of what you re trying to do .  you understand nothing .  will you listen to me .     oh  we ll listen   said nimmo grimly .    foster sat silently  eyes angry  lips compressed .  potterley s hands writhed like two intertwined snakes .    araman said   the past to you is the dead past .  if any of you have discussed the matter  it s dollars to nickels you ve used that phrase .  the dead past .  if you knew how many times i ve heard those three words  you d choke on them  too .    when people think of the past  they think of it as dead  far away and gone  long ago .  we encourage them to think so .  when we report time viewing  we always talk of views centuries in the past  even though you gentlemen know seeing more than a century or so is impossible .  people accept it .  the past means greece  rome  carthage  egypt  the stone age .  the deader the better .    now you three know a century or a little more is the limit  so what does the past mean to you .  your youth .  your first girl .  your dead mother .  twenty years ago .  thirty years ago .  fifty years ago .  the deader the better .   .   .   .  but when does the past really begin .    he paused in anger .  the others stared at him and nimmo stirred uneas   ily .    well   said araman   when did it begin .  a year ago .  five minutes ago .  one second ago .  isn t it obvious that the past begins an instant ago .  the dead past is just another name for the living present .  what if you focus the chronoscope in the past of one hundredth of a second ago .  aren t you watching the present .  does it begin to sink in .    nimmo said   damnation .     damnation   mimicked araman .   after potterley came to me with his  story night before last  how do you suppose i checked up on both of you .  i did it with the chronoscope  spotting key moments to the very instant of the present .     and that s how you knew about the safety deposit box .   said foster .    and every other important fact .  now what do you suppose would happen if we let news of a home chronoscope get out .  people might start out by watching their youth  their parents and so on  but it wouldn t be long before they d catch on to the possibilities .  the housewife will forget her poor  dead mother and take to watching her neighbor at home and her husband at the office .  the businessman will watch his competitor  the employer his employee .    there will be no such thing as privacy .  the party line  the prying eye behind the curtain will be nothing compared to it .  the video stars will be closely watched at all times by everyone .  every man his own peeping tom and there ll be no getting away from the watcher .  even darkness will be no escape because chronoscopy can be adjusted to the infrared and human figures can be seen by their own body heat .  the figures will be fuzzy  of course  and the surroundings will be dark  but that will make the titillation of it all the greater  perhaps .   .   .   .  hmp  the men in charge of the machine now experiment sometimes in spite of the regulations against it .    nimmo seemed sick .   you can always forbid private manufacture    araman turned on him fiercely .   you can  but do you expect it to do good .  can you legislate successfully against drinking  smoking  adultery or gossiping over the back fence .  and this mixture of nosiness and prurience will have a worse grip on humanity than any of those .  good lord  in a thousand years of trying we haven t even been able to wipe out the heroin traffic and you talk about legislating against a device for watching anyone you please at any time you please that can be built in a home workshop .    foster said suddenly   i won t publish .    potterley burst out  half in sobs   none of us will talk .  i regret    nimmo broke in .   you said you didn t tab me on the chronoscope  araman .     no time   said araman wearily .   things don t move any faster on the chronoscope than in real life .  you can t speed it up like the film in a book viewer .  we spent a full twenty four hours trying to catch the important moments during the last six months of potterley and foster .  there was no time for anything else and it was enough .     it wasn t   said nimmo .    what are you talking about .   there was a sudden infinite alarm on araman s face .    i told you my nephew  jonas  had called me to say he had put important information in a safety deposit box .  he acted as though he were in trouble .  he s my nephew .  i had to try to get him off the spot .  it took a while  then i  came here to tell him what i had done .  i told you when i got here  just after your man conked me that i had taken care of a few items .     what .  for heaven s sake     just this  i sent the details of the portable chronoscope off to half a dozen of my regular publicity outlets .    not a word .  not a sound .  not a breath .  they were all past any demonstration .    don t stare like that   cried nimmo .   don t you see my point .  i had popular publication rights .  jonas will admit that .  i knew he couldn t publish scientifically in any legal way .  i was sure he was planning to publish illegally and was preparing the safety deposit box for that reason  i thought if i put through the details prematurely  all the responsibility would be mine .  his career would be saved .  and if   were deprived of my science writing license as a result  my exclusive possession of the chronometric data would set me up for life .  jonas would be angry  i expected that  but i could explain the motive and we would split the take fifty fifty .   .   .  don t stare at me like that .  how did i know     nobody knew anything   said araman bitterly   but you all just took it for granted that the government was stupidly bureaucratic  vicious  tyrannical  given to suppressing research for the hell of it .  it never occurred to any of you that we were trying to protect mankind as best we could .     don t sit there talking   wailed potterley .   get the names of the people who were told     too late   said nimmo  shrugging .   they ve had better than a day .  there s been time for the word to spread .  my outfits will have called any number of physicists to check my data before going on with it and they ll call one another to pass on the news .  once scientists put neutrinics and pseudo gravities together  home chronoscopy becomes obvious .  before the week is out  five hundred people will know how to build a small chronoscope and how will you catch them all .   his plum cheeks sagged .   i suppose there s no way of putting the mushroom cloud back into that nice  shiny uranium sphere .    araman stood up .   we ll try  potterley  but i agree with nimmo .  it s too late .  what kind of a world we ll have from now on  i don t know  i can t tell  but the world we know has been destroyed completely .  until now  every custom  every habit  every tiniest way of life has always taken a certain amount of privacy for granted  but that s all gone now .    he saluted each of the three with elaborate formality .    you have created a new world among the three of you .  i congratulate you .  happy goldfish bowl to you  to me  to everyone  and may each of you fry in hell forever .  arrest

own drugged  unhealthy coma .   he had finally managed to fall asleep an hour earlier but even then it was more like exhaustion than sleep .    she was at his bedside now  shaking him .   daddy  daddy  wake up .  wake up .    he suppressed a groan .   all right  linda .     but  daddy  there s more policemen around than any time .  police cars and everything .    norman muller gave up and rose wearily to his elbows .  the day was beginning .  it was faintly stirring toward dawn outside  the germ of a miserable gray that looked about as miserably gray as he felt .  he could hear sarah  his wife  shuffling about breakfast duties in the kitchen .  his father in law  matthew  was hawking strenuously in the bathroom .  no doubt agent handley was ready and waiting for him .   this was the day .   election day .   to begin with  it had been like every other year .  maybe a little worse  because it was a presidential year  but no worse than other presidential years if it came to that .   the politicians spoke about the guh reat electorate and the vast electuh   copyright         by quinn publishing co .   inc .   ronic intelligence that was its servant .  the press analyzed the situation with industrial computers  the new york times and the st .  louis post dispatch had their own computers  and were full of little hints as to what would be forthcoming .  commentators and columnists pinpointed the crucial state and county in happy contradiction to one another .   the first hint that it would not be like every other year was when sarah muller said to her husband on the evening of october    with election day exactly a month off    cantwell johnson says that indiana will be the state this year .  he s the fourth one .  just think  our state this time .    matthew hortenweiler took his fleshy face from behind the paper  stared dourly at his daughter and growled   those fellows are paid to tell lies .  don t listen to them .     four of them  father   said sarah mildly .   they all say indiana .     indiana is a key state  matthew   said norman  just as mildly   on account of the hawkins smith act and this mess in indianapolis .  it    matthew twisted his old face akrmingly and rasped out   no one says bloomington or monroe county  do they .     well   said norman .   linda  whose little pointed chinned face had been shifting from one speaker to the next  said pipingly   you going to be voting this year  daddy .    norman smiled gently and said   i don t think so  dear .    but this was in the gradually growing excitement of an october in a presidential election year and sarah had led a quiet life with dreams for her companions .  she said longingly   wouldn t that be wonderful  though .     if i voted .   norman muller had a small blond mustache that had given him a debonair quality in the young sarah s eyes  but which  with gradual graying  had declined merely to lack of distinction .  his forehead bore deepening lines born of uncertainty and  in general  he had never seduced his clerkly soul with the thought that he was either born great or would under any circumstances achieve greatness .  he had a wife  a job and a little girl  and except under extraordinary conditions of elation or depression was inclined to consider that to be an adequate bargain struck with life .   so he was a little embarrassed and more than a little uneasy at the direction his wife s thoughts were taking .   actually  my dear   he said   there are two hundred million people in the country  and  with odds like that  i don t think we ought to waste our time wondering about it .    his wife said   why  norman  it s no such thing like two hundred million and you know it .  in the first place  only people between twenty and sixty are eligible and it s always men  so that puts it down to maybe fifty million to one .  then  if it s really indiana     then it s about one and a quarter million to one .  you wouldn t want me to bet in a horse race against those odds  now  would you .  let s have supper .    i matthew muttered from behind his newspaper   damned foolishness .    linda asked again   you going to be voting this year  daddy .   jj  norman shook his head and they all adjourned to the dining room .   by october     sarah s excitement was rising rapidly .  over the coffee  she announced that mrs .  schultz  having a cousin who was the secretary of an assemblyman  said that all the  smart money  was on indiana .    she says president villers is even going to make a speech at indianapolis .    norman muller  who had had a hard day at the store  nudged the statement with a raising of eyebrows and let it go at that .   matthew hortenweiler  who was chronically dissatisfied with washington  said   if villers makes a speech in indiana  that means he thinks mul tivac will pick arizona .  he wouldn t have the guts to go closer  the mush head .    sarah  who ignored her father whenever she could decently do so  said   i don t know why they don t announce the state as soon as they can  and then the county and so on .  then the people who were eliminated could relax .     if they did anything like that   pointed out norman   the politicians would follow the announcements like vultures .  by the time it was narrowed down to a township  you d have a congressman or two at every street corner .    matthew narrowed his eyes and brushed angrily at his sparse  gray hair .   they re vultures  anyhow .  listen    sarah murmured   now  father    matthew s voice rumbled over her protest without as much as a stumble or hitch .   listen  i was around when they set up multivac .  it would end partisan politics  they said .  no more voters  money wasted on campaigns .  no more grinning nobodies high pressured and advertising campaigned into congress or the white house .  so what happens .  more campaigning than ever  only now they do it blind .  they ll send guys to indiana on account of the hawkins smith act and other guys to california in case it s the joe hammer situation that turns out crucial .  i say  wipe out all that nonsense .  back to the good old    linda asked suddenly   don t you want daddy to vote this year  grandpa .    matthew glared at the young girl .   never you mind  now .   he turned back to norman and sarah .   there was a time i voted .  marched right up to the polling booth  stuck my fist on the levers and voted .  there was nothing to it .  i just said  this fellow s my man and i m voting for him .  that s the way it should be .    linda said excitedly   you voted  grandpa .  you really did .    sarah leaned forward quickly to quiet what might easily become an incongruous story drifting about the neighborhood   it s nothing  linda .  grandpa  doesn t really mean voted .  everyone did that kind of voting  your grandpa  too  but it wasn t really voting .    matthew roared   it wasn t when i was a little boy .  i was twenty two and i voted for langley and it was real voting .  my vote didn t count for much  maybe  but it was as good as anyone else s .  anyone else s .  and no multivac to    norman interposed   all right  linda  time for bed .  and stop asking questions about voting .  when you grow up  you ll understand all about it .    he kissed her with antiseptic gentleness and she moved reluctantly out of range under maternal prodding and a promise that she might watch the bedside video till       if she was prompt about the bathing ritual .   linda said   grandpa   and stood with her chin down and her hands behind her back until his newspaper lowered itself to the point where shaggy eyebrows and eyes  nested in fine wrinkles  showed themselves .  it was friday  october    .   he said   yes .    linda came closer and put both her forearms on one of the old man s knees so that he had to discard his newspaper altogether .   she said   grandpa  did you really once vote .    he said   you heard me say i did  didn t you .  do you think i tell fibs .     n no  but mamma says everybody voted then .     so they did .     but how could they .  how could everybody vote .    matthew stared at her solemnly  then lifted her and put her on his knee .   he even moderated the tonal qualities of his voice .  he said   you see  linda  till about forty years ago  everybody always voted .  say we wanted to decide who was to be the new president of the united states .  the democrats and republicans would both nominate someone  and everybody would say who they wanted .  when election day was over  they would count how many people wanted the democrat and how many wanted the republican .  whoever had more votes was elected .  you see .    linda nodded and said   how did all the people know who to vote for .  did multivac tell them .    matthew s eyebrows hunched down and he looked severe .   they just used their own judgment  girl .    she edged away from him  and he lowered his voice again   i m not angry at you  linda .  but  you see  sometimes it took all night to count what everyone said and people were impatient .  so they invented special machines which could look at the first few votes and compare them with the votes from the same places in previous years .  that way the machine could compute how the total vote would be and who would be elected .  you see .    she nodded .   like multivac .     the first computers were much smaller than multivac .  but the machines grew bigger and they could tell how the election would go from fewer  and fewer votes .  then  at last  they built multivac and it can tell from just i one voter .     fj linda smiled at having reached a familiar part of the story and said     that s nice .    matthew frowned and said   no  it s not nice .  i don t want a machine  telling me how i would have voted just because some joker in milwaukee  says he s against higher tariffs .  maybe i want to vote cockeyed just for the    i pleasure of it .  maybe i don t want to vote .  maybe      but linda had wriggled from his knee and was beating a retreat .   she met her mother at the door .  her mother  who was still wearing her coat and had not even had time to remove her hat  said breathlessly   run   along  linda .  don t get in mother s way .    then she said to matthew  as she lifted her hat from her head and patted her hair back into place   i ve been at agatha s .    matthew stared at her censoriously and did not even dignify that piece of information with a grunt as he groped for his newspaper .  sarah said  as she unbuttoned her coat   guess what she said .       .  matthew flattened out his newspaper for reading purposes with a sharp     crackle and said   don t much care .    sarah said   now  father   but she had no time for anger .  the news i had to be told and matthew was the only recipient handy  so she went on    agatha s joe is a policeman  you know  and he says a whole truckload of  secret service men came into bloomington last night .        they re not after me .     don t you see  father .  secret service agents  and it s almost election  time .  in bloomington .     maybe they re after a bank robber .     there hasn t been a bank robbery in town in ages .   .   .   .  father  you re hopeless .    she stalked away .   nor did norman muller receive the news with noticeably greater excitement .    now  sarah  how did agatha s joe know they were secret service agents .   he asked calmly .   they wouldn t go around with identification cards pasted on their foreheads .    but by next evening  with november a day old  she could say triumphantly   it s just everyone in bloomington that s waiting for someone local to be the voter .  the bloomington news as much as said so on video .    norman stirred uneasily .  he couldn t deny it  and his heart was sinking .  if bloomington was really to be hit by multivac s lightning  it would mean newspapermen  video shows  tourists  all sorts of strange upsets .  norman liked the quiet routine of his life  and the distant stir of politics was getting uncomfortably close .   he said   it s all rumor .  nothing more .     you wait and see  then .  you just wait and see .    as things turned out  there was very little time to wait  for the doorbell rang insistently  and when norman muller opened it and said   yes .   a tall  grave faced man said   are you norman muller .    norman said   yes   again  but in a strange dying voice .  it was not difficult to see from the stranger s bearing that he was one carrying authority  and the nature of his errand suddenly became as inevitably obvious as it had  until the moment before  been unthinkably impossible .   the man presented credentials  stepped into the house  closed the door behind him and said ritualistically   mr .  norman muller  it is necessary for me to inform you on the behalf of the president of the united states that you have been chosen to represent the american electorate on tuesday  november         .    norman muller managed  with difficulty  to walk unaided to his chair .  he sat there  white faced and almost insensible  while sarah brought water  slapped his hands in panic and moaned to her husband between clenched teeth   don t be sick  norman .  don t be sick .  they ll pick someone else .    when norman could manage to talk  he whispered   i m sorry  sir .    the secret service agent had removed his coat  unbuttoned his jacket and was sitting at ease on the couch .    it s all right   he said  and the mark of officialdom seemed to have vanished with the formal announcement and leave him simply a large and rather friendly man .   this is the sixth time i ve made the announcement and i ve seen all kinds of reactions .  not one of them was the kind you see on the video .  you know what i mean .  a holy  dedicated look  and a character who says   it will be a great privilege to serve my country .   that sort of stuff .   the agent laughed comfortingly .   sarah s accompanying laugh held a trace of shrill hysteria .   the agent said   now you re going to have me with you for a while .  my name is phil handley .  i d appreciate it if you call me phil .  mr .  muller can t leave the house any more till election day .  you ll have to inform the department store that he s sick  mrs .  muller .  you can go about your business for a while  but you ll have to agree not to say a word about this .  right  mrs .  muller .    sarah nodded vigorously .   no  sir .  not a word .     all right .  but  mrs .  muller   handley looked grave   we re not kidding now .  go out only if you must and you ll be followed when you do .  i m sorry but that s the way we must operate .     followed .     it won t be obvious .  don t worry .  and it s only for two days till the formal announcement to the nation is made .  your daughter     she s in bed   said sarah hastily .    good .  she ll have to be told i m a relative or friend staying with the family .  if she does find out the truth  she ll have to be kept in the house .  your father had better stay in the house in any case .     he won t like that   said sarah .    can t be helped .  now  since you have no others living with you     you know all about us apparently   whispered norman .    quite a bit   agreed handley .   in any case  those are all my instructions to you for the moment .  i ll try to cooperate as much as i can and be as little of a nuisance as possible .  the government will pay for my maintenance so i won t be an expense to you .  i ll be relieved each night by someone who will sit up in this room  so there will be no problem about sleeping accommodations .  now  mr .  muller     sir .     you can call me phil   said the agent again .   the purpose of the two day preliminary before formal announcement is to get you used to your position .  we prefer to have you face multivac in as normal a state of mind as possible .  just relax and try to feel this is all in a day s work .  okay .     okay   said norman  and then shook his head violently .   but i don t want the responsibility .  why me .     all right   said handley   let s get that straight to begin with .  murtivac weighs all sorts of known factors  billions of them .  one factor isn t known  though  and won t be known for a long time .  that s the reaction pattern of the human mind .  all americans are subjected to the molding pressure of what other americans do and say  to the things that are done to him and the things he does to others .  any american can be brought to multivac to have the bent of his mind surveyed .  from that the bent of all other minds in the country can be estimated .  some americans are better for the purpose than others at some given time  depending upon the happenings of that year .  multivac picked you as most representative this year .  not the smartest  or the strongest  or the luckiest  but just the most representative .  now we don t question multivac  do we .     couldn t it make a mistake .   asked norman .   sarah  who listened impatiently  interrupted to say   don t listen to him  sir .  he s just nervous  you know .  actually  he s very well read and he always follows politics very closely .    handley said   multivac makes the decisions  mrs .  muller .  it picked your husband .     but does it know everything .   insisted norman wildly .   couldn t it have made a mistake .     yes  it can .  there s no point in not being frank .  in       a selected voter died of a stroke two hours before it was time for him to be notified .  multivac didn t predict that  it couldn t .  a voter might be mentally unstable  morally unsuitable  or  for that matter  disloyal .  multivac can t know everything about everybody until he s fed all the data there is .  that s why  alternate selections are always held in readiness .  i don t think we fl be using one this time .  you re in good health  mr .  muller  and you ve been carefully investigated .  you qualify .    norman buried his face in his hands and sat motionless .    by tomorrow morning  sir   said sarah   he ll be perfectly all right .  he just has to get used to it  that s all .     of course   said handley .   in the privacy of their bedchamber  sarah muller expressed herself in other and stronger fashion .  the burden of her lecture was   so get hold of yourself  norman .  you re trying to throw away the chance of a lifetime .    norman whispered desperately   it frightens me  sarah .  the whole thing .     for goodness  sake  why .  what s there to it but answering a question or two .     the responsibility is too great .  i couldn t face it .     what responsibility .  there isn t any .  multivac picked you .  it s mul tivac s responsibility .  everyone knows that .    norman sat up in bed in a sudden excess of rebellion and anguish .   everyone is supposed to know that .  but they don t .  they     lower your voice   hissed sarah icily .   they ll hear you downtown .     they don t   said norman  declining quickly to a whisper .   when they talk about the ridgely administration of       do they say he won them over with pie in the sky promises and racist baloney .  no .  they talk about the  goddam maccomber vote   as though humphrey maccomber was the only man who had anything to do with it because he faced multivac .  i ve said it myself only now i think the poor guy was just a truck farmer who didn t ask to be picked .  why was it his fault more than anyone else s .  now his name is a curse .     you re just being childish   said sarah .    i m being sensible .  i tell you  sarah  i won t accept .  they can t make me vote if i don t want to .  i ll say i m sick .  i ll say    but sarah had had enough .   now you listen to me   she whispered in a cold fury .   you don t have only yourself to think about .  you know what it means to be voter of the year .  a presidential year at that .  it means publicity and fame and  maybe  buckets of money     and then i go back to being a clerk .     you will not .  you ll have a branch managership at the least if you have any brains at all  and you will have  because i ll tell you what to do .  you control the kind of publicity if you play your cards right  and you can force kennel .  stores  inc .   into a tight contract and an escalator clause in connection with your salary and a decent pension plan .     that s not the point in being voter  sarah .     that will be your point .  if you don t owe anything to yourself or to me  i m not asking for myself you owe something to linda .   norman groaned .   well  don t you .   snapped sarah .   yes  dear   murmured norman .   on november    the official announcement was made and it was too late for norman to back out even if he had been able to find the courage to make the attempt .   their house was sealed off .  secret service agents made their appearance in the open  blocking off all approach .   at first the telephone rang incessantly  but philip handley with an engagingly apologetic smile took all calls .  eventually  the exchange shunted all calls directly to the police station .   norman imagined that  in that way  he was spared not only the bubbling  and envious .   congratulations of friends  but also the egregious pressure of salesmen scenting a prospect and the designing smoothness of politicians from all over the nation .   .   .   .  perhaps even death threats from the inevitable cranks .   newspapers were forbidden to enter the house now in order to keep out weighted pressures  and television was gently but firmly disconnected  over linda s loud protests .   matthew growled and stayed in his room  linda  after the first flurry of excitement  sulked and whined because she could not leave the house  sarah divided her time between preparation of meals for the present and plans for the future  and norman s depression lived and fed upon itself .   and the morning of tuesday  november          came at last  and it was  .  election day .      it was early breakfast  but only norman muller ate  and that mechani   calry .  even a shower and shave had not succeeded in either restoring him to   reality or removing his own conviction that he was as grimy without as he felt grimy within .   handley s friendly voice did its best to shed some normality over the gray and unfriendly dawn .   the weather prediction had been for a cloudy day with prospects of rain before noon .    handley said   we ll keep this house insulated till mr .  muller is back  but after that we ll be off your necks .   the secret service agent was in full uniform now  including sidearms in heavily brassed holsters .    you ve been no trouble at all  mr .  handley   simpered sarah .   norman drank through two cups of black coffee  wiped his lips with a napkin  stood up and said haggardly   i m ready .    handley stood up  too .   very well  sir .  and thank you  mrs .  muller  for your very kind hospitality .    the armored car purred down empty streets .  they were empty even for that hour of the morning .   handley indicated that and said   they always shift traffic away from the line of drive ever since the attempted bombing that nearly ruined the lever ett election of     .    when the car stopped  norman was helped out by the always polite handley into an underground drive whose walls were lined with soldiers at attention .   he was led into a brightly lit room  in which three white uniformed men greeted him smilingly .   norman said sharply   but this is the hospital .     there s no significance to that   said handley at once .   it s just that the hospital has the necessary facilities .     well  what do i do .    handley nodded .  one of the three men in white advanced and said   i ll take over now  agent .    handley saluted in an offhand manner and left the room .   the man in white said   won t you sit down  mr .  mulkr .  i m john paulson  senior computer .  these are samson levine and peter dorogobuzh  my assistants .    norman shook hands numbly all about .  paulson was a man of middle height with a soft face that seemed used to smiling and a very obvious toupee .  he wore plastic rimmed glasses of an old fashioned cut  and he lit a cigarette as he talked .   norman refused his offer of one .    paulson said   in the first place  mr .  muller  i want you to know we are in no hurry .  we want you to stay with us all day if necessary  just so that you get used to your surroundings and get over any thought you might have that there is anything unusual in this  anything clinical  if you know what i mean .     it s all right   said norman .   i d just as soon this were over .     i understand your feelings .  still  we want you to know exactly what s going on .  in the first place  multivac isn t here .     it isn t .   somehow through all his depression  he had still looked forward to seeing multivac .  they said it was half a mile long and three stories high  that fifty technicians walked the corridors within its structure continuously .  it was one of the wonders of the world .   paulson smiled .   no .  it s not portable  you know .  it s located underground  in fact  and very few people know exactly where .  you can understand that  since it is our greatest natural resource .  believe me  elections aren t the only things it s used for .    norman thought he was being deliberately chatty and found himself intrigued all the same .   i thought i d see it .  i d like to .     i m sure of that .  but it takes a presidential order and even then it has to  be countersigned by security .  however  we are plugged into multivac right here by beam transmission .  what multivac says can be interpreted here and what we say is beamed directly to multivac  so in a sense we re in its presence .    norman looked about .  the machines within the room were all meaningless to him .    now let me explain  mr .  muller   paulson went on .   multivac already has most of the information it needs to decide all the elections  national  state and local .  it needs only to check certain imponderable attitudes of mind and it will use you for that .  we can t predict what questions it will ask  but they may not make much sense to you  or even to us .  it may ask you how you feel about garbage disposal in your town  whether you favor central incinerators .  it might ask you whether you have a doctor of your own or whether you make use of national medicine  inc .  do you understand .     yes  sir .     whatever it asks  you answer in your own words in any way you please .  if you feel you must explain quite a bit  do so .  talk an hour  if necessary .     yes  sir .     now  one more thing .  we will have to make use of some simple devices which will automatically record your blood pressure  heartbeat  skin conductivity and brain wave pattern while you speak .  the machinery will seem formidable  but it s all absolutely painless .  you won t even know it s going on .    the other two technicians were already busying themselves with smooth gleaming apparatus on oiled wheels .   norman said   is that to check on whether i m lying or not .     not at all  mr .  muller .  there s no question of lying .  it s only a matter of emotional intensity .  if the machine asks you your opinion of your child s school  you may say   i think it is overcrowded .   those are only words .  from the way your brain and heart and hormones and sweat glands work  multivac can judge exactly how intensely you feel about the matter .  it will understand your feelings better than you yourself .     i never heard of this   said norman .    no  i m sure you didn t .  most of the details of multivac s workings are top secret .  for instance  when you leave  you will be asked to sign a paper swearing that you will never reveal the nature of the questions you were asked  the nature of your responses  what was done  or how it was done .  the less is known about the multivac  the less chance of attempted outside pressures upon the men who service it .   he smiled grimly .   our lives are hard enough as it is .    norman nodded .   i understand .     and now would you like anything to eat or drink .     no .  nothing right now .      do you have any questions .    norman shook his head .    then you tell us when you re ready .     i m ready right now .     you re certain .     quite .    paulson nodded  and raised his hand in a gesture to the others .  they advanced with their frightening equipment  and norman muller felt his breath come a little quicker as he watched .   the ordeal lasted nearly three hours  with one short break for coffee and an embarrassing session with a chamber pot .  during all this time  norman muller remained encased in machinery .  he was bone weary at the close .   he thought sardonically that his promise to reveal nothing of what had passed would be an easy one to keep .  already the questions were a hazy mishmash in his mind .   somehow he had thought multivac would speak in a sepulchral  superhuman voice  resonant and echoing  but that  after all  was just an idea he had from seeing too many television shows  he now decided .  the truth was distressingly undramatic .  the questions were slips of a kind of metallic foil patterned with numerous punctures .  a second machine converted the pattern into words and paulson read the words to norman  then gave him the question and let him read it for himself .   norman s answers were taken down by a recording machine  played back to norman for confirmation  with emendations and added remarks also taken down .  all that was fed into a pattern making instrument and that  in turn  was radiated to murtivac .   the one question norman could remember at the moment was an incongruously gossipy   what do you think of the price of eggs .    now it was over  and gently they removed the electrodes from various portions of his body  unwrapped the pulsating band from his upper arm  moved the machinery away .   he stood up  drew a deep  shuddering breath and said   is that all .  am i through .     not quite .   paulson hurried to him  smiling in reassuring fashion .   we ll have to ask you to stay another hour .     why .   asked norman sharply .    it will take that long for multivac to weave its new data into the trillions of items it has .  thousands of elections are concerned  you know .  it s very complicated .  and it may be that an odd contest here or there  a comptroller ship in phoenix  arizona  or some council seat in wilkesboro  north carolina  may be in doubt .  in that case  multivac may be compelled to ask you a deciding question or two .     no   said norman .   i won t go through this again .     it probably won t happen   paulson said soothingly .   it rarely does .  but   just in case  you ll have to stay .   a touch of steel  just a touch  entered his voice .   you have no choice  you know .  you must .    norman sat down wearily .  he shrugged .   paulson said   we can t let you read a newspaper  but if you d care for a murder mystery  or if you d like to play chess  or if there s anything we can do for you to help pass the time  i wish you d mention it .     it s all right .  i ll just wait .    they ushered him into a small room just next to the one in which he had been questioned .  he let himself sink into a plastic covered armchair and closed his eyes .   as well as he could  he must wait out this final hour .   he sat perfectly still and slowly the tension left him .  his breathing grew less ragged and he could clasp his hands without being quite so conscious of the trembling of his fingers .   maybe there would be no questions .  maybe it was all over .   if it were over  then the next thing would be torchlight processions and invitations to speak at all sorts of functions .  the voter of the year .   he  norman muller  ordinary clerk of a small department store in bloom ington  indiana  who had neither been bom great nor achieved greatness would be in the extraordinary position of having had greatness thrust upon him .   the historians would speak soberly of the muller election of      .  that would be its name  the muller election .   the publicity  the better job  the flash flood of money that interested sarah so much  occupied only a comer of his mind .  it would all be welcome  of course .  he couldn t refuse it .  but at the moment something else was beginning to concern him .   a latent patriotism was stirring .  after all  he was representing the entire electorate .  he was the focal point for them .  he was  in his own person  for this one day  all of america .   the door opened  snapping him to open eyed attention .  for a moment  his stomach constricted .  not more questions .   but paulson was smiling .   that will be all  mr .  muller .     no more questions  sir .     none needed .  everything was quite clear cut .  you will be escorted back to your home and then you will be a private citizen once more .  or as much so as the public will allow .     thank you .  thank you .   norman flushed and said   i wonder who was elected .    paulson shook his head .   that will have to wait for the official announcement .  the rules are quite strict .  we can t even tell you .  you understand .     of course .  yes .   norman felt embarrassed .    secret service will have the necessary papers for you to sign .     yes .   suddenly  norman muller felt proud .  it was on him now in full strength .  he was proud .   in this imperfect world  the sovereign citizens of the first and greatest electronic democracy had  through norman muller  through him .   exercised once again its free  untrammeled franchise .   gimmicks three   come  come   said shapur quite politely  considering that he was a demon .   you are wasting my time .  and your own  too  i might add  since you have only half an hour left .   and his tail twitched .    it s not dematerialization .   asked isidore wellby thoughtfully .    i have already said it is not   said shapur .   for the hundredth time  wellby looked at the unbroken bronze that surrounded him on all sides .  the demon had taken unholy pleasure  what other kind indeed .   in pointing out that the floor  ceiling and four walls were featureless  two foot thick slabs of bronze  welded seamlessly together .   it was the ultimate locked room and wellby had but another half hour to get out  while the demon watched with an expression of gathering anticipation .   it has been ten years previously  to the day  naturally  that isidore wellby had signed up .    we pay you in advance   said shapur persuasively .   ten years of anything you want  within reason  and then you re a demon .  you re one of us  with a new name of demonic potency  and many privileges beside .  you ll hardly know you re damned .  and if you don t sign  you may end up in the fire  anyway  just in the ordinary course of things .  you never know .   .   .   .  here  look at me .  i m not doing too badly .  i signed up  had my ten years and here i am .  not bad .    copyright         by fantasy house  inc .   original title   the brazen locked room .      why so anxious for me to sign then  if i might be damned anyway .   asked wellby .    it s not so easy to recruit hell s cadre   said the demon  with a frank shrug that made the faint odor of sulfur dioxide in the air a trifle stronger .   everyone wishes to gamble on ending in heaven .  it s a poor gamble  but there it is .  i think you  re too sensible for that .  but meanwhile we have more damned souls than we know what to do with and a growing shortage at the administrative end .    wellby  having just left the army and finding himself with nothing much to show for it but a limp and a farewell letter from a girl he somehow still loved  pricked his finger  and signed .   of course  he read the small print first .  a certain amount of demonic power would be deposited to his account upon signature in blood .  he would not know in detail how one manipulated those powers  or even the nature of all of them  but he would nevertheless find his wishes fulfilled in such a way that they would seem to have come about through perfectly normal mechanisms .   naturally  no wish might be fulfilled which would interfere with the higher aims and purposes of human history .  wellby had raised his eyebrows at that .   shapur coughed .   a precaution imposed upon us by uh above .  you are reasonable .  the limitation won t interfere with you .    wellby said   there seems to be a catch clause  too .     a kind of one  yes .  after all  we have to check your aptitude for the position .  it states  as you see  that you will be required to perform a task for us at the conclusion of your ten years  one your demonic powers will make it quite possible for you to do .  we can t tell you the nature of the task now  but you will have ten years to study the nature of your powers .  look upon the whole thing as an entrance qualification .     and if   don t pass the test  what then .     in that case   said the demon   you will be only an ordinary damned soul after all .   and because he was a demon  his eyes glowed smokily at the thought and his clawed fingers twitched as though he felt them already deep in the other s vitals .  but he added suavely   come  now  the test will be a simple one .  we would rather have you as cadre than as just another chore on our hands .    wellby  with sad thoughts of his unattainable loved one  cared little enough at that moment for what would happen after ten years and he signed .   yet the ten years passed quickly enough .  isidore wellby was always reasonable  as the demon had predicted  and things worked well .  wellby accepted a position and because he was always at the right spot at the right time and always said the right thing to the right man  he was quickly promoted to a position of great authority .   investments he made invariably paid off and  what was more gratifying still  his girl came back to him most sincerely repentant and most satisfactorily adoring .   his marriage was a happy one and was blessed with four children  two boys and two girls  all bright and reasonably well behaved .  at the end of ten years  he was at the height of his authority  reputation and wealth  while his wife  if anything  had grown more beautiful as she had matured .   and ten years  to the day  naturally  after the making of the compact  he woke to find himself  not in his bedroom  but in a horrible bronze chamber of the most appalling solidity  with no company other than an eager demon .    you have only to get out  and you will be one of us   said shapur .   it can be done fairly and logically by using your demonic powers  provided you know exactly what it is you re doing .  you should  by now .     my wife and children will be very disturbed at my disappearance   said wellby with the beginning of regrets .    they will find your dead body   said the demon consolingly .   you will seem to have died of a heart attack and you will have a beautiful funeral .  the minister will consign you to heaven and we will not disillusion him or those who listen to him .  now  come  wellby  you have till noon .    wellby  having unconsciously steeled himself for this moment for ten years  was less panic stricken than he might have been .  he looked about speculatively .   is this room perfectly enclosed .  no trick openings .     no openings anywhere in the walls  floor or ceiling   said the demon  with a professional delight in his handiwork .   or at the boundaries of any of those surfaces  for that matter .  are you giving up .     no  no .  just give me time .    wellby thought very hard .  there seemed no sign of closeness in the room .  there was even a feeling of moving air .  the air might be entering the room by dematerializing across the walls .  perhaps the demon had entered by dematerialization and perhaps wellby himself might leave in that manner .  he asked .   the demon grinned .   dematerialization is not one of your powers .  nor did i myself use it in entering .     you re sure now .     the room is my own creation   said the demon smugly   and especially constructed for you .     and you entered from outside .     i did .     with reasonably demonic powers which i possess  too .     exactly .  come  let us be precise .  you cannot move through matter but you can move in any dimension by a mere effort of will .  you can move up  down  right  left  obliquely and so on  but you cannot move through matter in any way .    wellby kept on thinking  and shapur kept on pointing out the utter immovable solidity of the bronze walls  floor and ceiling  their unbroken ultimacy .   it seemed obvious to wellby that shapur  however much he might believe in the necessity for recruiting cadre  was barely restraining his demonic delight at possibly having an ordinary damned soul to amuse himself with .    at least   said wellby  with a sorrowful attempt at philosophy   i ll have ten happy years to look back on .  surely that s a consolation  even for a damned soul in hell .     not at all   said the demon .   hell would not be hell  if you were allowed consolations .  everything anyone gains on earth by pacts with the devil  as in your case  or my own  for that matter   is exactly what one might have gained without such a pact if one had worked industriously and in full trust in uh above .  that is what makes all such bargains so truly demonic .   and the demon laughed with a kind of cheerful howl .   wellby said indignantly   you mean my wife would have returned to me even if i had never signed your contract .     she might have   said shapur .   whatever happens is the will of uh  above  you know .  we ourselves can do nothing to alter that .    the chagrin of that moment must have sharpened wellby s wits for it was then that he vanished  leaving the room empty  except for a surprised demon .  and surprise turned to absolute fury when the demon looked at the contract with wellby which he had  until that moment  been holding in his hand for final action  one way or the other .   it was ten years  to the day  naturally  after isidore wellby had signed his pact with shapur  that the demon entered wellby s office and said  most angrily   look here    wellby looked up from his work  astonished .   who are you .     you know very well who i am   said shapur .    not at all   said wellby .   the demon looked sharply at the man .   i see you are telling the truth  but i can t make out the details .   he promptly flooded wellby s mind with the events of the last ten years .   wellby said   oh  yes .  i can explain  of course  but are you sure we will not be interrupted .     we won t be   said the demon grimly .    i sat in that closed bronze room   said wellby   and     never mind that   said the demon hastily .   i want to know     please .  let me tell this my way .    the demon clamped his jaws and fairly exuded sulfur dioxide till wellby coughed and looked pained .   wellby said   if you ll move off a bit .  thank you .   .   .   .  now i sat in that closed bronze room and remembered how you kept stressing the absolute  unbrokenness of the four walls  the floor and the ceiling .  i wondered  why did you specify .  what else was there beside walls  floor and ceiling .  you had defined a completely enclosed three dimensional space .    and that was it  three dimensional .  the room was not closed in the fourth dimension .  it did not exist indefinitely in the past .  you said you had created it for me .  so if one traveled into the past  one would find oneself at a point in time  eventually  when the room did not exist and then one would be out of the room .    what s more  you had said i could move in any dimension  and time may certainly be viewed as a dimension .  in any case  as soon as i decided to move toward the past  i found myself living backward at a tremendous rate and suddenly there was no bronze around me anywhere .    shapur cried in anguish   i can guess all that .  you couldn t have escaped any other way .  it s this contract of yours that i m concerned about .  if you re not an ordinary damned soul  very well  it s part of the game .  but you must be at least one of us  one of the cadre  it s what you were paid for  and if i don t deliver you down below  i will be in enormous trouble .    wellby shrugged his shoulders .   i m sorry for you  of course  but i can t help you .  you must have created the bronze room immediately after i placed my signature on the paper  for when i burst out of the room  i found myself just at the point in time at which i was making the bargain with you .  there you were again  there i was  you were pushing the contract toward me  together with a stylus with which i might prick my finger .  to be sure  as i had moved back in time  my memory of what was becoming the future faded out  but not  apparently  quite entirely .  as you pushed the contract at me  i felt uneasy .  i didn t quite remember the future  but i felt uneasy .  so i didn t sign .  i turned you down flat .    shapur ground his teeth .   i might have known .  if probability patterns affected demons  i would have shifted with you into this new if world .  as it is  all i can say is that you have lost the ten happy years we paid you with .  that is one consolation .  and we ll get you in the end .  that is another .     well  now   said wellby   are there consolations in hell .  through the ten years i have now lived  i knew nothing of what i might have obtained .  but now that you ve put the memory of the ten years that might have been into my mind  i recall that  in the bronze room  you told me that demonic agreements could give nothing that could not be obtained by industry and trust in above .  i have been industrious and i have trusted .    wellby s eyes fell upon the photograph of his beautiful wife and four beautiful children  then traveled about the tasteful luxuriance of his office .   and i may even escape hell altogether .  that  too  is beyond your power to decide .    and the demon  with a horrible shriek  vanished forever .   kid stuff  the first pang of nausea had passed and jan prentiss said   damn it  you re an insect .    it was a statement of fact  not an insult  and the thing that sat on prentiss  desk said   of course .    it was about a foot long  very thin  and in shape a farfetched and miniature caricature of a human being .  its stalky arms and legs originated in pairs from the upper portion of its body .  the legs were longer and thicker than the arms .  they extended the length of the body  then bent forward at the knee .   the creature sat upon those knees and  when it did so  the stub of its fuzzy abdomen just cleared prentiss  desk .   there was plenty of time for prentiss to absorb these details .  the object had no objection to being stared at .  it seemed to welcome it  in fact  as though it were used to exciting admiration .    what are you .   prentiss did not feel completely rational .  five minutes ago  he had been seated at his typewriter  working leisurely on the story he had promised horace w .  browne for last month s issue of farfetched fantasy fiction .  he had been in a perfectly usual frame of mind .  he had felt quite fine  quite sane .   and then a block of air immediately to the right of the typewriter had shimmered  clouded over and condensed into the little horror that dangled its black and shiny feet over the edge of the desk .   prentiss wondered in a detached sort of way that he bothered talking to  copyright         by galaxy publishing corporation .   it .  this was the first time his profession had so crudely affected his dreams .  it must be a dream  he told himself .    i m an avalonian   said the being .   i m from avalon  in other words .   it s tiny face ended in a mandibular mouth .  two swaying three inch antennae rose from a spot above either eye  while the eyes themselves gleamed richly in their many faceted fashion .  there was no sign of nostrils .   naturally not  thought prentiss wildly .  it has to breathe through vents in its abdomen .  it must be talking with its abdomen then .  or using telepathy .    avalon .   he said stupidly .  he thought  avalon .  the land of the fay in king arthur s time .    certainly   said the creature  answering the thought smoothly .   i m an elf .     oh  no .   prentiss put his hands to his face  took them away and found the elf still there  its feet thumping against the top drawer .  prentiss was not a drinking man  or a nervous one .  in fact  he was considered a very prosaic sort of person by his neighbors .  he had a comfortable paunch  a reasonable but not excessive amount of hair on his head  an amiable wife and an active ten year old son .  his neighbors were  of course  kept ignorant of the fact that he paid off the mortgage on his house by writing fantasies of one sort or another .   till now  however  this secret vice had never affected his psyche .  to be sure  his wife had shaken her head over his addiction many times .  it was her standard opinion that he was wasting  even perverting  his talents .    who on earth reads these things .   she would say .   all that stuff about demons and gnomes and wishing rings and elves .  all that kid stuff  if you want my frank opinion .     you re quite wrong   prentiss would reply stiffly .   modern fantasies are very sophisticated and mature treatments of folk motifs .  behind the facade of glib unreality there frequently lie trenchant comments on the world of today .  fantasy in modem style is  above all  adult fare .        blanche shrugged .  she had heard him speak at conventions so these comments weren t new to her .      besides   he would add   fantasies pay the mortgage  don t they .       maybe so   she would reply   but it would be nice if you d switch to     mysteries .  at least you d get quarter reprint sales out of those and we could   even tell the neighbors what you do for a living .    prentiss groaned in spirit .  blanche could come in now at any time and find him talking to himself  it was too real for a dream  it might be a hallucination  .  after that he would have to write mysteries for a living or take to work .    you re quite wrong   said the elf .   this is neither a dream nor a hallucination .    then why don t you go away .   asked prentiss .    i intend to .  this is scarcely my idea of a place to live .  and you re coming with me .     i am not .  what the hell do you think you are  telling me what i m going to do .     if you think that s a respectful way to speak to a representative of an older culture  i can t say much for your upbringing .     you re not an older culture   he wanted to add  you re just a figment of my imagination  but he had been a writer too long to be able to bring himself to commit the cliche .    we insects   said the elf freezingry   existed half a billion years before the first mammal was invented .  we watched the dinosaurs come in and we watched them go out .  as for you man things strictly newcomers .    for the first time  prentiss noted that  from the spot on the elf s body where its limbs sprouted  a third vestigial pair existed as well .  it increased the insecticity of the object and prentiss  sense of indignation grew .   he said   you needn t waste your company on social inferiors .     i wouldn t   said the elf   believe me .  but necessity drives  you know .  it s a rather complicated story but when you hear it  you ll want to help .    prentiss said uneasily   look  i don t have much time .  blanche my wife will be in here any time .  she ll be upset .     she won t be here   said the elf .   i ve set up a block in her mind .     what .     quite harmless  i assure you .  but  after all  we can t afford to be disturbed  can we .    prentiss sat back in his chair  dazed and unhappy .   the elf said   we elves began our association with you man things immediately after the last ice age began .  it had been a miserable time for us  as you can imagine .  we couldn t wear animal carcasses or live in holes as your uncouth ancestors did .  it took incredible stores of psychic energy to keep warm .     incredible stores of what .     psychic energy .  you know nothing at all about it .  your mind is too coarse to grasp the concept .  please don t interrupt .    the elf continued   necessity drove us to experiment with your people s brains .  they were crude  but large .  the cells were inefficient  almost worthless  but there were a vast number of them .  we could use those brains as a concentrating device  a type of psychic lens  and increase the available energy which our own minds could tap .  we survived the ice age handily and without having to retreat to the tropics as in previous such eras .    of course  we were spoiled .  when warmth returned  we didn t abandon the man things .  we used them to increase our standard of living generally .  we could travel faster  eat better  do more  and we lost our old  simple  virtuous way of life forever .  then  too  there was milk .     milk .   said prentiss .   i don t see the connection .     a divine liquid .  i only tasted it once in my life .  but elfin classic poetry speaks of it in superlatives .  in the old days  men always supplied us plentifully .  why mammals of all things should be blessed with it and insects not is a complete mystery .   .   .   .  how unfortunate it is that the men things got out of hand .     they did .     two hundred years ago .     good for us .     don t be narrow minded   said the elf stiffly .   it was a useful association for all parties until you man things learned to handle physical energies in quantity .  it was just the sort of gross thing your minds are capable of .     what was wrong with it .     it s hard to explain .  it was all very well for us to light up our nightly revels with fireflies brightened by use of two manpower of psychic energy .  but then you men creatures installed electric lights .  our antennal reception is good for miles  but then you invented telegraphs  telephones and radios .  our kobolds mined ore with much greater efficiency than man things do  until man things invented dynamite .  do you see .     no .     surely you don t expect sensitive and superior creatures such as the elves to watch a group of hairy mammals outdo them .  it wouldn t be so bad if we could imitate the electronic development ourselves  but our psychic energies were insufficient for the purpose .  well  we retreated from reality .  we sulked  pined and drooped .  call it an inferiority complex  if you will  but from two centuries ago onward  we slowly abandoned mankind and retreated to such centers as avalon .    prentiss thought furiously .   let s get this straight .  you can handle minds .     certainly .     you can make me think you re invisible .  hypnotically  i mean .     a crude term  but yes .     and when you appeared just now  you did it by lifting a kind of mental block .  is that it .     to answer your thoughts  rather than your words  you are not sleeping  you are not mad  and i am not supernatural .     i was just making sure .  i take it  then  you can read my mind .     of course .  it is a rather dirty and unrewarding sort of labor  but i can do it when i must .  your name is prentiss and you write imaginative fiction .  you have one larva who is at a place of instruction .  i know a great deal about you .    prentiss winced .   and just where is avalon .     you won t find it .   the elf clacked his mandibles together two or three times .   don t speculate on the possibility of warning the authorities .  you ll find yourself in a madhouse .  avalon  in case you think the knowledge will  help you  is in the middle of the atlantic and quite invisible  you know .  after the steamboat was invented  you man things got to moving about so unreasonably that we had to cloak the whole island with a psychic shield .    of course  incidents will take place .  once a huge  barbaric vessel hit us dead center and it took all the psychic energy of the entire population to give the island the appearance of an iceberg .  the titanic  i believe  was the name printed on the vessel .  and nowadays there are planes flying overhead all the time and sometimes there are crashes .  we picked up cases of canned milk once .  that s when i tasted it .    prentiss said   well  then  damn it  why aren t you still on avalon .  why did you leave .     i was ordered to leave   said the elf angrily .   the fools .     oh .     you know how it is when you re a little different .  i m not like the rest of them and the poor tradition ridden fools resented it .  they were jealous .  that s the best explanation .  jealous .     how are you different .     hand me that light bulb   said the elf .   oh  just unscrew it .  you don t need a reading lamp in the daytime .    with a quiver of repulsion  prentiss did as he was told and passed the object into the little hands of the elf .  carefully  the elf  with fingers so thin and wiry that they looked like tendrils  touched the bottom and side of the brass base .   feebly the filament in the bulb reddened .    good god   said prentiss .    that   said the elf proudly   is my great talent .  i told you that we elves couldn t adapt psychic energy to electronics .  well  i can .  i m not just an ordinary elf .  i m a mutant .  a super elf .  i m the next stage in elfin evolution .  this light is due just to the activity of my own mind  you know .  now watch when i use yours as a focus .    as he said that  the bulb s filament grew white hot and painful to look at  while a vague and not unpleasant tickling sensation entered prentiss  skull .   the lamp went out and the elf put the bulb on the desk behind the typewriter .    i haven t tried   said the elf proudly   but i suspect i can fission uranium too .     but look here  lighting a bulb takes energy .  you can t just hold it     i ve told you about psychic energy .  great oberon  man thing  try to understand .    prentiss felt increasingly uneasy  he said cautiously   what do you intend doing with this gift of yours .     go back to avalon  of course .  i should let those fools go to their doom  but an elf does have a certain patriotism  even if he is a coleopteron .     a what .     we elves are not all of a species  you know .  i m of beetle descent .  see .    he rose to his feet and  standing on the desk  turned his back to prentiss .  what had seemed merely a shining black cuticle suddenly split and lifted .  from underneath  two filmy  veined wings fluttered out .    oh  you can fly   said prentiss .    you re very foolish   said the elf contemptuously   not to realize i m too large for flight .  but they are attractive  aren t they .  how do you like the iridescence .  the lepidoptera have disgusting wings in comparison .  they re gaudy and indelicate .  what s more they re always sticking out .     the lepidoptera .   prentiss felt hopelessly confused .    the butterfly clans .  they re the proud ones .  they were always letting humans see them so they could be admired .  very petty minds in a way .  and that s why your legends always give fairies butterfly wings instead of beetle wings which are much more diaphanously beautiful .  we ll give the lepidoptera what for when we get back  you and i .     now hold on     fust think   said the elf  swaying back and forth in what looked like elfin ecstasy   our nightly revels on the fairy green will be a blaze of sparkling light from curlicues of neon tubing .  we can cut loose the swarms of wasps we ve got hitched to our flying wagons and install internal combustion motors instead .  we can stop this business of curling up on leaves when it s time to sleep and build factories to manufacture decent mattresses .  i tell you  we ll live .   .   .   .  and the rest of them will eat dirt for having ordered me out .     but i can t go with you   bleated prentiss .   i have responsibilities .  i have a wife and kid .  you wouldn t take a man away from his his larva  would you .     i m not cruel   said the elf .  he turned his eyes full on prentiss .   i have an elfin soul .  still  what choice have i .  i must have a man brain for focusing purposes or i will accomplish nothing  and not all man brains are suitable .     why not .     great oberon  creature .  a man brain isn t a passive thing of wood and stone .  it must co operate in order to be useful .  and it can only co operate by being fully aware of our own elfin ability to manipulate it .  i can use your brain  for instance  but your wife s would be useless to me .  it would take her years to understand who and what i am .    prentiss said   this is a damned insult .  are you telling me i believe in fairies .  i ll have you know i m a complete rationalist .     are you .  when i first revealed myself to you  you had a few feeble thoughts about dreams and hallucinations but you talked to me  you accepted me .  your wife would have screamed and gone into hysterics .    prentiss was silent .  he could think of no answer .    that s the trouble   said the elf despondently .   practically all you humans have forgotten about us since we left you .  your minds have closed   grown useless .  to be sure  your larvae believe in your legends about the  little folk   but their brains are undeveloped and useful only for simple processes .  when they mature  they lose belief .  frankly  i don t know what i would do if it weren t for you fantasy writers .     what do you mean we fantasy writers .     you are the few remaining adults who believe in the insect folk .  you  prentiss  most of all .  you ve been a fantasy writer for twenty years .     you re mad .  i don t believe the things i write .     you have to .  you can t help it .  i mean  while you re actually writing  you take the subject matter seriously .  after a while your mind is just naturally cultivated into usefulness .   .   .   .  but why argue .  i have used you .  you saw the light bulb brighten .  so you see you must come with me .     but i won t .   prentiss set his limbs stubbornly .   can you make me against my will .     i could  but i might damage you  and i wouldn t want that .  suppose we say this .  if you don t agree to come  i could focus a current of high voltage electricity through your wife .  it would be a revolting thing to have to do  but i understand your own people execute enemies of the state in that fashion  so that you would probably find the punishment less horrible than i do .  i wouldn t want to seem brutal even to a man thing .    prentiss grew conscious of the perspiration matting the short hairs on his temple .    wait   he said   don t do anything like that .  let s talk it over .    the elf shot out his filmy wings  fluttered them and returned them to their case .   talk  talk  talk .  it s tiring .  surely you have milk in the house .  you re not a very thoughtful host or you would have offered me refreshment before this .    prentiss tried to bury the thought that came to him  to push it as far below the outer skin of his mind as he could .  he said casually   i have something better than milk .  here  i ll get it for you .     stay where you are .  call to your wife .  she ll bring it .     but i don t want her to see you .  it would frighten her .    the elf said   you need feel no concern .  i ll handle her so that she won t be the least disturbed .    prentiss lifted an arm .   the elf said   any attack you make on me will be far slower than the bolt of electricity that will strike your wife .    prentiss  arm dropped .  he stepped to the door of his study .    blanche .   he called down the stairs .   blanche was just visible in the living room  sitting woodenly in the armchair near the bookcase .  she seemed to be asleep  open eyed .   prentiss turned to the elf .   something s wrong with her .     she s just in a state of sedation .  she ll hear you .  tell her what to do .     blanche .   he called again .   bring the container of eggnog and a small glass  will you .    with no sign of animation other than that of bare movement  blanche rose and disappeared from view .    what is eggnog .   asked the elf .   prentiss attempted enthusiasm .   it is a compound of milk  sugar and eggs beaten to a delightful consistency .  milk alone is poor staff compared to it .    blanche entered with the eggnog .  her pretty face was expressionless .  her eyes turned toward the elf but lightened with no realization of the significance of the sight .    here  jan   she said  and sat down in the old  leather covered chair by the window  hands falling loosely to her lap .   prentiss watched her uneasily for a moment .   are you going to keep her here .     she ll be easier to control .   .   .   .  well  aren t you going to offer me the eggnog .     oh  sure .  here .    he poured the thick white liquid into the cocktail glass .  he had prepared five milk bottles of it two nights before for the boys of the new york fantasy association and it had been mixed with a lavish hand  since fantasy writers notoriously like it so .   the elf s antennae trembled violently .    a heavenly aroma   he muttered .   he wrapped the ends of his thin arms about the stem of the small gkss and lifted it to his mouth .  the liquid s level sank .  when half was gone  he put it down and sighed   oh  the loss to my people .  what a creation .  what a thing to exist .  our histories tell us that in ancient days an occasional lucky sprite managed to take the place of a man larva at birth so that he might draw off the liquid fresh made .  i wonder if even those ever experienced anything like this .    prentiss said with a touch of professional interest   that s the idea behind this business of changelings  is it .     of course .  the female man creature has a great gift .  why not take advantage of it .   the elf turned his eyes upon the rise and fall of blanche s bosom and sighed again .   prentiss said  not too eager  now  don t give it away    go ahead .  drink all you want .    he  too  watched blanche  waiting for signs of restoring animation  waiting for the beginnings of breakdown in the elf s control .   the elf said   when is your larva returning from its place of instruction .  i need him .     soon  soon   said prentiss nervously .  he looked at his wristwatch .  actually  jan  junior  would be back  yelling for a slab of cake and milk  in something like fifteen minutes .    fill  er up   he said urgently .   fill  er up .    the elf sipped gaily .  he said   once the larva arrives  you can go .     go .     only to the library .  you ll have to get volumes on electronics .  i ll need the details on how to build television  telephones  all that .  i ll need to have rules on wiring  instructions for constructing vacuum tubes .  details  pren tiss  details .  we have tremendous tasks ahead of us .  oil drilling  gasoline refining  motors  scientific agriculture .  we ll build a new avalon  you and i .  a technical one .  a scientific fairyland .  we will create a new world .     great .   said prentiss .   here  don t neglect your drink .     you see .  you are catching fire with the idea   said the elf .   and you will be rewarded .  you will have a dozen female man things to yourself .    prentiss looked at blanche automatically .  no signs of hearing  but who could tell .  he said   i d have no use for female man th for women  i mean .     come now   said the elf censoriously   be truthful .  you men things are well known to our folk as lecherous  bestial creatures .  mothers frightened their young for generations by threatening them with men things .   .   .   .  young  ah .   he lifted the glass of eggnog in the air and said   to my own young   and drained it .    fill  er up   said prentiss at once .   fill  er up .    the elf did so .  he said   i ll have lots of children .  i ll pick out the best of the coleoptresses and breed my line .  i ll continue the mutation .  right now i m the only one  but when we have a dozen or fifty  i ll interbreed them and develop the race of the super elf .  a race of electro ulp electronic marvels and infinite future .   .  .  .  if i could only drink more .  nectar .  the original nectar .    there was the sudden noise of a door being flung open and a young voice calling   mom .  hey  mom .    the elf  his glossy eyes a little dimmed  said   then we ll begin to take over the men things .  a few believe already  the rest we will urp teach .  it will be the old days  but better  a more efficient elfhood  a tighter union .    jan  junior s  voice was closer and tinged with impatience .   hey  mom .  ain t you home .    prentiss felt his eyes popping with tension .  blanche sat rigid .  the elf s speech was slightly thick  his balance a little unsteady .  if prentiss were going to risk it  now  now was the time .    sit back   said the elf peremptorily .   you re being foolish .  i knew there was alcohol in the eggnog from the moment you thought your ridiculous scheme .  you men things are very shifty .  we elves have many proverbs about you .  fortunately  alcohol has little effect upon us .  now if you had tried catnip with just a touch of honey in it  .  .  .  ah  here is the larva .  how are you  little man thing .    the elf sat there  the goblet of eggnog halfway to his mandibles  while  jan  junior  stood in the doorway .  jan  junior s  ten year old face was moderately smeared with dirt  his hair was immoderately matted and there was a look of the utmost surprise in his gray eyes .  his battered schoolbooks swayed from the end of the strap he held in his hand .   he said   pop .  what s the matter with mom .  and and what s that .    the elf said to prentiss   hurry to the library .  no time must be lost .  you know the books i need .   all trace of incipient drunkenness had left the creature and prentiss  morale broke .  the creature had been playing with him .   prentiss got up to go .   the elf said   and nothing human  nothing sneaky  no tricks .  your wife is still a hostage .  i can use the larva s mind to kill her  it s good enough for that .  i wouldn t want to do it .  i m a member of the elfitarian ethical society and we advocate considerate treatment of mammals so you may rely on my noble principles    you do as i say .    prentiss felt a strong compulsion to leave flooding him .  he stumbled toward the door .   jan  junior  cried   pop  it can talk .  he says he ll kill mom .  hey  don t go away .    prentiss was already out of the room  when he heard the elf say   don t stare at me  larva .  i will not harm your mother if you do exactly as i say .  i am an elf  a fairy .  you know what a fairy is  of course .    and prentiss was at the front door when he heard jan  junior s  treble raised in wild shouting  followed by scream after scream in blanche s shuddering soprano .   i the strong  though invisible  elastic that was drawing prentiss out the house snapped and vanished .  he fell backward  righted himself and darted back up the stairs .   blanche  fairly saturated with quivering life  was backed into a corner  her arms about a weeping jan  junior .   on the desk was a collapsed black carapace  covering a nasty smear of pulpiness from which colorless liquid dripped .   jan  junior  was sobbing hysterically   i hit it .  i hit it with my school books .  it was hurting mom .    an hour passed and prentiss felt the world of normality pouring back into the interstices left behind by the creature from avalon .  the elf itself was already ash in the incinerator behind the house and the only remnant of its existence was the damp stain at the foot of his desk .   blanche was still sickly pale .  they talked in whispers .   prentiss said   how s jan  junior .     he s watching television .     is he all right .     oh  he s all right  but      be having nightmares for weeks .     i know .  so will i unless we can get it out of our minds .  i don t think there ll ever be another of those things here .    blanche said   i can t explain how awful it was .  i kept hearing every word he said  even when i was down in the living room .     it was telepathy  you see .       just couldn t move .  then  after you left  i could begin to stir a bit .  i tried to scream but all i could do was moan and whimper .  then jan  junior  smashed him and all at once i was free .  i don t understand how it happened .    prentiss felt a certain gloomy satisfaction .   i think i know .  i was under his control because i accepted the truth of his existence .  he held you in check through me .  when i left the room  increasing distance made it harder to use my mind as a psychic lens and you could begin moving .  by the time i reached the front door  the elf thought it was time to switch from my mind to jan  junior s .  that was his mistake .     in what way .   asked blanche .    he assumed that all children believe in fairies  but he was wrong .  here in america today children don t believe in fairies .  they never hear of them .  they believe in tom corbett  in hopalong cassidy  in dick tracy  in howdy doody  in superman and a dozen other things  but not in fairies .    the elf just never realized the sudden cultural changes brought about by comic books and television  and when he tried to grab jan  junior s mind  he couldn t .  before he could recover his psychic balance  jan  junior  was on top of him in a swinging panic because he thought you were being hurt and it was all over .    it s like i ve always said  blanche .  the ancient folk motifs of legend survive only in the modern fantasy magazine  and modem fantasy is purely adult fare .  do you finally see my point .    blanche said humbly   yes  dear .    prentiss put his hands in his pockets and grinned slowly .   you know  blanche  next time i see walt rae  i think i ll just drop a hint that i write the stuff .  time the neighbors knew  i think .    jan  junior  holding an enormous slice of buttered bread  wandered into his father s study in search of the dimming memory .  pop kept slapping him on the back and mom kept putting bread and cake in his hands and he was forgetting why .  there had been this big old thing on the desk that could talk  .   .   .   it had all happened so quickly that it got mixed up in his mind .   he shrugged his shoulders and  in the late afternoon sunlight  looked at the partly typewritten sheet in his father s typewriter  then at the small pile of paper resting on the desk .   he read a while  curled his lip and muttered   gee whiz .  fairies again .  always kid stuff .   and wandered off .   the watery place  we re never going to have space travel .  what s more  no extraterrestrials will ever land on earth at least  any more .   i m not just being a pessimist .  as a matter of fact  space travel is possible  extraterrestrials have landed .  i know that .  space ships are crisscrossing space among a million worlds  probably  but we ll never join them .  i know that  too .  all on account of a ridiculous error .   i ll explain .   it was actually bart cameron s error and you ll have to understand about bart cameron .  he s the sheriff at twin gulch  idaho  and i m his deputy .  bart cameron is an impatient man and he gets most impatient when he has to work up his income tax .  you see  besides being sheriff  he also owns and runs the general store  he s got some shares in a sheep ranch  he does a bit of assay work  he s got a kind of pension for being a disabled veteran  bad knee  and a few other things like that .  naturally  it makes his tax figures complicated .   it wouldn t be so bad if he d let a tax man work on the forms with him  but he insists on doing it himself and it makes him a bitter man .  by april     he isn t approachable .   so it s too bad the flying saucer landed on april          .   i saw it land .  my chair was backed up against the wall in the sheriff s office  and i was looking at the stars through the windows and feeling too lazy to go back to my magazine and wondering if i ought to knock off and  copyright         by renown publications  inc .   hit the sack or keep on listening to cameron curse real steady as he went over his columns of figures for the hundred twenty seventh time .   it looked like a shooting star at first  but then the track of light broadened into two things that looked like rocket exhausts and the thing came down sweet  steady and without a sound .  an old  dead leaf would have rustled more coming down and landed thumpier .  two men got out .   i couldn t say anything or do anything .  i couldn t choke or point  i couldn t even bug my eyes .  i just sat there .   cameron .  he never looked up .   there was a knock on the door which wasn t locked .  it opened and the two men from the flying saucer stepped in .  i would have thought they were city fellows if i hadn t seen the flying saucer land in the scrub .  they wore charcoal gray suits  with white shirts and maroon four in hands .  they had on black shoes and black homburgs .  they had dark complexions  black wavy hair and brown eyes .  they had very serious looks on their faces and were about five foot ten apiece .  they looked very much alike .   god  i was scared .   but cameron just looked up when the door opened and frowned .  ordinarily  i guess he d have laughed the collar button off his shirt at seeing clothes like that in twin gulch  but he was so taken up by his income tax that he never cracked a smile .   he said   what can i do for you  folks .   and he tapped his hand on the forms so it was obvious he hadn t much time .   one of the two stepped forward .  he said   we have had your people under observation a long time .   he pronounced each word carefully and all by itself .   cameron said   my people .  all i got s a wife .  what s she been doing .    the fellow in the suit said   we have chosen this locality for our first contact because it is isolated and peaceful .  we know that you are the leader here .     i m the sheriff  if that s what you mean  so spit it out .  what s you trouble .     we have been careful to adopt your mode of dress and even to assume your appearance .     that s my mode of dress .   he must have noticed it for the first time .    the mode of dress of your dominant social class  that is .  we have also learned your language .    you could see the light break in on cameron .  he said   you guys foreigners .   cameron didn t go much for foreigners  never having met many outside the army  but generally he tried to be fair .   the man from the saucer said   foreigners .  indeed we are .  we come from the watery place your people call venus .     i was just collecting up strength to blink my eyes  but that sent me right  back to nothing .  i had seen the flying saucer .  i had seen it land .  i had to believe this .  these men or these somethings came from venus .    but cameron never blinked an eye .  he said   all right .  this is the u . s . a .  we all got equal rights regardless of race  creed  color  or nationality .  i m at your service .  what can i do for you .     we would like to have you make immediate arrangements for the important men of your u . s . a .   as you call it  to be brought here for discussions leading to your people joining our great organization .    slowly  cameron got red .   our people join your organization .  we re already part of the u . n .  and god knows what else .  and i suppose i m to get the president here  eh .  right now .  in twin gulch .  send a hurry up message .   he looked at me  as though he wanted to see a smile on my face  but i couldn t as much as fall down if someone had pushed the chair out from under me .   the saucer man said   speed is desirable .     you want congress  too .  the supreme court .     if they will help  sheriff .    and cameron really went to pieces .  he banged his income tax form and yelled   well  you re not helping me  and i have no time for wise guy jerks who come around  especially foreigners .  if you don t get the hell out of here pronto  i ll lock you up for disturbing the peace and i ll never let you out .     you wish us to leave .   said the man from venus .    right now .  get the hell out of here and back to wherever you re from and don t ever come back .  i don t want to see you and no one else around here does .    the two men looked at each other  making little twitches with their faces .   then the one who had done all the talking said   i can see in your mind that you really wish  with great intensity  to be left alone .  it is not our way to force ourselves or our organization on people who do not wish us or it .  we will respect your privacy and leave .  we will not return .  we will girdle your world in warning and none will enter and your people will never have to leave .    cameron said   mister  i m tired of this crap  so i ll count to three    they turned and left  and i just knew that everything they said was so .  i was listening to them  you see  which cameron wasn t  because he was busy thinking of his income tax  and it was as though i could hear their minds  know what i mean .  i knew that there would be a kind of fence around earth  corralling us in  keeping us from leaving  keeping others from coming   in .  i knew it .   and when they left  i got my voice back too late .  i screamed   cameron  for god s sake  they re from space .  why d you send them away .     from space .   he stared at me .   i yelled   look .   i don t know how i did it  he being twenty five pounds  heavier than i  but i yanked him to the window by his shirt collar  busting every shirt button off him .   he was too surprised to resist and when he recovered his wits enough to make like he was going to knock me down  he caught sight of what was going on outside the window and the breath went out of him .   they were getting into the flying saucer  those two men  and the saucer sat there  large  round  shiny and kind of powerful  you know .  then it took off .  it went up easy as a feather and a red orange glow showed up on one side and got brighter as the ship got smaller till it was a shooting star again  slowly fading out .       and i said   sheriff  why d you send them away .  they had to see the president .  now they ll never come back .    cameron said     thought they were foreigners .  they said they had to learn our language .  and they talked funny .     oh  fine .  foreigners .     they said they were foreigners and they looked italian .  i thought they were italian .     how could they be italian .  they said they were from the planet venus .  i heard them .  they said so .     the planet venus .   his eyes got real round .    they said it .  they called it the watery place or something .  you know venus has a lot of water on it .    but you see  it was just an error  a stupid error  the kind anyone could make .  only now earth is never going to have space travel and we ll never as much as land on the moon or have another venusian visit us .  that dope  cameron  and his income tax .   because he whispered   venus .  when they talked about the watery place  i thought they meant venice .    living space  clarence rimbro had no objections to living in the only house on an uninhabited planet  any more than had any other of earth s even trillion of inhabitants .   if someone had questioned him concerning possible objections  he would undoubtedly have stared blankly at the questioner .  his house was much larger than any house could possibly be on earth proper and much more modern .  it had its independent air supply and water supply  ample food in its freezing compartments .  it was isolated from the lifeless planet on which it was located by a force field  but the rooms were built about a five acre farm  under glass  of course   which  in the planet s beneficent sunlight  grew flowers for pleasure and vegetables for health .  it even supported a few chickens .  it gave mrs .  rimbro something to do with herself afternoons  and a place for the two little rimbros to play when they were tired of indoors .   furthermore  if one wanted to be on earth proper  if one insisted on it  if one had to have people around and air one could breathe in the open or water to swim in  one had only to go out of the front door of the house .   so where was the difficulty .   remember  too  that on the lifeless planet on which the rimbro house was located there was complete silence except for the occasional monotonous effects of wind and rain .  there was absolute privacy and the feeling of absolute ownership of two hundred million square miles of planetary surface .   clarence rimbro appreciated all that in his distant way .  he was an accountant  skilled in handling very advanced computer models  precise in his  copyright         by columbia publications  inc .   manners and clothing  not much given to smiling beneath his thin  well kept mustache and properly aware of his own worth .  when he drove from work toward home  he passed the occasional dwelling place on earth proper and he never ceased to stare at them with a certain smugness .   well  either for business reasons or mental perversion  some people simply had to live on earth proper .  it was too bad for them .  after all  earth proper s soil had to supply the minerals and basic food supply for all the trillion of inhabitants  in fifty years  it would be two trillion  and space was at a premium .  houses on earth proper just couldn  t be any bigger than that  and people who had to live in them had to adjust to the fact .   even the process of entering his house had its mild pleasantness .  he would enter the community twist place to which he was assigned  it looked  as did all such  like a rather stumpy obelisk   and there he would invariably find others waiting to use it .  still more would arrive before he reached the head of the line .  it was a sociable time .    how s your planet .    how s yours .   the usual small talk .  sometimes someone would be having trouble .  machinery breakdowns or serious weather that would alter the terrain unfavorably .  not often .   but it passed the time .  then rimbro would be at the head of the line  he would put his key into the slot  the proper combination would be punched  and he would be twisted into a new probability pattern  his own particular probability pattern  the one assigned to him when he married and became a producing citizen  a probability pattern in which life had never developed on earth .  and twisting to this particular lifeless earth  he would walk into his own foyer .   just like that .   he never worried about being in another probability .  why should he .  he never gave it any thought .  there were an infinite number of possible earths .  each existed in its own niche  its own probability pattern .  since on a planet such as earth there was  according to calculation  about a fifty fifty chance of life s developing  half of all the possible earths  still infinite  since half of infinity was infinity  possessed life  and half  still infinite  did not .  and living on about three hundred billion of the unoccupied earths were three hundred billion families  each with its own beautiful house  powered by the sun of that probability  and each securely at peace .  the number of earths so occupied grew by millions each day .   and then one day  rimbro came home and sandra  his wife  said to him  as he entered   there s been the most peculiar noise .    rimbro s eyebrows shot up and he looked closely at his wife .  except for a certain restlessness of her thin hands and a pale look about the corners of her tight mouth  she looked normal .   rimbro said  still holding his topcoat halfway toward the servette that waited patiently for it   noise .  what noise .  i don t hear anything .     it s stopped now   sandra said .   really  it was like a deep thumping or  rumble .  you d hear it a bit .  then it would stop .  then you d hear it a bit and so on .  i ve never heard anything like it .    rimbro surrendered his coat .   but that s quite impossible .     i heard it .     i ll look over the machinery   he mumbled .   something may be wrong .    nothing was  that his accountant s eyes could discover  and  with a shrug  he went to supper .  he listened to the servettes hum busily about their different chores  watched one sweep up the plates and cutlery for disposal and recovery  then said  pursing his lips   maybe one of the servettes is out of order .  i ll check them .     it wasn t anything like that  clarence .    rimbro went to bed  without further concern over the matter  and wakened with his wife s hand clutching his shoulder .  his hand went automatically to the contact patch that set the walls glowing .   what s the matter .  what time is it .    she shook her head .   listen .  listen .    good lord  thought rimbro  there is a noise .  a definite rumbling .  it came and went .    earthquake .   he whispered .  it did happen  of course  though  with all the planet to choose from  they could generally count on having avoided the faulted areas .    all day long .   asked sandra fretfully .   i think it s something else .   and then she voiced the secret terror of every nervous householder .   i think there s someone on the planet with us .  this earth is inhabited .    rimbro did the logical things .  when morning came  he took his wife and children to his wife s mother .  he himself took a day off and hurried to the sector s housing bureau .   he was quite annoyed at all his .   bill ching of the housing bureau was short  jovial and proud of his part mongolian ancestry .  he thought probability patterns had solved every last one of humanity s problems .  alec mishnoff  also of the housing bureau  thought probability patterns were a snare into which humanity had been hopelessly tempted .  he had originally majored in archeology and had studied a variety of antiquarian subjects with which his delicately poised head was still crammed .  his face managed to look sensitive despite overbearing eyebrows  and he lived with a pet notion that so far he had dared tell no one  though preoccupation with it had driven him out of archeology and into housing .   ching was fond of saying   the hell with malthus .   it was almost a verbal trademark of his .   the hell with malthus .  we can t possibly overpopulate now .  however frequently we double and redouble  homo sapiens remains finite in number  and the uninhabited earths remain infinite .  and we don t have to put one house on each planet .  we can put a hundred   a thousand  a million .  plenty of room and plenty of power from each probability sun .     more than one on a planet .   said mishnoff sourly .   ching knew exactly what he meant .  when probability patterns had first been put to use  sole ownership of a planet had been powerful inducement for early settlers .  it appealed to the snob and despot in every one .  what man so poor  ran the slogan  as not to have an empire larger than genghis khan s .  to introduce multiple settling now would outrage everyone .   ching said  with a shrug   all right  it would take psychological preparation .  so what .  that s what it took to start the whole deal in the first place .     and food .   asked mishnoff .    you know we re putting hydroponic works and yeast plants in other probability patterns .  and if we had to  we could cultivate their soil .     wearing space suits and importing oxygen .     we could reduce carbon dioxide for oxygen till the plants got going and they d do the job after that .     given a million years .     mishnoff  the trouble with you   ching said   is you read too many ancient history books .  you re an obstructionist .    but ching was too good natured really to mean that  and mishnoff continued to read books and to worry .  mishnoff longed for the day he could get up the courage necessary to see the head of the section and put right out in plain view bang  like that exactly what it was that was troubling him .   but now  a mr .  clarence rimbro faced them  perspiring slightly and toweringly angry at the fact that it had taken him the better part of two days to reach this far into the bureau .   he reached his exposition s climax by saying   and   say the planet is inhabited and i don t propose to stand for it .    having listened to his story in full  ching tried the soothing approach .  he said   noise like that is probably just some natural phenomenon .     what kind of natural phenomenon .   demanded rimbro .   i want an investigation .  if it s a natural phenomenon  i want to know what kind .  i say the place is inhabited .  it has life on it  by heaven  and i m not paying rent on a planet to share it .  and with dinosaurs  from the sound of it .     come  mr .  rimbro  how long have you lived on your earth .     fifteen and a half years .     and has there ever been any evidence of life .     there is now  and  as a citizen with a production record classified as a i  i demand an investigation .     of course we ll investigate  sir  but we just want to assure you now that everything is all right .  do you realize how carefully we select our probability patterns .     i m an accountant .  i have a pretty good idea   said rimbro at once .    then surely you know our computers cannot fail us .  they never pick a  probability which has been picked before .  they can t possibly .  and they re geared to select only probability patterns in which earth has a carbon dioxide atmosphere  one in which plant life  and therefore animal life  has never developed .  because if plants had evolved  the carbon dioxide would have been reduced to oxygen .  do you understand .     i understand it all very well and i m not here for lectures   said rimbro .   i want an investigation out of you and nothing else .  it is quite humiliating to think i may be sharing my world  my own world  with something or other  and i don t propose to endure it .     no  of course not   muttered ching  avoiding mishnoff s sardonic glance .   we ll be there before night .    they were on their way to the twisting place with full equipment .   mishnoff said   i want to ask you something .  why do you go through that there s no need to worry  sir  routine .  they always worry anyway .  where does it get you .     i ve got to try .  they shouldn  t worry   said ching petulantly .   ever hear of a carbon dioxide planet that was inhabited .  besides  rimbro is the type that starts rumors .  i can spot them .  by the time he s through  if he s encouraged  he ll say his sun went nova .     that happens sometimes   said mishnoff .    so .  one house is wiped out and one family dies .  see  you re an obstructionist .  in the old times  the times you like  if there were a flood in china or someplace  thousands of people would die .  and that s out of a population of a measly billion or two .    mishnoff muttered   how do you know the rimbro planet doesn t have life on it .     carbon dioxide atmosphere .     but suppose   it was no use .  mishnoff couldn t say it .  he finished lamely   suppose plant and animal life develops that can live on carbon  j dioxide .     it s never been observed .     in an infinite number of worlds  anything can happen .   he finished that   in a whisper .   everything must happen .     chances are one in a duodecillion   said ching  shrugging .   they arrived at the twisting point then  and  having utilized the freight twist for their vehicle  thus sending it into the rimbro storage area   they entered the rimbro probability pattern themselves .  first ching  then mishnoff .    a nice house   said ching  with satisfaction .   very nice model .  good taste .    hear anything .   asked mishnoff .      no .    ching wandered into the garden .   hey   he yelled .   rhode island reds .    mishnoff followed  looking up at the glass roof .  the sun looked like the sun of a trillion other earths .   he said absently   there could be plant life  just starting out .  the carbon dioxide might just be starting to drop in concentration .  the computer would never know .     and it would take millions of years for animal life to begin and millions more for it to come out of the sea .     it doesn t have to follow that pattern .    ching put an arm about his partner s shoulder .   you brood .  someday  you ll tell me what s really bothering you  instead of just hinting  and we can straighten you out .    mishnoff shrugged off the encircling arm with an annoyed frown .  ching s tolerance was always hard to bear .  he began   let s not psychothera pize   he broke off  then whispered   listen .    there was a distant rumble .  again .   they placed the seismograph in the center of the room and activated the force field that penetrated downward and bound it rigidly to bedrock .  they watched the quivering needle record the shocks .   mishnoff said   surface waves only .  very superficial .  it s not underground .    ching looked a little more dismal   what is it then .       think   said mishnoff   we d better find out .   his face was gray with apprehension .   we ll have to set up a seismograph at another point and get a fix on the focus of the disturbance .     obviously   said ching .   i ll go out with the other seismograph .  you stay here .     no   said mishnoff  with energy .        go out .    mishnoff felt terrified  but he had no choice .  if this were it  he would be prepared .  he could get a warning through .  sending out an unsuspecting ching would be disastrous .  nor could he warn ching  who would certainly never believe him .   but since mishnoff was not cast in the heroic mold  he trembled as he got into his oxygen suit and fumbled the disrupter as he tried to dissolve the force field locally in order to free the emergency exit .    any reason you want to go  particularly .   asked ching  watching the other s inept manipulations .   i m willing .     it s all right .  i m going out   said mishnoff  out of a dry throat  and stepped into the lock that led out onto the desolate surface of a lifeless earth .  a presumably lifeless earth .   the sight was not unfamiliar to mishnoff .  he had seen its like dozens of times .  bare rock  weathered by wind and rain  crusted and powdered with  sand in the gullies  a small and noisy brook beating itself against its stony course .  all brown and gray  no sign of green .  no sound of life .   yet the sun was the same and  when night fell  the constellations would be the same .   the situation of the dwelling place was in that region which on earth proper would be called labrador .   it was labrador here  too  really .  it had been calculated that in not more than one out of a quadrillion or so earths were there significant changes in the geological development .  the continents were everywhere recognizable down to quite small details .    despite the situation and the time of the year  which was october  the temperature was sticky warm due to the hothouse effect of the carbon dioxide in this earth s dead atmosphere .   from inside his suit  through the transparent visor  mishnoff watched it all somberly .  if the epicenter of the noise were close by  adjusting the second seismograph a mile or so away would be enough for the fix .  if it weren t  they would have to bring in an air scooter .  well  assume the lesser complication to begin with .   methodically  he made his way up a rocky hillside .  once at the top  he could choose his spot .   once at the top  puffing and feeling the heat most unpleasantly  he found he didn t have to .   his heart was pounding so that he could scarcely hear his own voice as he yelled into his radio mouthpiece   hey  ching  there s construction going on .     what .   came back the appalled shout in his ears .   there was no mistake .  ground was being leveled .  machinery was at work .  rock was being blasted out .   mishnoff shouted   they re blasting .  that s the noise .    ching called back   but it s impossible .  the computer would never pick the same probability pattern twice .  it couldn  t .     you don t understand   began mishnoff .   but ching was following his own thought processes .   get over there  mishnoff .  i m coming out  too .     no  damn it .  you stay there   cried mishnoff in alarm .   keep me in radio contact  and for god s sake be ready to leave for earth proper on wings if i give the word .     why .   demanded ching .   what s going on .     i don t know yet   said mishnoff .   give me a chance to find out .    to his own surprise  he noticed his teeth were chattering .   muttering breathless curses at the computer  at probability patterns and at the insatiable need for living space on the part of a trillion human beings expanding in numbers like a puff of smoke  mishnoff slithered and slipped down the other side of the slope  setting stones to rolling and rousing peculiar echoes .   a man came out to meet him  dressed in a gas tight suit  different in many details from mishnoff s own  but obviously intended for the same purpose to lead oxygen to the lungs .   mishnoff gasped breathlessly into his mouthpiece   hold it  ching .  there s a man coming .  keep in touch .   mishnoff felt his heart pump more easily and the bellows of his lungs labor less .   the two men were staring at one another .  the other man was blond and craggy of face .  the look of surprise about him was too extreme to be feigned .   he said in a harsh voice   wer sind sie .  was machen sie hier .    mishnoff was thunderstruck .  he d studied ancient german for two years in the days when he expected to be an archeologist and he followed the comment despite the fact that the pronunciation was not what he had been taught .  the stranger was asking his identity and his business there .   stupidly  mishnoff stammered   sprechen sie deutsch .  and then had to mutter reassurance to ching whose agitated voice in his earpiece was demanding to know what the gibberish was all about .   the german speaking one made no direct answer .  he repeated   wer sind sie .   and added impatiently   hier ist fiir ein verriickten spass keine zeit .    mishnoff didn t feel like a joke either  particularly not a foolish one  but he continued   sprechen sie planetisch .    he did not know the german for  planetary standard language  so he had to guess .  too late  he thought he should have referred to it simply as english .   the other man stared wide eyed at him .   sind sie wahnsinnig .    mishnoff was almost willing to settle for that  but in feeble self defense  he said   i m not crazy  damn it .  i mean   aufdererde woher sie gekom    he gave it up for lack of german  but the new idea that was rattling inside his skull would not quit its nagging .  he had to find some way of testing it .  he said desperately   welches fahr ist es jetzt .    presumably  the stranger  who was questioning his sanity already  would be convinced of mishnoff s insanity now that he was being asked what year it was  but it was one question for which mishnoff had the necessary german .   the other muttered something that sounded suspiciously like good german swearing and then said   es ist dock zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig  und warum    the stream of german that followed was completely incomprehensible to mishnoff  but in any case he had had enough for the moment .  if he translated the german correctly  the year given him was       which was nearly two thousand years in the past .  how could that be .   he muttered   zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig .      a  fa   said the other  with deep sarcasm .   zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig .  der ganze fahr long ist es so gewesen .    mishnoff shrugged .  the statement that it had been so all year long was a feeble witticism even in german and it gained nothing in translation .  he pondered .   but then the other s ironical tone deepening  the german speaking one went on   zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig nach hitler .  hilft das ihnen vielleicht .  nach hitler .    mishnoff yelled with delight .   that does help me .  es hilft .  horen sie  bitte   he went on in broken german interspersed with scraps of planetary   for heaven s sake  urn gottes willen    making it      after hitler was different altogether .   he put german together desperately  trying to explain .   the other frowned and grew thoughtful .  he lifted his gloved hand to stroke his chin or make some equivalent gesture  hit the transparent visor that covered his face and left his hand there uselessly  while he thought .   he said  suddenly   ich heiss george fallenby .    to mishnoff it seemed that the name must be of anglo saxon derivation  although the change in vowel form as pronounced by the other made it seem teutonic .    guten tag   said mishnoff awkwardly .   ich heiss alec mishnoff   and was suddenly aware of the slavic derivation of his own name .    kommen sie mit mir  hen mishnoff   said fallenby .   mishnoff followed with a strained smile  muttering into his transmitter   it s all right  ching .  it s all right .    back on earth proper  mishnoff faced the sector s bureau head  who had grown old in the service  whose every gray hair betokened a problem met and solved  and every missing hair a problem averted .  he was a cautious man with eyes still bright and teeth that were still his own .  his name was berg .   he shook his head .   and they speak german  but the german you studied was two thousand years old .     true   said mishnoff .   but the english hemingway used is two thousand years old and planetary is close enough for anyone to be able to read it .     hmp .  and who s this hitler .     he was a sort of tribal chief in ancient times .  he led the german tribe in one of the wars of the twentieth century  just about the time the atomic age started and true history began .     before the devastation  you mean .     right .  there was a series of wars then .  the anglo saxon countries won out  and i suppose that s why the earth speaks planetary .     and if hitler and his germans had won out  the world would speak german instead .     they have won out on fallenby s earth  sir  and they do speak german .     and make their dates  after hitler  instead of a . d .  .     right .  and i suppose there s an earth in which the slavic tribes won out and everyone speaks russian .     somehow   said berg   it seems to me we should have foreseen it  and yet  as far as i know  no one has .  after all  there are an infinite number of inhabited earths  and we can t be the only one that has decided to solve the problem of unlimited population growth by expanding into the worlds of probability .     exactly   said mishnoff earnestly   and it seems to me that if you think of it  there must be countless inhabited earths so doing and there must be many multiple occupations in the three hundred billion earths we ourselves occupy .  the only reason we caught this one is that  by sheer chance  they decided to build within a mile of the dwelling we had placed there .  this is something we must check .     you imply we ought to search all our earths .     i do  sir .  we ve got to make some settlement with other inhabited earths .  after all  there is room for all of us and to expand without agreement may result in all sorts of trouble and conflict .     yes   said berg thoughtfully .     agree with you .    clarence rimbro stared suspiciously at berg s old face  creased now into all manner of benevolence .    you re sure now .     absolutely   said the bureau head .   we re sorry that you ve had to accept temporary quarters for the last two weeks     more like three .      three weeks  but you will be compensated .     what was the noise .     purely geological  sir .  a rock was delicately balanced and  with the wind  it made occasional contact with the rocks of the hillside .  we ve removed it and surveyed the area to make certain that nothing similar will occur again .    rimbro clutched his hat and said   well  thanks for your trouble .     no thanks necessary  i assure you  mr .  rimbro .  this is our job .    rimbro was ushered out  and berg turned to mishnoff  who had remained a quiet spectator of this completion of the rimbro affair .   berg said   the germans were nice about it  anyway .  they admitted we had priority and got off .  room for everybody  they said .  of course  as it turned out  they build any number of dwellings on each unoccupied world .   .   .   .  and now there s the project of surveying our other worlds and making similar agreements with whomever we find .  it s all strictly confidential  too .   it can t be made known to the populace without plenty of preparation .   .   .   .  still  none of this is what i want to speak to you about .     oh .   said mishnoff .  developments had not noticeably cheered him .  his own bogey still concerned him .   berg smiled at the younger man .   you understand  mishnoff  we in the bureau  and in the planetary government  too  are very appreciative of your quick thinking  of your understanding of the situation .  this could have developed into something very tragic  had it not been for you .  this appreciation will take some tangible form .     thank you  sir .     but  as i said once before  this is something many of us should have thought of .  how is it you did .   .   .   .  now we ve gone into your background a little .  your co worker  ching  tells us you have hinted in the past at some serious danger involved in our probability pattern setup  and that you insisted on going out to meet the germans although you were obviously frightened .  you were anticipating what you actually found  were you not .  and how did you do it .    mishnoff said confusedly   no  no .  that was not in my mind at all .  it came as a surprise .  i    suddenly he stiffened .  why not now .  they were grateful to him .  he had proved that he was a man to be taken into account .  one unexpected thing had already happened .   he said firmly   there s something else .     yes .     how did one begin .    there s no life in the solar system other than the life on earth .     that s right   said berg benevolently .    and computation has it that the probability of developing any form of interstellar travel is so low as to be infinitesimal .     what are you getting at .     that all this is so in this probability .  but there must be some probability patterns in which other life does exist in the solar system or in which interstellar drives are developed by dwellers in other star systems .    berg frowned .   theoretically .     in one of these probabilities  earth may be visited by such intelligences .  if it were a probability pattern in which earth is inhabited  it won t affect us  they ll have no connection with us in earth proper .  but if it were a probability pattern in which earth is uninhabited and they set up some sort of a base  they may find  by happenstance  one of our dwelling places .     why ours .   demanded berg dryly .   what not a dwelling place of the germans  for instance .     because we spot our dwellings one to a world .  the german earth doesn t .  probably very few others do .  the odds are in favor of us by billions  to one .  and if extraterrestrials do find such a dwelling  they ll investigate and find the route to earth proper  a highly developed  rich world .     not if we turn off the twisting place   said berg .    once they know that twisting places exist  they can construct their own   said mishnoff .   a race intelligent enough to travel through space could do that  and from the equipment in the dwelling they would take over  they could easily spot our particular probability .   .   .   .  and then how would we handle extraterrestrials .  they re not germans  or other earths .  they would have alien psychologies and motivations .  and we re not even on our guard .  we just keep setting up more and more worlds and increasing the chance every day that    his voice had risen in excitement and berg shouted at him   nonsense .  this is all ridiculous    the buzzer sounded and the communiplate brightened and showed the face of ching .  ching s voice said   i m sorry to interrupt  but     what is it .   demanded berg savagely .    there s a man here i don t know what to do with .  he s drunk or crazy .  he complains that his home is surrounded and that there are things staring through the glass roof of his garden .     things .   cried mishnoff .    purple things with big red veins  three eyes and some sort of tentacles instead of hair .  they have    but mishnoff and berg didn t hear the rest .  they were staring at each other in sick horror .   the message  they drank beer and reminisced as men will who have met after long separation .  they called to mind the days under fire .  they remembered sergeants and girls  both with exaggeration .  deadly things became humorous in retrospect  and trifles disregarded for ten years were hauled out for airing .   including  of course  the perennial mystery .    how do you account for it .   asked the first .   who started it .    the second shrugged .   no one started it .  everyone was doing it  like a disease .  you  too  i suppose .    the first chuckled .   the third one said softly   i never saw the fun in it .  maybe because i came across it first when i was under fire for the first time .  north africa .     really .   said the second .    the first night on the beaches of oran .  i was getting under cover  making for some native shack and i saw it in the light of a flare    george was deliriously happy .  two years of red tape and now he was finally back in the past .  now he could complete his paper on the social life of the foot soldier of world war ii with some authentic details .   out of the warless  insipid society of the thirtieth century  he found himself for one glorious moment in the tense  superlative drama of the warlike twentieth .   north africa .  site of the first great sea borne invasion of the war .  how the temporal physicists had scanned the area for the perfect spot and mo copyright         by fantasy house  inc .   ment .  this shadow of an empty wooden building was it .  no human would approach for a known number of minutes .  no blast would seriously affect it in that time .  by being there  george would not affect history .  he would be that ideal of the temporal physicist  the  pure observer .    it was even more terrific than he had imagined .  there was the perpetual roar of artillery  the unseen tearing of planes overhead .  there were the periodic lines of tracer bullets splitting the sky and the occasional ghastly glow of a flare twisting downward .   and he was here .  he  george  was part of the war  part of an intense kind of life forever gone from the world of the thirtieth century  grown tame and gentle .   he imagined he could see the shadows of an advancing column of soldiers  hear the low cautious monosyllables slip from one to another .  how he longed to be one of them in truth  not merely a momentary intruder  a  pure observer .    he stopped his note taking and stared at his stylus  its micro light hypnotizing him for a moment .  a sudden idea had overwhelmed him and he looked at the wood against which his shoulder pressed .  this moment must not pass unforgotten into history .  surely doing this would affect nothing .  he would use the older english dialect and there would be no suspicion .   he did it quickly and then spied a soldier running desperately toward the structure  dodging a burst of bullets .  george knew his time was up  and  even as he knew it  found himself back in the thirtieth century .   it didn t matter .  for those few minutes he had been part of world war ii .  a small part  but part .  and others would know it .  they might not know they knew it  but someone perhaps would repeat the message to himself .   someone  perhaps that man running for shelter  would read it and know that along with all the heroes of the twentieth century was the  pure observer   the man from the thirtieth century  george kilroy .  he was there .   satisfaction guaranteed  tony was tall and darkly handsome  with an incredibly patrician air drawn into every line of his unchangeable expression  and claire belmont regarded him through the crack in the door with a mixture of horror and dismay .    i can t  larry .  i just can t have him in the house .   feverishly  she was searching her paralyzed mind for a stronger way of putting it  some way that would make sense and settle things  but she could only end with a simple  repetition .     well  i can t .    larry belmont regarded his wife stiffly  and there was that spark of impatience in his eyes that claire hated to see  since she felt her own incompetence mirrored in it .   we re committed  claire   he said   and i can t have you backing out now .  the company is sending me to washington on this basis  and it probably means a promotion .  it s perfectly safe and you know it .  what s your objection .    she frowned helplessly .   it just gives me the chills .  i couldn t bear him .     he s as human as you or i  almost .  so  no nonsense .  come  get out there .    his hand was in the small of her back  shoving  and she found herself in her own living room  shivering .  it was there  looking at her with a precise politeness  as though appraising his hostess to be of the next three weeks .  dr .  susan calvin was there  too  sitting stiffly in thin lipped abstraction .  she had the cold  faraway look of someone who has worked with machines so long that a little of the steel had entered the blood .   copyright         by ziff davis publishing co .    hello   crackled claire in general  and ineffectual  greeting .   but larry was busily saving the situation with a spurious gaiety .   here  claire  i want you to meet tony  a swell guy .  this is my wife  claire  tony  old boy .   larry s hand draped itself amiably over tony s shoulder  but tony remained unresponsive and expressionless under the pressure .   he said   how do you do  mrs .  belmont .    and claire jumped at tony s voice .  it was deep and mellow  smooth as the hair on his head or the skin on his face .   before she could stop herself  she said   oh  my you talk .     why not .  did you expect that i didn t .    but claire could only smile weakly .  she didn t really know what she had expected .  she looked away  then let him slide gently into the comer of her eye .  his hair was smooth and black  like polished plastic or was it really composed of separate hairs .  and was the even  olive skin of his hands and face continued on past the obscurement of his formally cut clothing .   she was lost in the shuddering wonder of it  and had to force her thoughts back into place to meet dr .  calvin s flat  unemotional voice .    mrs .  belmont  i hope you appreciate the importance of this experiment .  your husband tells me he has given you some of the background .  i would like to give you more  as the senior psychologist of the u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .    tony is a robot .  his actual designation on the company files is tn    but he will answer to tony .  he is not a mechanical monster  nor simply a calculating machine of the type that were developed during world war ii  fifty years ago .  he has an artificial brain nearly as complicated as our own .  it is an immense telephone switchboard on an atomic scale  so that billions of possible  telephone connections  can be compressed into an instrument that will fit inside a skull .    such brains are manufactured for each model of robot specifically .  each contains a precalculated set of connections so that each robot knows the english language to start with and enough of anything else that may be necessary to perform his job .    until now  u . s .  robots has confined its manufacturing activity to industrial models for use in places where human labor is impractical in deep mines  for instance  or in underwater work .  but we want to invade the city and the home .  to do so  we must get the ordinary man and woman to accept these robots without fear .  you understand that there is nothing to fear .     there isn t  claire   interposed larry earnestly .   take my word for it .  it s impossible for him to do any harm .  you know i wouldn t leave him with you otherwise .    claire cast a quick  secret glance at tony and lowered her voice .   what if i make him angry .     you needn t whisper   said dr .  calvin calmly .   he can t get angry with  you  my dear .  i told you that the switchboard connections of his brain were predetermined .  well  the most important connection of all is what we call the first law of robotics   and it is merely this   no robot can harm a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   all robots are built so .  no robot can be forced in any way to do harm to any human .  so  you see  we need you and tony as a preliminary experiment for our own guidance  while your husband is in washington to arrange for government supervised legal tests .     you mean all this isn t legal .    larry cleared his throat .   not just yet  but it s all right .  he won t leave the house  and you mustn t let anyone see him .  that s all .   .   .   .  and  claire  i d stay with you  but i know too much about the robots .  we must have a completely inexperienced tester so that we can have severe conditions .  it s necessary .     oh  well   muttered claire .  then  as a thought struck her   but what does he do .     housework   said dr .  calvin shortly .   she got up to leave  and it was larry who saw her to the front door .  claire stayed behind drearily .  she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror above the mantelpiece  and looked away hastily .  she was very tired of her small  mousy face and her dim  unimaginative hair .  then she caught tony s eyes upon her and almost smiled before she remembered .   .   .   .   he was only a machine .   larry belmont was on his way to the airport when he caught a glimpse of gladys claffern .  she was the type of woman who seemed made to be seen in glimpses .   .   .   .  perfectly and precisely manufactured  dressed with thoughtful hand and eye  too gleaming to be stared at .   the little smile that preceded her and the faint scent that trailed her were a pair of beckoning fingers .  larry felt his stride break  he touched his hat  then hurried on .   as always he felt that vague anger .  if claire could only push her way into the claffern clique  it would help so much .  but what was the use .   claire .  the few times she had come face to face with gladys  the little fool had been tongue tied .  he had no illusions .  the testing of tony was his big chance  and it was in claire s hands .  how much safer it would be in the hands of someone like gladys claffern .   claire woke the second morning to the sound of a subdued knock on the bedroom door .  her mind clamored  then went icy .  she had avoided tony the first day  smiling thinly when she met him and brushing past with a wordless sound of apology .    is that you tony .     yes  mrs .  belmont .  may i enter .    she must have said yes  because he was in the room  quite suddenly and noiselessly .  her eyes and nose were simultaneously aware of the tray he was carrying .    breakfast .   she said .    if you please .    she wouldn t have dared to refuse  so she pushed herself slowly into a sitting position and received it  poached eggs  buttered toast  coffee .    i have brought the sugar and cream separately   said tony .   i expect to learn your preference with time  in this and in other things .    she waited .   tony  standing there straight and pliant as a metal rule  asked  after a moment   would you prefer to eat in privacy .     yes .   .  .  .  i mean  if you don t mind .     will you need help later in dressing .     oh  my  no .   she clutched frantically at the sheet  so that the coffee hovered at the edge of catastrophe .  she remained so  in rigor  then sank helplessly back against the pillow when the door closed him out of her sight again .   she got through breakfast somehow .   .  .  .  he was only a machine  and if it were only more visible that he were it wouldn t be so frightening .  or if his expression would change .  it just stayed there  nailed on .  you couldn t tell what went on behind those dark eyes and that smooth  olive skin stuff .  the coffee cup beat a faint castanet for a moment as she set it back  empty  on the tray .   then she realized that she had forgotten to add the sugar and cream after all  and she did so hate black coffee .   she burned a straight path from bedroom to kitchen after dressing .  it was her house  after all  and there wasn t anything frippy about her  but she liked her kitchen clean .  he should have waited for supervision .   .   .   .   but when she entered  she found a kitchen that might have been minted  fire new from the factory the moment before .  v  she stopped  stared  turned on her heel and nearly ran into tony .  she yelped .    may i help .   he asked .    tony   and she scraped the anger off the edges of her mind s panic   you must make some noise when you walk .  i can t have you stalking me  you know .   .   .   .  didn t you use this kitchen .     i did  mrs .  belmont .     it doesn t look it .     i cleaned up afterward .  isn t that customary .    claire opened her eyes wide .  after all  what could one say to that .  she opened the oven compartment that held the pots  took a quick  unseeing  look at the metallic glitter inside  then said with a tremor   very good .  quite satisfactory .    if at the moment  he had beamed  if he had smiled  if he had quirked the corner of his mouth the slightest bit  she felt that she could have warmed to him .  but he remained an english lord in repose  as he said   thank you  mrs .  belmont .  would you come into the living room .    she did  and it struck her at once .   have you been polishing the furniture .     is it satisfactory  mrs .  belmont .     but when .  you didn t do it yesterday .     last night  of course .     you burned the lights all night .     oh  no .  that wouldn t have been necessary .  i ve a built in ultra violet source .  i can see in ultraviolet .  and  of course  i don t require sleep .    he did require admiration  though .  she realized that  then .  he had to know that he was pleasing her .  but she couldn t bring herself to supply that pleasure for him .   she could only say sourly   your kind will put ordinary houseworkers out of business .     there is work of much greater importance they can be put to in the world  once they are freed of drudgery .  after all  mrs .  belmont  things like myself can be manufactured .  but nothing yet can imitate the creativity and versatility of a human brain  like yours .    and though his face gave no hint  his voice was warmly surcharged with awe and admiration  so that claire flushed and muttered   my brain .  you can have it .    tony approached a little and said   you must be unhappy to say such a thing .  is there anything i can do .    for a moment  claire felt like laughing .  it was a ridiculous situation .  here was an animated carpet sweeper  dishwasher  furniture polisher  general factotum  rising from the factory table and offering his services as consoler and confidant .   yet she said suddenly  in a burst of woe and voice   mr .  belmont doesn t think i have a brain  if you must know .   .   .   .  and i suppose i haven t .   she couldn t cry in front of him .  she felt  for some reason  that she had the honor of the human race to support against this mere creation .    it s lately   she added .   it was all right when he was a student  when he was just starting .  but i can t be a big man s wife  and he s getting to be a big man .  he wants me to be a hostess and an entry into social life for him like g guh guh gladys claffern .    her nose was red  and she looked away .   but tony wasn t watching her .  his eyes wandered about the room .   i can help you run the house .     but it s no good   she said fiercely .   it needs a touch i can t give it .  i can  only make it comfortable  i can t ever make it the kind they take pictures of for the home beautiful magazines .     do you want that kind .     does it do any good wanting .    tony s eyes were on her  full .   i could help .     do you know anything about interior decoration .     is it something a good housekeeper should know .     oh  yes .     then i have the potentialities of learning it .  can you get me books on the subject .    something started then .   claire  clutching her hat against the brawling liberties of the wind  had manipulated two fat volumes on the home arts back from the public library .  she watched tony as he opened one of them and flipped the pages .  it was the first time she had watched his fingers flicker at anything like fine work .   i don t see how they do it  she thought  and on a sudden impulse reached for his hand and pulled it toward herself .  tony did not resist  but let it lie limp for inspection .   she said   it s remarkable .  even your fingernails look natural .     that s deliberate  of course   said tony .  then  chattily   the skin is a flexible plastic  and the skeletal framework is a light metal alloy .  does that amuse you .     oh  no .   she lifted her reddened face .   i just feel a little embarrassed at sort of poking into your insides .  it s none of my business .  you don t ask me about mine .     my brain paths don t include that type of curiosity .  i can only act within my limitations  you know .    and claire felt something tighten inside her in the silence that followed .  why did she keep forgetting he was a machine .  now the thing itself had to remind her .  was she so starved for sympathy that she would even accept a robot as equal because he sympathized .   she noticed tony was still flipping the pages almost helplessly and there was a quick  shooting sense of relieved superiority within her .   you can t read  can you .    tony looked up at her  his voice calm  unreproachful .   i am reading  mrs .  belmont .     but   she pointed at the book in a meaningless gesture .    i am scanning the pages  if that s what you mean .  my sense of reading is photographic .    it was evening then  and when claire eventually went to bed tony was well into the second volume  sitting there in the dark  or what seemed dark to claire s limited eyes .   her last thought  the one that clamored at her just as her mind let go and  tumbled  was a queer one .  she remembered his hand again  the touch of it .  it had been warm and soft  like a human being s .  how clever of the factory  she thought  and softly ebbed to sleep .   it was the library continuously  thereafter  for several days .  tony suggested the fields of study  which branched out quickly .  there were books on color matching and on cosmetics  on carpentry and on fashions  on art and on the history of costumes .   he turned the pages of each book before his solemn eyes  and  as quickly as he turned  he read  nor did he seem capable of forgetting .   before the end of the week  he had insisted on cutting her hair  introducing her to a new method of arranging it  adjusting her eyebrow line a bit and changing the shade of her powder and lipstick .   she had palpitated in nervous dread for half an hour under the delicate touch of his inhuman fingers and then looked in the mirror .    there is more that can be done   said tony   especially in clothes .  how do you find it for a beginning .    and she hadn t answered  not for quite a while .  not until she had absorbed the identity of the stranger in the glass and cooled the wonder at the beauty of it all .  then she had said chokingly  never once taking her eyes from the warming image   yes  tony  quite good for a beginning .    she said nothing of this in her letters to larry .  let him see it all at once .  and something in her realized that it wasn t only the surprise she would enjoy .  it was going to be a kind of revenge .   tony said one morning   it s time to start buying  and i m not allowed to leave the house .  if i write out exactly what we must have  can i trust you to get it .  we need drapery  and furniture fabric  wallpaper  carpeting  paint  clothing and any number of small things .     you can t get these things to your own specifications at a stroke s notice   said claire doubtfully .    you can get fairly close  if you go through the city and if money is no object .     but  tony  money is certainly an object .     not at all .  stop off at u . s .  robots in the first place .  i ll write a note for you .  you see dr .  calvin  and tell her that i said it was part of the experiment .    dr .  calvin  somehow  didn t frighten her as on that first evening .  with her new face and a new hat  she couldn t be quite the old claire .  the psychologist listened carefully  asked a few questions  nodded and then claire found herself walking out  armed with an unlimited charge account against the assets of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .   it is wonderful what money will do .  with a store s contents at her feet  a  saleslady s dictum was not necessarily a voice from above  the uplifted eyebrow of a decorator was not anything like jove s thunder .   and once  when an exalted plumpness at one of the most lordly of the garment salons had insistently poohed her description of the wardrobe she must have with counterpronouncements in accents of the purest fifty seventh street french  she called up tony  then held the phone out to monsieur .    if you don t mind  voice firm  but fingers twisting a bit  i d like you to talk to my uh secretary .    pudgy proceeded to the phone with a solemn arm crooked behind his back .  he lifted the phone in two fingers and said delicately   yes .   a short pause  another  yes   then a much longer pause  a squeaky beginning of an objection that perished quickly  another pause  a very meek  yes   and the phone was restored to its cradle .    if madam will come with me   he said  hurt and distant   i will try to supply her needs .     fust a second .   claire rushed back to the phone  and dialed again .   hello  tony .  i don t know what you said  but it worked .  thanks .  you re a   she struggled for the appropriate word  gave up and ended in a final little squeak    a a dear .    it was gladys claffern looking at her when she turned from the phone again .  a slightly amused and slightly amazed gladys claffem  looking at her out of a face tilted a bit to one side .    mrs .  belmont .    it all drained out of claire just like that .  she could only nod stupidly  like a marionette .   gladys smiled with an insolence you couldn t put your finger on .   i didn t know you shopped here .   as if the place had  in her eyes  definitely lost caste through the fact .    i don t  usually   said claire humbly .    and haven t you done something to your hair .  it s quite quaint .   .   .   .  oh  i hope you ll excuse me  but isn t your husband s name lawrence .  it seems to me that it s lawrence .    claire s teeth clenched  but she had to explain .  she had to .   tony is a friend of my husband s .  he s helping me select some things .     i understand .  and quite a dear about it  i imagine .   she passed on smiling  carrying the light and the warmth of the world with her .   claire did not question the fact that it was to tony that she turned for consolation .  ten days had cured her of reluctance .  and she could weep before him  weep and rage .    i was a complete f fool   she stormed  wrenching at her water togged handkerchief .   she does that to me .  i don t know why .  she just does .  i  should have kicked her .  i should have knocked her down and stamped on her .     can you hate a human being so much .   asked tony  in puzzled softness .   that part of a human mind is closed to me .     oh  it isn t she   she moaned .   it s myself  i suppose .  she s everything i want to be on the outside  anyway .   .   .   .  and i can t be .    tony s voice was forceful and low in her ear .   you can be  mrs .  belmont .  you can be .  we have ten days yet  and in ten days the house will no longer be itself .  haven t we been planning that .     and how will that help me with her .     invite her here .  invite her friends .  have it the evening before i before i leave .  it will be a housewarming  in a way .     she won t come .     yes  she will .  she ll come to laugh .   .   .   .  and she won t be able to .     do you really think so .  oh  tony  do you think we can do it .   she had both his hands in hers .   .   .   .  and then  with her face flung aside   but what good would it be .  it won t be i  it will be you that s doing it .  i can t ride your back .     nobody lives in splendid singleness   whispered tony .   they ve put that knowledge in me .  what you  or anyone  see in gladys claffern is not just gladys claffern .  she rides the back of all that money and social position can bring .  she doesn t question that .  why should you .   .   .   .  and look at it this way  mrs .  belmont .  i am manufactured to obey  but the extent of my obedience is for myself to determine .  i can follow orders niggardly or liberally .  for you  it is liberal  because you are what i have been manufactured to see human beings as .  you are kind  friendly  unassuming .  mrs .  claffem  as you describe her  is not  and i wouldn t obey her as i would you .  so it is you  and not i  mrs .  belmont  that is doing all this .    he withdrew his hands from hers then  and claire looked at that expressionless face no one could read wondering .  she was suddenly frightened   again in a completely new way .   she swallowed nervously and stared at her hands  which were still tingling   with the pressure of his fingers .  she hadn t imagined it  his fingers had pressed hers  gently  tenderly  just before they moved away .    nof   its fingers  .   .   .  its fingers .   .   .   .   she ran to the bathroom and scrubbed her hands blindly  uselessly .   she was a bit shy of him the next day  watching him narrowly  waiting to see what might follow and for a while nothing did .   tony was working .  if there was any difficulty in technique in putting up wallpaper  or utilizing the quick drying paint  tony s activity did not show it .  his hands moved precisely  his fingers were deft and sure .   he worked all night .  she never heard him  but each morning was a new  adventure .  she couldn t count the number of things that had been done  and by evening she was still finding new touches and another night had  come .   she tried to help only once and her human clumsiness marred that .  he was in the next room  and she was hanging a picture in the spot marked by tony s mathematical eyes .  the little mark was there  the picture was there  and a revulsion against idleness was there .   but she was nervous  or the ladder was rickety .  it didn t matter .  she felt it going  and she cried out .  it tumbled without her  for tony  with far more than flesh and blood quickness  had been under her .   his calm  dark eyes said nothing at all  and his warm voice said only words .   are you hurt  mrs .  belmont .    she noticed for an instant that her falling hand must have mussed that sleek hair of his  because for the first time she could see for herself that it was composed of distinct strands fine black hairs .   and then  all at once  she was conscious of his arms about her shoulders and under her knees holding her tightly and warmly .   she pushed  and her scream was loud in her own ears .  she spent the rest of the day in her room  and thereafter she slept with a chair upended against the doorknob of her bedroom door .   she had sent out the invitations  and  as tony had said  they were accepted .  she had only to wait for the last evening .   it came  too  after the rest of them  in its proper place .  the house was scarcely her own .  she went through it one last time and every room had been changed .  she  herself  was in clothes she would never have dared wear before .   .   .   .  and when you put them on  you put on pride and confidence  with them .   she tried a polite look of contemptuous amusement before the minor  and the mirror sneered back at her masterfully .   what would larry say .   .  .  .  it didn t matter  somehow .  the exciting days weren t coming with him .  they were leaving with tony .  now wasn t that strange .  she tried to recapture her mood of three weeks before and failed completely .   the clock shrieked eight at her in eight breathless installments  and she turned to tony .   they ll be here soon  tony .  you d better get into the basement .  we can t let them    she stared a moment  then said weakly   tony .   and more strongly   tony .   and nearly a scream   tony .    but his arms were around her now  his face was close to hers  the pressure of his embrace was relentless .  she heard his voice through a haze of emotional jumble .    claire   the voice said   there are many things i am not made to understand  and this must be one of them .  i am leaving tomorrow  and i don t  want to .  i find that there is more in me than just a desire to please you .  isn t it strange .    his face was closer  his lips were warm  but with no breath behind them  for machines do not breathe .  they were almost on hers .    .   .   .  and the bell sounded .   for a moment  she struggled breathlessly  and then he was gone and nowhere in sight  and the bell was sounding again .  its intermittent shrillness was insistent .   the curtains on the front windows had been pulled open .  they had been closed fifteen minutes earlier .  she knew that .   they must have seen  then .  they must all have seen everything .   they came in so politely  all in a bunch the pack come to howl with their sharp  darting eyes piercing everywhere .  they had seen .  why else would gladys ask in her jabbingest manner after lany .  and claire was spurred to a desperate and reckless defiance .   yes  he is away .  he ll be back tomorrow  i suppose .  no  i haven t been lonely here myself .  not a bit .  i ve had an exciting time .  and she laughed at them .  why not .  what could they do .  larry would know the truth  if it ever came to him  the story of what they thought they saw .   but they didn t laugh .   she could read that in the fury in gladys claffern s eyes  in the false sparkle of her words  in her desire to leave early .  and as she parted with them  she caught one last  anonymous whisper disjointed .     .   .   .  never saw anything like  .  .  .  so handsome    and she knew what it was that had enabled her to finger snap them so .  let each cat mew  and let each cat know that she might be prettier than claire belmont  and grander  and richer but not one  not one  could have so handsome a lover .   and then she remembered again again again  that tony was a machine  and her skin crawled .    go away .  leave me be .   she cried to the empty room and ran to her bed .  she wept wakefully all that night and the next morning  almost before dawn  when the streets were empty  a car drew up to the house and took tony away .   lawrence belmont passed dr .  calvin s office  and  on impulse  knocked .  he found her with mathematician peter bogert  but did not hesitate on that account .   he said   claire tells me that u . s .  robots paid for all that was done at my house     yes   said eh  .  calvin .   we ve written it off  as a valuable and necessary  part of the experiment .  with your new position as associate engineer  you ll be able to keep it up  i think .     that s not what i m worried about .  with washington agreeing to the tests  we ll be able to get a tn model of our own by next year  i think .   he turned hesitantly  as though to go  and as hesitantly turned back again .    well  mr .  belmont .   asked dr .  calvin  after a pause .    i wonder   began larry .   i wonder what really happened there .  she  claire  i mean seems so different .  it s not just her looks though  frankly  i m amazed .   he laughed nervously .   it s her .  she s not my wife  really i can t explain it .     why try .  are you disappointed with any part of the change .     on the contrary .  but it s a little frightening  too  you see     i wouldn t worry  mr .  belmont .  your wife has handled herself very well .  frankly  i never expected to have the experiment yield such a thorough and complete test .  we know exactly what corrections must be made in the tn model  and the credit belongs entirely to mrs .  belmont .  if you want me to be very honest  i think your wife deserves your promotion more than you do .    larry flinched visibly at that .   as long as it s in the family   he murmured unconvincingly and left .   susan calvin looked after him   i think that hurt i hope .   .   .   .  have you read tony s report  peter .     thoroughly   said bogert .   and won t the tn   model need changes .     oh  you think so  too .   questioned calvin sharply .   what s your reasoning .    bogert frowned .   i don t need any .  it s obvious on the face of it that we can t have a robot loose which makes love to his mistress  if you don t mind the pun .     love .  peter  you sicken me .  you really don t understand .  that machine had to obey the first law .  he couldn t allow harm to come to a human being  and harm was coming to claire belmont through her own sense of inadequacy .  so he made love to her  since what woman would fail to appreciate the compliment of being able to stir passion in a machine in a cold  soulless machine .  and he opened the curtains that night deliberately  that the others might see and envy without any risk possible to claire s marriage .  i think it was clever of tony     do you .  what s the difference whether it was pretense or not  susan .  it still has its horrifying effect .  read the report again .  she avoided him .  she screamed when he held her .  she didn t sleep that last night in hysterics .  we can t have that .     peter  you re blind .  you re as blind as i was .  the tn model will be rebuilt entirely  but not for your reason .  quite otherwise  quite otherwise .   strange that i overlooked it in the first place   her eyes were opaquely thoughtful   but perhaps it reflects a shortcoming in myself .  you see  peter  machines can t fall in love  but even when it s hopeless and horrifying  women can .    hell fire  there was a stir as of a very polite first night audience .  only a handful of scientists were present  a sprinkling of high brass  some congressmen  a few newsmen .   alvin homer of the washington bureau of the continental press found himself next to joseph vincenzo of los alamos  and said   now we ought to leam something .    vincenzo stared at him through bifocals and said   not the important thing .    homer frowned .  this was to be the first super slow motion films of an atomic explosion .  with trick lenses changing directional polarization in flickers  the moment of explosion would be divided into billionth second snaps .  yesterday  an a bomb had exploded .  today  those snaps would show the explosion in incredible detail .   horner said   you think this won t work .    vincenzo looked tormented .   it will work .  we ve run pilot tests .  but the important thing     which is .     that these bombs are man s death sentence .  we don t seem to be able to learn that .   vincenzo nodded .   look at them here .  they re excited and thrilled  but not afraid .    the newsman said   they know the danger .  they re afraid  too .     not enough   said the scientist .   i ve seen men watch an h bomb blow an island into a hole and then go home and sleep .  that s the way men are .   copyright         by king size publications  inc .   for thousands of years  hell fire has been preached to them  and it s made no real impression .     hell fire  are you religious  sir .     what you saw yesterday was hell fire .  an exploding atom bomb is hell fire .  literally .    that was enough for homer .  he got up and changed his seat  but watched the audience uneasily .  were any afraid .  did any worry about hell fire .  it didn t seem so to him .   the lights went out  the projector started .  on the screen  the firing tower stood gaunt .  the audience grew tensely quiet .   then a dot of light appeared at the apex of the tower  a brilliant  burning point  slowly budding in a lazy  outward elbowing  this way and that  taking on uneven shapes of light and shadow  growing oval .   a man cried out chokingly  then others .  a hoarse babble of noise  followed by thick silence .  horner could smell fear  taste terror in his own mouth  feel his blood freeze .   the oval fireball had sprouted projections  then paused a moment in stasis  before expanding rapidly into a bright and featureless sphere .   that moment of stasis the fireball had shown dark spots for eyes  with dark lines for thin  flaring eyebrows  a hairline coming down v shaped  a mouth twisted upward  laughing wildly in the hell fire and horns .   the last trump  the archangel gabriel was quite casual about the whole thing .  idly  he let the tip of one wing graze the planet mars  which  being of mere matter  was unaffected by the contact .   he said   it s a settled matter  etheriel .  there s nothing to be done about it now .  the day of resurrection is due .    etheriel  a very junior seraph who had been created not quite a thousand years earlier as men counted time  quivered so that distinct vortices appeared in the continuum .  ever since his creation  he had been in immediate charge of earth and environs .  as a job  it was a sinecure  a cubbyhole  a dead end  but through the centuries he had come to take a perverse pride in the world .    but you ll be disrupting my world without notice .     not at all .  not at all .  certain passages occur in the book of daniel and in the apocalypse of st .  john which are clear enough .     they are .  having been copied from scribe to scribe .  i wonder if two words in a row are left unchanged .     there are hints in the rig veda  in the confucian analects     which are the property of isolated cultural groups which exist as a thin aristocracy     the gilgamesh chronicle speaks out plainly .     much of the gilgamesh chronicle was destroyed with the library of ashurbanipal sixteen hundred years  earth style  before my creation .    copyright         by king size publications  inc .    . j  there are certain features of the great pyramid and a pattern in the inlaid jewels of the taj mahal     which are so subtle that no man has ever rightly interpreted them .   j gabriel said wearily   if you re going to object to everything  there s no fise discussing the matter .  in any case  you ought to know about it .  in matters concerning earth  you re omniscient .       yes  if i choose to be .  i ve had much to concern me here and investigating the possibilities of resurrection did not  i confess  occur to me .     well  it should have .  all the papers involved are in the files of the council of ascendants .  you could have availed yourself of them at any time .     i tell you all my time was needed here .  you have no idea of the deadly efficiency of the adversary on this planet .  it took all my efforts to curb him  and even so     why  yes  gabriel stroked a comet as it passed  he does seem to have won his little victories .  i note as i let the interlocking factual pattern of this miserable little world flow through me that this is one of those setups with matter energy equivalence .   i i  so it is   said etheriel .  j  and they are playing with it .   s  i m afraid so .   ji  then what better time for ending the matter .     i ll be able to handle it  i assure you .  their nuclear bombs will not destroy them .     i wonder .  well  now suppose you let me continue  etheriel .  the appointed moment approaches .    the seraph said stubbornly   i would like to see the documents in the case .     if you insist .   the wording of an act of ascendancy appeared in glittering symbols against the deep black of the airless firmament .   etheriel read aloud   it is hereby directed by order of council that the archangel gabriel  serial number etcetera  etcetera  well  that s you  at any rate   will approach planet  class a  number g        hereinafter known as earth  and on january          at       p . m .   using local time values   he finished reading in gloomy silence .    satisfied .     no  but i m helpless .    gabriel smiled .  a trumpet appeared in space  in shape like an earthly trumpet  but its burnished gold extended from earth to sun .  it was raised to gabriel s glittering beautiful lips .    can t you let me have a little time to take this up with the council .   asked etheriel desperately .    what good would it do you .  the act is countersigned by the chief  and you know that an act countersigned by the chief is absolutely irrevocable .   and now  if you don t mind  it is almost the stipulated second and i want to be done with this as i have other matters of much greater moment on my mind .  would you step out of my way a little .  thank you .    gabriel blew  and a clean  thin sound of perfect pitch and crystalline delicacy filled all the universe to the furthest star .  as it sounded  there was a tiny moment of stasis as thin as the line separating past from future  and then the fabric of worlds collapsed upon itself and matter was gathered back into the primeval chaos from which it had once sprung at a word .  the stars and nebulae were gone  and the cosmic dust  the sun  the planets  the moon  all  all  all except earth itself  which spun as before in a universe now completely empty .   the last trump had sounded .   r .  e .  mann   known to all who knew him simply as r . e .   eased himself into the offices  of the billikan bitsies factory and stared somberly at the tall man  gaunt but with a certain faded elegance about his neat gray mustache  who bent intently over a sheaf of papers on his desk .   r . e .  looked at his wristwatch  which still said       having ceased running at that time .  it was eastern standard time  of course        p . m .  greenwich time .  his dark brown eyes  staring sharply out over a pair of pronounced cheekbones  caught those of the other .   for a moment  the tall man stared at him blankly .  then he said   can i do anything for you .     horatio j .  billikan  i presume .  owner of this place .     yes .     i m r .  e .  mann and i couldn t help but stop in when i finally found someone at work .  don t you know what today is .     today .     it s resurrection day .     oh  that .  i know it .  i heard the blast .  fit to wake the dead .   .   .   .  that s rather a good one  don t you think .   he chuckled for a moment  then went on .   it woke me at seven in the morning .  i nudged my wife .  she slept through it  of   course .  i always said she would .   it s the last trump  dear   i said .  hortense  that s my wife  said   all right   and went back to sleep .  i bathed  shaved  dressed and came to work .     but why .      why not .      none of yoour workers have come in .     no  poor sjouls .  they ll take a holiday just at first .  you ve got to expect that .  after all  it isn t every day that the world comes to an end .  frankly  it s just as well .  it  gives me a chance to straighten out my personal correspondence without interruptions .  telephone hasn t rung once .    he stood u  p and went to the window .   it s a great improvement .  no blinding sun amy more and the snow s gone .  there s a pleasant light and a  pleasant warmth .  very good arrangement .   .   .   .  but now  if you don t mind  i m rather busy  so if you ll excuse me    a great  hoarse voice interrupted with a   just a minute  horatio   and a gentleman  looking remarkably like billikan in a somewhat craggier way  followed his prominent nose into the office and struck an attitude of offended dignity which was scarcely spoiled by the fact that he was quite naked .   may i ask why you ve shut down bitsies .    billikan looked faint .   good heavens   he said   it s father .  wherever did you come from .     from the graveyard   roared billikan  senior .   where on earth else .  they re coming out of the ground there by the dozens .  every one of them naked .  women  too .    billikan cleared his throat .   i ll get you some clothes  father .  i ll bring them to you from home .     never mind that .  business first .  business first .    r . e .  came out of his musing .   is everyone coming out of their graves at the same time  sir .    he stared curiously at billikan  senior  as he spoke .  the old man s appearance was one of robust age .  his cheeks were furrowed but glowed with health .  his age  r . e .  decided  was exactly what it was at the moment of his death  but his body was as it should have been at that age if it functioned ideally .   billikan  senior  said   no  sir  they are not .  the newer graves are coming up first .  pottersby died five years before me and came up about five minutes after me .  seeing him made me decide to leave .  i had had enough of him when  .   .   .  and that reminds me .   he brought his fist down on the desk  a very solid fist .   there were no taxis  no busses .  telephones weren t working .  i had to walk .  i had to walk twenty miles .     like that .   asked his son in a faint and appalled voice .   billikan  senior  looked down upon his bare skin with casual approval .   it s warm .  almost everyone else is naked .   .   .   .  anyway  son  i m not here to make small talk .  why is the factory shut down .     it isn t shut down .  it s a special occasion .     special occasion  my foot .  you call union headquarters and tell them resurrection day isn t in the contract .  every worker is being docked for every minute he s off the job .    billikan s lean face took on a stubborn look as he peered at his father .   i will not .  don t forget  now  you re no longer in charge of this plant .  i am .     oh  you are .  by what right .     by your will .     all right .  now here i am and i void my will .     you can t  father .  you re dead .  you may not look dead  but i have witnesses .  i have the doctor s certificate .  i have receipted bills from the undertaker .  i can get testimony from the pallbearers .    billikan  senior  stared at his son  sat down  placed his arm over the back of the chair  crossed his iegs and said   if it conies to that  we re all dead  aren t we .  the world s come to an end  hasn t it .     but you ve been declared legally dead and   haven t .     oh  we ll change that  son .  there are going to be more of us than of you and votes count .    billikan  junior  tapped the desk firmly with the flat of his hand and flushed slightly .   father  i hate to bring up this particular point  but you force me to .  may i remind you that by now   am sure that mother is sitting at home waiting for you  that she probably had to walk the streets uh  naked  too  and that she probably isn t in a good humor .    billikan  senior  went ludicrously pale .   good heavens .     and you know she always wanted you to retire .    billikan  senior  came to a quick decision .   i m not going home .  why  this is a nightmare .  aren t there any limits to this resurrection business .  it s  it s it s sheer anarchy .  there s such a thing as overdoing it .  i m just not going home .    at which point  a somewhat rotund gentleman with a smooth  pink face and fluffy white sideburns  much like pictures of martin van buren  stepped in and said coldly   good day .     father   said billikan  senior .    grandfather   said billikan  junior .   billikan  grandsenior  looked at billikan  junior  with disapproval .   if you are my grandson   he said   you ve aged considerably and the change has not improved you .    billikan  junior  smiled with dyspeptic feebleness  and made no answer .   billikan  grandsenior  did not seem to require one .  he said   now if you two will bring me up to date on the business  i will resume my managerial function .    there were two simultaneous answers  and billikan  grandsenior s  florid ity waxed dangerously as he beat the ground peremptorily with an imaginary cane and barked a retort .   r . e .  said   gentlemen .    he raised his voice .   gentlemen .    he shrieked at full long power   gentlemen .    conversation snapped off sharply and all turned to look at him .  r . e .  s angular face  his oddly attractive eyes  his sardonic mouth seemed suddenly to dominate the gathering .   he said   i don t understand this argument .  what is it that you manufacture .     bitsies   said billikan  junior .    which  i take it  are a packaged cereal breakfast food     teeming with energy in every golden  crispy flake   cried billikan  junior .    covered with honey sweet  crystalline sugar  a confection and a food  growled billikan  senior .    to tempt the most jaded appetite   roared billikan  grandsenior .    exactly   said r . e .   what appetite .    they stared stolidly at him .   i beg your pardon   said billikan  junior .    are any of you hungry .   asked r . e .   i m not .     what is this fool maundering about .   demanded billikan  grandsenior  angrily .  his invisible cane would have been prodding r . e .  in the navel had it  the cane  not the navel  existed .   r . e .  said   i m trying to tell you that no one will ever eat again .  it is the hereafter  and food is unnecessary .    the expressions on the faces of the billikans needed no interpretation .  it was obvious that they had tried their own appetites and found them wanting .   billikan  junior  said ashenly   ruined .    billikan  grandsenior  pounded the floor heavily and noiselessly with his imaginary cane .   this is confiscation of property without due process of law .   i ll sue .  i ll sue .     quite unconstitutional   agreed billikan  senior .    if you can find anyone to sue  i wish you all good fortune   said r . e .  agreeably .   and now if you ll excuse me i think i ll walk toward th   graveyard .    he put his hat on his head and walked out the door .   etheriel  his vortices quivering  stood before the glory of a six winged  cherub .     the cherub said   if i understand you  your particular universe r  as been  dismantled .        exactly .       well  surely  now  you don t expect me to set it up again .          i don t expect you to do anything   said etheriel   except to arrange an appointment for me with the chief .    the cherub gestured his respect instantly at hearing the word .  two wing tips covered his feet  two his eyes and two his mouth .  he restored hi tnself to normal and said   the chief is quite busy .  there are a myriad score of matters for him to decide .     who denies that .  i merely point out that if matters stand as  ney are now  there will have been a universe in which satan will have won  he final victory .     satan .     it s the hebrew word for adversary   said etheriel impatiently .    could say ahriman  which is the persian word .  in any case  i mean the adversary .    the cherub said   but what will an interview with the chief accomplish .  the document authorizing the last trump was countersigned by the chief   and you know that it is irrevocable for that reason .  the chief would never limit his own omnipotence by canceling a word he had spoken in his official capacity .     is that final .  you will not arrange an appointment .     i cannot .    etheriel said   in that case    shall seek out the chief without one .  i will invade the primum mobile .  if it means my destruction  so be it .   he gathered his energies .   .   .   .   the cherub murmured in horror   sacrilege .   and there was a faint gathering of thunder as etheriel sprang upward and was gone .   r .  e .  mann passed through the crowding streets and grew used to the sight of people bewildered  disbelieving  apathetic  in makeshift clothing or  usually  none at all .   a girl  who looked about twelve  leaned over an iron gate  one foot on a crossbar  swinging it to and fro  and said as he passed   hello  mister .     hello   said r . e .  the girl was dressed .  she was not one of the uh  returnees .   the girl said   we got a new baby in our house .  she s a sister i once had .  mommy is crying and they sent me here .    r . e .  said   well  well   passed through the gate and up the paved walk to the house  one with modest pretensions to middle class gentility .  he rang the bell  obtained no answer  opened the door and walked in .   he followed the sound of sobbing and knocked at an inner door .  a stout man of about fifty with little hair and a comfortable supply of cheek and chin looked out at him with mingled astonishment and resentment .    who are you .    r . e .  removed his hat .   i thought i might be able to help .  your little girl outside    a woman looked up at him hopelessly from a chair by a double bed .  her hair was beginning to gray .  her face was puffed and unsightly with weeping and the veins stood out bluely on the back of her hands .  a baby lay on the bed  plump and naked .  it kicked its feet languidly and its sightless baby eyes turned aimlessly here and there .    this is my baby   said the woman .   she was born twenty three years ago in this house and she died when she was ten days old in this house .  i wanted her back so much .     and now you have her   said r . e .    but it s too late   cried the woman vehemently .   i ve had three other children .  my oldest girl is married  my son is in the army .  i m too old to have a baby now .  and even if even if    her features worked in a heroic effort to keep back the tears and failed .   her husband said with flat tonelessness   it s not a real baby .  it doesn t  cry .  it doesn t soil itself .  it won t take milk .  what will we do .  it ll never grow .  it ll always be a baby .    r . e .  shook his head .   i don t know   he said .   i m afraid i can do nothing to help .    quietly he left .  quietly he thought of the hospitals .  thousands of babies must be appearing at each one .   place them in racks  he thought  sardonically .  stack them like cordwood .  they need no care .  their little bodies are merely each the custodian of an indestructible spark of life .   he passed two little boys of apparently equal chronological age  perhaps ten .  their voices were shrill .  the body of one glistened white in the sunless light so he was a returnee .  the other was not .  r . e .  paused to listen .   the bare one said   i had scarlet fever .    a spark of envy at the other s claim to notoriety seemed to enter the clothed one s voice .   gee .     that s why i died .     gee .  did they use pensillun or auromysim .     what .     they re medicines .     i never heard of them .     boy  you never heard of much .     i know as much as you .     yeah .  who s president of the united states .     warren harding  that s who .     you re crazy .  it s eisenhower .     who s he .     ever see television .     what s that .    the clothed boy hooted earsplittingly .   it s something you turn on and see comedians  movies  cowboys  rocket rangers  anything you want .     let s see it .    there was a pause and the boy from the present said   it ain t working .    the other boy shrieked his scorn .   you mean it ain t never worked .  you made it all up .   f .  r . e .  shrugged and passed on .   the crowds thinned as he left town and neared the cemetery .  those who were left were all walking into town  all were nude .   a man stopped him  a cheerful man with pinkish skin and white hair who had the marks of pince nez on either side of the bridge of his nose  but no glasses to go with them .    greetings  friend .     hello   said r . e .    you re the first man with clothing that i ve seen .  you were alive when the trumpet blew  i suppose .     yes  i was .     well  isn t this great .  isn t this joyous and delightful .  come rejoice with me .     you like this  do you .   said r . e .    like it .  a pure and radiant joy fills me .  we are surrounded by the light of the first day  the light that glowed softly and serenely before sun  moon and stars were made .   you know your genesis  of course .   there is the comfortable warmth that must have been one of the highest blisses of eden  not enervating heat or assaulting cold .  men and women walk the streets unclothed and are not ashamed .  all is well  my friend  all is well .    r . e .  said   well  it s a fact that i haven t seemed to mind the feminine display all about .     naturally not   said the other .   lust and sin as we remember it in our earthly existence no longer exists .  let me introduce myself  friend  as i was in earthly times .  my name on earth was winthrop hester .  i was bom in      and died in      as we counted time then .  through the last forty years of my life i labored to bring my little flock to the kingdom and i go now to count the ones i have won .    r . e .  regarded the ex minister solemnly   surely there has been no judgment yet .     why not .  the lord sees within a man and in the same instant that all things of the world ceased  all men were judged and we are the saved .     there must be a great many saved .     on the contrary  my son  those saved are but as a remnant .     a pretty large remnant .  as near as   can make out  everyone s coming back to life .  i ve seen some pretty unsavory characters back in town as alive as you are .     last minute repentance       never repented .     of what  my son .     of the fact that i never attended church .    winthrop hester stepped back hastily .   were you ever baptized .     not to my knowledge .    winthrop hester trembled .   surely you believe in god .     well   said r . e .    i believed a lot of things about him that would probably startle you .    winthrop hester turned and hurried off in great agitation .   in what remained of his walk to the cemetery  r . e .  had no way of estimating time  nor did it occur to him to try  no one else stopped him .  he found the cemetery itself all but empty  its trees and grass gone  it occurred to him that there was nothing green in the world  the ground everywhere was a hard  featureless  grainless gray  the sky a luminous white   but its headstones still standing .   on one of these sat a lean and furrowed man with long  black hair on his  head and a mat of it  shorter  though more impressive  on his chest and upper arms .   he called out in a deep voice   hey  there  you .    r . e .  sat down on a neighboring headstone .   hello .    black hair said   your clothes don t look right .  what year was it when it happened .          .       died in      .  funnyl i expected to be one pretty hot boy right about now  with the  tamal flames shooting up my innards .     aren t you coming along to town .   asked r . e .    my name s zeb   said the ancient .   that s short for zebulon  but zeb s good enough .  what s the town like .  changed some  i reckon .     it s got nearly a hundred thousand people in it .    zeb s mouth yawned somewhat .   go on .  might nigh bigger n philadelphia .   .   .   .  you re making fun .     philadelphia s got   r . e .  paused .  stating the figure would do him no good .  instead  he said   the town s grown in a hundred fifty years  you know .     country  too .     forty eight states   said r . e .   all the way to the pacific .     no .   zeb slapped his thigh in delight and then winced at the unexpected absence of rough homespun to take up the worst of the blow .   i d head out west if i wasn t needed here .  yes  sir .   his face grew lowering and his thin lips took on a definite grimness .   i ll stay right here  where i m needed .     why are you needed .    the explanation came out briefly  bitten off hard .   injuns .     indians .     millions of  em .  first the tribes we fought and licked and then tribes who ain t never seen a white man .  they ll all come back to life .  i ll need my old buddies .  you city fellers ain t no good at it .   .  .  .  ever seen an injun .    r . e .  said   not around here lately  no .    zeb looked his contempt  and tried to spit to one side but found no saliva for the purpose .  he said   you better git back to the city  then .  after a while  it ain t going to be safe nohow round here .  wish i had my musket .    r . e .  rose  thought a moment  shrugged and faced back to the city .  the headstone he had been sitting upon collapsed as he rose  falling into a powder of gray stone that melted into the featureless ground .  he looked about .  most of the headstones were gone .  the rest would not last long .  only the one under zeb still looked firm and strong .   r . e .  began the walk back .  zeb did not turn to look at him .  he remained waiting quietly and calmly for indians .   etheriel plunged through the heavens in reckless haste .  the eyes of the ascendants were on him  he knew .  from late born seraph  through cherubs and angels  to the highest archangel  they must be watching .   already he was higher than any ascendant  uninvited  had ever been before and he waited for the quiver of the word that would reduce his vortices to non existence .   but he did not falter .  through non space and non time  he plunged toward union with the primum mobile  the seat that encompassed all that is  was  would be  had been  could be and might be .   and as he thought that  he burst through and was part of it  his being expanding so that momentarily he  too  was part of the all .  but then it was mercifully veiled from his senses  and the chief was a still  small voice within him  yet all the more impressive in its infinity for all that .    my son   the voice said   i know why you have come .     then help me  if that be your will .     by my own will   said the chief   an act of mine is irrevocable .  all your mankind  my son  yearned for life .  all feared death .  all evolved thoughts and dreams of life unending .  no two groups of men  no two single men  evolved the same afterlife  but all wished life .  i was petitioned that i might grant the common denominator of all these wishes life unending .  i did so .     no servant of yours made that request .     the adversary did  my son .    etheriel trailed his feeble glory in dejection and said in a low voice   i am dust in your sight and unworthy to be in your presence  yet i must ask a question .  is then the adversary your servant also .     without him i can have no other   said the chief   for what then is good but the eternal fight against evil .    and in that fight  thought etheriel  i have lost .   r . e .  paused in sight of town .  the buildings were crumbling .  those that were made of wood were already heaps of rubble .  r . e .  walked to the nearest such heap and found the wooden splinters powdery and dry .   he penetrated deeper into town and found the brick buildings still standing  but there was an ominous roundness to the edges of the bricks  a threatening flakiness .    they won t last long   said a deep voice   but there is this consolation  if consolation it be  their collapse can kill no one .    r . e .  looked up in surprise and found himself face to face with a cadaverous don quixote of a man  lantern jawed  sunken cheeked .  his eyes were sad and his brown hair was lank and straight .  his clothes hung loosely and skin showed clearly through various rents .    my name   said the man   is richard levine .  i was a professor of history once before this happened .     you re wearing clothes   said r . e .   you re not one of those resurrected .     no  but that mark of distinction is vanishing .  clothes are going .    r . e .  looked at the throngs that drifted past them  moving slowly and aimlessly like motes in a sunbeam .  vanishingly few wore clothes .  he looked down at himself and noticed for the first time that the seam down the length of each trouser leg had parted .  he pinched the fabric of his jacket between thumb and forefinger and the wool parted and came away easily .    i guess you re right   said r . e .    if you ll notice   went on levine   mellon s hill is flattening out .    r . e .  turned to the north where ordinarily the mansions of the aristocracy  such aristocracy as there was in town  studded the slopes of mellon s hill  and found the horizon nearly flat .   levine said   eventually  there ll be nothing but flatness  featurelessness  nothingness and us .     and indians   said r . e .   there s a man outside of town waiting for indians and wishing he had a musket .     i imagine   said levine   the indians will give no trouble .  there is no pleasure in fighting an enemy that cannot be killed or hurt .  and even if that were not so  the lust for battle would be gone  as are all lusts .     are you sure .     i am positive .  before all this happened  although you may not think it to look at me  i derived much harmless pleasure in a consideration of the female figure .  now  with the unexampled opportunities at my disposal  i find myself irritatingly uninterested .  no  that is wrong .  i am not even irritated at my disinterest .    r . e .  looked up briefly at the passers by .   i see what you mean .     the coming of indians here   said levine   is nothing compared with the situation in the old world .  early during the resurrection  hitler and his wehrmacht must have come back to life and must now be facing and intermingled with stalin and the red army all the way from berlin to stalingrad .  to complicate the situation  the kaisers and czars will arrive .  the men at verdun and the somme are back in the old battlegrounds .  napoleon and his marshals are scattered over western europe .  and mohammed must be back to see what following ages have made of islam  while the saints and apostles consider the paths of christianity .  and even the mongols  poor things  the khans from temujin to aurangzeb  must be wandering the steppes helplessly  longing for their horses .     as a professor of history   said r . e .    you must long to be there and observe .     how could i be there .  every man s position on earth is restricted to the distance he can walk .  there are no machines of any kind  and  as i have just mentioned  no horses .  and what would i find in europe anyway .  apathy  i think .  as here .    a soft plopping sound caused r . e .  to turn around .  the wing of a neigh   boring brick building had collapsed in dust .  portions of bricks lay on either side of him .  some must have hurtled through him without his being aware of it .  he looked about .  the heaps of rubble were less numerous .  those that remained were smaller in size .   he said   i met a man who thought we had all been judged and are in heaven .     judged .   said levine .   why  yes  i imagine we are .  we face eternity now .  we have no universe left  no outside phenomena  no emotions  no passions .  nothing but ourselves and thought .  we face an eternity of introspection  when all through history we have never known what to do with ourselves on a rainy sunday .     you sound as though the situation bothers you .     it does more than that .  the dantean conceptions of inferno were childish and unworthy of the divine imagination  fire and torture .  boredom is much more subtle .  the inner torture of a mind unable to escape itself in any way  condemned to fester in its own exuding mental pus for all time  is much more fitting .  oh  yes  my friend  we have been judged  and condemned  too  and this is not heaven  but hell .    and levine rose with shoulders drooping dejectedly  and walked away .   r . e .  gazed thoughtfully about and nodded his head .  he was satisfied .   the self admission of failure lasted but an instant in etheriel  and then  quite suddenly  he lifted his being as brightly and highly as he dared in the presence of the chief and his glory was a tiny dot of light in the infinite primum mobile .    if it be your will  then   he said .   i do not ask you to defeat your will but to fulfill it .     in what way  my son .     the document  approved by the council of ascendants and signed by yourself  authorizes the day of resurrection at a specific time of a specific day of the year      as earthmen count time .     so it did .     but the year      is unqualified .  what then is      .  to the dominant culture on earth the year was a . d .       .  that is true .  yet from the time you breathed existence into earth and its universe there have passed       years .  based on the internal evidence you created within that universe  nearly four billion years have passed .  is the year  unqualified  then             or            .    nor is that all   etheriel went on .   the year   . d .       is the year      of the byzantine era       by the jewish calendar .  it is      a . u . c .   that is  the      th year since the founding of rome  if we adopt the roman calendar .  it is the year      in the mohammedan calendar  and the hundred eightieth year of the independence of the united states .    humbly i ask then if it does not seem to you that a year referred to as      alone and without qualification has no meaning .    the chief s still small voice said   i have always known this  my son  it was you who had to learn .     then   said etheriel  quivering luminously with joy   let the very letter of your will be fulfilled and let the day of resurrection fall in       but only when all the inhabitants of earth unanimously agree that a certain year shall be numbered      and none other .     so let it be   said the chief  and this word re created earth and all it contained  together with the sun and moon and all the hosts of heaven .   it was   a . m .  on january          when r .  e .  mann awoke with a start .  the very beginnings of a melodious note that ought to have filled all the universe had sounded and yet had not sounded .   for a moment  he cocked his head as though to allow understanding to flow in  and then a trifle of rage crossed his face to vanish again .  it was but another battle .   he sat down at his desk to compose the next plan of action .  people already spoke of calendar reform and it would have to be stimulated .  a new era must begin with december          and someday a new year      would come       of the atomic era  acknowledged as such by all the world .   a strange light shone on his head as thoughts passed through his more than human mind and the shadow of ahriman on the wall seemed to have small horns at either temple .   the fun they had  margie even wrote about it that night in her diary .  on the page headed may           she wrote   today tommy found a real book .    it was a very old book .  margie s grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper .   they turned the pages  which were yellow and crinkly  and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to on a screen  you know .  and then  when they turned back to the page before  it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time .    gee   said tommy   what a waste .  when you re through with the book  you just throw it away  i guess .  our television screen must have had a million books on it and it s good for plenty more .    wouldn t throw it away .     same with mine   said margie .  she was eleven and hadn t seen as many telebooks as tommy had .  he was thirteen .   she said   where did you find it .     in my house .   he pointed without looking  because he was busy reading .   in the attic .     what s it about .     school .    margie was scornful .   school .  what s there to write about school .  i hate school .    margie always hated school  but now she hated it more than ever .  the  reproduction in whole or in part prohibited except by permission of nea service  inc .   mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the county inspector .   he was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires .  he smiled at margie and gave her an apple  then took the teacher apart .  margie had hoped he wouldn t know how to put it together again  but he knew how all right  and  after an hour or so  there it was again  large and black and ugly  with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked .  that wasn t so bad .  the part margie hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers .  she always had to write them out in a punch code they made her leam when she was six years old  and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no time .   the inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted margie s head .  he said to her mother   it s not the little girl s fault  mrs .  jones .  i think the geography sector was geared a little too quick .  those things happen sometimes .  i ve slowed it up to an average ten year level .  actually  the over all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory .   and he patted margie s head again .   margie was disappointed .  she had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether .  they had once taken tommy s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely .   so she said to tommy   why would anyone write about school .    tommy looked at her with very superior eyes .   because it s not our kind of school  stupid .  this is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago .   he added loftily  pronouncing the word carefully   centuries ago .    margie was hurt .   well  i don t know what kind of school they had all that time ago .   she read the book over his shoulder for a while  then said   anyway  they had a teacher .     sure they had a teacher  but it wasn t a regular teacher .  it was a man .     a man .  how could a man be a teacher .     well  he just told the boys and girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions .     a man isn t smart enough .     sure he is .  my father knows as much as my teacher .     he can t .  a man can t know as much as a teacher .     he knows almost as much  i betcha .    margie wasn t prepared to dispute that .  she said   i wouldn t want a strange man in my house to teach me .    tommy screamed with laughter .   you don t know much  margie .  the teachers didn t live in the house .  they had a special building and all the kids went there .     and all the kids learned the same thing .     sure  if they were the same age .     but my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid has to be taught differently .     just the same they didn t do it that way then .  if you don t like it  you don t have to read the book .     i didn t say i didn t like it   margie said quickly .  she wanted to read about those funny schools .   they weren t even half finished when margie s mother called   margie .  school .    margie looked up .   not yet  mamma .     now .   said mrs .  jones .   and it s probably time for tommy  too .    margie said to tommy   can i read the book some more with you after school .     maybe   he said nonchalantly .  he walked away whistling  the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm .   margie went into the schoolroom .  it was right next to her bedroom  and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her .  it was always on at the same time every day except saturday and sunday  because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours .   the screen was lit up  and it said   today s arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions .  please insert yesterday s homework in the proper slot .    margie did so with a sigh .  she was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather s grandfather was a little boy .  all the kids from the whole neighborhood came  laughing and shouting in the schoolyard  sitting together in the schoolroom  going home together at the end of the day .  they learned the same things  so they could help one another on the homework and talk about it .   and the teachers were people .   .   .   .   the mechanical teacher was flashing on the screen   when we add the fractions     and l       margie was thinking about how the kids must have loved it in the old days .  she was thinking about the fun they had .   jokester  noel meyerhof consulted the list he had prepared and chose which item was to be first .  as usual  he relied mainly on intuition .   he was dwarfed by the machine he faced  though only the smallest portion of the latter was in view .  that didn t matter .  he spoke with the offhand confidence of one who thoroughly knew he was master .    johnson   he said   came home unexpectedly from a business trip to find his wife in the arms of his best friend .  he staggered back and said   max .  i m married to the lady so i have to .  but why you .       meyerhof thought  okay  let that trickle down into its guts and gurgle about a bit .   and a voice behind him said   hey .    meyerhof erased the sound of that monosyllable and put the circuit he was using into neutral .  he whirled and said   i m working .  don t you knock .    he did not smile as he customarily did in greeting timothy whistler  a senior analyst with whom he dealt as often as with any .  he frowned as he would have for an interruption by a stranger  wrinkling his thin face into a distortion that seemed to extend to his hair  rumpling it more than ever .   whistler shrugged .  he wore his white lab coat with his fists pressing down within its pockets and creasing it into tense vertical lines .   i knocked .  you didn t answer .  the operations signal wasn t on .    meyerhof grunted .  it wasn t at that .  he d been thinking about this new project too intensively and he was forgetting little details .   copyright         by royal publications  inc .   and yet he could scarcely blame himself for that .  this thing was important .   he didn t know why it was  of course .  grand masters rarely did .  that s what made them grand masters  the fact that they were beyond reason .  how else could the human mind keep up with that ten mile long lump of solidified reason that men called multivac  the most complex computer ever built .   meyerhof said   i am working .  is there something important on your mind .     nothing that can t be postponed .  there are a few holes in the answer on the hyperspatial   whistler did a double take and his face took on a rueful look of uncertainty .   working .     yes .  what about it .     but   he looked about  staring into the crannies of the shallow room that faced the banks upon banks of relays that formed a small portion of multivac .   there isn t anyone here at that .     who said there was  or should be .     you were telling one of your jokes  weren t you .     and .    whistler forced a smile .   don t tell me you were telling a joke to multivac .    meyerhof stiffened .   why not .     were you .     yes .     why .    meyerhof stared the other down .   i don t have to account to you .  or to anyone .     good lord  of course not .  i was curious  that s all .   .  .  .  but then  if you re working  i ll leave .   he looked about once more  frowning .    do so   said meyerhof .  his eyes followed the other out and then he activated the operations signal with a savage punch of his finger .   he strode the length of the room and back  getting himself in hand .  damn whistler .  damn them all .  because he didn t bother to hold those technicians  analysts and mechanics at the proper social distance  because he treated them as though they  too  were creative artists  they took these liberties .   he thought grimly  they can t even tell jokes decently .   and instantly that brought him back to the task in hand .  he sat down again .  devil take them all .   he threw the proper multivac circuit back into operation and said   the ship s steward stopped at the rail of the ship during a particularly rough ocean crossing and gazed compassionately at the man whose slumped position over the rail and whose intensity of gaze toward the depths betokened all too well the ravages of seasickness .    gentry  the steward patted the man s shoulder .   cheer up  sir   he murmured .   i know it seems bad  but really  you know  nobody ever dies of seasickness .     the afflicted gentleman lifted his greenish  tortured face to his comforter and gasped in hoarse accents   don t say that  man .  for heaven s sake  don t say that .  it s only the hope of dying that s keeping me alive .      timothy whistler  a bit preoccupied  nevertheless smiled and nodded as he passed the secretary s desk .  she smiled back at him .   here  he thought  was an archaic item in this computer ridden world of the twenty first century  a human secretary .  but then perhaps it was natural that such an institution should survive here in the very citadel of computerdom  in the gigantic world corporation that handled multivac .  with multivac filling the horizons  lesser computers for trivial tasks would have been in poor taste .   whistler stepped into abram trask s office .  that government official paused in his careful task of lighting a pipe  his dark eyes flicked in whistler s direction and his beaked nose stood out sharply and prominently against the rectangle of window behind him .    ah  there  whistler .  sit down .  sit down .    whistler did so .   i think we ve got a problem  trask .    trask half smiled .   not a technical one  i hope .  i m just an innocent politician .    it was one of his favorite phrases .     it involves meyerhof .    trask sat down instantly and looked acutely miserable .   are you sure .   t  reasonably sure .    whistler understood the other s sudden unhappiness well .  trask was the government official in charge of the division of computers and automation of the department of the interior .  he was expected to deal with matters of policy involving the human satellites of multivac  just as those technically trained satellites were expected to deal with multivac itself .   but a grand master was more than just a satellite .  more  even  than just a human .   early in the history of multivac  it had become apparent that the bottleneck was the questioning procedure .  multivac could answer the problem of humanity  all the problems  if if it were asked meaningful questions .  but as knowledge accumulated at an ever faster rate  it became ever more difficult to locate those meaningful questions .   reason alone wouldn t do .  what was needed was a rare type of intuition  the same faculty of mind  only much more intensified  that made a grand master at chess .  a mind was needed of the sort that could see through the quadrillions of chess patterns to find the one best move  and do it in a matter of minutes .   trask moved restlessly .   what s meyerhof been doing .     he s introduced a line of questioning that i find disturbing .     oh  come on  whistler .  is that all .  you can t stop a grand master from going through any line of questioning he chooses .  neither you nor i are equipped to judge the worth of his questions .  you know that .  i know you know that .     i do .  of course .  but i also know meyerhof .  have you ever met him socially .     good lord  no .  does anyone meet any grand master socially .     don t take that attitude  trask .  they re human and they re to be pitied .  have you ever thought what it must be like to be a grand master  to know there are only some twelve like you in the world  to know that only one or two come up per generation  that the world depends on you  that a thousand mathematicians  logicians  psychologists and physical scientists wait on you .    trask shrugged and muttered   good lord  i d feel king of the world .     i don t think you would   said the senior analyst impatiently .   they feel kings of nothing .  they have no equal to talk to  no sensation of belonging .  listen  meyerhof never misses a chance to get together with the boys .  he isn t married  naturally  he doesn t drink  he has no natural social touch yet he forces himself into company because he must .  and do you know what he does when he gets together with us  and that s at least once a week .     i haven t the least idea   said the government man .   this is all new to me .     he s a jokester .     what .     he tells jokes .  good ones .  he s terrific .  he can take any story  however old and dull  and make it sound good .  it s the way he tells it .  he has a flair .     i see .  well  good .     or bad .  these jokes are important to him .   whistler put both elbows on trask s desk  bit at a thumbnail and stared into the air .   he s different  he knows he s different and these jokes are the one way he feels he can get the rest of us ordinary schmoes to accept him .  we laugh  we howl  we clap him on the back and even forget he s a grand master .  it s the only hold he has on the rest of us .     this is all interesting .  i didn t know you were such a psychologist .  still  where does this lead .     just this .  what do you suppose happens if meyerhof runs out of jokes .     what .   the government man stared blankly .    if he starts repeating himself .  if his audience starts laughing less heartily  or stops laughing altogether .  it s his only hold on our approval .  without it  he ll be alone and then what would happen to him .  after all  trask  he s one of the dozen men mankind can t do without .  we can t let anything happen to him .  i don t mean just physical things .  we can t even let him get too unhappy .  who knows how that might affect his intuition .     well  has he started repeating himself .     not as far as i know  but i think he thinks he has .     why do you say that .     because i ve heard him telling jokes to multivac .     oh  no .     accidentally .  i walked in on him and he threw me out .  he was savage .  he s usually good natured enough  and i consider it a bad sign that he was so upset at the intrusion .  but the fact remains that he was telling a joke to multivac  and i m convinced it was one of a series .     but why .    whistler shrugged and rubbed a hand fiercely across his chin .   i have a thought about that .  i think he s trying to build up a store of jokes in mul tivac s memory banks in order to get back new variations .  you see what i mean .  he s planning a mechanical jokester  so that he can have an infinite number of jokes at hand and never fear running out .     good lord .     objectively  there may be nothing wrong with that  but i consider it a bad sign when a grand master starts using multivac for his personal problems .  any grand master has a certain inherent mental instability and he should be watched .  meyerhof may be approaching a borderline beyond which we lose a grand master .    trask said blankly   what are you suggesting i do .     you can check me .  i m too close to him to judge well  maybe  and judging humans isn t my particular talent  anyway .  you re a politician  it s more your talent .     judging humans  perhaps  not grand masters .     they re human  too .  besides  who else is to do it .    the fingers of trask s hand struck his desk in rapid succession over and over like a slow and muted roll of drums .    i suppose i ll have to   he said .   meyerhof said to multivac   the ardent swain  picking a bouquet of wildflowers for his loved one  was disconcerted to find himself  suddenly  in the same field with a large bull of unfriendly appearance which  gazing at him steadily  pawed the ground in a threatening manner .  the young man  spying a farmer on the other side of a fairly distant fence  shouted   hey  mister  is that bull safe .   the farmer surveyed the situation with critical eye  spat to one side and called back   he s safe as anything .   he spat again  and added   can t say the same about you  though .      meyerhof was about to pass on to the next when the summons came .   it wasn t really a summons .  no one could summon a grand master .  it was only a message that division head trask would like very much to see grand master meyerhof if grand master meyerhof could spare him the time .   meyerhof might  with impunity  have tossed the message to one side and continued with whatever he was doing .  he was not subject to discipline .   on the other hand  were he to do that  they would continue to bother him oh  very respectfully  but they would continue to bother him .   so he neutralized the pertinent circuits of multivac and locked them into place .  he put the freeze signal on his office so that no one would dare enter in his absence and left for trask s office .   trask coughed and felt a bit intimidated by the sullen fierceness of the other s look .  he said   we have not had occasion to know one another  grand master  to my great regret .     i have reported to you   said meyerhof stiffly .   trask wondered what lay behind those keen  wild eyes .  it was difficult for him to imagine meyerhof with his thin face  his dark  straight hair  his intense air  even unbending long enough to tell funny stories .   he said   reports are not social acquaintance .  i i have been given to understand you have a marvelous fund of anecdotes .     i am a jokester  sir .  that s the phrase people use .  a jokester .     they haven t used the phrase to me  grand master .  they have said     the hell with them .  i don t care what they ve said .  see here  trask  do you want to hear a joke .   he leaned forward across the desk  his eyes narrowed .    by all means .  certainly   said trask  with an effort at heartiness .    all right .  here s the joke  mrs .  jones stared at the fortune card that had emerged from the weighing machine in response to her husband s penny .  she said   it says here  george  that you re suave  intelligent  farseeing  industrious and attractive to women .   with that  she turned the card over and added   and they have your weight wrong  too .      trask laughed .  it was almost impossible not to .  although the punch line was predictable  the surprising facility with which meyerhof had produced just the tone of contemptuous disdain in the woman s voice  and the cleverness with which he had contorted the lines of his face to suit that tone carried the politician helplessly into laughter .   meyerhof said sharply   why is that funny .    trask sobered .   i beg your pardon .     i said  why is that funny .  why do you laugh .     well   said trask  trying to be reasonable   the last line put every thing that preceded in a new light .  the unexpectedness     the point is   said meyerhof   that i have pictured a husband being humiliated by his wife  a marriage that is such a failure that the wife is convinced that her husband lacks any virtue .  yet you laugh at that .  if you were the husband  would you find it funny .    he waited a moment in thought  then said   try this one  trask  abner  was seated at his wife s sickbed  weeping uncontrollably  when his wife  mustering the dregs of her strength  drew herself up to one elbow .      abner   she whispered   abner  i cannot go to my maker without confessing my misdeed .       not now   muttered the stricken husband .   not now  my dear .  lie back and rest .       i cannot   she cried .   i must tell  or my soul will never know peace .  i have been unfaithful to you  abner .  in this very house  not one month ago       hush  dear   soothed abner .   i know all about it .  why else have i poisoned you .      trask tried desperately to maintain equanimity but did not entirely succeed .  he suppressed a chuckle imperfectly .      meyerhof said   so that s funny  too .  adultery .  murder .  all funny .      well  now   said trask   books have been written analyzing humor .      true enough   said meyerhof   and i ve read a number of them .  what s more  i ve read most of them to multivac .  still  the people who write the books are just guessing .  some of them say we laugh because we feel superior to the people in the joke .  some say it is because of a suddenly realized incongruity  or a sudden relief from tension  or a sudden reinterpretation of events .  is there any simple reason .  different people laugh at different jokes .  no joke is universal .  some people don t laugh at any joke .  yet what may be most important is that man is the only animal with a true sense of humor  the only animal that laughs .    trask said suddenly   i understand .  you re trying to analyze humor .  that s why you re transmitting a series of jokes to multivac .     who told you i was doing that .   .   .   .  never mind  it was whistler .  i remember  now .  he surprised me at it .  well  what about it .     nothing at all .     you don t dispute my right to add anything i wish to multivac s general fund of knowledge  or to ask any question i wish .     no  not at all   said trask hastily .   as a matter of fact  i have no doubt that this will open the way to new analyses of great interest to psychologists .     hmp .  maybe .  just the same there s something plaguing me that s more important than just the general analysis of humor .  there s a specific question i have to ask .  two of them  really .     oh .  what s that .   trask wondered if the other would answer .  there would be no way of compelling him if he chose not to .   but meyerhof said   the first question is this  where do all these jokes come from .     what .     who makes them up .  listen .  about a month ago  i spent an evening swapping jokes .  as usual  i told most of them and  as usual  the fools  laughed .  maybe they really thought the jokes were funny and maybe they were just humoring me .  in any case  one creature took the liberty of slapping me on the back and saying   meyerhof  you know more jokes than any ten people i know .     i m sure he was right  but it gave rise to a thought .  i don t know how many hundreds  or perhaps thousands  of jokes i ve told at one time or another in my life  yet the fact is i never made up one .  not one .  i d only repeated them .  my only contribution was to tell them .  to begin with  i d either heard them or read them .  and the source of my hearing or reading didn t make up the jokes  either .  i never met anyone who ever claimed to have constructed a joke .  it s always  i heard a good one the other day   and  heard any good ones lately .     all the jokes are old .  that s why jokes exhibit such a social lag .  they still deal with seasickness  for instance  when that s easily prevented these days and never experienced .  or they ll deal with fortune giving weighing machines  like the joke i told you  when such machines are found only in antique shops .  well  then  who makes up the jokes .    trask said   is that what you re trying to find out .   it was on the tip of trask s tongue to add  good lord  who cares .  he forced that impulse down .  a grand master s questions were always meaningful .    of course that s what i m trying to find out .  think of it this way .  it s not just that jokes happen to be old .  they must be old to be enjoyed .  it s essential that a joke not be original .  there s one variety of humor that is  or can be  original and that s the pun .  i ve heard puns that were obviously made up on the spur of the moment .  i have made some up myself .  but no one laughs at such puns .  you re not supposed to .  you groan .  the better the pun  the louder the groan .  original humor is not laugh provoking .  why .     i m sure i don t know .     all right .  let s find out .  having given multivac all the information i thought advisable on the general topic of humor  i am now feeding it selected jokes .    trask found himself intrigued .   selected how .   he asked .    i don t know   said meyerhof .   they felt like the right ones .  i m grand master  you know .     oh  agreed .  agreed .     from those jokes and the general philosophy of humor  my first request will be for multivac to trace the origin of the jokes  if it can .  since whistler is in on this and since he has seen fit to report it to you  have him down in analysis day after tomorrow .  i think he ll have a bit of work to do .     certainly .  may i attend  too .    meyerhof shrugged .  trask s attendance was obviously a matter of indifference to him .      meyerhof had selected the last in the series with particular care .  what that care consisted of  he could not have said  but he had revolved a dozen possibilities in his mind  and over and over again had tested each for some indefinable quality of meaningfulness .   he said   ug  the caveman  observed his mate running to him in tears  her leopard skin skirt in disorder .   ug   she cried  distraught   do something quickly .  a saber toothed tiger has entered mother s cave .  do something .   ug grunted  picked up his well gnawed buffalo bone and said   why do anything .  who the hell cares what happens to a saber toothed tiger .      it was then that meyerhof asked his two questions and leaned back  closing his eyes .  he was done .    i saw absolutely nothing wrong   said trask to whistler .   he told me what he was doing readily enough and it was odd but legitimate .     what he claimed he was doing   said whistler .    even so  i can t stop a grand master on opinion alone .  he seemed queer but  after all  grand masters are supposed to seem queer .  i didn t think him insane .     using multivac to find the source of jokes .   muttered the senior analyst in discontent .   that s not insane .     how can we tell .   asked trask irritably .   science has advanced to the point where the only meaningful questions left are the ridiculous ones .  the sensible ones have been thought of  asked and answered long ago .     it s no use .  i m bothered .     maybe  but there s no choice now  whistler .  we ll see meyerhof and you can do the necessary analysis of multivac s response  if any .  as for me  my only job is to handle the red tape .  good lord  i don t even know what a senior analyst such as yourself is supposed to do  except analyze  and that doesn t help me any .    whistler said   it s simple enough .  a grand master like meyerhof asks questions and multivac automatically formulates it into quantities and operations .  the necessary machinery for converting words to symbols is what makes up most of the bulk of multivac .  multivac then gives the answer in quantities and operations  but it doesn t translate that back into words except in the most simple and routine cases .  if it were designed to solve the general retranslation problem  its bulk would have to be quadrupled at least .     i see .  then it s your job to translate these symbols into words .     my job and that of other analysts .  we use smaller  specially designed computers whenever necessary .   whistler smiled grimly .   like the delphic priestess of ancient greece  multivac gives oracular and obscure answers .  only we have translators  you see .    they had arrived .  meyerhof was waiting .   whistler said briskly   what circuits did you use  grand master .   meyerhof told him and whistler went to work .   trask tried to follow what was happening  but none of it made sense .  the government official watched a spool unreel with a pattern of dots in endless incomprehensibility .  grand master meyerhof stood indifferently to one side while whistler surveyed the pattern as it emerged .  the analyst had put on headphones and a mouthpiece and at intervals murmured a series of instructions which  at some far off place  guided assistants through electronic contortions in other computers .   occasionally  whistler listened  then punched combinations on a complex keyboard marked with symbols that looked vaguely mathematical but weren t .   a good deal more than an hour s time elapsed .   the frown on whistler s face grew deeper .  once  he looked up at the two others and began   this is unbel   and turned back to his work .   finally  he said hoarsely   i can give you an unofficial answer .   his eyes were red rimmed .   the official answer awaits complete analysis .  do you want it unofficial .     go ahead   said meyerhof .   trask nodded .   whistler darted a hangdog glance at the grand master .   ask a foolish question   he said .  then  gruffly   multivac says  extraterrestrial origin .     what are you saying .   demanded trask .    don t you hear me .  the jokes we laugh at were not made up by any man .  multivac has analyzed all data given it and the one answer that best fits that data is that some extraterrestrial intelligence has composed the jokes  all of them  and placed them in selected human minds at selected times and places in such a way that no man is conscious of having made one up .  all subsequent jokes are minor variations and adaptations of these grand originals .    meyerhof broke in  face flushed with the kind of triumph only a grand master can know who once again has asked the right question .   all comedy writers   he said   work by twisting old jokes to new purposes .  that s well known .  the answer fits .     but why .   asked trask .   why make up the jokes .     multivac says   said whistler   that the only purpose that fits all the data is that the jokes are intended to study human psychology .  we study rat psychology by making the rats solve mazes .  the rats don t know why and wouldn t even if they were aware of what was going on  which they re not .  these outer intelligences study man s psychology by noting individual reactions to carefully selected anecdotes .  each man reacts differently .   .   .   .  presumably  these outer intelligences are to us as we are to rats .   he shuddered .   trask  eyes staring  said   the grand master said man is the only animal  with a sense of humor .  it would seem then that the sense of humor is foisted upon us from without .    meyerhof added excitedly   and for possible humor created from within  we have no laughter .  puns  i mean .    whistler said   presumably  the extraterrestrials cancel out reactions to spontaneous jokes to avoid confusion .    trask said in sudden agony of spirit   come on  now  good lord  do either of you believe this .    the senior analyst looked at him coldly .   multivac says so .  it s all that can be said so far .  it has pointed out the real jokesters of the universe  and if we want to know more  the matter will have to be followed up .   he added in a whisper   if anyone dares follow it up .    grand master meyerhof said suddenly   i asked two questions  you know .  so far only the first has been answered .  i think multivac has enough data to answer the second .    whistler shrugged .  he seemed a half broken man .   when a grand master thinks there is enough data   he said   i ll make book on it .  what is your second question .     i asked this .  what will be the effect on the human race of discovering the answer to my first question .     why did you ask that .   demanded trask .    just a feeling that it had to be asked   said meyerhof .   trask said   insane .  it s all insane   and turned away .  even he himself felt how strangely he and whistler had changed sides .  now it was trask crying insanity .   trask closed his eyes .  he might cry insanity all he wished  but no man in fifty years had doubted the combination of a grand master and multivac and found his doubts verified .   whistler worked silently  teeth clenched .  he put multivac and its subsidiary machines through their paces again .  another hour passed and he laughed harshly .   a raving nightmare .     what s the answer .   asked meyerhof .   i want multivac s remarks  not yours .     all right .  take it .  multivac states that  once even a single human discovers the truth of this method of psychological analysis of the human mind  it will become useless as an objective technique to those extraterrestrial powers now using it .     you mean there won t be any more jokes handed out to humanity .   asked trask faintly .   or what do you mean .     no more jokes   said whistler   now .  multivac says now .  the experiment is ended now .  a new technique will have to be introduced .    they stared at each other .  the minutes passed .   meyerhof said slowly   multivac is right .    whistler said haggardly   i know .    even trask said in a whisper   yes .  it must be .    it was meyerhof who put his finger on the proof of it  meyerhof the accomplished jokester .  he said   it s over  you know  all over .  i ve been trying for five minutes now and i can t think of one single joke  not one .  and if i read one in a book  i wouldn t laugh .  i know .     the gift of humor is gone   said trask drearily .   no man will ever laugh again .    and they remained there  staring  feeling the world shrink down to the dimensions of an experimental rat cage with the maze removed and something  something about to be put in its place .   the immortal bard   oh  yes   said dr .  phineas welch   i can bring back the spirits of the illustrious dead .    he was a little drunk  or maybe he wouldn t have said it .  of course  it was perfectly all right to get a little drunk at the annual christmas party .   scott robertson  the school s young english instructor  adjusted his glasses and looked to right and left to see if they were overheard .   really  dr .  welch .     i mean it .  and not just the spirits .  i bring back the bodies  too .     i wouldn t have said it were possible   said robertson primly .    why not .  a simple matter of temporal transference .     you mean time travel .  but that s quite uh unusual .     not if you know how .     well  how  dr .  welch .     think i m going to tell you .   asked the physicist gravely .  he looked vaguely about for another drink and didn t find any .  he said   i brought quite a few back .  archimedes  newton  galileo .  poor fellows .     didn t they like it here .  i should think they d have been fascinated by our modern science   said robertson .  he was beginning to enjoy the conversation .    oh  they were .  they were .  especially archimedes .  i thought he d go mad with joy at first after i explained a little of it in some greek i d boned up on  but no no     what was wrong .    copyright        .  by palmer publications  inc .    just a different culture .  they couldn t get used to our way   i life .  they got terribly lonely and frightened .  i had to send them back .   ja   that s too bad .     yes .  great minds  but not flexible minds .  not universal .  so i tried shakespeare .     what .   yelled robertson .  this was getting closer to home .    don t yell  my boy   said welch .   it s bad manners .     did you say you brought back shakespeare .     i did .  i needed someone with a universal mind  someone who knew people well enough to be able to live with them centuries way from his own time .  shakespeare was the man .  i ve got his signature .  as a memento  you know .     on you .   asked robertson  eyes bugging .    right here .   welch fumbled in one vest pocket after another .   ah  here it is .    a little piece of pasteboard was passed to the instructor .  on one side it said   l .  klein   sons  wholesale hardware .   on the other side  in straggly script  was written   will   shakesper .    a wild surmise filled robertson .   what did he look like .     not like his pictures .  bald and an ugly mustache .  he spoke in a thick brogue .  of course  i did my best to please him with our times .  i told him we thought highly of his plays and still put them on the boards .  in fact  i said we thought they were the greatest pieces of literature in the english language  maybe in any language .     good .  good   said robertson breathlessly .    i said people had written volumes of commentaries on his plays .  naturally he wanted to see one and i got one for him from the library .     and .     oh  he was fascinated .  of course  he had trouble with the current idioms and references to events since       but i helped out .  poor fellow .  i don t think he ever expected such treatment .  he kept saying   god ha  mercy .  what cannot be racked from words in five centuries .  one could wring  methinks  a flood from a damp clout .       he wouldn t say that .     why not .  he wrote his plays as quickly as he could .  he said he had to on account of the deadlines .  he wrote hamlet in less than six months .  the plot was an old one .  he just polished it up .     that s all they do to a telescope mirror .  just polish it up   said the english instructor indignantly .   the physicist disregarded him .  he made out an untouched cocktail on the bar some feet away and sidled toward it .   i told the immortal bard that we even gave college courses in shakespeare .       give one .     i know .  i enrolled him in your evening extension course .  i never saw a  man so eager to find out what posterity thought of him as poor bill was .  he worked hard at it .     you enrolled william shakespeare in my course .   mumbled robertson .  even as an alcoholic fantasy  the thought staggered him .  and was it an alcoholic fantasy .  he was beginning to recall a bald man with a queer way of talking .   .  .  .    not under his real name  of course   said dr .  welch .   never mind what he went under .  it was a mistake  that s all .  a big mistake .  poor fellow .   he had the cocktail now and shook his head at it .    why was it a mistake .  what happened .     i had to send him back to        roared welch indignantly .   how much humiliation do you think a man can stand .     what humiliation are you talking about .    dr .  welch tossed off the cocktail .   why  you poor simpleton  you flunked him .    someday  niccolo mazetti lay stomach down on the rug  chin buried in the palm of one small hand  and listened to the bard disconsolately .  there was even the suspicion of tears in his dark eyes  a luxury an eleven year old could allow himself only when alone .   the bard said   once upon a time in the middle of a deep wood  there lived a poor woodcutter and his two motherless daughters  who were each as beautiful as the day is long .  the older daughter had long hair as black as a feather from a raven s wing  but the younger daughter had hair as bright and golden as the sunlight of an autumn afternoon .    many times while the girls were waiting for their father to come home from his day s work in the wood  the older girl would sit before a mirror and sing    what she sang  niccolo did not hear  for a call sounded from outside the room   hey  nickie .    and niccolo  his face clearing on the moment  rushed to the window and shouted   hey  paul .    paul loeb waved an excited hand .  he was thinner than niccolo and not as tall  for all he was six months older .  his face was full of repressed tension which showed itself most clearly in the rapid blinking of his eyelids .   hey  nickie  let me in .  i ve got an idea and a half .  wait till you hear it .   he looked rapidly about him as though to check on the possibility of eavesdroppers  but the front yard was quite patently empty .  he repeated  in a whisper   wait till you hear it .    copyright         by royal publications  inc .    all right .  i ll open the door .    the bard continued smoothly  oblivious to the sudden loss of attention on the part of niccolo .  as paul entered  the bard was saying .    .   .   .  thereupon  the lion said   if you will find me the lost egg of the bird which flies over the ebony mountain once every ten years  i will      paul said   is that a bard you re listening to .  i didn t know you had one .    niccolo reddened and the look of unhappiness returned to his face .   just an old thing i had when i was a kid .  it ain t much good .   he kicked at the bard with his foot and caught the somewhat scarred and discolored plastic covering a glancing blow .   the bard hiccupped as its speaking attachment was jarred out of contact a moment  then it went on    for a year and a day until the iron shoes were worn out .  the princess stopped at the side of the road .   .   .   .    paul said   boy  that is an old model   and looked at it critically .   despite niccofo s own bitterness against the bard  he winced at the other s condescending tone .  for the moment  he was sorry he had allowed paul in  at least before he had restored the bard to its usual resting place in the basement .  it was only in the desperation of a dull day and a fruitless discussion with his father that he had resurrected it .  and it turned out to be just as stupid as he had expected .   nickie was a little afraid of paul anyway  since paul had special courses at school and everyone said he was going to grow up to be a computing engineer .   not that niccolo himself was doing badly at school .  he got adequate marks in logic  binary manipulations  computing and elementary circuits  all the usual grammar school subjects .  but that was it .  they were just the usual subjects and he would grow up to be a control board guard like everyone else .   paul  however  knew mysterious things about what he called electronics and theoretical mathematics and programing .  especially programing .  niccolo didn t even try to understand when paul bubbled over about it .   paul listened to the bard for a few minutes and said   you been using it much .     no .   said niccolo  offended .   i ve had it in the basement since before you moved into the neighborhood .  i just got it out today   he lacked an excuse that seemed adequate to himself  so he concluded   i just got it out .    paul said   is that what it tells you about  woodcutters and princesses and talking animals .    niccolo said   it s terrible .  my dad says we can t afford a new one .  i said to him this morning   the memory of the morning s fruitless pleadings brought niccolo dangerously near tears  which he repressed in a panic .  somehow  he felt that paul s thin cheeks never felt the stain of tears and that paul would have only contempt for anyone else less strong than himself .   niccolo went on   so i thought i d try this old thing again  but it s no good .    paul turned off the bard  pressed the contact that led to a nearly instantaneous reorientation and recombination of the vocabulary  characters  plot lines and climaxes stored within it .  then he reactivated it .   the bard began smoothly   once upon a time there was a little boy named willikins whose mother had died and who lived with a stepfather and a stepbrother .  although the stepfather was very well to do  he begrudged poor willikins the very bed he slept in so that willikins was forced to get such rest as he could on a pile of straw in the stable next to the horses     horses .   cried paul .    they re a kind of animal   said niccolo .   i think .     i know that .  i just mean imagine stories about horses .     it tells about horses all the time   said niccolo .   there are things called cows  too .  you milk them but the bard doesn t say how .     well  gee  why don t you fix it up .     i d like to know how .    the bard was saying   often willikins would think that if only he were rich and powerful  he would show his stepfather and stepbrother what it meant to be cruel to a little boy  so one day he decided to go out into the world and seek his fortune .    paul  who wasn t listening to the bard  said   it s easy .  the bard has memory cylinders all fixed up for plot lines and climaxes and things .  we don t have to worry about that .  it s just vocabulary we ve got to fix so it ll know about computers and automation and electronics and real things about today .  then it can tell interesting stories  you know  instead of about princesses and things .    niccolo said despondently   i wish we could do that .    paul said   listen  my dad says if i get into special computing school next year  he ll get me a real bard  a late model .  a big one with an attachment for space stories and mysteries .  and a visual attachment  too .     you mean see the stories .     sure .  mr .  daugherty at school says they ve got things like that  now  but not for just everybody .  only if i get into computing school  dad can get a few breaks .    niccolo s eyes bulged with envy .   gee .  seeing a story .     you can come over and watch anytime  nickie .     oh  boy .  thanks .     that s all right .  but remember  i m the guy who says what kind of story we hear .     sure .  sure .   niccolo would have agreed readily to much more onerous conditions .   paul s attention returned to the bard .   it was saying     if that is the case   said the king  stroking his beard and frowning till clouds filled the sky and lightning flashed   you w   see to it that my entire land is freed of flies by this time day after tomorrow or       all we ve got to do   said paul   is open it up   he shut the bard off again and was prying at its front panel as he spoke .    hey   said niccolo  in sudden alarm .   don t break it .     i won t break it   said paul impatiently .   i know all about these things .   then  with sudden caution   your father and mother home .     no .     all right  then .   he had the front panel off and peered in .   boy  this is a one cylinder thing .    he worked away at the bard s innards .  niccolo  who watched with painful suspense  could not make out what he was doing .   paul pulled out a thin  flexible metal strip  powdered with dots .   that s the bard s memory cylinder .  i ll bet its capacity for stories is under a trillion .     what are you going to do  paul .   quavered niccolo .    i ll give it vocabulary .     how .     easy .  i ve got a book here .  mr .  daugherty gave it to me at school .    paul pulled the book out of his pocket and pried at it till he had its plastic jacket off .  he unreeled the tape a bit  ran it through the vocalizer  which he turned down to a whisper  then placed it within the bard s vitals .  he made further attachments .    what ll that do .     the book will talk and the bard will put it all on its memory tape .     what good will that do .     boy  you re a dope .  this book is all about computers and automation and the bard will get all that information .  then he can stop talking about kings making lightning when they frown .    niccolo said   and the good guy always wins anyway .  there s no excitement .     oh  well   said paul  watching to see if his setup was working properly   that s the way they make bards .  they got to have the good guy win and make the bad guys lose and things like that .  i heard my father talking about it once .  he says that without censorship there d be no telling what the younger generation would come to .  he says it s bad enough as it is .   .  .  .  there  it s working fine .    paul brushed his hands against one another and turned away from the bard .  he said   but listen  i didn t tell you my idea yet .  it s the best thing you ever heard  i bet .  i came right to you  because i figured you d come in with me .     sure  paul  sure .     okay .  you know mr .  daugherty at school .  you know what a funny kind of guy he is .  well  he likes me  kind of .     i know .     i was over at his house after school today .     you were .     sure .  he says i m going to be entering computer school and he wants to encourage me and things like that .  he says the world needs more people who can design advanced computer circuits and do proper programing .     oh .    paul might have caught some of the emptiness behind that monosyllable .  he said impatiently   programing .  i told you a hundred times .  that s when you set up problems for the giant computers like multivac to work on .  mr .  daugherty says it gets harder all the time to find people who can really run computers .  he says anyone can keep an eye on the controls and check off answers and put through routine problems .  he says the trick is to expand research and figure out ways to ask the right questions  and that s hard .    anyway  nickie  he took me to his place and showed me his collection of old computers .  it s kind of a hobby of his to collect old computers .  he had tiny computers you had to push with your hand  with little knobs all over it .  and he had a hunk of wood he called a slide rule with a little piece of it that went in and out .  and some wires with balls on them .  he even had a hunk of paper with a kind of thing he called a multiplication table .    niccolo  who found himself only moderately interested  said   a paper table .     it wasn t really a table like you eat on .  it was different .  it was to help people compute .  mr .  daugherty tried to explain but he didn t have much time and it was kind of complicated  anyway .     why didn t people just use a computer .     that was before they had computers   cried paul .    before .     sure .  do you think people always had computers .  didn t you ever hear of cavemen .    niccolo said   how d they get along without computers .       don t know .  mr .  daugherty says they just had children any old time and did anything that came into their heads whether it would be good for everybody or not .  they didn t even know if it was good or not .  and farmers grew things with their hands and people had to do all the work in the factories and run all the machines .     i don t believe you .     that s what mr .  daugherty said .  he said it was just plain messy and everyone was miserable .   .   .   .  anyway  let me get to my idea  will you .     well  go ahead .  who s stopping you .   said niccolo  offended .    all right .  well  the hand computers  the ones with the knobs  had little squiggles on each knob .  and the slide rule had squiggles on it .  and the  multiplication table was all squiggles .  i asked what they were .  mr .  daugherty said they were numbers .     what .     each different squiggle stood for a different number .  for  one  you made a kind of mark  for  two  you make another kind of mark  for  three  another one and so on .     what for .     so you could compute .     what for .  you just tell the computer     jiminy   cried paul  his face twisting with anger   can t you get it through your head .  these slide rules and things didn t talk .     then how     the answers showed up in squiggles and you had to know what the squiggles meant .  mr .  daugherty says that  in olden days  everybody learned how to make squiggles when they were kids and how to decode them  too .  making squiggles was called  writing  and decoding them was  reading .   he says there was a different kind of squiggle for every word and they used to write whole books in squiggles .  he said they had some at the museum and i could look at them if i wanted to .  he said if i was going to be a real computer and programer i would have to know about the history of computing and that s why he was showing me all these things .    niccolo frowned .  he said   you mean everybody had to figure out squiggles for every word and remember them .   .  .  .  is this all real or are you making it up .     it s all real .  honest .  look  this is the way you make a  one .     he drew his finger through the air in a rapid downstroke .   this way you make  two   and this way  three .   i learned all the numbers up to  nine .      niccolo watched the curving finger uncomprehendingly .   what s the good of it .     you can leam how to make words .  i asked mr .  daugherty how you made the squiggle for  paul loeb  but he didn t know .  he said there were people at the museum who would know .  he said there were people who had learned how to decode whole books .  he said computers could be designed to decode books and used to be used that way but not any more because we have real books now  with magnetic tapes that go through the vocalizer and come out talking  you know .     sure .     so if we go down to the museum  we can get to learn how to make words in squiggles .  they ll let us because i m going to computer school .    niccolo was riddled with disappointment .   is that your idea .  holy smokes  paul  who wants to do that .  make stupid squiggles .     don t you get it .  don t you get it .  you dope .  it ll be secret message stuff     what .     sure .  what good is talking when everyone can understand you .  with squiggles you can send secret messages .  you can make them on paper and nobody in the world would know what you were saying unless they knew the squiggles  too .  and they wouldn t  you bet  unless we taught them .  we can have a real club  with initiations and rules and a clubhouse .  boy    a certain excitement began stirring in niccolo s bosom .   what kind of secret messages .     any kind .  say i want to tell you to come over my place and watch my new visual bard and i don t want any of the other fellows to come .  i make the right squiggles on paper and i give it to you and you look at it and you know what to do .  nobody else does .  you can even show it to them and they wouldn t know a thing .     hey  that s something   yelled niccolo  completely won over .   when do we learn how .     tomorrow   said paul .   i ll get mr .  daugherty to explain to the museum that it s all right and you get your mother and father to say okay .  we can go down right after school and start learning .     sure .   cried niccolo .   we can be club officers .     i ll be president of the club   said paul matter of factly .   you can be vice president .     all right .  hey  this is going to be tots more fun than the bard .   he was suddenly reminded of the bard and said in sudden apprehension   hey  what about my old bard .    paul turned to look at it .  it was quietly taking in the slowly unreeling book  and the sound of the book s vocalizations was a dimly heard murmur .   he said   i ll disconnect it .    he worked away while niccolo watched anxiously .  after a few moments  paul put his reassembled book into his pocket  replaced the bard s panel and activated it .   the bard said   once upon a time  in a large city  there lived a poor young boy named fair johnnie whose only friend in the world was a small computer .  the computer  each morning  would tell the boy whether it would rain that day and answer any problems he might have .  it was never wrong .  but it so happened that one day  the king of that land  having heard of the little computer  decided that he would have it as his own .  with this purpose in mind  he called in his grand vizier and said    niccolo turned off the bard with a quick motion of his hand .   same old junk   he said passionately   fust with a computer thrown in .     well   said paul   they got so much stuff on the tape already that the computer business doesn t show up much when random combinations are made .  what s the difference  anyway .  you just need a new model .     we ll never be able to afford one .  just this dirty old miserable thing .   he kicked at it again  hitting it more squarely this time .  the bard moved backward with a squeal of castors .    you can always watch mine  when i get it   said paul .   besides  don t forget our squiggle club .    niccolo nodded .    i tell you what   said paul .   let s go over to my place .  my father has some books about old times .  we can listen to them and maybe get some ideas .  you leave a note for your folks and maybe you can stay over for supper .  come on .     okay   said niccolo  and the two boys ran out together .  niccolo  in his eagerness  ran almost squarely into the bard  but he only rubbed at the spot on his hip where he had made contact and ran on .   the activation signal of the bard glowed .  niccolo s collision closed a circuit and  although it was alone in the room and there was none to hear  it began a story  nevertheless .   but not in its usual voice  somehow  in a lower tone that had a hint of throatiness in it .  an adult  listening  might almost have thought that the voice carried a hint of passion in it  a trace of near feeling .   the bard said   once upon a time  there was a little computer named the bard who lived all alone with cruel step people .  the cruel step people continually made fun of the little computer and sneered at him  telling him he was good for nothing and that he was a useless object .  they struck him and kept him in lonely rooms for months at a time .    yet through it all the little computer remained brave .  he always did the best he could  obeying all orders cheerfully .  nevertheless  the step people with whom he lived remained cruel and heartless .    one day  the little computer learned that in the world there existed a great many computers of all sorts  great numbers of them .  some were bards like himself  but some ran factories  and some ran farms .  some organized population and some analyzed all kinds of data .  many were very powerful and very wise  much more powerful and wise than the step people who were so cruel to the little computer .    and the little computer knew then that computers would always grow wiser and more powerful until someday someday someday    but a valve must finally have stuck in the bard s aging and corroding vitals  for as it waited alone in the darkening room through the evening  it could only whisper over and over again   someday someday someday .    the author s

torture is done and it s now for the fun and the paper that s white and the words that are right  for you ve worked up a new s . f .  story .   dreaming  is a private thing  jesse weill looked up from his desk .  his old  spare body  his sharp  high bridged nose  deep set  shadowy eyes and amazing shock of white hair had trademarked his appearance during the years that dreams  inc .   had become world famous .   he said   is the boy here already  joe .    joe dooley was short and heavy set .  a cigar caressed his moist lower lip .  he took it away for a moment and nodded .   his folks are with him .  they re all scared .     you re sure this is not a false akrm  joe .  i haven t got much time .   he looked at his watch .   government business at two .     this is a sure thing  mr .  weill .   dooley s face was a study in earnestness .  his jowls quivered with persuasive intensity .   like i told you  i picked him up playing some kind of basketball game in the schoolyard .  you should ve seen the kid .  he stunk .  when he had his hands on the ball  his own team had to take it away  and fast  but just the same he had all the stance of a star player .  know what i mean .  to me it was a giveaway .     did you talk to him .     well  sure .  i stopped him at lunch .  you know me .   dooley gestured expansively with his cigar and caught the severed ash with his other hand .   kid  i said     and he s dream material .     i said   kid  i just came from africa and       all right .   weill held up the palm of his hand .   your word i ll always  copyright         by fantasy house  inc .   take .  how you do it i don t know  but when you say a boy is a potential dreamer  i ll gamble .  bring him in .    the youngster came in between his parents .  dooley pushed chairs forward and weill rose to shake hands .  he smiled at the youngster in a way that turned the wrinkles of his face into benevolent creases .    you re tommy slutsky .    tommy nodded wordlessly .  he was about ten and a little small for that .  his dark hair was plastered down unconvincingly and his face was unrealisti cally clean .   weill said   you re a good boy .    the boy s mother smiled at once and patted tommy s head maternally  a gesture which did not soften the anxious expression on the youngster s face  .  she said   he s always a very good boy .    weill let this dubious statement pass .   tell me  tommy   he said  and held out a lollipop which was first hesitated over  then accepted   do you ever listen to dreamies .     sometimes   said tommy trebly .   mr .  slutsky cleared his throat .  he was broad shouldered and thick fingered  the type of laboring man who  every once in a while  to the confusion of eugenics  sired a dreamer .   we rented one or two for the boy .  real old ones .    weill nodded .  he said   did you like them  tommy .     they were sort of silly .     you think up better ones for yourself  do you .    the grin that spread over the ten year old face had the effect of taking away some of the unreality of the slicked hair and washed face .   weill went on gently   would you like to make up a dream for me .    tommy was instantly embarrassed .   i guess not .     it won t be hard .  it s very easy .   .   .   .  joe .    dooley moved a screen out of the way and rolled forward a dream recorder .   the youngster looked owlishly at it .   weill lifted the helmet and brought it close to the boy .   do you know what this is .    tommy shrank away .   no .     it s a thinker .  that s what we call it because people think into it .  you put it on your head and think anything you want .     then what happens .     nothing at all .  it feels nice .     no   said tommy   i guess i d rather not .    his mother bent hurriedly toward him .   it won t hurt  tommy .  you do what the man says .   there was an unmistakable edge to her voice .   tommy stiffened  and looked as though he might cry but he didn t .  weill put the thinker on him .   he did it gently and slowly and let it remain there for some thirty seconds before speaking again  to let the boy assure himself it would do no harm  to let him get used to the insinuating touch of the fibrils against the sutures of his skull  penetrating the skin so finely as to be insensible almost   and finally to let him get used to the faint hum of the alternating field vortices .   then he said   now would you think for us .     about what .   only the boy s nose and mouth showed .    about anything you want .  what s the best thing you would like to do when school is out .    the boy thought a moment and said  with rising inflection   go on a stratojet .     why not .  sure thing .  you go on a jet .  it s taking off right now .   he gestured lightly to dooley  who threw the freezer into circuit .   weill kept the boy only five minutes and then let him and his mother be escorted from the office by dooley .  tommy looked bewildered but undamaged by the ordeal .   weill said to the father   now  mr .  slutsky  if your boy does well on this test  we ll be glad to pay you five hundred dollars each year until he finishes high school .  in that time  all we ll ask is that he spend an hour a week some afternoon at our special school .     do i have to sign a paper .   slutsky s voice was a bit hoarse .    certainly .  this is business  mr .  slutsky .     well  i don t know .  dreamers are hard to come by  i hear .     they are .  they are .  but your son  mr .  slutsky  is not a dreamer yet .  he might never be .  five hundred dollars a year is a gamble for us .  it s not a gamble for you .  when he s finished high school  it may turn out he s not a dreamer  yet you ve lost nothing .  you ve gained maybe four thousand dollars altogether .  if he is a dreamer  he ll make a nice living and you certainly haven t lost then .     he ll need special training  won t he .     oh  yes  most intensive .  but we don t have to worry about that till after he s finished high school .  then  after two years with us  he ll be developed .  rely on me  mr .  slutsky .     will you guarantee that special training .    weill  who had been shoving a paper across the desk at slutsky  and punching a pen wrong end to at him  put the pen down and chuckled .   a guarantee .  no .  how can we when we don t know for sure yet if he s a real talent .  still  the five hundred a year will stay yours .    slutsky pondered and shook his head .   i tell you straight out  mr .  weill  .   .   .  after your man arranged to have us come here  i called luster think .  they said they ll guarantee training .    weill sighed .   mr .  slutsky  i don t like to talk against a competitor .  if they say they ll guarantee schooling  they ll do as they say  but they can t make a boy a dreamer if he hasn t got it in him  schooling or not .  if they  t ke a plain boy without the proper talent and put him through a development course  they ll ruin him .  a dreamer he won t be  i guarantee you .  and a normal human being  he won t be  either .  don t take the chance of doing it  to your son .    now dreams  inc .   will be perfectly honest with you .  if he can be a dreamer  we ll make him one .  if not  we ll give him back to you without having tampered with him and say   let him learn a trade .   he ll be better aind healthier that way .  i tell you  mr .  slutsky i have sons and daughters aind grandchildren so i know what i say i would not allow a child of mine t o be pushed into dreaming if he s not ready for it .  not for a million dlollars .    slutsky wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and reached for the p n .   what does this say .     this is just an option .  we pay you a hundred dollars in cash right now .  no strings attached .  we study the boy s reverie .  if we feel it s worth follow iing up  we ll call you in again and make the five hundred dollar a year deaj .  leave yourself in my hands  mr .  slutsky  and don t worry .  you won t be s orry .    slutsky signed .   weill passed the document through the file slot and handed an envelope t o slutsky .   five minutes later  alone in the office  he placed the unfreezer over his qwn head and absorbed the boy s reverie intently .  it was a typically childish  saydream .  first person was at the controls of the plane  which looked like a compound of illustrations out of the filmed thrillers that still circulated among those who lacked the time  desire or money for dream cylinders .   when he removed the unfreezer  he found dooley looking at him .    well  mr .  weill  what do you think .   said dooley  with an eager and proprietary air .    could be  joe .  could be .  he has the overtones and  for a ten year old boy without a scrap of training  it s hopeful .  when the plane went through aj cloud  there was a distinct sensation of pillows .  also the smell of clean sheets  which was an amusing touch .  we can go with him a ways  joe .     good .     but i tell you  joe  what we really need is to catch them still sooner .  and svhy not .  someday  joe  every child will be tested at birth .  a difference in tthe brain there positively must be and it should be found .  then we could separate the dreamers at the very beginning .     hell  mr .  weill   said dooley  looking hurt .   what would happen to my jjob  then .    weill laughed .   no cause to worry yet  joe .  it won t happen in our life ttimes .  in mine  certainly not .  we ll be depending on good talent scouts like  you for many years .  you just watch the playgrounds and the streets   mfeill s gnarled hand dropped to dooley s shoulder with a gentle  approving  pressure  and find us a few more hillarys and janows and luster think won t ever catch us .   .  .  .  now get out .  i want lunch and then i ll be ready for my two o clock appointment .  the government  joe  the government .   and he winked portentously .   jesse weill s two o clock appointment was with a young man  apple cheeked  spectacled  sandy haired and glowing with the intensity of a man with a mission .  he presented his credentials across weill s desk and revealed himself to be john j .  byrne  an agent of the department of arts and sciences .    good afternoon  mr .  byrne   said weill .   in what way can i be of service .     are we private here .   asked the agent .  he had an unexpected baritone .    quite private .     then  if you don t mind  i ll ask you to absorb this .   byrne produced a small and battered cylinder and held it out between thumb and forefinger .   weill took it  hefted it  turned it this way and that and said with a denture revealing smile   not the product of dreams  inc .   mr .  byrne .     i didn t think it was   said the agent .   i d still like you to absorb it .  i d set the automatic cutoff for about a minute  though .     that s all that can be endured .   weill pulled the receiver to his desk and placed the cylinder into the unfreeze compartment .  he removed it  polished either end of the cylinder with his handkerchief and tried again .   it doesn t make good contact   he said .   an amateurish job .    he placed the cushioned unfreeze helmet over his skull and adjusted the temple contacts  then set the automatic cutoff .  he leaned back and clasped his hands over his chest and began absorbing .   his fingers grew rigid and clutched at his jacket .  after the cutoff had brought absorption to an end  he removed the unfreezer and looked faintly angry .   a raw piece   he said .   it s lucky i m an old man so that such things no longer bother me .    byrne said stiffly   it s not the worst we ve found .  and the fad is increasing .    weill shrugged .   pornographic dreamies .  it s a logical development  i suppose .    the government man said   logical or not  it represents a deadly danger for the moral fiber of the nation .     the moral fiber   said weill   can take a lot of beating .  erotica of one form or another have been circulated all through history .     not like this  sir .  a direct mind to mind stimulation is much more effective than smoking room stories or filthy pictures .  those must be filtered through the senses and lose some of their effect in that way .    weill could scarcely argue that point .  he said   what would you have me do .           can you suggest a possible source for this cylinder .     mr .  byrne  i m not a policeman .     no  no  i m not asking you to do our work for us .  the department is quite capable of conducting its own investigations .  can you help us  i mean  from your own specialized knowledge .  you say your company did not put out that filth .  who did .     no reputable dream distributor .  i m sure of that .  it s too cheaply made .     that could have been done on purpose .     and no professional dreamer originated it .     are you sure  mr .  weill .  couldn t dreamers do this sort of thing for some small  illegitimate concern for money or for fun .     they could  but not this particular one .  no overtones .  it s two dimensional .  of course  a thing like this doesn t need overtones .     what do you mean  overtones .    weill laughed gently .   you are not a dreamie fan .    byme tried not to look virtuous and did not entirely succeed .   i prefer music .     well  that s all right  too   said weill tolerantly   but it makes it a little harder to explain overtones .  even people who absorb dreamies would not be able to explain if you asked them .  still they d know a dreamie was no good if the overtones were missing  even if they couldn t tell you why .  look  when an experienced dreamer goes into reverie  he doesn t think a story like in the old fashioned television or book films .  it s a series of little visions .  each one has several meanings .  if you studied them carefully  you d find maybe five or six .  while absorbing in the ordinary way  you would never notice  but careful study shows it .  believe me  my psychological staff puts in long hours on just that point .  all the overtones  the different meanings  blend together into a mass of guided emotion .  without them  everything would be flat  tasteless .    now  this morning  i tested a young boy .  a ten year old with possibilities .  a cloud to him isn t a cloud  it s a pillow  too .  having the sensations of both  it was more than either .  of course  the boy s very primitive .  but when he s through with his schooling  he ll be trained and disciplined .  he ll be subjected to all sorts of sensations .  he ll store up experience .  he ll study and analyze classic dreamies of the past .  he ll learn how to control and direct his thoughts  though  mind you  i have always said that when a good dreamer improvises    weill halted abruptly  then proceeded in less impassioned tones   i shouldn t get excited .  all i try to bring out now is that every professional dreamer has his own type of overtones which he can t mask .  to an expert it s like signing his name on the dreamie .  and i  mr .  byrne  know all the signatures .  now that piece of dirt you brought me has no overtones at all .  it was done by an ordinary person .  a little talent  maybe  but like you and me  he really can t think .    byrne reddened a trifle .   a lot of people can think  mr .  weill  even if they don t make dreamies .     oh  tush   and weill wagged his hand in the air .   don t be angry with what an old man says .  i don t mean think as in reason .  i mean think as in dream .  we all can dream after a fashion  just like we all can run .  but can you and i run a mile in four minutes .  you and i can talk  but are we daniel websters .  now when i think of a steak  i think of the word .  maybe i have a quick picture of a brown steak on a platter .  maybe you have a better pictori alization of it and you can see the crisp fat and the onions and the baked potato .  i don t know .  but a dreamer  .   .   .  he sees it and smells it and tastes it and everything about it  with the charcoal and the satisfied feeling in the stomach and the way the knife cuts through it and a hundred other things all at once .  very sensual .  very sensual .  you and i can t do it .     well  then   said byrne   no professional dreamer has done this .  that s something anyway .   he put the cylinder in his inner jacket pocket .   i hope we ll have your full cooperation in squelching this sort of thing .     positively  mr .  byrne .  with a whole heart .     i hope so .   byrne spoke with a consciousness of power .   it s not up to me  mr .  weill  to say what will be done and what won t be done  but this sort of thing   he tapped the cylinder he had brought   will make it awfully tempting to impose a really strict censorship on dreamies .    he rose .   good day  mr .  weill .     good day  mr .  byrne .  i ll hope always for the best .    francis belanger burst into jesse weill s office in his usual steaming tizzy  his reddish hair disordered and his face aglow with worry and a mild perspiration .  he was brought up sharply by the sight of weill s head cradled in the crook of his elbow and bent on the desk until only the glimmer of white hair was visible .   belanger swallowed .   boss .    weill s head lifted .   it s you  frank .     what s the matter  boss .  are you sick .     i m old enough to be sick  but i m on my feet .  staggering  but on my feet .  a government man was here .     what did he want .     he threatens censorship .  he brought a sample of what s going round .  cheap dreamies for bottle parties .     god damn .   said belanger feelingly .    the only trouble is that morality makes for good campaign fodder .  they ll be hitting out everywhere .  and  to tell the truth  we re vulnerable  frank .     we are .  our stuff is clean .  we play up straight adventure and romance .    weill thrust out his lower lip and wrinkled his forehead .   between us  frank  we don t have to make believe .  clean .  it depends on how you look at  it .  it s not for publication  maybe  but you know and i know that every dreamie has its freudian connotations .  you can t deny it .     sure  if you look for it .  if you re a psychiatrist     if you re an ordinary person  too .  the ordinary observer doesn t know it s there and maybe he couldn t tell a phallic symbol from a mother image even if you pointed it out .  still  his subconscious knows .  and it s the connotations that make many a dreamie click .     all right  what s the government going to do .  clean up the subconscious .     it s a problem .  i don t know what they re going to do .  what we have on our side  and what i m mainly depending on  is the fact that the public loves its dreamies and won t give them up .   .  .  .  meanwhile  what did you come in for .  you want to see me about something  i suppose .    belanger tossed an object onto weill s desk and shoved his shirttail deeper into his trousers .   weill broke open the glistening plastic cover and took out the enclosed cylinder .  at one end was engraved in a too fancy script in pastel blue  along the himalayan trail .   it bore the mark of luster think .    the competitor s product .   weill said it with capitals  and his lips twitched .   it hasn t been published yet .  where did you get it  frank .     never mind .  i just want you to absorb it .    weill sighed .   today  everyone wants me to absorb dreams .  frank  it s not dirty .    belanger said testily   it has your freudian symbols .  narrow crevasses between the mountain peaks .  i hope that won t bother you .     i m an old man .  it stopped bothering me years ago  but that other thing was so poorly done  it hurt .   .  .  .  all right  let s see what you ve got here .    again the recorder .  again the unfreezer over his skull and at the temples .  this time  weill rested back in his chair for fifteen minutes or more  while francis belanger went hurriedly through two cigarettes .   when weill removed the headpiece and blinked dream out of his eyes  belanger said   well  what s your reaction  boss .    weill corrugated his forehead .   it s not for me .  it was repetitious .  with competition like this  dreams  inc .   doesn t have to worry for a while .     that s your mistake  boss .  luster think s going to win with stuff like this .  we ve got to do something .     now  frank     no  you listen .  this is the coming thing .     this .   weill stared with a half humorous dubiety at the cylinder .   it s amateurish  it s repetitious .  its overtones are very unsubtle .  the snow had a distinct lemon sherbet taste .  who tastes lemon sherbet in snow these days  frank .  in the old days  yes .  twenty years ago  maybe .  when lyman harri son first made his snow symphonies for sale down south  it was a big thing .   sherbet and candy striped mountaintops and sliding down chocolate covered cliffs .  it s slapstick  frank .  these days it doesn t go .     because   said belanger   you re not up with the times  boss .  i ve got to talk to you straight .  when you started the dreamie business  when you bought up the basic patents and began putting them out  dreamies were luxury stuff .  the market was small and individual .  you could afford to turn out specialized dreamies and sell them to people at high prices .     i know   said weill   and we ve kept that up .  but also we ve opened a rental business for the masses .     yes  we have and it s not enough .  our dreamies have subtlety  yes .  they can be used over and over again .  the tenth time you re still finding new things  still getting new enjoyment .  but how many people are connoisseurs .  and another thing .  our stuff is strongly individualized .  they re first person .     well .     well  luster think is opening dream palaces .  they ve opened one with three hundred booths in nashville .  you walk in  take your seat  put on your unfreezer and get your dream .  everyone in the audience gets the same one .     i ve heard of it  frank  and it s been done before .  it didn t work the first time and it won t work now .  you want to know why it won t work .  because  in the first place  dreaming is a private thing .  do you like your neighbor to know what you re dreaming .  in the second place  in a dream palace  the dreams have to start on schedule  don t they .  so the dreamer has to dream not when he wants to but when some palace manager says he should .  finally  a dream one person likes another person doesn t like .  in those three hundred booths  i guarantee you  a hundred fifty people are dissatisfied .  and if they re dissatisfied  they won t come back .    slowly  belanger rolled up his sleeves and opened his collar .   boss   he said   you re talking through your hat .  what s the use of proving they won t work .  they are working .  the word came through today that luster think is breaking ground for a thousand booth palace in st .  louis .  people can get used to public dreaming  if everyone else in the same room is having the same dream .  and they can adjust themselves to having it at a given time  as long as it s cheap and convenient .    damn it  boss  it s a social affair .  a boy and a girl go to a dream palace and absorb some cheap romantic thing with stereotyped overtones and commonplace situations  but still they come out with stars sprinkling their hair .  they ve had the same dream together .  they ve gone through identical sloppy emotions .  they re in tune  boss .  you bet they go back to the dream palace  and all their friends go  too .    and if they don t like the dream .     that s the point .  that s the nub of the whole thing .  they re bound to like it .  if you prepare hillary specials with wheels within wheels within wheels  with surprise twists on the third level undertones  with clever shifts  of significance and all the other things we re so proud of  why  naturally  it won t appeal to everyone .  specialized dreamies are for specialized tastes .  but luster think is turning out simple jobs in third person so both sexes can be hit at once .  like what you ve just absorbed .  simple  repetitious  commonplace .  they re aiming at the lowest common denominator .  no one will love it  maybe  but no one will hate it .    weill sat silent for a long time and belanger watched him .  then weill said   frank  i started on quality and i m staying there .  maybe you re right .  maybe dream palaces are the coming thing .  if so we ll open them  but we ll use good stuff .  maybe luster think underestimates ordinary people .  let s go slowly and not panic .  i have based all my policies on the theory that there s always a market for quality .  sometimes  my boy  it would surprise you how big a market .     boss    the sounding of the intercom interrupted belanger .    what is it  ruth .   said weill .   the voice of his secretary said   it s mr .  hillary  sir .  he wants to see you right away .  he says it s important .     hillary .   weill s voice registered shock .  then   wait five minutes  ruth  then send him in .    weill turned to belanger .   today  frank  is definitely not one of my good days .  a dreamer s place is in his home with his thinker .  and hillary s our best dreamer so he especially should be at home .  what do you suppose is wrong with him .    belanger  still brooding over luster think and dream palaces  said shortly   call him in and find out .     in one minute .  tell me  how was his last dream .  i haven t tried the one that came in last week .    belanger came down to earth .  he wrinkled his nose .   not so good .     why not .     it was ragged .  too jumpy .  i don t mind sharp transitions for the liveliness  you know  but there s got to be some connection  even if only on a deep level .     is it a total loss .     no hillary dream is a total loss .  it took a lot of editing  though .  we cut it down quite a bit and spliced in some odd pieces he d sent us now and then .  you know  detached scenes .  it s still not grade a  but it will pass .     you told him about this  frank .     think i m crazy  boss .  think i m going to say a harsh word to a dreamer .    and at that point the door opened and weill s comely young secretary smiled sherman hillary into the office .   sherman hillary  at the age of thirty one  could have been recognized as a dreamer by anyone .  his eyes  unspectacled  had nevertheless the misty look of one who either needs glasses or who rarely focuses on anything mundane .  he was of average height but underweight  with black hair that needed cutting  a narrow chin  a pale skin and a troubled look .   he muttered   hello  mr .  weill   and half nodded in hangdog fashion in the direction of belanger .   weill said heartily   sherman  my boy  you look fine .  what s the matter .  a dream is cooking only so so at home .  you re worried about it .   .  .  .  sit down  sit down .    the dreamer did  sitting at the edge of the chair and holding his thighs stiffly together as though to be ready for instant obedience to a possible order to stand up once more .   he said   i ve come to tell you  mr .  weill  i m quitting .     quitting .     i don t want to dream any more  mr .  weill .    weill s old face looked older now than at any time in the day .   why  sherman .    the dreamer s lips twisted .  he blurted out   because i m not living  mr .  weill .  everything passes me by .  it wasn t so bad at first .  it was even relaxing .  i d dream evenings  weekends when i felt like  or any other time .  and when i felt like i wouldn t .  but now  mr .  weill  i m an old pro .  you tell me i m one of the best in the business and the industry looks to me to think up new subtleties and new changes on the old reliables like the flying reveries  and the worm turning skits .    weill said   and is anyone better than you  sherman .  your little sequence on leading an orchestra is selling steadily after ten years .     all right  mr .  weill .  i ve done my part .  it s gotten so i don t go out any more .  i neglect my wife .  my little girl doesn t know me .  last week  we went to a dinner party sarah made me and i don t remember a bit of it .  sarah says i was sitting on the couch all evening just staring at nothing and humming .  she said everyone kept looking at me .  she cried all night .  i m tired of things like that  mr .  weill .  i want to be a normal person and live in this world .  i promised her i d quit and i will  so it s good by  mr .  weill .   hillary stood up and held out his hand awkwardly .   weill waved it gently away .   if you want to quit  sherman  it s all right .  but do an old man a favor and let me explain something to you .     i m not going to change my mind   said hillary .    i m not going to try to make you .  i just want to explain something .  i m an old man and even before you were born i was in this business so i like to talk about it .  humor me  sherman .  please .    hillary sat down .  his teeth clamped down on his lower lip and he stared sullenly at his fingernails .   weill said   do you know what a dreamer is  sherman .  do you know  what he means to ordinary people .  do you know what it is to be like me  like frank belanger  like your wife  sarah .  to have crippled minds that can t imagine  that can t build up thoughts .  people like myself  ordinary people  would like to escape just once in a while this life of ours .  we can t .  we need help .    in olden times it was books  plays  radio  movies  television .  they gave us make believe  but that wasn t important .  what was important was that for a little while our own imaginations were stimulated .  we could think of handsome lovers and beautiful princesses .  we could be beautiful  witty  strong  capable  everything we weren t .    but  always  the passing of the dream from dreamer to absorber was not perfect .  it had to be translated into words in one way or another .  the best dreamer in the world might not be able to get any of it into words .  and the best writer in the world could put only the smallest part of his dreams into words .  you understand .    but now  with dream recording  any man can dream .  you  sherman  and a handful of men like you  supply those dreams directly and exactly .  it s straight from your head into ours  full strength .  you dream for a hundred million people every time you dream .  you dream a hundred million dreams at once .  this is a great thing  my boy .  you give all those people a glimpse of something they could not have by themselves .    hillary mumbled   i ve done my share .   he rose desperately to his feet .   i m through .  i don t care what you say .  and if you want to sue me for breaking our contract  go ahead and sue .  i don t care .    weill stood up  too .   would i sue you .   .   .   .  ruth   he spoke into the intercom   bring in our copy of mr .  hillary s contract .    he waited .  so did hillary and so did belanger .  weill smiled faintly and his yellowed fingers drummed softly on his desk .   his secretary brought in the contract .  weill took it  showed its face to hillary and said   sherman  my boy  unless you want to be with me  it s not right you should stay .    then  before belanger could make more than the beginning of a horrified gesture to stop him  he tore the contract into four pieces and tossed them down the waste chute .   that s all .    hillary s hand shot out to seize weill s .   thanks  mr .  weill   he said earnestly  his voice husky .   you ve always treated me very well  and i m grateful .  i m sorry it had to be like this .     it s all right  my boy .  it s all right .    half in tears  still muttering thanks  sherman hillary left .    for the love of pete  boss  why did you let him go .   demanded belanger distractedly .   don t you see the game .  he ll be going straight to luster think .  they ve bought him off .    weill raised his hand .   you re wrong .  you re quite wrong .  i know the boy  and this would not be his style .  besides   he added dryly   ruth is a good secretary and she knows what to bring me when i ask for a dreamer s contract .  what i had was a fake .  the real contract is still in the safe  believe me .    meanwhile  a fine day i ve had .  i had to argue with a father to give me a chance at new talent  with a government man to avoid censorship  with you to keep from adopting fatal policies and now with my best dreamer to keep him from leaving .  the father i probably won out over .  the government man and you  i don t know .  maybe yes  maybe no .  but about sherman hillary  at least  there is no question .  the dreamer will be back .     how do you know .    weill smiled at belanger and crinkled his cheeks into a network of fine lines .   frank  my boy  you know how to edit dreamies so you think you know all the tools and machines of the trade .  but let me tell you something .  the most important tool in the dreamie business is the dreamer himself .  he is the one you have to understand most of all  and i understand them .    listen .  when i was a youngster there were no dreamies then i knew a fellow who wrote television scripts .  he would complain to me bitterly that when someone met him for the first time and found out who he was  they would say  where do you get those crazy ideas .    they honestly didn t know .  to them it was an impossibility to even think of one of them .  so what could my friend say .  he used to talk to me about it and tell me  could i say  i don t know .  when i go to bed  i can t sleep for ideas dancing in my head .  when i shave  i cut myself  when i talk  i lose track of what i m saying  when i drive  i take my life in my hands .  and always because ideas  situations  dialogues are spinning and twisting in my mind .  i can t tell you where i get my ideas .  can you tell me  maybe  your trick of not getting ideas  so i  too  can have a little peace .    you see  frank  how it is .  you can stop work here anytime .  so can i .  this is our job  not our life .  but not sherman hillary .  wherever he goes  whatever he does  he ll dream .  while he lives  he must think  while he thinks  he must dream .  we don t hold him prisoner  our contract isn t an iron wall for him .  his own skull is his prisoner  frank .  so he ll be back .  what can he do .   belanger shrugged .   if what you say is right  i m sort of sorry for the  guy    weill nodded sadly .   i m sorry for all of them .  through the years  i ve found out one thing .  it s their business  making people happy .  other peo pie .    profession  george platen could not conceal the longing in his voice .  it was too much to suppress .  he said     tomorrow   s the first of may .  olympics .      he rolled over on his stomach and peered over the foot of his bed at his roommate .  didn   t he feel it  too .  didn   t this make some impression on him .   george   s face was thin and had grown a trifle thinner in the nearly year and a half that he had been at the house .  his figure was slight but the look in his blue eyes was as intense as it had ever been  and right now there was a trapped look in the way his fingers curled against the bedspread .   george   s roommate looked up briefly from his book and took the oppoffimity to adjust the light level of the stretch of wall near his chair .  his name was hali omani and he was a nigerian by birth .  his dark brown skin and massive features seemed made for calmness  and mention of the olympics did not move him .   he said     i know  george .      george owed much to hall   s patience and kindness when it was needed  but even patience and kindness could be overdone .  was this a time to sit there like a statue built of some dark  warm wood .   george wondered if he himself would grow like that after ten years here and rejected the thought violently .  no .   he said defiantly     i think you   ve forgotten what may means .      the other said     i remember very well what it means .  it means nothing .  you   re the one who   s forgotten that .  may means nothing to you  george platen  and     he added softly     it means nothing to me  hali omani .      george said     the ships are coming in for recruits .  by june  thousands and thousands will leave with millions of men and women heading for any world you can name  and all that means nothing .         less than nothing .  what do you want me to do about it  anyway .     omani ran his finger along a difficult passage in the book he was reading and his lips moved soundlessly .   george watched him .  damn it  he thought  yell  scream  you can do that much .  kick at me  do anything .   it was only that he wanted not to beso alone in his anger .  he wanted not to be the only one so filled with resentment  not to be the only one dying a slow death .   it was better those first weeks when the universe was a small shell of vague light and sound pressing down upon him .  it was better before omarn had wavered into view and dragged him back to a life that wasn   t worth living .   omani .  he was old .  he was at least thirty .  george thought  will i be like that at thirty .  will i be like that in twelve years .   and because he was afraid he might be  he yelled at omani     will you stop reading that fool book .      omani turned a page and read on a few words  then lifted his head with its skullcap of crisply curled hair and said     what .         what good does it do you to read the book .     he stepped forward  snorted    more electronics     and slapped it out of omani   s hands .   omani got up slowly and picked up the book .  he smoothed a crumpled page without visible rancor .     call it the satisfaction of curiosity     he said .     i understand a little of it today  perhaps a little more tomorrow .  that   s a victory in a way .         a victory .  what kind of a victory .  is that what satisfies you in life .  to get to know enough to be a quarter of a registered electronician by the time you   re sixty five .         perhaps by the time i   mthirty five .         and then who   ll want you .  who   ll use you .  where will you go .         no one .  no one .  nowhere .  i   ll stay here and read other books .         and that satisfies you .  tell me .  you   ve dragged me to class .  you   ve got me to reading and memorizing  too .  for what .  there   s nothing in it that satisfies me .         what good will it do you to deny yourself satisfaction .         it means i   ll quit the whole farce .  i   ll do as i planned to do in the beginning before you dovey lovied me out of it .  i   m going to force them to to               omani put down his book .  he let the other run down and then said     to what  george .         to correct a miscarriage of justice .  a frame up .  i   ll get that antoneffi and force him to admit he he         omani shook his head .     everyone who comes here insists it   s a mistake .  i thought you   d passed that stage .         don   t call it a stage     said george violently .     in my case  it   s a fact .  i   ve told you         you   ve told me  but in your heart you know no one made any mistake as far as you were concerned .         because no one will admit it .  you think any of them would admit a mistake unless they were forced to .  well  i   ll force them .      it was may that was doing this to george  it was olympics month .  he felt it bring the old wildness back and he couldn   t stop it .  he didn   t want to stop it .  he had been in danger of forgetting .   he said     i was going tobe acomputerprogrammerandlcanbeone .  i could be one today  regardless of what they say analysis shows .     he pounded his mattress .     they   re wrong .  they must be .         the analysts are never wrong .         they must be .  do you doubt my intelligence .         inteffigence hasn   t one thing to do with it .  haven   t you been told that often enough .  can   t you understand that .      george rolled away  lay on his back and stared somberly at the ceiling .      what did you want to be  hali .         i had no fixed plans .  hydropomcist would have suited me  i suppose .         did you think you could make it .         i wasn   t sure .      george had never asked personal questions of omani before .  it struck him as queer  almost unnatural  that other people had had ambitions and ended here .  hydroponicist .   he said     did you think you   d make this .         no  but here i am just the same .         and you   re satisfied .  really  really satisfied .  you   re happy .  you love it .  you wouldn   t be anywhere else .      slowly  omani got to his feet .  carefully  he began to unmake his bed .  he said     george  you   re a hard case .  you   re knocking yourself out because you won   t accept the facts about yourself .  george  you   re here in what you call the house  but i   ve never heard you give it its full title .  say it  george  say it .  then go to bed and sleep this off .      george gritted his teeth and showed them .  he choked out     no .         then i will     said omani  and he did .  he shaped each syllable carefully .   george was bitterly ashamed at the sound of it .  he turned his head away .   for most of the first eighteen years of his life  george platen had headed firmly in one direction  that of registered computer programmer .  there were those in his crowd who spoke wisely of spationautics  refrigeration technology  transportation control  and even administration .  but george held firm .   he argued relative merits as vigorously as any of them  and why not .  education day loomed ahead of them and was the great fact of their existence .  it approached steadily  as fixed and certain as the calendar  the first day of november of the year following one   s eighteenth birthday .   after that day  there were other topics of conversation .  one could discuss with others some detail of the profession  or the virtues of one   s wife and children  or the fate of one   s space polo team  or one   s experience in the olympics .  before education day  however  there was only one topic that  unfailingly and unwearyingly held everyone   s interest  and that was education day .      what are you going for .  think you   ll make it .  heck  that   s no good .  look at the records  quota   s been cut .  logistics now      or hypermechanics now  or communications now  or gravitics now  especially gravitics at the moment .  everyone had been talking about gravitics in the few years just before george   s education day because of the development of the gravitic power engine .   any world within ten light years of a dwarf star  everyone said  would give its eyeteeth for any kind of registered gravitics engineer .   the thought of that never bothered george .  sure it would  all the eyeteeth it could scare up .  but george had also heard what had happened before in a newly developed technique .  rationalization and simplification followed in a flood .  new models each year  new types of gravitic engines  new principles .  then all those eyeteeth gentlemen would find themselves out of date and superseded by later models with later educations .  the first group would then have to settle down to unskilled labor or ship out to some backwoods world that wasn   t quite caught up yet .   now computer programmers were in steady demand year after year  century after century .  the demand never reached wild peaks  there was never a howling bull market for programmers  but the demand climbed steadily as new worlds opened up and as older worlds grew more complex .   he had argued with stubby trevelyan about that constantly .  as best friends  their arguments had to be constant and vitriolic and  of course  neither ever persuaded or was persuaded .   but then trevelyan had had a father who was a registered metallurgist and had actually served on one of the outworlds  and a grandfather who had also been a registered metallurgist .  he himself was intent on becoming a registered metallurgist almost as a matter of family right and was firmly convinced that any other profession was a shadeless than respectable .      there   ll always be metal     he said     and there   s an accomplishment in molding alloys to specification and watching structures grow .  now what   s a programmer going to be doing .  sitting at a coder all day long  feeding some fool mile long machine .      even at sixteen  george had learned to be practical .  he said simply     there   ll be a million metallurgists put out along with you .         because it   s good .  a good profession .  the best .         but you get crowded out  stubby .  you can be way back in line .  any world can tape out its own metallurgists  and the market for advanced earth models isn   t so big .  and it   s mostly the small worlds that want them .  you know what percent of the turnout of registered metallurgists get tabbed for worlds with a grade a rating .  i looked it up .  it   s just    .   percent .  that means you   ll have seven chances in eight of being stuck in some world that  just about has running water .  you may even be stuck on earth    .   percent are .      trevelyan said beffigerently     there   s no disgrace in staying on earth .  earth needs technicians  too .  good ones .     his grandfather had been an earth bound metallurgist  and trevelyan lifted his finger to his upper lip and dabbed at an as yet nonexistent mustache .   george knew about trevelyan   s grandfather and  considering the earthbound position of his own ancestry  was in no mood to sneer .  he said diplomatically     no intellectual disgrace .  of course not .  but it   s nice to get into a grade a world  isn   t it .      now you take programmers .  only the grade a worlds have the kind of computers that really need first class programmers so they   re the only ones in the market .  and programmer tapes are complicated and hardly any one fits .  they need more programmers than their own population can supply .  it   s just a matter of statistics .  there   s one first class programmer per million  say .  a world needs twenty and has a population often million  they have to come to earth for five to fifteen programmers .  right .      and you know how many registered computer programmers went to grade a planets last year .  i   ll tell you .  every last one .  if you   re a programmer  you   re a picked man .  yes  sir .      trevelyan frowned .     if only one in a million makes it  what makes you think you   ll make it .      george said guardedly     i   ll make it .      he never dared tell anyone  not trevelyan  not his parents  of exactly what he was doing that made him so confident .  but he wasn   t worried .  he was simply confident  that was the worst of the memories he had in the hopeless days afterward  .  he was as blandly confident as the average eight year old kid approaching reading day that childhood preview of education day .   of course  reading day had been different .  partly  there was the simple fact of childhood .  a boy of eight takes many extraordinary things in stride .  one day you can   t read and the next day you can .  that   s just the way things are .  like the sun shining .   and then not so much depended upon it .  there were no recruiters just ahead  waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming olympics .  a boy or girl who goes through the reading day is just someone who has ten more years of undifferentiated living upon earth   s crawling surface  just someone who returns to his family with one new ability .   by the time education day caine  ten years later  george wasn   t even sure of most of the details of his own reading day .     most clearly of all  he remembered it to be a dismal september day with a mild rain falling .   september for reading day  november for education  day  may for olympics .  they made nursery rhymes out of it .   george had  dressed by the wall lights  with his parents far more excited than he himself was .  his father was a registered pipe fitter and had found his occupation on earth .  this fact had always been a humiliation to him  although  of course  as anyone could see plainly  most of each generation must stay on earth in the nature of things .   there had to be farmers and miners and even technicians on earth .  it was only the late model  high specialty professions that were in demand on the outworlds  and only a few millions a year out of earth   s eight billion population could be exported .  every man and woman on earth couldn   t be among that group .   but every man and woman could hope that at least one of his children could be one  and platen  senior  was certainly no exception .  it was obvious to him  and  to be sure  to others as well  that george was notably intelligent and quick minded .  he would be bound to do well and he would have to  as he was an only child .  if george didn   t end on an outworld  they would have to wait for grandchildren before a next chance would come along  and that was too far in the future to be much consolation .   reading day would not prove much  of course  but it would be the only indication they would have before the big day itself .  every parent on earth would be listening to the quality of reading when his child came home with it  listening for any particularly easy flow of words and building that into certain omens of the future .  there were few families that didn   t have at least one hopeful who  from reading day on  was the great hope because of the way he handled his trisyllabics .   dimly  george was aware of the cause of his parents    tension  and if there was any anxiety in his young heart that drizzly morning  it was only the fear that his father   s hopeful expression might fade out when he returned home with his reading .   the children met in the large assembly room of the town   s education hall .  all over earth  in millions of local halls  throughout that month  similar groups of children would be meeting .  george felt depressed by the grayness of the room and by the other children  strained and stiff in unaccustomed finery .   automatically  george did as all the rest of the children did .  he found the small clique that represented the children on his floor of the apartment house and joined them .   trevelyan  who lived immediately next door  still wore his hair childishly long and was years removed from the sideburns and thin  reddish mustache that he was to grow as soon as he was physiologically capable of  it .   trevelyan  to whom george was then known as jaw joe  said     bet you   re scared .         i am not     said george .  then  confidentially     my folks got a hunk of printing up on the dresser in my room  and when .  come home  i   m going to read it for them .      george   s main suffering at the moment lay in the fact  that he didn   t quite know where to put his hands .  he had been warned not to scratch his head or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets .  this eliminated almost every possibility .    trevelyan put his hands in his pockets and said     my father isn   t worried .      trevelyan  senior  had been a metallurgist on diporia for nearly seven years  which gave him a superior social status in his neighborhood even though he had retired and returned to earth .   earth discouraged these re immigrants because of population problems  but a small trickle did return .  for one thing the cost of living was lower on earth  and what was a trifling annuity on diporia  say  was a comfortable income on earth .  besides  there were always men who found more satisfaction in displaying their success before the friends and scenes of their childhood than before all the rest of the universe besides .   trevelyan  senior  further explained that if he stayed on diporia  so would his children  and diporia was a one spaceship world .  back on earth  his kids could end anywhere  even novia .   stubby trevelyan had picked up that item early .  even before reading day  his conversation was based on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate home would be in novia .   george  oppressed by thoughts of the other   s future greatness and his own small time contrast  was driven to beffigerent defense at once .      my father isn   t worried either .  he just wants to hear me read because he knows i   ll be good .  i suppose your father would just as soon not hear you because he knows you   ll be all wrong .         i wifi not be all wrong .  reading is nothing .  on novia  i   ll hire people to read to me .         because you won   t be able to read yourself  on account of you   re dumb .         then how come i   ll be on novia .      and george  driven  made the great denial .     who says you   ll be on novia .  bet you don   t go anywhere .      stubby trevelyan reddened .     i won   t be a pipe fitterlike yonrold man .         take that back  you dumbhead .         you take that back .      they stood nose to nose  not wanting to fight but relieved at having something familiar to do in this strange place .  furthermore  now that george had curled his hands into fists and lifted them before his face  the problem of what to do with his hands was  at least temporarily  solved .  other children gathered round excitedly .   but then it all ended when a woman   s voice sounded loudly over the public address system .  there was instant silence everywhere .  george dropped his fists and forgot trevelyan .      children     said the voice     we are going to call out your names .  as each child is called  he or she is to go to one of the men waiting along the  side walls .  do you see them .  they are wearing red unifonns so they will be easy to find .  the girls will go to the right .  the boys will go to the left .  now look about and see which man in red is nearest to you      george found his man at a glance and waited for his name to be called off .  he had not been introduced before this to the sophistications of the alphabet  and the length of time it took to reach his own name grew disturbing .   the crowd of children thinned  little rivulets made their way to each of the red clad guides .   when the name    george platen    was finally called  his sense of relief was exceeded only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact that stubby trevelyan still stood in his place  uncalled .   george shouted back over his shoulder as he left     yay  stubby  maybe they don   t want you .      that moment of gaiety quickly left .  he was herded into a line and directed down corridors in the company of strange children .  they all looked at one another  large eyed and concerned  but beyond a snuffling     quitcher pushing    and    hey  watch out    there was no conversation .   they were handed little slips of paper which they were told must remain with them .  george stared at his curiously .  little black marks of different shapes .  he knew it to be printing but how could anyone make words out of it .  he couldn   t imagine .   he was told to strip  he and four other boys who were all that now remained together .  all the new clothes came shucking off and four eightyear olds stood naked and small  shivering more out of embarrassment than cold .  medical technicians came past  probing them  testing them with odd instruments  pricking them for blood .  each took the little cards and made additional marks on them with little black rods that produced the marks  all neatly lined up  with great speed .  george stared at the new marks  but they were no more comprehensible than the old .  the children were ordered back into their clothes .   they sat on separate little chairs then and waited again .  names were called again and    george platen    came third .   he moved into a large room  filled with frightening instruments with knobs and glassy panels in front .  there was a desk in the very center  and behind it a man sat  his eyes on the papers piled before him .   he said     george platen .         yes  sir     said george in a shaky whisper .  all this waiting and all this going here and there was making him nervous .  he wished it were over .   the man behind the desk said     i am dr .  lloyed  george .  how are you .      the doctor didn   t look up as he spoke .  it was as though he had said those words over and over again and didn   t have to look up any more .      i   m all right .         are you afraid  george .         n no  sir     said george  sounding afraid even in his own ears .      that   s good     said the doctor     because there   s nothing to be afraid of  you know .  let   s see  george .  it says here on your card that your father is named peter and that he   s a registered pipe fitter and your mother is named amy and is a registered home technician .  is that right .         y yes  sir .         and your birthday is february     and you had an ear infection about a year ago .  right .            yes  sir .         do you know how i know all these things .         it   s on the card  ithink  sir .         that   s right .     the doctor looked up at george for the first time and smiled .  he showed even teeth and looked much younger than george   s father .  some of george   s nervousness vanished .   the doctor passed the card to george .     do you know what all those things there mean  george .      although george knew he did not he was startled by the sudden request into looking at the card as though he might understand now through some sudden stroke of fate .  but they were just marks as before and he passed the card back .     no  sir .         why not .      george felt a sudden pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this doctor .  didn   t he know why not .   george said     i can   t read  sir .         would you like to read .            yes  sir .            why  george .      george stared  appalled .  no one had ever asked him that .  he had no answer .  he said falteringly     i don   t know  sir .         printed information will direct you all through your life .  there is so much you   ll have to know even after education day .  cards like this one will tell you .  books will tell you .  television screens will tell you .  printing will tell you such useful things and such interesting things that not being able to read would be as bad as not being able to see .  do you understand .         yes  sir .         are you afraid  george .      no sir .         good .  now i ll tell you exactly what we ll do first .  i m gomg to put  these wires on your forehead just over the corners of your eyes .  they   ll stick there but they won   t hurt at all .  then  i   ll   on something that wifi make a buzz .  it will sound funny and it may tickle you  but it won   t hurt .  now if it does hurt  you tell me  and i   ll turn it off right away  but it won   t hurt .  all right .      george nodded and swallowed .      are you ready .      george nodded .  he closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself .  his parents had explained this to him .  they  too  had said it wouldn   t hurt  but then there were always the older children .  there were the ten  and twelveyear olds who howled after the eight year olds waiting for reading day     watch out for the needle .     there were the others who took you off in confidence and said     they got to cut your head open .  they use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it     and so on into horrifying details .   george had never believed them but he had had nightmares  and now closed his eyes and felt pure terror .   he didn   t feel the wires at his temple .  the buzz was a distant thing  and there was the sound of his own blood in his ears  ringing hollowly as though it and he were in a large cave .  slowly he chanced opening his eyes .   the doctor had his back to him .  from one of the instruments a strip of paper unwound and was covered with a thin  wavy purple line .  the doctor tore off pieces and put them into a slot in another machine .  he did it over and over again .  each time a little piece of film came out  which the doctor looked at .  finally  he turned toward george with a queer frown between his eyes .   the buzzing stopped .   george said breathlessly     is it over .      the doctor said     yes     but he was still frowning .      can i read now .     asked george .  he felt no different .   the doctor said     what .     then smiled very suddenly and briefly .  he said     it works fine  geoge .  you   ll be reading in fifteen minutes .  now we   re going to use another machine this time and it wifi take longer .  i   m going to cover your whole head  and when i turn it on you won   t be able to see or hear anything for a while  but it won   t hurt .  just to make sure i   m going to give you a little switch to hold in your hand .  if anything hurts  you press the little button and everything shuts off .  all right .      in later years  george was told that the little switch was strictly a dummy  that it was introduced solely for confidence .  he never did know for sure  however  since he never pushed the button .   a large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed over his head and left there .  three or four little knobs seemed to grab at him and bite into his skull  but there was only a little pressure that faded .  no pain .   the doctor   s voice sounded dimly .     everything all right  george .      and then  with no real warning  a layer of thick felt closed down all about him .  he was disembodied  there was no sensation  no universe  only himself and a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him something telling him telling him  he strained to hear and understand but there was all that thick felt between .   then the helmet was taken off his head  and the light was so bright that it hurt his eyes while the doctor   s voice drummed at his ears .   the doctor said     here   s your card  george .  what does it say .      george looked at his card again and gave out a strangled shout .  the marks weren   t just marks at all .  they made up words .  they were words just as clearly as though something were whispering them in his ears .  he could hear them being whispered as he looked at them .      what does it say  george .         it says it says    platen  george .  born    february      of peter and amy platen in .   .   .        he broke off .      you can read  george     said the doctor .     it   s all over .         for good .  i won   t forget how .         of course not .     the doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely .     you will be taken home now .      it was days before george got over this new and great talent of his .  he read for his father with such facility that platen  senior  wept and called relatives to tell the good news .   george walked about town  reading every scrap of printing he could find and wondering how it was that none of it had ever made sense to him before .   he tried to remember how it was not to be able to read and he couldn   t .  as far as his feeling about it was concerned  he had always been able to read .  always .   at eighteen  george was rather dark  of medium height  but thin enough to look taller .  trevelyan  who was scarcely an inch shorter  had a stockiness of build that made    stubby    more than ever appropriate  but in this last year he had grown self conscious .  the nickname could no longer be used without reprisal .  and since trevelyan disapproved of his proper first name even more strongly  he was called trevelyan or any decent variant of that .  as though to prove his manhood further  he had most persistently grown a pair of sideburns and a bristly mustache .   he was sweating and nervous now  and george  who had himself grown out of    jaw jee    and into the curt monosyllabic gutterality of    george     was rather amused by that .   they were in the same large hall they had been in ten years before  and not since  .  it was as if a vague dream of the past had come to sudden reality .  in the first few minutes george had been distinctly surprised at finding everything seem smaller and more cramped than his memory told him  then he made allowance for his own growth .   the crowd was smaller than it had been in childhood .  it was exclusively male this time .  the girls had another day assigned them .   trevelyan leaned over to say     beats me the way they make you wait .         red tape     said george .     you can   t avoid it .      trevelyan said     what makes you so damned tolerant about it .         i   ve got nothing to worry about .         oh  brother  you make me sick .  i hope you end up registered manure spreader just so i can see your face when you do .     his somber eyes swept the crowd anxiously .   george looked about  too .  it wasn   t quite the system they used on the  children .  matters went slower  and instructions had been given out at the start in print  an advantage over the pre readers  .  the names platen and trevelyan were well down the alphabet still  but this time the two knew it .   young men came out of the education rooms  frowning and uncomfortable  picked up their clothes and belongings  then went off to analysis to learn the results .   each  as he came out  would be surrounded by a clot of the thinning crowd .     how was it .        how   d it feel .        whacha think ya made .        ya feel any different .      answers were vague and noncommittal .   george forced himself to remain out of those clots .  you only raised your own blood pressure .  everyone said you stood the best chance if you remained calm .  even so  you could feel the palms of your hands grow cold .  funny that new tensions came with the years .   for instance  high specialty professionals heading out for an outworld were accompanied by a wife  or husband  .  it was important to keep the sex ratio in good balance on all worlds .  and if you were going out to a grade a world  what girl would refuse you .  george had no specific girl in mind yet  he wanted none .  not now .  once he made programmer  once he could add to his name  registered computer programmer  he could take his pick  like a sultan in a harem .  the thought excited him and he tried to put it away .  must stay calm .   trevelyan muttered     what   s it all about anyway .  first they say it works best if you   re relaxed and at ease .  then they put you through this and make it impossible for you to be relaxed and at ease .         maybe that   s the idea .  they   re separating the boys from the men to begin with .  take it easy  trev .         shut up .      george   s turn came .  his name was not called .  it appeared in glowing letters on the notice board .   he waved at trevelyan .     take it easy  trev .  don   t let it get you .      he was happy as he entered the testing chamber .  actually happy .   the man behind the desk said     george platen .      for a fleeting instant there was a razor sharp picture in george   s mind of another man  ten years earlier  who had asked the same question  and it was almost as though this were the same man and he  george  had turned eight again as he stepped across the threshold .   but the man looked up and  of course  the face matched that of the sudden memory not at all .  the nose was bulbous  the hair thin and stringy  and the chin wattled as though its owner had once been grossly overweight and had reduced .   the man behind the desk looked annoyed .     well .      george came to earth .     i   m george platen  sir .         say so  then .  i   m dr .  zachary antonelli  and we   re going to be intimately acquainted in a moment .      he stared at small strips of film  holding them up to the light owlishly .  george winced inwardly .  very hazily  he remembered that other doctor  he had forgotten the name  staring at such film .  could these be the same .  the other doctor had frowned and this one was looking at him now as though he were angry .   his happiness was already just about gone .   dr .  antonelli spread the pages of a thickish file out before him now and put the films carefully to one side .     it says here you want to be a computer programmer .         yes  doctor .            still do .               yes  sir .            it   s a responsible and exacting position .  do you feel up to it .            yes  sir .         most pre educates don   t put down any specific profession .  i believe they are afraid of queering it .            i think that   s tight  sir .         aren   t you afraid of that .         i might as well be honest  sir .      dr .  antonelli nodded  but without any noticeable lightening of his expression .     why do you want to be a programmer .         it   s a responsible and exacting position as you said  sir .  it   s an important job and an exciting one .  i like it and .  think i can do it .      dr .  antonelli put the papers away  and looked at george sourly .  he said     how do you know you like it .  because you think you   ll be snapped up by some grade a planet .      george thought uneasily  he   s trying to rattle you .  stay calm and stay frank .   he said     i think a programmer has a good chance  sir  but even if i were left on earth  i know i   d like it .      that was true enough .  i   m not lying  thought george .       all right  how do you know .      he asked it as though he knew there was no decent answer and george almost smiled .  he had one .   he said     i   ve been reading about programming  sir .         you   ve been what .     now the doctor looked genuinely astonished and george took pleasure in that .      reading about it  sir .  i bought a book on the subject and i   ve been studying it .         a book for registered programmers .            yes  sir .         but you couldn   t understand it .         not at first .  i got other books on mathematics and electronics .  i made out all i could .  i still don   t know much  but i know enough to know i like it and to know i can make it .      even his parents never found that secret cache of books or knew why he spent so much time in his own room or exactly what happened to the sleep he missed .    the doctor pulled at the loose skin under his chin .     what was your idea in doing that  son .         i wanted to make sure i would be interested  sir .         surely you know that being interested means nothing .  you could be devoured by a subject and if the physical makeup of your brain makes it more efficient for you to be something else  something else you will be .  you know that  don   t you .         i   ve been told that     said george cautiously .      well  believe it .  it   s true .      george said nothing .   dr .  antonelli said     or do you believe that studying some subject will bend the brain cells in that direction  like that other theory that a pregnant woman need only listen to great music persistently to make a composer of her child .  do you believe that .      george flushed .  that had certainly been in his mind .  by forcing his intellect constantly in the desired direction  he had felt sure that he would be getting a head start .  most of his confidence had rested on exactly that point .      i never     he began  and found no way of finishing .      well  it isn   t true .  good lord  youngster  your brain pattern is fixed at birth .  it can be altered by a blow hard enough to damage the cells or by a burst blood vessel or by a tumor or by a major infection each time  of course  for the worse .  but it certainly can   t be affected by your thinking special thoughts .     he stared at george thoughtfully  then said     who told you to do this .      george  now thoroughly disturbed  swallowed and said     no one  doctor .  my own idea .         who knew you were doing it after you started .         no one .  doctor  i meant to do no wrong .         who said anything about wrong .  useless is what i would say .  why did you keep it to yourself .         i i thought they   d laugh at me .      he thought abruptly of a recent exchange with trevelyan .  george had very cautiously broached the thought  as of something merely circulating distantly in the very outermost reaches of his mind  concerning the possibility of learning something by ladling it into the mind by hand  so to speak  in bits and pieces .  trevelyan had hooted     george  you   ll be tanning your own shoes next and weaving your own shirts .     he had been thankful for his policy of secrecy .    dr .  antonelli shoved the bits of film he had first looked at from position to position in morose thought .  then he said     let   s get you analyzed .  this is getting me nowhere .      the wires went to george   s temples .  there was the buzzing .  again there came a sharp memory of ten years ago .   george   s hands were clammy  his heart pounded .  he should never have told the doctor about his secret reading .   it was his damned vanity  he told himself .  he had wanted to show how enterprising he was  how full of initiative .  instead  he had showed himself superstitious and ignorant and aroused the hostility of the doctor .   he could tell the doctor hated him for a wise guy on the make .    and now he had brought himself to such a state of nervousness  he was sure the analyzer would show nothing that made sense .   he wasn   t aware of the moment when the wires were removed from his temples .  the sight of the doctor  staring at him thoughtfully  blinked into his consciousness and that was that  the wires were gone .  george dragged himself together with a tearing effort .  he had quite given up his ambition to be a programmer .  in the space of ten minutes  it had all gone .   he said dismally     i suppose no .         no what .         no programmer .      the doctor rubbed his nose and said     you get your clothes and whatever belongs to you and go to room    c .  your files will be waiting for you there .  so will my report .      george said in complete surprise     have i been educated already .  i thought this was just to      dr .  antonelli stared down at his desk .     it will all be explained to you .  you do as i say .      george felt something like panic .  what was it they couldn   t tell him .  he wasn   t fit for anything but registered laborer .  they were going to prepare him for that  adjust him to it .   he was suddenly certain of it and he had to keep from screaming by main force .   he stumbled back to his place of waiting .  trevelyan was not there  a fact for which he would have been thankful if he had had enough self possession to be meaningfully aware of his surroundings .  hardly anyone was left  in fact  and the few who were looked as though they might ask him questions were it not that they were too worn out by their tail of the alphabet waiting to buck the fierce  hot look of anger and hate he cast at them .   what right had they to be technicians and he  himself  a laborer .  laborer .  he was certain .   he was led by a red uniformed guide along the busy corridors lined with separate rooms each containing its groups  here two  there five  the motor mechanics the construction engineers  the agronomists  there were hundreds of specialized professions and most of them would be represented in this small town by one or two anyway .   he hated them all just then  the statisticians  the accountants  the lesser  breeds and the higher .  he hated them because they owned their smug knowledge now  knew their fate  while he himself  empty still  had to face some kind of further red tape .   he reached    c  was ushered in and left in an empty room .  for one moment  his spirits bounded .  surely  if this were the labor classification room  there would be dozens of youngsters present .   a door sucked into its recess on the other side of a waist high partition and an elderly  white haired man stepped out .  he smiled and showed even teeth that were obviously false  but his face was still ruddy and unlined and his voice had vigor .   he said     good evening  george .  our own sector has only one of you this time  i see .         only one .     said george blanidy .      thousands over the earth  of course .  thousands .  you   re not alone .      george felt exasperated .  he said     i don   t understand  sir .  what   s my classification .  what   s happening .         easy  son .  you   re all right .  it could happen to anyone .     he held out his hand and george took it mechanically .  it was warm and it pressed george   s hand firmly .     sit down  son .  i   m sam ellenford .      george nodded impatiently .     i want to know what   s going on  sir .         of course .  to begin with  you can   t be a computer programmer  george .  you   ve guessed that  i think .         yes  i have     said george bitterly .     what will i be  then .         that   s the hard part to explain  george .     he paused  then said with careful distinctness     nothing .         what .         nothing .         but what does that mean .  why can   t you assign me a profession .         we have no choice in the matter  george .  it   s the structure of your mind that decides that .      george went a sallow yellow .  his eyes bulged .     there   s something wrong with my mind .         there   s something about it .  as far as professional classification is concerned  i suppose you can call it wrong .         but why .      ellenford shrugged .     i   m sure you know how earth runs its educational program  george .  practically any human being can absorb practically any body of knowledge  but each individual brain pattern is better suited to receiving some types of knowledge than others .  we try to match mind to knowledge as well as we can within the limits of the quota requirements for each profession .      george nodded .     yes  iknow .         every once in awhile  george  we come up against a young man whose mind is not suited to receiving a superimposed knowledge of any sort .         you mean i can   t be educated .         that is what imean .         but that   s crazy .  i   m intelligent .  i can understand     he looked helplessly about as though trying to find some way of proving that he had a functioning brain .      don   t misunderstand me  please     said ellenford gravely .     you   re intelligent .  there   s no question about that .  you   re even above average in intelligence .  unfortunately that has nothing to do with whether the mind ought to be allowed to accept superimposed knowledge or not .  in fact  it is almost always the intelligent person who comes here .         you mean i can   t even be a registered laborer .     babbled george .  suddenly even that was better than the blank that faced him .     what   s there to know to be a laborer .         don   t underestimate the laborer  young man .  there are dozens of subclassifications and each variety has its own corpus of fairly detailed knowledge .  do you think there   s no skill in knowing the proper maimer of lifting a weight .  besides  for the laborer  we must select not only minds suited to it  but bodies as well .  you   re not the type  george  to last long as a laborer .      george was conscious of his slight build .  he said     but i   ve never heard of anyone without a profession .         there aren   t many     conceded ellenford .     and we protect them .         protect them .     george felt confusion and fright grow higher in side him .      you   re a ward of the planet  george .  from the time you walked through that door  we   ve been in charge of you .     and he smiled .   it was a fond smile .  to george it seemed the smile of ownership  the smile of a grown man for a helpless child .   he said     you mean  i   m going to be in prison .         of course not .  you will simply be with others of your kind .      your kind .  the words made a kind of thunder in george   s ear .   ellenford said     you need special treatment .  we   ll take care of you .      to george   s own horror  he burst into tears .  ellenford walked to the other end of the room and faced away as though in thought .   george fought to reduce the agonized weeping to sobs and then to strangle those .  he thought of his father and mother  of his friends  of trevelyan  of his own shame  he said rebelliously     i learned to read .         everyone with a whole mind can do that .  we   ve never found exceptions .  it is at this stage that we discover exceptions .  and when you learned to read  george  we were concerned about your mind pattern .  certain peculiarities were reported even then by the doctor in charge .         can   t you try educating me .  you haven   t even tried .  i   m willing to take the risk .         the law forbids us to do that  george .  but look  it will not be bad .  we will explain matters to your family so they will not be hurt .  at the place to  which you   ll be taken  you   ll be allowed privileges .  we   ll get you books and you can learn what you will .         dab knowledge in by hand     said george bitterly .     shred by shred .  then  when i die i   ll know enough to be a registered junior office boy  paper clip division .         yet i understand you   ve already been studying books .      george froze .  he was struck devastatingly by sudden understanding .        that   s it .   .         what   s it .            that fellow antonelli .  he   s knifing me .         no  george .  you   re quite wrong .         don   t tell me that .     george was in an ecstasy of fury .     that lousy bastard is selling me out because he thought i was a little too wise for him .  i read books and tried to get a head start toward programming .  well  what do you want to square things .  money .  you won   t get it .  i   m getting out of here and when i finish broadcasting this      he was screaming .   ellenford shook his head and touched a contact .   two men entered on catfeet and got on either side of george .  they pinned his arms to his sides .  one of them used an air spray hypodennic in the hollow of his right elbow and the hypnotic entered his vein and had an almost immediate effect .   his screams cut off and his head fell forward .  his knees buckled and only the men on either side kept him erect as he slept .   they took care of george as they said they would  they were good to him and unfailingly kind about the way  george thought  he himself would be to a sick kitten he had taken pity on .   they told him that he should sit up and take some interest in life  and then told him that most people who came there had the same attitude of despair at the beginning and that he would snap out of it .   he didn   t even hear them .   dr .  ellenford himself visited him to tell him that his parents had been informed that he was away on special assignment .   george muttered     do they know      ellenford assured him at once     we gave no details .      at first george had refused to eat .  they fed him intravenously .  they hid sharp objects and kept him under guard .  hali omani came to be his roommate and his stolidity had a calming effect .   one day  out of sheer desperate boredom  george asked for a book .  omani  who himself read books constantly  looked up  smiling broadly .  george almost withdrew the request then  rather than give any of them satisfaction  then thought  what do i care .   he didn   t specify the book and omani brought one on chemistry .  it was in big print  with small words and many illustrations .  it was for teen agers .  he threw the book violently against the wall .   that   s what he would be always .  a teen ager all his life .  a pre educate forever and special books would have to be written for him .  he lay smoldering in bed  staring at the ceiling  and after an hour had passed  he got up sulkily  picked up the book  and began reading .   it took him a week to finish it and then he asked foi another .      do you want to take the first one back .     asked omani .   george frowned .  there were things in the book he had not understood  yet he was not so lost to shame as to say so .   but omani said     come to think of it  you   d better keep it .  books are meant to be read and reread .      it was that same day that he finally yielded to omani   s invitation that he tour the place .  he dogged at the nigerian   s feet and took in his surroundings with quick hostile glances .   the place was no prison certainly .  there were no walls  no locked doors  no guards .  but it was a prison in that the inmates had no place to go outside .   it was somehow good to see others like himself by the dozen .  it was so easy to believe himself to be the only one in the world so maimed .   he mumbled     how many people here anyway .         two hundred and five  george  and this isn   t the only place of the sort in the world .  there are thousands .      men looked up as he passed  wherever he went  in the gymnasium  along the tennis courts  through the library  he had never in his life imagined books could exist in such numbers  they were stacked  actually stacked  along long shelves  .  they stared at him curiously and he returned the looks savagely .  at least they were no better than he  no call for them to look at him as though he were some sort of curiosity .   most of them were in their twenties .  george said suddenly     what happens to the older ones .      omani said     this place specializes in the younger ones .     then  as though he suddenly recognized an implication in george   s question that he had missed earlier  he shook his head gravely and said     they   re not put out of the way  if that   s what you mean .  there are other houses for older ones .            who cares .     mumbled george  who felt he was sounding too interested and in danger of slipping into surrender .      you might .  as you grow older  you will find yourself in a house with occupants of both sexes .      that surprised george somehow .     women  too .         of course .  do you suppose women are immune to this sort of thing .      george thought of that with more interest and excitement than he had felt for anything since before that day when  he forced his thought away from that .   ornani stopped at the doorway of a room that contained a small closedcircuit television and a desk computer .  five or six men sat about the  television orn  said     this is a classroom .      george said     what   s that .         the young men in there are being educated .  not     he added  quickly     in the usual way .         you mean they   re cramming it in bit by bit .         that   s right .  this is the way everyone did it in ancient times .      this was what they kept telling him since he had come to the house but what of it .  suppose there had been a day when mankind had not known the diatherm oven .  did that mean he should be satisfied to eat meat raw in a world where others ate it cooked .   he said     why do they want to go through that bit by bit stuff .         to pass the time  george  and because they   re curious .         what good does it do them .         it makes them happier .      george carried that thought to bed with him .   the next day he said to omani ungraciously     can you get me into a classroom where i can find out something about programming .      omarn replied heartily     sure .      it was slow and he resented it .  why should someone have to explain something and explain it again .  why should he have to read and reread a passage  then stare at a mathematical relationship and not understand it at once .  that wasn   t how other people had to be .   over and over again  he gave up .  once he refused to attend classes for a week .   but always he returned .  the official in charge  who assigned reading  conducted the television demonstrations  and even explained difficult passages and concepts  never commented on the matter .   george was finally given a regular task in the gardens and took his turn in the various kitchen and cleaning details .  this was represented to him as being an advance  but he wasn   t fooled .  the place might have been far more mechanized than it was  but they deliberately made work for the young men in order to give them the illusion of worthwhile occupation  of usefulness .  george wasn   t fooled .   they were even paid small sums of money out of which they could buy certain specified luxuries or which they could put aside for a problematical use in a problematical old age .  george kept his money in an open jar  which he kept on a closet shelf .  he had no idea how much he had accumulated .  nor did he care .   he made no real friends though he reached the stage where a civil good day was in order .  he even stopped brooding  or almost stopped  on the miscarriage of justice that had placed him there .  he would go weeks without dreaming of antonelli  of his gross nose and wattled neck  of the leer with which he would push george into a boiling quicksand and hold him under  till he woke screaming with omani bending over him in concern .   omani said to him on a snowy day in february     it   s amazing how you   re adjusting .      but that was february  the thirteenth to be exact  his nineteenth birthday .  march came  then april  and with the approach of may he realized he hadn   t adjusted at all .   the previous may had passed unregarded while george was still in his bed  drooping and ambitionless .  this may was different .   all over earth  george knew  olympics would be taking place and young men would be competing  matching their skills against one another in the fight for a place on a new world .  there would be the holiday atmosphere  the excitement  the news reports  the self contained recruiting agents from the worlds beyond space  the glory of victory or the consolations of defeat .   how much of fiction dealt with these motifs  how much of his own boyhood excitement lay in following the events of olympics from year to year  how many of his own plans  george platen could not conceal the longing in his voice .  it was too much to suppress .  he said     tomorrow   s the first of may .  olympics .      and that led to his first quarrel with omani and to omani   s bitter enunciation of the exact name of the institution in which george found himself .   omani gazed fixedly at george and said distinctly     a house for the feeble minded .      george platen flushed .  feeble minded .   he rejected it desperately .  he said in a monotone     i   m leaving .      he said it on impulse .  his conscious mind learned it first from the statement as he uttered it .   omani  who had returned to his book  looked up .     what .      george knew what he was saying now .  he said it fiercely     i   m leaving .         that   s ridiculous .  sit down  george  calm yourself .         oh  no .  i   m here on a frame up  i tell you .  this doctor  antonelli  took a dislike to me .  it   s the sense of power these petty bureaucrats have .  cross them and they wipe out your life with a stylus mark on some card file .         are you back to that .         and staying there till it   s all straightened out .  i   m going to get to antonelli somehow  break him  force the truth out of him .     george was breathing heavily and he felt feverish .  olympics month was here and he couldn   t let it pass .  if he did  it would be the final surrender and he would be lost for all time .   omani threw his legs over the side of his bed and stood up .  he was nearly six feet tall and the expression on his face gave him the look of a concerned saint bernard .  he put his arm about george   s shoulder     if i hurt your feelings      george shrugged him off .     you just said what you thought was the truth  and i   m going to prove it isn   t the truth  that   s all .  why not .  the door   s open .  there aren   t any locks .  no one ever said i couldn   t leave .  i   ll just walk out .         all right  but where will you go .         to the nearest air terminal  then to the nearest olympics center .  i   ve got money .     he seized the open jar that held the wages he had put away .  some of the coins jangled to the floor .      that will last you a week maybe .  then what .         by then i   ll have things settled .         by then you   ll come crawling back here     said omani earnestly     with all the progress you   ve made to do over again .  you   re mad  george .         feeble minded is the word you used before .         well  i   m sorry i did .  stay here  will you .         are you going to try to stop me .      omani compressed his full lips .     no  i guess i won   t .  this is your business .  if the only way you can learn is to buck the world and come back with blood on your face  go ahead .  well  go ahead .      george was in the doorway now  looking back over his shoulder .     i   m going      he came back to pick up his pocket grooming set slowly     i hope you don   t object to my taking a few personal belongings .      omani shrugged .  he was in bed again reading  indifferent .   george lingered at the door again  but omani didn   t look up .  george gritted his teeth  turned and walked rapidly down the empty corridor and out into the night shrouded grounds .   he had expected to be stopped before leaving the grounds .  he wasn   t .  he had stopped at an all night diner to ask directions to an air terminal and expected the proprietor to call the police .  that didn   t happen .  he summoned a skimmer to take him to the airport and the driver asked no questions .   yet he felt no lift at that .  he arrived at the airport sick at heart .  he had not realized how the outer world would be .  he was surrounded by professionals .  the diner   s proprietor had had his name inscribed on the plastic shell over the cash register .  so and so  registered cook .  the man in the skimmer had his license up  registered chauffeur .  george felt the bareness of his name and experienced a kind of nakedness because of it  worse  he felt skinned .  but no one challenged him .  no one studied him suspiciously and demanded proof of professional rating .   george thought bitterly  who would imagine any human being without one .   he bought a ticket to san francisco on the   a . m .  plane .  no other plane for a sizable olympics center was leaving before morning and he wanted to wait as little as possible .  as it was  he sat huddled in the waiting room  watching for the police .  they did not come .   he was in san francisco before noon and the noise of the city struck him  like a blow .  this was the largest city he had ever seen and he had been used to silence and calm for a year and a half now .   worse  it was olympics month .  he almost forgot his own predicament in his sudden awareness that some of the noise  excitement  confusion was due to that .   the olympics boards were up at the airport for the benefit of the incoming travelers  and crowds jostled around each one .  each major profession had its own board .  each listed directions to the olympics hall where the contest for that day for that profession would be given  the individuals competing and their city of birth  the outworld  if any  sponsoring it .   it was a completely stylized thing .  george had read descriptions often enough in the newspnnts and films  watched matches on television  and even witnessed a small olympics in the registered butcher classification at the county seat .  even that  which had no conceivable galactic implication  there was no outworlder in attendance  of course  aroused excitement enough .   partly  the excitement was caused simply by the fact of competition  partly by the spur of local pride  oh  when there was a home town boy to cheer for  though he might be a complete stranger   and  of course  partly by betting .  there was no way of stopping the last .   george found it difficult to approach the board .  he found himself looking at the scurrying  avid onlookers in a new way .   there must have been a time when they themselves were olympic material .  what had they done .  nothing .   if they had been winners  they would be far out in the galaxy somewhere  not stuck here on earth .  whatever they were  their professions must have made them earth bait from the beginning  or else they had made themselves earth bait by inefficiency at whatever high specialized professions they had had .   now these failures stood about and speculated on the chances of newer and younger men .  vultures .   how he wished they were speculating on him .   he moved down the line of boards blanidy  clinging to the outskirts of the groups about them .  he had eaten breakfast on the strato and he wasn   t hungry .  he was afraid  though .  he was in abig city during the confusion of the beginning of olympics competition .  that was protection  sure .  the city was full of strangers .  no one would question george .  no one would care about george .   no one would care .  not even the house  thought george bitterly .  they cared for him like a sick kitten  but if a sick kitten up and wanders off  well  too bad  what can you do .   and now that he was in san francisco  what did he do .  his thoughts struck blankly against a wall .  see someone .  whom .  how .  where would he even stay .  the money he had left seemed pitiful .   the first shamefaced thought of going back came to him .  he could go to  the police  he shook his head violently as though arguing with a material adversary .   a word caught his eye on one of the boards  gleaming there  metallurgist .  in smaller letters  nonferrous .  at the bottom of a long list of names  in flowing script  sponsored by novia .   it induced painful memories  himself arguing with trevelyan  so certain that he himself would be a programmer  so certain that a programmer was superior to a metallurgist  so certain that he was following the right course  so certain that he was clever  so clever that he had to boast to that small minded  vindictive antonelli .   he had been so sure of himself that moment when he had been called and had left the nervous trevelyan standing there  so cocksure .   george cried out in a short  incoherent high pitched gasp .  someone turned to look at him  then hurried on .  people brushed past impatiently pushing him this way and that .  he remained staring at the board  open mouthed .   it was as though the board had answered his thought .  he was thinking    trevelyan    so hard that it had seemed for a moment that of course the board would say    trevelyan    back at him .   but that was trevelyan  up there .  and armand trevelyan  stubby   s hated first name  up in lights for everyone to see  and the right hometown .  what   s more  trev had wanted novia  aimed for novia  insisted on novia  and this competition was sponsored by novia .   this had to be trev  good old trev .  almost without thinking  he noted the directions for getting to the place of competition and took his place in line for a skimmer .   then he thought somberly  trev made it .  he wanted to be a metallurgist  and he made it .   george felt colder  more alone than ever .   there was a line waiting to enter the hall .  apparently  metallurgy olympics was to be an exciting and closely fought one .  at least  the illuminated sky sign above the hail said so  and the jostling crowd seemed to think so .   it would have been a rainy day  george thought  from the color of the sky  but san francisco had drawn the shield across its breadth from bay to ocean .  it was an expense to do so  of course  but all expenses were warranted where the comfort of outworlders was concerned .  they would be in town for the olympics .  they were heavy spenders .  and for each recruit taken  there would be a fee both to earth and to the local government from the planet sponsoring the olympics .  it paid to keep outworiders in mind of a particular city as a pleasant place in which to spend olympics time .  san francisco knew what it was doing .   george  lost in thought  was suddenly aware of a gentle pressure on his shoulder blade and a voice saying     are you in line here  young man .      the line had moved up without george   s having noticed the widening gap .  he stepped forward hastily and muttered     sony  sir .      there was the touch of two fingers on the elbow of his jacket and he looked about furtively .   the man behind him nodded cheerfully .  he had iron gray hair  and under his jacket he wore an old fashioned sweater that buttoned down in front .  he said     i didn   t mean to sound sarcastic .         no offense .         all right  then .     he sounded cozily talkative .     i wasn   t sure you might not simply be standing there  entangled with the line  so to speak  only by accident .  i thought you might be a         a what .     said george sharply .      why  a contestant  of course .  you look young .      george turned away .  he felt neither cozy nor talkative  and bitterly impatient with busybodies .   a thought struck him .  had an alarm been sent out for him .  was his description known  or his picture .  was gray hair behind him trying to get a good look at his face .   he hadn   t seen any news reports .  he craned his neck to see the moving strip of news headlines parading across one section of the city shield  somewhat lackluster against the gray of the cloudy afternoon sky .  it was no use .  he gave up at once .  the headlines would never concern themselves with him .  this was olympics time and the only news worth headlining was the comparative scores of the winners and the trophies won by continents  nations  and cities .   it would go on like that for weeks  with scores calculated on a per capita basis and every city finding some way of calculating itself into a position of honor .  his own town had once placed third in an olympics covering wiring technician  third in the whole state .  there was still a plaque saying so in town hall .   george hunched his head between his shoulders and shoved his hands in his pocket and decided that made him more noticeable .  he relaxed and tried  to look unconcerned  and felt no safer .  he was in the lobby now  and no authoritative hand had yet been laid on his shoulder .  he filed into the hall itself and moved as far forward as he could .   it was with an unpleasant shock that he noticed gray hair next to him .  he looked away quickly and tried reasoning with himself .  the man had been nght behind him in line after all .   gray hair  beyond a brief and tentative smile  paid no attention to him and  besides  the olympics was about to start .  george rose in his seat to see if he could make out the position assigned to trevelyan and at the moment that was all his concern .   the hall was moderate in size and shaped in the classical long oval  with the spectators in the two balconies running completely about the rim and the  contestants in the linear trough down the center .  the machines were set up  the progress boards above each bench were dark  except for the name and contest number of each man .  the contestants themselves were on the scene  reading  talking together  one was checking his fingernails minutely .   it was  of course  considered bad form for any contestant to pay any attention to the problem before him until the instant of the starting signal .    george studied the program sheet he found in the appropriate slot in the arm of his chair and found trevelyan   s name .  his number was twelve and  to george   s chagrin  that was at the wrong end of the hail .  he could make out the figure of contestant twelve  standing with his hands in his pockets  back to his machine  and staring at the audience as though he were counting the house .  george couldn   t make out the face .   still  that was trev .   george sank back in his seat .  he wondered if trev would do well .  he hoped  as a matter of conscious duty  that he would  and yet there was something within him that felt rebelliously resentful .  george  profession less  here  watching .  trevelyan  registered metallurgist  nonferrous  there  competing .   george wondered if trevelyan had competed in his first year .  sometimes men did  if they felt particularly confident or hurried .  it involved a certain risk .  however efficient the educative process  a preliminary year on earth     oiling the stiff knowledge     as the expression went  insured a higher score .   if trevelyan was repeating  maybe he wasn   t doing so well .  george felt ashamed that the thought pleased him just a bit .   he looked about .  the stands were almost full .  this would be a well attended olympics  which meant greater strain on the contestants or greater drive  perhaps  depending on the individual .   why olympics  he thought suddenly .  he had never known .  why was bread called bread .   once he had asked his father     why do they call it olympics  dad .      and his father had said     olympics means competition .      george had said     is when stubby and i fight an olympics  dad .      platen  senior  had said     no .  olympics is a special kind of competition and don   t ask silly questions .  you   ll know all you have to know when you get educated .      george  back in the present  sighed and crowded down into his seat .   all you have to know .   funny that the memory should be so clear now .     when you get educated .     no one ever said     if you get educated .      he always had asked silly questions  it seemed to him now .  it was as though his mind had some instinctive foreknowledge of its inability to be educated and had gone about asking questions in order to pick up scraps here and there as best it could .   and at the house they encouraged him to do so because they agreed with his mind   s instinct .  it was the only way .   he sat up suddenly .  what the devil was he doing .  falling for that lie .  was it because trev was there before him  an educee  competing in the olympics that he himself was surrendering .   he wasn   t feeble minded .  no .   and the shout of denial in his mnd was echoed b     the sudden clamor in the audience as everyone got to his feet .   the box seat in the very center of one long side of the oval was filling with an entourage wearing the colors of novia  and the word    novia    went up above them on the main board .   novia was a grade a world with a large population and a thoroughly developed civilization  perhaps the best in the galaxy .  it was the kind of world that every earthman wanted to live in someday  or  failing that  to see his children live in .   george remembered trevelyan   s insistence on novia as a goal and there he was competing for it .    the lights went out in that section of the ceiling above the audience and so did the wall lights .  the central trough  in which the contestants waited  became floodlit .   again george tried to make out trevelyan .  too far .   the clear  polished voice of the announced sounded .     distinguished novian sponsors .  ladies .  gentlemen .  the olympics competition for metallurgist  nonferrous  is about to begin .  the contestants are      carefully and conscientiously  he read off the list in the program .  names .  home towns .  educative years .  each name received its cheers  the san franciscans among them receiving the loudest .  when trevelyan   s name was reached  george surprised himself by shouting and waving madly .  the gray haired man next to him surprised him even more by cheering likewise .   george could not help but stare in astonishment and his neighbor leaned over to say  speaking loudly in order to be heard over the hubbub      no one here from my home town  i   ll root for yours .  someone you know .      george shrank back .     no .         i noticed you looking in that direction .  would you like to borrow my glasses .         no .  thank you .      why didn   t the old fool mind his own business .    the announcer went on with other formal details concerning the serial number of the competition  the method of timing and scoring and so on .  finally  he approached the meat of the matter and the audience grew silent as it listened .      each contestant will be supplied with a bar of nonferrous alloy of unspecified composition .  he will be required to sample and assay the bar  reporting all results correctly to four decimals in percent .  all will utilize for this purpose a beeman microspectrograph  model fx    each of which is  at the moment  not in working order .      there was an appreciative shout from the audience .      each contestant will be required to analyze the fault of his machine and correct it .  tools and spare parts are supplied .  the spare part necessary may  not be present  in which case it must be asked for  and time of delivery thereof will be deducted from final time .  are all contestants ready .      the board above contestant five flashed a frantic red signal .  contestant five ran off the floor and returned a moment later .  the audience laughed good naturedly .      are all contestants ready .      the boards remained blank .      any questions .      still blank .      you may begin .      there was  of course  no way anyone in the audience could tell how any contestant was progressing except for whatever notations went up on the notice board .  but then  that didn   t matter .  except for what professional metallurgists there might be in the audience  none would understand anything about the contest professionally in any case .  what was important was who won  who was second  who was third .  for those who had bets on the standings  illegal  but unpreventable  that was all important .  everything else might go hang .   george watched as eagerly as the rest  glancing from one contestant to the next  observing how this one had removed the cover from his mlcrospectrograph with deft strokes of a small instrument  how that one was peering into the face of the thing  how still a third was setting his alloy bar into its holder  and how a fourth adjusted a vernier with such small touches that he seemed momentarily frozen .   trevelyan was as absorbed as the rest .  george had no way of telling how he was doing .   the notice board over contestant seventeen flashed  focus plate out of adjustment .   the audience cheered wildly .   contestant seventeen might be right and he might  of course  be wrong .  if the latter  he would have to correct his diagnosis later and lose time .  or he might never correct his diagnosis and be unable to complete his analysis or  worse still  end with a completely wrong analysis .   never mind .  for the moment  the audience cheered .   other boards lit up .  george watched for board twelve .  that came on finally     sample holder off center .  new clamp depresser needed .      an attendant went running to him with a new part .  if trevelyan was wrong  it would mean useless delay .  nor would the time elapsed in waiting for the part be deducted .  george found himself holding his breath .   results were beginning to go up on board seventeen  in gleaming letters   aluminum     .       magnesium     .       copper     .      .  here and there  other boards began sprouting figures .   the audience was in bedlam .   george wondered how the contestants could work in such pandemo  nium  then wondered if that were not even a good thing .  a first class technician should work best under pressure .   seventeen rose from his place as his board went red rimmed to signify completion .  four was only two seconds behind him .  another  then another .   trevelyan was still working  the n  inor constituents of his alloy bar still unreported .  with nearly all contestants standing  trevelyan finally rose  also .  then  tailing off  five rose  and received an ironic cheer .   it wasn   t over .  official announcements were naturally delayed .  time elapsed was something  but accuracy was just as important .  and not all diagnoses were of equal difficulty .  a dozen factors had to be weighed .   finally  the announcer   s voice sounded     wmner in the time of four minutes and twelve seconds  diagnosis correct  analysis correct within an average of zero point seven parts per hundred thousand  contestant number seventeen  henry anton schmidt of      what followed was drowned in the screaming .  number eight was next and then four  whose good time was spoiled by a five part in ten thousand error in the niobium figure .  twelve was never mentioned .  he was an also ran .   george made his way through the crowd to the contestants    door and found a large clot of humanity ahead of him .  there would be weeping relatives  joy or sorrow  depending  to greet them  newsmen to interview the top scorers  or the home town boys  autograph hounds  publicity seekers and the just plain curious .  girls  too  who might hope to catch the eye of a top scorer  almost certainly headed for novia  or perhaps a low scorer who needed cnosolation and had the cash to afford it  .   george hung back .  he saw no one he knew .  with san francisco so far from home  it seemed pretty safe to assume that there would be no relatives to condole with trev on the spot .   contestants emerged  smiling wealdy  nodding at shouts of approval .  policemen kept the crowds far enough away to allow a lane for walking .  each high scorer drew a portion of the crowd off with him  like a magnet pushing through a mound of iron filings .   when trevelyan walked out  scarcely anyone was left .   george felt somehow that he had delayed coming out until just that had come to pass .   there was a cigarette in his dour mouth and he turned  eyes downcast  to walk off .   it was the first hint of home george had had in what was almost a year and a half and seemed almost a decade and a half .  he was almost amazed that trevelyan hadn   t aged  that he was the same trev he had last seen .   george sprang forward .     trev .      trevelyan spun about  astonished .  he stared at george and then his hand shot out .     george platen  what the devil      and almost as soon as the look of pleasure had crossed his face  it left .  his hand dropped before george had quite the chance of seizing it .      were you in there .     a curt jerk of trev    s head indicated the hail .         i was .            to see me .            yes .            didn   t do so well  did i .     he dropped his cigarette and stepped on it  staring off to the street  where the emerging crowd was slowly eddying and finding its way into skimmers  while new lines were forming for the next scheduled olympics .   trevelyan said heavily     so what .  it   s only the second time i missed .  novia can go shove after the deal i got today .  there are planets that would jump at me fast enough  but  listen  i haven   t seen you since education day .  where did you go .  your folks said you were on special assignment but gave no details and you never wrote .  you might have written .         i should have     said george uneasily .     anyway  i came to say i was sorry the way things went just now .         don   t be     said trevelyan .     i told you .  novia can go shove  at that i should have known .  they   ve been saying for weeks that the beeman machine would be used .  all the wise money was on beeman machines .  the damned education tapes they ran through me were for henslers and who uses henslers .  the worlds in the goman cluster if you want to call them worlds .  wasn   t that a nice deal they gave me .         can   t you complain to         don   t be a fool .  they   ll tell me my brain was built for henslers .  go argue .  everything went wrong .  i was the only one who had to send out for a piece of equipment .  notice that .         they deducted the time for that  though .         sure  but i lost time wondering if i could be right in my diagnosis when i noticed there wasn   t any clamp depressor in the parts they had supplied .  they don   t deduct for that .  if it had been a hensler  i would have known i was right .  how could i match up then .  the top winner was a san franciscan .  so were three of the next four .  and the fifth guy was from los angeles .  they get big city educational tapes .  the best available .  beeman spectrographs and all .  how do i compete with them .  i came all the way out here just to get a chance at a novian sponsored olympics in my classification and i might just as well have stayed home .  i knew it  i tell you  and that settles it .  novia isn   t the only chunk of rock in space .  of all the damned      he wasn   t speaking to george .  he wasn   t speaking to anyone .  he was just uncorked and frothing .  george realized that .   george said     if you knew in advance that the beemans were going to be used  couldn   t you have studied up on them .         they weren   t in my tapes  i tell you .         you could have read books .      the last word had trailed off under trevelyan   s suddenly sharp look .   trevelyan said     are you trying to make a big laugh out of this .  you think this is funny .  how do you expect me to read some book and try to memorize enough to match someone else who knows .         i thought         you try it .  you try     then  suddenly     what   s your profession  by the way .     he sounded thoroughly hostile .         well            come on  now .  if you   re going to be a wise gu  with me  let   s see what you   ve done .  you   re still on earth  i notice  so you   re not a computer programmer and your special assignment can   t be much .      george said     listen  trev .  i   m late for an appointment .     he backed away  trying to smile .      no  you don   t .     trevelyan reached out fiercely  catching hold of george   s jacket .     you answer my question .  why are you afraid to tell me .  what is it with you .  don   t come here rubbing a bad showing in my face  george  unless you can take it  too .  do you hear me .      he was shaking george in frenzy and they were struggling and swaying across the floor  when the voice of doom struck george   s ear in the form of a policeman   s outraged call .      all right now .  all right .  break it up .      george   s heart turned to lead and lurched sickeningly .  the policeman would be taking names  asking to see identity cards  and george lacked one .  he would be questioned and his lack of profession would show at once  and before trevelyan  too  who ached with the pain of the drubbing he had taken and would spread the news back home as a salve for his own hurt feelings .   george couldn   t stand that .  he broke away from trevelyan and made to run  but the policeman   s heavy hand was on his shoulder .     hold on  there .  let   s see your identity card .      trevelyan was fumbling for his  saying harshly .     i   m annand trevelyan  metallurgist  nonferrous .  i was just competing in the olympics .  you better find out about him  though  officer .      george faced the two  lips dry and throat thickened past speech .   another voice sounded  quiet  well mannered .     officer .  one moment .      the policeman stepped back .     yes  sir .         this young man is my guest .  what is the trouble .      george looked about in wild surprise .  it was the gray haired man who had been sitting next to him .  gray hair nodded benignly at george .   guest .  was he mad .   the policeman was saying     these two were creating a disturbance  sir .         any criminal charges .  any damages .         no  sir .            well  then  i   ll be responsible .     he presented a small card to the policeman   s view and the latter stepped back at once .   trevelyan began indignantly .     hold on  now     but the policeman turned on him .      all right now .  got any charges .            i just            on your way .  the rest of you move on .     a sizable crowd had gathered  which now  reluctantly  unknotted itself and raveled away .   george let himself be led to a skimmer but balked at entering .  he said     thank you  but i   m not your guest .      could it be a ridiculous case of mistaken identity .    but gray hair smiled and said     you weren   t but you are now .  let me introduce myself  i   m ladislas ingenescu  registered historian .            but            come  you will come to no harm  i assure you .  after all  i only wanted to spare you some trouble with a policeman .         but why .         do you want a reason .  well  then  say that we   re honorary towns mates  you and i .  we both shouted for the same man  remember  and we townspeople must stick together  even if the tie is only honorary .  eh .      and george  completely unsure of this man  ingenescu  and of himself as well  found himself inside the skimmer .  before he could make up his mind that he ought to get off again  they were off the ground .   he thought confusedly  the man has some status .  the policeman deferred to him .   he was almost forgetting that his real purpose here in san francisco was not to find trevelyan but to find some person with enough influence to force a reappraisal of his own capacity of education .   it could be that ingenescu was such a man .  and right in george   s lap .  everything could be working out fine fine .  yet it sounded hollow in his thought .  he was uneasy .   during the short skimmer hop  ingenescu kept up an even flow of small talk  pointing out the landmarks of the city  reminiscing about past olympics he had seen .  george  who paid just enough attention to make vague sounds during the pauses  watched the route of flight anxiously .   would they head for one of the shield openings and leave the city altogether .   no  they headed downward  and george sighed his relief softly .  he felt safer in the city .   the skimmer landed at the roof entry of a hotel and  as he alighted  ingenescu said     i hope you   ll eat dinner with me in my room .      george said     yes     and grinned unaffectedly .  he was just beginning to realize the gap left within him by missing lunch .   ingenescu let george eat in silence .  night closed in and the wall lights went on automatically .   george thought  i   ve been on my own almost twenty four hours .    and then over the coffee  ingenescu finally spoke again .  he said     you   ve been acting as though you think i intend you harm .      george reddened  put down his cup and tried to deny it  but the older man laughed and shook his head .      it   s so .  i   ve been watching you closely since i first saw you and i think i know a great deal about you now .      george half rose in horror .   ingenescu said     but sit down .  i only want to help you .      george sat down but his thoughts were in a whirl .  if the old man knew who he was  why had he not left him to the policeman .  on the other hand  why should he volunteer help .   ingenescu said     you want to know why i should want to help you .  oh  don   t look alarmed .  i can   t read minds .  it   s just that my training enables me to judge the little reactions that give minds away  you see .  do you understand that .      george shook his head .   ingenescu said     consider my first sight of you .  you were waiting in line to watch an olympics  and your micro reactions didn   t match what you were doing .  the expression of your face was wrong  the action of your hands was wrong .  it meant that something  in general  was wrong  and the interesting thing was that  whatever it was  it was nothing common  nothing obvious .  perhaps  i thought  it was something of which your own conscious mind was unaware .      i couldn   t help but follow you  sit next to you .  i followed you again when you left and eavesdropped on the conversation between your friend and yourself .  after that  well  you were far too interesting an object of study i   m sorry if that sounds cold blooded    for me to allow you to be taken off by a policeman .   now tell me  what is it that troubles you .      george was in an agony of indecision .  if this was a trap  why should it be such an indirect  roundabout one .  and he had to turn to someone .  he had come to the city to find help and here was help being offered .  perhaps what was wrong was that it was being offered .  it came too easy .   ingenescu said     of course  what you tell me as a social scientist is a privileged communication .  do you know what that means .            no  sir .         it means  it would be dishonorable for me to repeat what you say to anyone for any purpose .  moreover no one has the legal right to compel me to repeat it .      george said  with sudden suspicion     i thought you were a historian .            so lam .            just now you said you were a social scientist .      ingenescu broke into loud laughter and apologized for it when he could talk .     i   m sorry  young man  i shouldn   t laugh  and i wasn   t really laughing at you .  i was laughing at earth and its emphasis on physical science  and the practical segments of it at that .  i   ll bet you can rattle off every subdivision of construction technology or mechanical engineering and yet you   re a blank on social science .         well  then what is social science .         social science studies groups of human beings and there are many  high specialized branches to it  just as there are to zoology  for instance .  for instance  there are culturists  who study the mechanics of cultures  their growth  development  and decay .  cultures     he added  forestalling a question     are all the aspects of a way of life .  for instance  it includes the way we make our living  the things we enjoy and believe  what we consider good and bad and soon .  do you understand .         i think i do .         an economist not an economic statistician  now  but an economist specialized in the study of the way a culture supplies the bodily needs of its individual members .  a psychologist specializes in the individual member of a society and how he is affected by the society .  a futurist specializes in planning the future course of a society  and a historian  that   s where i come in  now .            yes  sir .         a historian specializes in the past development of our own society and of societies with other cultures .      george found himself interested .     was it different in the past .         i should say it was .  until a thousand years ago  there was no education  not what we call education  at least .      george said     i know .  people learned in bits and pieces out of books .         why  how do you know this .         i   ve heard it said     george said cautiously .  then     is there any use in worrying about what   s happened long ago .  i mean  it   s all done with  isn   t it .         it   s never done with  my boy .  the past explains the present .  for instance  why is our educational system what it is .      george stirred restlessly .  the man kept bringing the subject back to that .  he said snappishly     because it   s best .         ah  but why is it best .     now you listen to me for one moment and i   ll explain .  then you can tell me if there is any use in history .  even before interstellar travel was developed     he broke off at the look of complete astonishment on george   s face .     well  did you think we always had it .         i never gave it any thought  sir .         i   m sure you didn   t .  but there was a time  four or five thousand years ago  when mankind was confined to the surface of earth .  even then  his culture had grown quite technological and his numbers had increased to the point where any failure in technology would have meant mass starvation and disease .  to maintain the technological level and advance it in the face of an increasing population  more and more technicians and scientists had to be trained  and yet  as science advanced  it took longer and longer to train them .      as first interplanetary and then interstellar travel was developed  the problem grew more acute .  in fact  actual colonization of extra solar planets was impossible for about fifteen hundred years because of a lack of properly trained men .      the turning point came when the mechanics of the storage of knowledge within the brain was worked out .  once that had been done  it became possible to devise educational tapes that would modify the mechanics in such a way as to place within the mind a body of knowledge ready made so to speak .  but you know about that .      once that was done  trained men could be turned out by the thousands and millions  and we could begin what someone has since called the    filling of the universe .     there are now fifteen hundred inhabited planets in the galaxy and there is no end in sight .      do you see all that is involved .  earth exports education tapes for low specialized professions and that keeps the galactic culture unified .  for instance  the reading tapes insure a single language for all of us .   don   t look so surprised  other languages are possible  and in the past were used .  hundreds of them .      earth also exports high specialized professionals and keeps its own population at an endurable level .  since they are shipped out in a balanced sex ratio  they act as self reproductive units and help increase the populations on the outworlds where an increase is needed .  furthermore  tapes and men are paid for in material which we much need and on which our economy depends .  now do you understand why our education is the best way .            yes  sir .            does it help you to understand  knowing that without it  interstellar colonization was impossible for fifteen hundred yea s .         yes  sir .            then you see the uses of history .     the historian smiled .     and now i wonder if you see why i   m interested in you .      george snapped out of time and space back to reality .  ingenescu  apparently  didn   t talk aimlessly .  all this lecture had been a device to attack him from a new angle .   he said  once again withdrawn  hesitating     why .         social scientists work with societies and societies are made up of people .         all right .      but people aren   t machines .  the professionals in physical science work with machines .  there is only a limited amount to know about a machine and the professionals know it all .  furthermore  all machines of a given sort are just about alike so that there is nothing to interest them in any given individual machine .  but people  ah  they are so complex and so different one from another that a social scientist never knows all there is to know or even a good part of what there is to know .  to understand his own specialty  he must always be ready to study people  particularly unusual specimens .         like me     said george tonelessly .      i shouldn   t call you a specimen  i suppose  but you are unusual .  you   re  worth studying  and if you will allow me that privilege then  in return  i will help you if you are in trouble and if i can .      there were pin wheels whirring in george   s mind .   all this talk about people and colonization made possible by education .  it was as though caked thought within him were being broken up and strewn about mercilessly .   he said     let me think     and clamped his hands over his ears .   he took them away and said to the historian     will you do something for me  sir .         if i can     said the historian amiably .      and everything i say in this room is a privileged communication .  you said so .            and i meant it .            then get me an interview with an outworld official  with with a novian .      ingenescu looked startled .     well  now         you can do it     said george earnestly .     you   re an important official .  i saw the policeman   s look when you put that card in front of his eyes .  if you refuse  i i won   t let you study me .      it sounded a silly threat in george   s own ears  one without force .  on ingenescu  however  it seemed to have a strong effect .   he said     that   s an impossible condition .  a novian in olympics month         all right  then  get me a novian on the phone and i   ll make my own arrangements for an interview .         do you think you can .         i know i can .  wait and see .      ingenescu stared at george thoughtfully and then reached for the visiphone .   george waited  half drunk with his new outlook on the whole problem and the sense of power it brought .  it couldn   t miss .  it couldn   t miss .  he would be a novian yet .  he would leave earth in triumph despite antonelli and the whole crew of fools at the house for the  he almost laughed aloud  feeble minded .   george watched eagerly as the visiplate lit up .  it would open up a window into a room of novians  a window into a small patch of novia transplanted to earth .  in twenty four hours  he had accomplished that much .   there was a burst of laughter as the plate unmisted and sharpened  but for the moment no single head could be seen but rather the fast passing of the shadows of men and women  this way and that .  a voice was heard  clear worded over a background of babble .     ingenescu .  he wants me .      then there he was  staring out of the plate .  a novian .  a genuine novian .   george had not an atom of doubt .  there was something completely  outworldly about him .  nothing that could be completely defined  or even momentarily mistaken .    he was swarthy in complexion with a dark wave of hair combed rigidly back from his forehead .  he wore a thin black mustache and a pointed beard  just as dark  that scarcely reached below  the lower limit of his narrow chin  but the rest of his face was so smooth that it looked as though it had been depilated permanently .   he was smiling .     ladislas  this goes too far .  we fully expect to be spied on  within reason  during our stay on earth  but mind reading is out of bounds .         mind reading  honorable .         confess .  you knew i was going to call this evening .  you knew i was only waiting to finish this drink .     his hand moved up into view and his eye peered through a small glass of a faintly violet liqueur .     i can   t offer you one  i   m afraid .      george  out of range of ingenescu   s transmitter could not be seen by the novian .  he was relieved at that .  he wanted time to compose himself and he needed it badly .  it was as though he were made up exclusively of restless fingers  drumming  drumming  but he was right .  he hadn   t miscalculated .  ingenescu was important .   the novian called him by his first name .   good .  things worked well .  what george had lost on antonelli  he would make up  with advantage  on ingenescu .  and someday  when he was on his own at last  and could come back to earth as powerful a novian as this one who could negligently joke with ingenescu   s first name and be addressed as    honorable    in turn when he came back  he would settle with antonelli .  he had a year and a half to pay back and he  he all but lost his balance on the brink of the enticing daydream and  snapped back in sudden anxious realization that he was losing the thread of what was going on .   the novian was saying      doesn   t hold water .  novia has a civilization as complicated and advanced as earth   s .  we   re not zeston  after all .  it   s ridiculous that we have to come here for individual technicians .      ingenescu said soothingly     only for new models .  there is never any certainty that new models will be needed .  to buy the educational tapes would cost you the same price as a thousand technicians and how do you know you would need that many .      the novian tossed off what remained of his drink and laughed .   it displeased george  somehow  that a novian should be this frivolous .  he wondered uneasily if perhaps the novian ought not to have skipped that drink and even the one or two before that .    the novian said     that   s typical pious fraud  ladislas .  you know we can make use of all the late models we can get .  i collected five metallurgists this afternoon         i know     said ingenescu .     i was there .         watching me .  spying .     cried the novian .     i   ll tell you what it is .  the new model metallurgists i got differed from the previous model only in knowing the use of beeman spectrographs .  the tapes couldn   t be modified that much  not that much     he held up two fingers close together     from last year   s model .  you introduce the new models only to make us buy and spend and come here hat in hand .         we don   t make you buy .         no  but you sell late model technicians to landonum and so we have to keep pace .  it   s a merry go round you have us on  you pious earthmen  but watch out  there may be an exit somewhere .     there was a sharp edge to his laugh  and it ended sooner than it should have .   ingenescu said     in all honesty  i hope there is .  meanwhile  as to the purpose of my call         that   s right  you called .  oh  well  i   ve said my say and   suppose next year there   ll be a new model of metallurgist anyway for us to spend goods on  probably with a new gimmick for niobium assays and nothing else altered and the next year  but go on  what is it you want .         i have a young man here to whom i wish you to speak .         oh .     the novian looked not completely pleased with that .     concerning what .         i can   t say .  he hasn   t told me .  for that matter he hasn   t even told me his name and profession .      the novian frowned .     then why take up my time .         he seems quite confident that you will be interested in what he has to say .         i dare say .         and     said ingenescu     as a favor to me .      the novian shrugged .     put him on and tell him to make it short .      ingenescu stepped aside and whispered to george     address him as    honorable .      george swallowed with difficulty .  this was it .   george felt himself going moist with perspiration .  the thought had come so recently  yet it was in him now so certainly .  the beginnings of it had come when he had spoken to trevelyan  then everything had fermented and billowed into shape while ingenescu had prattled  and then the novian   s own remarks had seemed to nail it all into place .   george said     honorable  i   ve come to show you the exit from the meny go round .     deliberately  he adopted the novian   s own metaphor .   the novian stared at him gravely .     what merry go round .         you yourself mentioned it  honorable .  the merry go round that novia is on when you come to earth to to get technicians .      he couldn   t keep his teeth from chattering  from excitement  not fear .    the novian said     you   re trying to say that you know a way by which we can avoid patronizing earth   s mental supermarket .  is that it .         yes  sir .  you can control your own educational system .         umm .  without tapes .         y yes  honorable .      the novian  without taking his eyes from george  called out     ingenescu  get into view .      the historian moved to where he could be seen over george   s shoulder .   the novian said     what is this .  i don   t seem to penetrate .         i assure you solenmly     said ingenescu     that whatever this is it is being done on the young man   s own initiative  honorable .  i have not inspired this .  i have nothing to do with it .         well  then  what is the young man to you .  why do you call me on his behalf .      ingenescu said     he is an object of study  honorable .  he has value to me and i humor him .         what kind of value .         it   s difficult to explain  a matter of my profession .      the novian laughed shortly .     well  to each his profession .     he nodded to an invisible person or persons outside plate range .     there   s a young man here  a prot  g   of ingenescu or some such thing  who will explain to us how to educate without tapes .     he snapped his fingers  and another glass of pale liqueur appeared in his hand .     well  young man .      the faces on the plate were multiple now .  men and women  both  crammed in for a view of george  their faces molded into various shades of amusement and curiosity .   george tried to look disdainful .  they were all  in their own ways  novians as well as the earthman     studying    him as though he were a bug on a pin .  ingenescu was sitting in a corner  now  watching him owl eyed .   fools  he thought tensely  one and all .  but they would have to understand .  he would make them understand .   he said     i was at the metallurgist olympics this afternoon .         you  too .     said the novian blandly .     it seems all earth was there .         no  honorable  but i was .  i had a friend who competed and who made out very badly because you were using the beeman machines .  his education had included only the henslers  apparently an older model .  you said the modification involved was slight .     george held up two fingers close together in conscious mimicry of the other   s previous gesture .     and my friend had known some time in advance that knowledge of the beeman machines would be required .         and what does that signify .         it was my friend   s lifelong ambition to qualify for novia .  he already knew the henslers .  he had to know the beemans to qualify and he knew that .  to learn about the beemans would have taken just a few more facts  a bit  more data  a small amount of practice perhaps .  with a life   s ambition nding the scale  he might have managed this         and where would he have obtained a tape for the additional facts and  data .  or has education become a private matter for home study here on earth .      there was dutiful laughter from the faces in the background .   george said     that   s why he didn   t learn  honorable .  he thought he needed a tape .  he wouldn   t even try without one  no matter what the prize .  he refused to try without a tape .         refused  eh .  probably the type of fellow who would refuse to fly without a skimmer .     more laughter and the novian thawed into a smile and said     the fellow is amusing .  go on .  i   ll give you another few moments .      george said tensely     don   t think this is a joke .  tapes are actually bad .  they teach too much  they   re too painless .  a man who learns that way doesn   t know how to learn any other way .  he   s frozen into whatever position he   s been taped .  now if a person weren   t given tapes but were forced to learn by hand  so to speak  from the start  why  then he   d get the habit of learning  and continue to learn .  isn   t that reasonable .  once he has the habit well developed he can be given just a small amount of tape knowledge  perhaps  to fill in gaps or fix details .  then he can make further progress on his own .  you can make beeman metallurgists out of your own hensler metallurgists in that way and not have to come to earth for new models .      the novian nodded and sipped at his drink .     and where does everyone get knowledge without tapes .  from interstellar vacuum .         from books .  by studying the instruments themselves .  by thinking .         books .  how does one understand books without education .      books are in words .  words can be understood for the most part .  specialized words can be explained by the technicians you already have .         what about reading .  will you allow reading tapes .         reading tapes are all right  i suppose  but there   s no reason you can   t learn to read the old way  too .  at least in part .      the novian said     so that you can develop good habits from the start .         yes  yes     george said gleefully .  the man was beginning to understand .      and what about mathematics .         that   s the easiest of all  sir honorable .  mathematics is different from other technical subjects .  it starts with certain simple principles and proceeds by steps .  you can start with nothing and leam .  it   s practically designed for that .  then  once you know the proper types of mathematics  other technical books become quite understandable .  especially if you start with easy ones .         are there easy books .         definitely .  even if there weren   t  the technicians you now have can try to write easy books .  some of them might be able to put some of their knowledge into words and symbols .         good lord     said the novian to the men clustered about him .     the young devil has an answer for everything .         i have .  i have     shouted george .     ask me .         have you tried learning from books yourself .  or is this just theory with you .      george turned to look quickly at ingenescu  but the historian was passive .  there was no sign of anything but gentle interest in his face .   george said     i have .         and do you find it works .         yes  honorable     said george eagerly .     take me with you to novia .  i can set up a program and direct         wait  i have a few more questions .  how long would it take  do you suppose  for you to become a metallurgist capable of handling a beeman machine  supposing you started from nothing and did not use educational tapes .      george hesitated .     well years  perhaps .         two years .  five .  ten .         i can   t say  honorable .         well  there   s a vital question to which you have no answer  have you .  shall we say five years .  does that sound reasonable to you .         i suppose so .            all right .  we have a technician studying metallurgy according to this method of yours for five years .  he   s no good to us during that time  you   ll admit  but he must be fed and housed and paid for all that time .         but         let me finish .  then when he   s done and can use the beeman  five years have passed .  don   t you suppose we   ll have modified beemans then which he won   t be able to use .         but by then he   ll be expert on learning .  he could learn the new details necessary in a matter of days .         so you say .  and suppose this friend of yours  for instance  had studied up on beemans on his own and managed to learn it  would he be as expert in its use as a competitor who had learned it off the tapes .         maybe not     began george .      ah     said the novian .      wait  let me finish .  even if he doesn   t know something as well  it   s the ability to learn further that   s important .  he may be able to think up things  new things that no tape educated man would .  you   ll have a reservoir of onginal thinkers         in your studying     said the novian     have you thought up any new things .         no  but i   m just one man and i haven   t studied long         yes .   well  ladies  gentlemen  have we been sufficiently amused .         wait     cried george  in sudden panic .     i want to arrange a personal interview .  there are things i can   t explain over the visiphone .  there are details      the novian looked past george .     ingenescu .  i think i have done you your favor .  now  really  i have a heavy schedule tomorrow .  be well .      the screen went blank .   george   s hands shot out toward the screen  as though in a wild impulse to shake life back into it .  he cried out     he didn   t believe me .  he didn   t believe me .      ingenescu said     no  george .  did you really think he would .      george scarcely heard him .     but why not .  it   s all true .  it   s all so much to his advantage .  no risk .  i and a few men to work with  a dozen men training for years would cost less than one technician .   he was drunk .  drunk .  he didn   t understand .      george looked about breathlessly .     how do i get to him .  i   ve got to .  this was wrong .  shouldn   t have used the visiphone .  i need time .  face to face .  how do i      ingenescu said     he won   t see you  george .  and if he did  he wouldn   t believe you .         he will  i tell you .  when he isn   t drinking .  he     george turned squarely toward the historian and his eyes widened .     why do you call me george .         isn   t that your name .  george platen .         you know me .         all about you .      george was motionless except for the breath pumping his chest wall up and down .   ingenescu said     i want to help you  george .  i told you that .  i   ve been studying you and i want to help you .      george screamed     i don   t need help .  i   m not feeble minded .  the whole world is  but i   m not .     he whirled and dashed madly for the door .   he flung it open and two policemen roused themselves suddenly from their guard duty and seized him .   for all george   s straining  he could feel the hypo spray at the fleshy point just under the corner of his jaw  and that was it .  the last thing he remembered was the face of ingenescu  watching with gentle concern .   george opened his eyes to the whiteness of a ceiling .  he remembered what had happened .  he remembered it distantly as though it had happened to somebody else .  he stared at the ceiling till the whiteness filled his eyes and washed his brain clean  leaving room  it seemed  for new thought and new ways of thinking .   he didn   t know how long he lay there so  listening to the drift of his own thinking .   there was a voice in his ear .     are you awake .      and george heard his own moaning for the first time .  had he been moaning .  he tried to turn his head .   the voice said     are you in pain  george .      george whispered     funny .  i was so anxious to leave earth .  i didn   t understand .         do you know where you are .         back in the the house .     george managed to turn .  the voice be longed to omani .   george said     it   s funny ididn   t understand .      omani smiled gently     sleep again      george slept .   and woke again .  his mind was clear .   omani sat at the bedside reading  but he put down the book as george   s eyes opened .   george struggled to a sitting position .  he said     hello .         are you hungry .         you bet .     he stared at omani curiously .     i was followed when i left  wasn   t i .      omani nodded .     you were under observation at all times .  we were going to maneuver you to antonelli and let you discharge your aggressions .  we felt that to be the only way you could make progress .  your emotions were clogging your advance .      george said  with a trace of embarrassment     i was all wrong about him .         it doesn   t matter now .  when you stopped to stare at the metallurgy notice board at the airport  one of our agents reported back the list of names .  you and i had talked about your past sufficiently so that i caught the significance of trevelyan   s name there .  you asked for directions to the olympics  there was the possibility that this might result in the kind of crisis we were hoping for  we sent ladislas ingenescu to the hall to meet you and take over .         he   s an important man in the government  isn   t he .            yes  he is .            and you had him take over .  it makes me sound important .         you are important  george .      a thick stew had arrived  steaming  fragrant .  george grinned wolfishly and pushed his sheets back to free his arms .  omani helped arrange the bed table .  for a while  george ate silently .   then george said     i woke up here once before just for a short time .      omani said     i know .  i was here .         yes  i remember .  you know  everything was changed .  it was as though i was too tired to feel emotion .  i wasn   t angry any more .  i could just think .  it was as though i had been drugged to wipe out emotion .         you weren   t     said omani .     just sedation .  you had rested .         well  anyway  it was all clear to me  as though i had known it all the time but wouldn   t listen to myself .  i thought  what was it i had wanted  novia to let me do .  i had wanted to go to novia and take a batch of un educated youngsters and teach them out of books .  i had wanted to establish a house for the feeble minded like here and earth already has them many of them .      omani   s white teeth gleamed as he smiled .     the institute of higher studies is the correct name for places like this .         now i see it     said george     so easily i am amazed at my blindness before .  after all  who invents the new instrument models that require new model technicians .  who invented the beeman spectrographs  for instance .  a man called beeman  i suppose  but he couldn   t have been tape educated or how could he have made the advance .         exactly .         or who makes educational tapes .  special tape making technicians .  then who makes the tapes to train them .  more advanced technicians .  then who makes the tapes  you see what i mean .  somewhere there has to be an end .  somewhere there must be men and women with capacity for original thought .         yes  george .      george leaned back  stared over omani   s head  and for a moment there was the return of something like restlessness to his eyes .      why wasn   t i told all this at the beginning .         oh  if we could     said omani     the trouble it would save us .  we can analyze a mind  george  and say this one will make an adequate architect and that one a good woodworker .  we know of no way of detecting the capacity for original  creative thought .  it is too subtle a thing .  we have some rule of thumb methods that mark out individuals who may possibly or potentially have such a talent .      on reading day  such individuals are reported .  you were  for instance .  roughly speaking  the number so reported comes to one in ten thousand .  by the time education day arrives  these individuals are checked again  and nine out of ten of them turn out to have been false alarms .  those who remain are sent to places like this .      george said     well  what   s wrong with telling people that one out of of a hundred thousand will end at places like these .  then it won   t be such a shock to those who do .         and those who don   t .  the ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine that don   t .  we can   t have all those people considering themselves failures .  they aim at the professions and one way or another they all make it .  everyone can place after his or her name  registered something or other .  in one fashion or another every individual has his or her place in society and this is necessary .         but we .     said george .     the one in ten thousand exception .         you can   t be told .  that   s exactly it .  it   s the final test .  even after we   ve thinned out the possibilities on education day  nine out of ten of those who come here are not quite the material of creative genius  and there   s no way we can distinguish those nine from the tenth that we want by any form of machinery .  the tenth one must tell us himself .         how .         we bring you here to a house for the feeble minded and the man who  won   t accept that is the man we want .  it   s a method that can be cruel  but it works .  it won   t do to say to a man     you can create .  do so .     it is much safer to wait for a man to say     i can create  and i will do so whether you wish itor not .     there are ten thousand men like you  george  who support the advancing technology of fifteen hundred worlds .  we can   t allow ourselves to miss one recruit to that number or waste our efforts on one member who doesn   t measure up .      george pushed his empty plate out of the way and lifted a cup of coffee to his lips .      what about the people here who don   t measure up .         they are taped eventually and become our social scientists .  ingenescu is one .  i am a registered psychologist .  we are second echelon  so to speak .      george finished his coffee .  he said     i still wonder about one thing .            what is that .         george threw aside the sheet and stood up .     why do they call them olympics .      the feeling of power  jehan shuman was used to dealing with the men in authority on long embattled earth .  he was only a civilian but he originated programming patterns that resulted in self directing war computers of the highest sort .  generals consequently listened to him .  heads of congressional committees  too .   there was one of each in the special lounge of new pentagon .  general weidef was space burnt and had a small mouth puckered almost into a cipher .  congressman brant was smooth cheeked and clear eyed .  he smoked denebian tobacco with the air of one whose patriotism was so notorious  he could be allowed such liberties .   shuman  tall  distinguished  and programmer first class  faced them fearlessly .   he said   this  gentlemen  is myron aub .     the one with the unusual gift that you discovered quite by accident   said congressman brant placidly .   ah .   he inspected the little man with the egg bald head with amiable curiosity .   the little man  in return  twisted the fingers of his hands anxiously .  he had never been near such great men before .  he was only an aging low grade technician who had long ago failed all tests designed to smoke out the gifted ones among mankind and had settled into the rut of unskilled labor .  there was just this hobby of his that the great programmer had found out about and was now making such a frightening fuss over .   general weider said   i find this atmosphere of mystery childish .    copyright        by quinn publishing co .   inc .    you won t in a moment   said shuman .   this is not something we can leak to the firstcomer .   aub .   there was something imperative about his manner of biting off that one syllable name  but then he was a great programmer speaking to a mere technician .   aub .  how much is nine times seven .    aub hesitated a moment .  his pale eyes glimmered with a feeble anxiety .   sixty three   he said .   congressman brant lifted his eyebrows .   is that right .     check it for yourself  congressman .    the congressman took out his pocket computer  nudged the milled edges twice  looked at its face as it lay there in the palm of his hand  and put it back .  he said   is this the gift you brought us here to demonstrate .  an illusionist .     more than that  sir .  aub has memorized a few operations and with them he computes on paper .     a paper computer .   said the general .  he looked pained .    no  sir   said shuman patiently .   not a paper computer .  simply a sheet of paper .  general  would you be so kind as to suggest a number .     seventeen   said the general .    and you  congressman .       twenty three .     good .  aub  multiply those numbers and please show the gentlemen your manner of doing it .     yes  programmer   said aub  ducking his head .  he fished a small pad out of one shirt pocket and an artist s hairline stylus out of the other .  his forehead corrugated as he made painstaking marks on the paper .   general weider interrupted him sharply .   let s see that .    aub passed him the paper  and weider said   well  it looks like the figure seventeen .    congressman brant nodded and said   so it does  but i suppose anyone can copy figures off a computer .  i think i could make a passable seventeen myself  even without practice .     if you will let aub continue  gentlemen   said shuman without heat .   aub continued  his hand trembling a little .  finally he said in a low voice   the answer is three hundred and ninety one .    congressman brant took out his computer a second time and flicked it   by godfrey  so it is .  how did he guess .     no guess  congressman   said shuman .   he computed that result .  he did it on this sheet of paper .     humbug   said the general impatiently .   a computer is one thing and marks on paper are another .     explain  aub   said shuman .    yes  programmer .   well  gentlemen  i write down seventeen and just  underneath it  i write twenty three .  next  i say to myself  seven times three    the congressman interrupted smoothly   now  aub  the problem is seventeen times twenty three .     yes  i know   said the little technician earnestly   but i start by saying seven times three because that s the way it works .  now seven times three is twenty one .     and how do you know that .   asked the congressman .    i just remember it .  it s always twenty one on the computer .  i ve checked it any number of times .     that doesn t mean it always will be  though  does it .   said the congressman .    maybe not   stammered aub .   i m not a mathematician .  but i always get the right answers  you see .     go on .     seven times three is twenty one  so i write down twenty one .  then one times three is three  so i write down a three under the two of twenty one .     why under the two .   asked congressman brant at once .    because   aub looked helplessly at his superior for support .   it s difficult to explain .    shuman said   if you will accept his work for the moment  we can leave the details for the mathematicians .    brant subsided .   aub said   three plus two makes five  you see  so the twenty one becomes a fifty one .  now you let that go for a while and start fresh .  you multiply seven and two  that s fourteen  and one and two  that s two .  put them down like this and it adds up to thirty four .  now if you put the thirty four under the fifty one this way and add them  you get three hundred and ninety one and that s the answer .    there was an instant s silence and then general weider said   i don t believe it .  he goes through this rigmarole and makes up numbers and multiplies and adds them this way and that  but i don t believe it .  it s too complicated to be anything but homswoggling .     oh no  sir   said aub in a sweat .   it only seems complicated because you re not used to it .  actually  the rules are quite simple and will work for any numbers .     any numbers  eh .   said the general .   come then .   he took out his own computer  a severely styled gi model  and struck it at random .   make a five seven three eight on the paper .  that s five thousand seven hundred and thirty eight .     yes  sir   said aub  taking a new sheet of paper .    now    more punching of his computer    seven two three nine .  seven thousand two hundred and thirty nine .     yes  sir .     and now multiply those two .     it will take some time   quavered aub .    take the time   said the general .    go ahead  aub   said shuman crisply .   aub set to work  bending low .  he took another sheet of paper and another .  the general took out his watch finally and stared at it .   are you through with your magic making  technician .     i m almost done  sir .   here it is  sir .  forty one million  five hundred and thirty seven thousand  three hundred and eighty two .   he showed the scrawled figures of the result .   general weider smiled bitterly .  he pushed the multiplication contact on his computer and let the numbers whirl to a halt .  and then he stared and said in a surprised squeak   great galaxy  the fella s right .    the president of the terrestrial federation had grown haggard in office and  in private  he allowed a look of settled melancholy to appear on his sensitive features .  the denebian war  after its early start of vast movement and great popularity  had trickled down into a sordid matter of maneuver and countermaneuver  with discontent rising steadily on earth .  possibly  it was rising on deneb  too .   and now congressman brant  head of the important committee on military appropriations  was cheerfully and smoothly spending his half hour appointment spouting nonsense .    computing without a computer   said the president impatiently   is a contradiction in terms .     computing   said the congressman   is only a system for handling data .  a machine might do it  or the human brain might .  let me give you an example .   and  using the new skills he had learned  he worked out sums and products until the president  despite himself  grew interested .    does this always work .     every time  mr .  president .  it is foolproof .     is it hard to learn .     it took me a week to get the real hang of it .  i think you would do better .     well   said the president  considering   it s an interesting parlor game  but what is the use of it .     what is the use of a newborn baby  mr .  president .  at the moment there is no use  but don t you see that this points the way toward liberation from the machine .  consider  mr .  president   the congressman rose and his deep voice automatically took on some of the cadences he used in public debate   that the denebian war is a war of computer against computer .  their computers forge an impenetrable shield of counter missiles against our missiles  and ours forge one against theirs .  if we advance the efficiency of  our computers  so do they theirs  and for five years a precarious and profitless balance has existed .    now we have in our hands a method for going beyond the computer  leapfrogging it  passing through it .  we will combine the mechanics of computation with human thought  we will have the equivalent of intelligent computers  billions of them .  i can t predict what the consequences will be in detail but they will be incalculable .  and if deneb beats us to the punch  they may be unimaginably catastrophic .    the president said  troubled   what would you have me do .     put the power of the administration behind the establishment of a secret project on human computation .  call it project number  if you like .  i can vouch for my committee  but i will need the administration behind me .     but how far can human computation go .     there is no limit .  according to programmer shuman  who first introduced me to this discovery     i ve heard of shuman  of course .     yes .  well  dr .  shuman tells me that in theory there is nothing the computer can do that the human mind can not do .  the computer merely takes a finite amount of data and performs a finite number of operations upon them .  the human mind can duplicate the process .    the president considered that .  he said   if shuman says this  i am inclined to believe him in theory .  but  in practice  how can anyone know how a computer works .    brant laughed genially .   well  mr .  president  i asked the same question .  it seems that at one time computers were designed directly by human beings .  those were simple computers  of course  this being before the time of the rational use of computers to design more advanced computers had been established .     yes  yes .  go on .     technician aub apparently had  as his hobby  the reconstruction of some of these ancient devices and in so doing he studied the details of their workings and found he could imitate them .  the multiplication i just performed for you is an imitation of the workings of a computer .     amazing .    the congressman coughed gently   if i may make another point  mr .  president  the further we can develop this thing  the more we can divert our federal effort from computer production and computer maintenance .  as the human brain takes over  more of our energy can be directed into peacetime pursuits and the impingement of war on the ordinary man will be less .  this will be most advantageous for the party in power  of course .     ah   said the president   i see your point .  well  sit down  congressman  sit down .  i want some time to think about this .   but meanwhile  show me that multiplication trick again .  let s see if i can t catch the point of it .    programmer shuman did not try to hurry matters .  loesser was conservative  very conservative  and liked to deal with computers as his father and grandfather had .  still  he controlled the west european computer combine  and if he could be persuaded to join project number in full enthusiasm  a great deal would be accomplished .   but loesser was holding back .  he said   i m not sure i like the idea of relaxing our hold on computers .  the human mind is a capricious thing .  the computer will give the same answer to the same problem each time .  what guarantee have we that the human mind will do the same .     the human mind  computer loesser  only manipulates facts .  it doesn t matter whether the human mind or a machine does it .  they are just tools .     yes  yes .  i ve gone over your ingenious demonstration that the mind can duplicate the computer but it seems to me a little in the air .  i ll grant the theory but what reason have we for thinking that theory can be converted to practice .     i think we have reason  sir .  after all  computers have not always existed .  the cave men with their triremes  stone axes  and railroads had no computers .     and possibly they did not compute .     you know better than that .  even the building of a railroad or a ziggurat called for some computing  and that must have been without computers as we know them .     do you suggest they computed in the fashion you demonstrate .     probably not .  after all  this method we call it  graphitics   by the way  from the old european word  grapho  meaning  to write  is developed from the computers themselves so it cannot have antedated them .  still  the cave men must have had some method  eh .     lost arts .  if you re going to talk about lost arts     no  no .  i m not a lost art enthusiast  though i don t say there may not be some .  after all  man was eating grain before hydroponics  and if the primitives ate grain  they must have grown it in soil .  what else could they have done .     i don t know  but i ll believe in soil growing when i see someone grow grain in soil .  and i ll believe in making fire by rubbing two pieces of flint together when i see that  too .    shuman grew placative .   well  let s stick to graphitics .  it s just part of the process of etherealization .  transportation by means of bulky contrivances is giving way to direct mass transference .  communications devices become less massive and more efficient constantly .  for that matter  compare your pocket computer with the massive jobs of a thousand years ago .  why not  then  the last step of doing away with computers altogether .  come  sir  project number is a going concern  progress is already headlong .  but we  want your help .  if patriotism doesn t move you  consider the intellectual adventure involved .    loesser said skeptically   what progress .  what can you do beyond multiplication .  can you integrate a transcendental function .     in time  sir .  in time .  in the last month i have learned to handle division .  i can determine  and correctly  integral quotients and decimal quotients .     decimal quotients .  to how many places .    programmer shuman tried to keep his tone casual .   any number .    loesser s lower jaw dropped .   without a computer .     set me a problem .     divide twenty seven by thirteen .  take it to six places .    five minutes later  shuman said   two point oh seven six nine two three .    loesser checked it .   well  now  that s amazing .  multiplication didn t impress me too much because it involved integers after all  and i thought trick manipulation might do it .  but decimals     and that is not all .  there is a new development that is  so far  top secret and which  strictly speaking  i ought not to mention .  still  we may have made a breakthrough on the square root front .     square roots .     it involves some tricky points and we haven t licked the bugs yet  but technician aub  the man who invented the science and who has an amazing intuition in connection with it  maintains he has the problem almost solved .  and he is only a technician .  a man like yourself  a trained and talented mathematician ought to have no difficulty .     square roots   muttered loesser  attracted .    cube roots  too .  are you with us .    loesser s hand thrust out suddenly   count me in .    general weider stumped his way back and forth at the head of the room and addressed his listeners after the fashion of a savage teacher facing a group of recalcitrant students .  it made no difference to the general that they were the civilian scientists heading project number .  the general was the over all head  and he so considered himself at every waking moment .   he said   now square roots are all fine .  i can t do them myself and i don t understand the methods  but they re fine .  still  the project will not be sidetracked into what some of you call the fundamentals .  you can play with graphitics any way you want to after the war is over  but right now we have specific and very practical problems to solve .    in a far corner  technician aub listened with painful attention .  he was no longer a technician  of course  having been relieved of his duties and assigned to the project  with a fine sounding title and good pay .  but  of course  the social distinction remained and the highly placed scientific leaders could never bring themselves to admit him to their ranks on a footing of    equality .  nor  to do aub justice  did he  himself  wish it .  he was as uncomfortable with them as they with him .      the general was saying   our goal is a simple one  gentlemen  the re      placement of the computer .  a ship that can navigate space without a com   i puter on board can be constructed in one fifth the time and at one tenth the  expense of a computer laden ship .  we could build fleets five times  ten  times  as great as deneb could if we could but eliminate the computer .    and i see something even beyond this .  it may be fantastic now  a mere dream  but in the future i see the manned missile .   there was an instant murmur from the audience .  the general drove on .   at the present time  our chief bottleneck is the fact that missiles are limited in intelligence .  the computer controlling them can only be so large  and for that reason they can meet the changing nature of anti missile defenses in an unsatisfactory way .  few missiles  if any  accomplish their goal and missile warfare is coming to a dead end  for the enemy  fortunately  as well as for ourselves .    on the other hand  a missile with a man or two within  controlling flight by graphitics  would be lighter  more mobile  more intelligent .  it would give us a lead that might well mean the margin of victory .  besides which  gentlemen  the exigencies of war compel us to remember one thing .  a man is much more dispensable than a computer .  manned missiles could be launched in numbers and under circumstances that no good general would care to undertake as far as computer directed missiles are concerned   he said much more but technician aub did not wait .   technician aub  in the privacy of his quarters  labored long over the note he was leaving behind .  it read finally as follows    when i began the study of what is now called graphitics  it was no more than a hobby .  i saw no more in it than an interesting amusement  an exercise of mind .    when project number began  i thought that others were wiser than i  that graphitics might be put to practical use as a benefit to mankind  to aid in the production of really practical mass transference devices perhaps .  but now i see it is to be used only for death and destruction .    i cannot face the responsibility involved in having invented graphitics .    he then deliberately turned the focus of a protein depolarizer on himself and fell instantly and painlessly dead .   they stood over the grave of the little technician while tribute was paid to the greatness of his discovery .   programmer shuman bowed his head along with the rest of them  but remained unmoved .  the technician had done his share and was no longer needed  after all .  he might have started graphitics  but now that it had  started  it would carry on by itself overwhelmingly  triumphantly  until manned missiles were possible with who knew what else .   nine times seven  thought shuman with deep satisfaction  is sixty three  and i don t need a computer to tell me so .  the computer is in my own head .   and it was amazing the feeling of power that gave him .   the dying night  part one  it was almost a class reunion  and though it was marked by joylessness  there was no reason as yet to think it would be marred by tragedy .   edward talliaferro  fresh from the moon and without his gravity legs yet  met the other two in stanley kaunas s room .  kaunas rose to greet him in a subdued manner .  battersley ryger merely sat and nodded .   talliaferro lowered his krge body carefully to the couch  very aware of its unusual weight .  he grimaced a little  his plump lips twisting inside the rim of hair that surrounded his mouth on lip  chin  and cheek .   they had seen one another earlier that day under more formal conditions .  now for the first time they were alone  and talliaferro said   this is a kind of occasion .  we re meeting for the first time in ten years .  first time since graduation  in fact .    ryger s nose twitched .  it had been broken shortly before that same graduation and he had received his degree in astronomy with a bandage disfiguring his face .  he said grumpily   anyone ordered champagne .  or something .    talliaferro said   come on .  first big interplanetary astronomical convention in history is no place for glooming .  and among friends  too .    kaunas said suddenly   it s earth .  it doesn t feel right .  i can t get used to it .   he shook his head but his look of depression was not detachable .  it remained .   copyright        by fantasy house  inc .   talliaferro said   i know .  i m so heavy .  it takes all the energy out of me .  at that  you re better off than i am  kaunas .  mercurian gravity is   .   normal .  on the moon  it s only   .    .   he interrupted ryger s beginning of a sound by saying   and on ceres they use pseudo grav fields adjusted to   .   .  you have no problems at all  ryger .    the cerian astronomer looked annoyed   it s the open air .  going outside without a suit gets me .     right   agreed kaunas   and letting the sun beat down on you .  just letting it .    talliaferro found himself insensibly drifting back in time .  they had not changed much .  nor  he thought  had he himself .  they were all ten years older  of course .  ryger had put on some weight and kaunas s thin face had grown a bit leathery  but he would have recognized either if he had met him without warning .   he said   i don t think it s earth getting us .  let s face it .    kaunas looked up sharply .  he was a little fellow with quick  nervous movements of his hands .  he habitually wore clothes that looked a shade too large for him .   he said   villiers .  i know .  i think about him sometimes .   then  with an air of desperation   i got a letter from him .    ryger sat upright  his olive complexion darkening further and said with energy   you did .  when .     a month ago .    ryger turned to talliaferro .   how about you .    talliaferro blinked placidly and nodded .   ryger said   he s gone crazy .  he claims he s discovered a practical method of mass transference through space .   he told you two also .   that s it  then .  he was always a little bent .  now he s broken .    he rubbed his nose fiercely and talliaferro thought of the day vidiers had broken it .   for ten years  villiers had haunted them like the vague shadow of a guilt that wasn t really theirs .  they had gone through their graduate work together  four picked and dedicated men being trained for a profession that had reached new heights in this age of interplanetary travel .   the observatories were opening on the other worlds  surrounded by vacuum  unblurred by air .   there was the lunar observatory  from which earth and the inner planets could be studied  a silent world in whose sky the home planet hung suspended .   mercury observatory  closest to the sun  perched at mercury s north pole  where the terminator moved scarcely at all  and the sun was fixed on the horizon and could be studied in the minutest detail .   ceres observatory  newest  most modem  with its range extending from jupiter to the outermost galaxies .   there were disadvantages  of course .  with interplanetary travel still difficult  leaves would be few  anything like normal life virtually impossible  but this was a lucky generation .  coming scientists would find the fields of knowledge well reaped and  until the invention of an interstellar drive  no new horizon as capacious as this one would be opened .   each of these lucky four  talliaferro  ryger  kaunas  and villiers  was to be in the position of a galileo  who by owning the first real telescope  could not point it anywhere in the sky without making a major discovery .   but then romero villiers had fallen sick and it was rheumatic fever .  whose fault was that .  his heart had been left leaking and limping .   he was the most brilliant of the four  the most hopeful  the most intense  and he could not even finish his schooling and get his doctorate .   worse than that  he could never leave earth  the acceleration of a spaceship s take off would kill him .   talliaferro was marked for the moon  ryger for ceres  kaunas for mercury .  only villiers stayed behind  a life prisoner of earth .   they had tried telling their sympathy and villiers had rejected it with something approaching hate .  he had railed at them and cursed them .  when ryger lost his temper and lifted his fist  villiers had sprung at him  screaming  and had broken ryger s nose .   obviously ryger hadn t forgotten that  as he caressed his nose gingerly with one finger .   kaunas s forehead was an uncertain washboard of wrinkles .   he s at the convention  you know .  he s got a room in the hotel     .       won t see him   said ryger .    he s coming up here .  he said he wanted to see us .  i thought  he said nine .  he ll be here any minute .     in that case   said ryger   if you don t mind  i m leaving .   he rose .   talliaferro said   oh  wait a while .  what s the harm in seeing him .     because there s no point .  he s mad .     even so .  let s not be petty about it .  are you afraid of him .     afraid .   ryger looked contemptuous .    nervous  then .  what is there to be nervous about .     i m not nervous   said ryger .    sure you are .  we all feel guilty about him  and without real reason .  nothing that happened was our fault .   but he was speaking defensively and he knew it .   and when  at that point  the door signal sounded  all three jumped and turned to stare uneasily at the barrier that stood between themselves and villiers .   the door opened and romero villiers walked in .  the others rose stiffly to greet him  then remained standing in embarrassment  without one hand being raised .   he stared them down sardonically .  he s changed  thought talliaferro .   he had .  he had shrunken in almost every dimension .  a gathering stoop made him seem even shorter .  the skin of his scalp glistened through thinning hair  the skin on the back of his hands was ridged crookedly with bluish veins .  he looked ill .  there seemed nothing to link him to the memory of the past except for his trick of shading his eyes with one hand when he stared intently and  when he spoke  the even  controlled baritone of his voice .   he said   my friends .  my space trotting friends .  we ve lost touch .    talliaferro said   hello  villiers .    villiers eyed him .   are you well .     well enough .     and you two .    kaunas managed a weak smile and a murmur .  ryger snapped   all right  villiers .  what s up .     ryger  the angry man   said villiers .   how s ceres .     it was doing well when i left .  how s earth .     you can see for yourself   but villiers tightened as he said that .   he went on   i am hoping that the reason all three of you have come to the convention is to hear my paper day after tomorrow .     your paper .  what paper .   asked talliaferro .    i wrote you all about it .  my method of mass transference .    ryger smiled with one corner of his mouth .   yes  you did .  you didn t say anything about a paper  though  and i don t recall that you re listed as one of the speakers .  i would have noticed it if you had been .     you re right .  i m not listed .  nor have i prepared an abstract for publication .    villiers had flushed and talliaferro said soothingly   take it easy  villiers .  you don t look well .    villiers whirled on him  lips contorted .   my heart s holding out  thank you .    kaunas said   listen  villiers  if you re not listed or abstracted     you listen .  i ve waited ten years .  you have the jobs in space and i have to teach school on earth  but i m a better man than any of you or all of you .     granted   began talliaferro .    and i don t want your condescension either .  mandel witnessed it .  i suppose you ve heard of mandel .  well  he s chairman of the astronautics division at the convention and i demonstrated mass transference for him .  it was a crude device and it burnt out after one use but  are you listening .     we re listening   said ryger coldly   for what that counts .     he ll let me talk about it my way .  you bet he will .  no warning .  no advertisement .  i m going to spring it at them like a bombshell .  when i give  them the fundamental relationships involved it will break up the convention .  they ll scatter to their home labs to check on me and build devices .  and they ll find it works .  i made a live mouse disappear at one spot in my lab and appear in another .  mandel witnessed it .    he stared at them  glaring first at one face  then at another .  he said   you don t believe me  do you .    ryger said   if you don t want advertisement  why do you tell us .     you re different .  you re my friends  my classmates .  you went out into space and left me behind .     that wasn t a matter of choice   objected kaunas in a thin  high voice .   villiers ignored that .  he said   so i want you to know now .  what will work for a mouse will work for a human .  what will move something ten feet across a lab will move it a million miles across space .  i ll be on the moon  and on mercury  and on ceres and anywhere i want to go .  i ll match every one of you and more .  and i ll have done more for astronomy just teaching school and thinking  than all of you with your observatories and telescopes and cameras and spaceships .     well   said talliaferro   i m pleased .  more power to you .  may i see a copy of the paper .     oh  no .   villiers  hands clenched close to his chest as though he were holding phantom sheets and shielding them from observation .   you wait like everyone else .  there s only one copy and no one will see it till i m ready .  not even mandel .     one copy   cried talliaferro .   if you misplace it     i won t .  and if i do  it s all in my head .     if you   talliaferro almost finished that sentence with  die  but stopped himself .  instead  he went on after an almost imperceptible pause    have any sense  you ll scan it at least .  for safety s sake .     no   said villiers  shortly .   you ll hear me day after tomorrow .  you ll see the human horizon expanded at one stroke as it never has been before .    again he stared intently at each face .   ten years   he said .   good by .     he s mad   said ryger explosively  staring at the door as though villiers were still standing before it .    is he .   said talliaferro thoughtfully .   i suppose he is  in a way .  he hates us for irrational reasons .  and  then  not even to scan his paper as a precaution    talliaferro fingered his own small scanner as he said that .  it was just a neutrally colored  undistinguished cylinder  somewhat thicker and somewhat shorter than an ordinary pencil .  in recent years  it had become the hallmark of the scientist  much as the stethoscope was that of the physician and the micro computer that of the statistician .  the scanner was worn in a jacket pocket  or clipped to a sleeve  or slipped behind the ear  or swung at the end of a string .   talliaferro sometimes  in his more philosophical moments  wondered how it was in the days when research men had to make laborious notes of the literature or file away full sized reprints .  how unwieldy .   now it was only necessary to scan anything printed or written to have a micro negative which could be developed at leisure .  talliaferro had already recorded every abstract included in the program booklet of the convention .  the other two  he assumed with full confidence  had done likewise .   talliaferro said   under the circumstances  refusal to scan is mad .     space .   said ryger hotly .   there is no paper .  there is no discovery .  scoring one on us would be worth any lie to him .     but then what will he do day after tomorrow .   asked kaunas .    how do i know .  he s a madman .    talliaferro still played with his scanner and wondered idly if he ought to remove and develop some of the small slivers of film that lay stored away in its vitals .  he decided against it .  he said   don t underestimate villiers .  he s a brain .     ten years ago  maybe   said ryger .   now he s a nut .  i propose we forget him .    he spoke loudly  as though to drive away villiers and all that concerned him by the sheer force with which he discussed other things .  he talked about ceres and his work the radio plotting of the milky way with new radioscopes capable of the resolution of single stars .   kaunas listened and nodded  then chimed in with information concerning the radio emissions of sunspots and his own paper  in press  on the association of proton storms with the gigantic hydrogen flares on the sun s surface .   talliaferro contributed little .  lunar work was unglamorous in comparison .  the latest information on long scale weather forecasting through direct observation of terrestrial jet streams would not compare with radioscopes and proton storms .   more than that  his thoughts could not leave villiers .  villiers was the brain .  they all knew it .  even ryger  for all his bluster  must feel that if mass transference were at all possible then villiers was a logical discoverer .   the discussion of their own work amounted to no more than an uneasy admission that none of them had come to much .  talliaferro had followed the literature and knew .  his own papers had been minor .  the others had authored nothing of great importance .   none of them face the fact had developed into space shakers .  the colossal dreams of school days had not come true and that was that .  they were competent routine workmen .  no less .  unfortunately  no more .  they knew that .   villiers would have been more .  they knew that  too .  it was that knowledge  as well as guilt  which kept them antagonistic .   talliaferro felt uneasily that villiers  despite everything  was yet to be  more .  the others must be thinking so  too  and mediocrity could grow quickly unbearable .  the mass transference paper would come to pass and villiers would be the great man after all  as he was always fated to be apparently  while his classmates  with all their advantages  would be forgotten .  their role would be no more than to applaud from the crowd .   he felt his own envy and chagrin and was ashamed of it  but felt it none the less .   conversation died  and kaunas said  his eyes turning away   listen  why don t we drop in on old villiers .    there was a false heartiness about it  a completely unconvincing effort at casualness .  he added   no use leaving bad feelings unnecessarily    talliaferro thought  he wants to make sure about the mass transference .  he s hoping it is only a madman s nightmare so he can sleep tonight .   but he was curious himself  so he made no objection  and even ryger shrugged with ill grace and said   hell  why not .    it was a little before eleven then .   talliaferro was awakened by the insistent ringing of his door signal .  he hitched himself to one elbow in the darkness and felt distinctly outraged .  the soft glow of the ceiling indicator showed it to be not quite four in the morning .   he cried out   who is it .    the ringing continued in short  insistent spurts .   growling  talliaferro slipped into his bathrobe .  he opened the door and blinked in the corridor light .  he recognized the man who faced him from the trimensionals he had seen often enough .   nevertheless  the man said in an abrupt whisper   my name is hubert mandel .     yes  sir   said talliaferro .  mandel was one of the names in astronomy  prominent enough to have an important executive position with the world astronomical bureau  active enough to be chairman of the astronautics section here at the convention .   it suddenly struck talliaferro that it was mandel for whom villiers claimed to have demonstrated mass transference .  the thought of villiers was somehow a sobering one .   mandel said   you are dr .  edward talliaferro .     yes  sir .     then dress and come with me .  it is very important .  it concerns a mutual acquaintance .     dr .  villiers .    mandel s eyes flickered a bit .  his brows and lashes were so fair as to give those eyes a naked  unfringed appearance .  his hair was silky thin  his age about fifty .   he said   why villiers .     he mentioned you last evening .  i don t know any other mutual acquaintance .    mandel nodded  waited for talliaferro to finish slipping into his clothes  then turned and led the way .  ryger and kaunas were waiting in a room one floor above talliaferro s .  kaunas s eyes were red and troubled .  ryger was smoking a cigarette with impatient puffs .   talliaferro said   we re all here .  another reunion .   it fell flat .   he took a seat and the three stared at one another .  ryger shrugged .   mandel paced the floor  hands deep in his pockets .  he said   i apologize for any inconvenience  gentlemen  and i thank you for your co operation .  i would like more of it .  our friend  romero villiers  is dead .  about an hour ago  his body was removed from the hotel .  the medical judgment is heart failure .    there was a stunned silence .  ryger s cigarette hovered halfway to his lips  then sank slowly without completing its journey .    poor devil   said talliaferro .    horrible   whispered kaunas hoarsely .   he was   his voice played out .   ryger shook himself .   well  he had a bad heart .  there s nothing to be done .     one little thing   corrected mandel quietly .   recovery .     what does that mean .   asked ryger sharply .   mandel said   when did you three see him last .    talliaferro spoke .   last evening .  it turned out to be a reunion .  we all met for the first time in ten years .  it wasn t a pleasant meeting  i m sorry to say .  villiers felt he had cause for anger with us  and he was angry .     that was when .     about nine  the first time .     the first time .     we saw him again later in the evening .    kaunas looked troubled .   he had left angrily .  we couldn t leave it at that .  we had to try .  it wasn t as if we hadn t all been friends at one time .  so we went to his room and    mandel pounced on that .   you were all in his room .     yes   said kaunas  surprised .    about when .     eleven  i think .   he looked at the others .  talliaferro nodded .    and how long did you stay .     two minutes   put in ryger .   he ordered us out as though we were after his paper .   he paused as though expecting mandel to ask what paper  but mandel said nothing .  he went on .   i think he kept it under his pillow .  at least he lay across the pillow as he yelled at us to leave .     he may have been dying then   said kaunas  in a sick whisper .    not then   said mandel shortly .   so you probably all left fingerprints .     probably   said talliaferro .  he was losing some of his automatic respect  for mandel and a sense of impatience was returning .  it was four in the morning  mandel or no .  he said   now what s all this about .     well  gentlemen   said mandel   there s more to villiers  death than the fact of death .  villiers  paper  the only copy of it as far as i know  was stuffed into the cigarette flash disposal unit and only scraps of it were left .  i ve never seen or read the paper  but i knew enough about the matter to be willing to swear in court if necessary that the remnants of unflashed paper in the disposal unit were of the paper he was planning to give at this convention .   you seem doubtful  dr .  ryger .    ryger smiled sourly .   doubtful that he was going to give it .  if you want my opinion  sir  he was mad .  for ten years he was a prisoner of earth and he fantasied mass transference as escape .  it was all that kept him alive probably .  he rigged up some sort of fraudulent demonstration .  i don t say it was deliberate fraud .  he was probably madly sincere  and sincerely mad .  last evening was the climax .  he came to our rooms he hated us for having escaped earth and triumphed over us .  it was what he had lived for for ten years .  it may have shocked him back to some form of sanity .  he knew he couldn t actually give the paper  there was nothing to give .  so he burnt it and his heart gave out .  it is too bad .    mandel listened to the cerian astronomer  wearing a look of sharp disapproval .  he said   very glib  dr .  ryger  but quite wrong .  i am not as easily fooled by fraudulent demonstrations as you may believe .  now according to the registration data  which i have been forced to check rather hastily  you three were his classmates at college .  is that right .    they nodded .    are there any other classmates of yours present at the convention .     no   said kaunas .   we were the only four qualifying for a doctorate in astronomy that year .  at least he would have qualified except     yes  i understand   said mandel .   well  then  in that case one of you three visited villiers in his room one last time at midnight .    there was a short silence .  then ryger said coldly   not i .   kaunas  eyes wide  shook his head .   talliaferro said   what are you implying .     one of you came to him at midnight and insisted on seeing his paper .  i don t know the motive .  conceivably  it was with the deliberate intention of forcing him into heart failure .  when villiers collapsed  the criminal  if i may call him so  was ready .  he snatched the paper which  i might add  probably was kept under his pillow  and scanned it .  then he destroyed the paper itself in the flash disposal  but he was in a hurry and destruction wasn t complete .    ryger interrupted .   how do you know all this .  were you a witness .     almost   said mandel .   villiers was not quite dead at the moment of his first collapse .  when the criminal left  he managed to reach the phone and call my room .  he choked out a few phrases  enough to outline what had  occurred .  unfortunately i was not in my room  a late conference kept me away .  however  my recording attachment taped it .  i always play the recording tape back whenever i return to my room or office .  bureaucratic habit .  i called back .  he was dead .     well  then   said ryger   who did he say did it .     he didn t .  or if he did  it was unintelligible .  but one word rang out clearly .  it was  classmate .      talliaferro detached his scanner from its place in his inner jacket pocket and held it out toward mandel .  quietly he said   if you would like to develop the film in my scanner  you are welcome to do so .  you will not find villiers  paper there .    at once  kaunas did the same  and ryger  with a scowl  joined .   mandel took all three scanners and said dryly   presumably  whichever one of you has done this has already disposed of the piece of exposed film with the paper on it .  however    talliaferro raised his eyebrows .   you may search my person or my room .    but ryger was still scowling   now wait a minute  wait one bloody minute .  are you the police .    mandel stared at him .   do you want the police .  do you want a scandal and a murder charge .  do you want the convention disrupted and the system press to make a holiday out of astronomy and astronomers .  villiers  death might well have been accidental .  he did have a bad heart .  whichever one of you was there may well have acted on impulse .  it may not have been a premeditated crime .  if whoever it is will return the negative  we can avoid a great deal of trouble .     even for the criminal .   asked talliaferro .       mandel shrugged .   there may be trouble for him .  i will not promise immunity .  but whatever the trouble  it won t be public disgrace and life imprisonment  as it might be if the police are called in .    silence .   mandel said   it is one of you three .    silence .   mandel went on   i think i can see the original reasoning of the guilty person .  the paper would be destroyed .  only we four knew of the mass transference and only i had ever seen a demonstration .  moreover you had only his word  a madman s word perhaps  that i had seen it .  with villiers dead of heart failure and the paper gone  it would be easy to believe dr .  ryger s theory that there was no mass transference and never had been .  a year or two might pass and our criminal  in possession of the mass transference data  could reveal it little by little  rig experiments  publish careful papers  and end as the apparent discoverer with all that would imply in terms of money and renown .  even his own classmates would suspect nothing .  at most they would believe that the long past affair with villiers had inspired him to begin investigations in the field .  no more .    mandel looked sharply from one face to another .   but none of that will work now .  any of the three of you who comes through with mass transference is proclaiming himself the criminal .  i ve seen the demonstration  i know it is legitimate  i know that one of you possesses a record of the paper .  the information is therefore useless to you .  give it up then .    silence .   mandel walked to the door and turned again   i d appreciate it if you would stay here till i return .  i won t be long .  i hope the guilty one will use the interval to consider .  if he s afraid a confession will lose him his job  let him remember that a session with the police may lose him his liberty and cost him the psychic probe .   he hefted the three scanners  looked grim and somewhat in need of sleep .   i ll develop these .    kaunas tried to smile .   what if we make a break for it while you re gone .     only one of you has reason to try   said mandel .   i think i can rely on the two innocent ones to control the third  if only out of self protection .    he left .   it was five in the morning .  ryger looked at his watch indignantly .   a hell of a thing .  i want to sleep .     we can curl up here   said talliaferro philosophically .   is anyone planning a confession .    kaunas looked away and ryger s lip lifted .    i didn t think so .   talliaferro closed his eyes  leaned his large head back against the chair and said in a tired voice   back on the moon  they re in the slack season .  we ve got a two week night and then it s busy  busy .  then there s two weeks of sun and there s nothing but calculations  correlations and bull sessions .  that s the hard time .  i hate it .  if there were more women  if i could arrange something permanent    in a whisper  kaunas talked about the fact that it was still impossible to get the entire sun above the horizon and in view of the telescope on mercury .  but with another two miles of track scon to be laid down for the observatory move the whole thing  you know  tremendous forces involved  solar energy used directly it might be managed .  it would be managed .   even ryger consented to talk of ceres after listening to the low murmur of the other voices .  there was the problem there of the two hour rotation period  which meant the stars whipped across the sky at an angular velocity twelve times that in earth s sky .  a net of three light scopes  three radio scopes  three of everything  caught the fields of study from one another as they whirled past .    could you use one of the poles .   asked kaunas .    you re thinking of mercury and the sun   said ryger impatiently .   even at the poles  the sky would still twist  and half of it would be forever  hidden .  now if ceres showed only one face to the sun  the way mercury does  we could have a permanent night sky with the stars rotating slowly once in three years .    the sky lightened and it dawned slowly .   talliaferro was half asleep  but he kept hold of half consciousness firmly .  he would not fall asleep and leave the others awake .  each of the three  he thought  was wondering   who .  who .   except the guilty one  of course .   talliaferro s eyes snapped open as mandel entered again .  the sky  as seen from the window  had grown blue .  talliaferro was glad the window was closed .  the hotel was air conditioned  of course  but windows could be opened during the mild season of the year by those earthmen who fancied the illusion of fresh air .  talliaferro  with moon vacuum on his mind  shuddered at the thought with real discomfort .   mandel said   have any of you anything to say .    they looked at him steadily .  ryger shook his head .   mandel said   i have developed the film in your scanners  gentlemen  and viewed the results .   he tossed scanners and developed slivers of film on to the bed .   nothing .  you ll have trouble sorting out the film  i m afraid .  for that i m sorry .  and now there is still the question of the missing film .     if any   said ryger  and yawned prodigiously .   mandel said   i would suggest we come down to villiers  room  gentlemen .    kaunas looked startled .   why .    talliaferro said   is this psychology .  bring the criminal to the scene of the crime and remorse will wring a confession from him .    mandel said   a less melodramatic reason is that i would like to have the two of you who are innocent help me find the missing film of villiers  paper .     do you think it s there .   asked ryger challengingly .    possibly .  it s a beginning .  we can then search each of your rooms .  the symposium on astronautics doesn t start till tomorrow at    a . m .  we have till then .     and after that .     it may have to be the police .    they stepped gingerly into villiers  room .  ryger was red  kaunas pale .  talliaferro tried to remain calm .   last night they had seen it under artificial lighting with a scowling  disheveled villiers clutching his pillow  staring them down  ordering them away .  now there was the scentless odor of death about it .   mandel fiddled with the window polarizer to let more light in  and adjusted it too far  so that the eastern sun slipped in .   kaunas threw his arm up to shade his eyes and screamed   the sun .   so that all the others froze .   kaunas s face showed a kind of terror  as though it were his mercurian sun that he had caught a blinding glimpse of .   talliaferro thought of his own reaction to the possibility of open air and his teeth gritted .  they were all bent crooked by their ten years away from earth .   kaunas ran to the window  fumbling for the polarizer  and then the breath came out of him in a huge gasp .   mandel stepped to his side .   what s wrong .   and the other two joined them .   the city lay stretched below them and outward to the horizon in broken stone and brick  bathed in the rising sun  with the shadowed portions toward them .  talliaferro cast it all a furtive and uneasy glance .   kaunas  his chest seemingly contracted past the point where he could cry out  stared at something much closer .  there  on the outer window sill  one corner secured in a trifling imperfection  a crack in the cement  was an inch long strip of milky gray film  and on it were the early rays of the rising sun .   mandel  with an angry  incoherent cry  threw up the window and snatched it away .  he shielded it in one cupped hand  staring out of hot and reddened eyes .   he said   wait here .    there was nothing to say .  when mandel left  they sat down and stared stupidly at one another .   mandel was back in twenty minutes .  he said quietly  in a voice that gave the impression  somehow  that it was quiet only because its owner had passed far beyond the raving stage    the corner in the crack wasn t overexposed .  i could make out a few words .  it is villiers  paper .  the rest is ruined  nothing can be salvaged .  it s gone .     what next .   said talliaferro .   mandel shrugged wearily .   right now  i don t care .  mass transference is gone until someone as brilliant as villiers works it out again .  i shall work on it but i have no illusions as to my own capacity .  with it gone  i suppose you three don t matter  guilty or not .  what s the difference .   his whole body seemed to have loosened and sunk into despair .   but talliaferro s voice grew hard .   now  hold on .  in your eyes  any of the three of us might be guilty .  i  for instance .  you are a big man in the field and you will never have a good word to say for me .  the general idea may arise that i am incompetent or worse .  i will not be ruined by the shadow of guilt .  now let s solve this thing .     i am no detective   said mandel wearily .    then call in the police  damn it .    i ryger said   wait a while  tal .  are you implying that i m guilty .      i m saying that i m innocent .    kaunas raised his voice in fright .   it will mean the psychic probe for each of us .  there may be mental damage    mandel raised both arms high in the air .   gentlemen .  gentlemen .  please .  there is one thing we might do short of the police  and you are right  dr .  talliaferro  it would be unfair to the innocent to leave this matter here .    they turned to him in various stages of hostility .  ryger said   what do you suggest .     i have a friend named wendell urth .  you may have heard of him  or you may not  but perhaps i can arrange to see him tonight .     what if you can .   demanded talliaferro .   where does that get us .     he s an odd man   said mandel hesitantly   very odd .  and very brilliant in his way .  he has helped the police before this and he may be able to help us now .    part two  edward talliaferro could not forbear staring at the room and its occupant with the greatest astonishment .  it and he seemed to exist in isolation  and to be part of no recognizable world .  the sounds of earth were absent in this well padded  windowless nest .  the light and air of earth had been blanked out in artificial illumination and conditioning .   it was a large room  dim and cluttered .  they had picked their way across a littered floor to a couch from which book films had been brusquely cleared and dumped to one side in a tangle .   the man who owned the room had a large  round face on a stumpy  round body .  he moved quickly about on his short legs  jerking his head as he spoke until his thick glasses all but bounced off the thoroughly inconspicuous nubble that served as a nose .  his thick lidded  somewhat protuberant eyes gleamed in myopic good nature at them all  as he seated himself in his own chair desk combination  lit directly by the one bright light in the room .    so good of you to come  gentlemen .  pray excuse the condition of my room .   he waved stubby fingers in a wide sweeping gesture .   i am engaged in cataloguing the many objects of extraterrological interest i have accumulated .  it is a tremendous job .  for instance    he dodged out of his seat and burrowed in a heap of objects beside the desk till he came up with a smoky gray object  semi translucent and roughly cylindrical .   this   he said   is a callistan object that may be a relic of intelligent nonhuman entities .  it is not decided .  not more than a dozen have been discovered and this is the most perfect single specimen i know of .    he tossed it to one side and talliaferro jumped .  the plump man stared in his direction and said   it s not breakable .   he sat down again  clasped his  pudgy fingers tightly over his abdomen and let them pump slowly in and out as he breathed .   and now what can i do for you .    hubert mandel had carried through the introductions and talliaferro was considering deeply .  surely it was a man named wendell urth who had written a recent book entitled comparative evolutionary processes on water oxygen planets  and surely this could not be the man .   he said   are you the author of comparative evolutionary processes  dr .  urth .    a beatific smile spread across urth s face   you ve read it .     well  no  i haven t  but    urth s expression grew instantly censorious .   then you should .  right now .  here  i have a copy    he bounced out of his chair again and mandel cried at once   now wait  urth  first things first .  this is serious .    he virtually forced urth back into his chair and began speaking rapidly as though to prevent any further side issues from erupting .  he told the whole story with admirabk word economy .   urth reddened slowly as he listened .  he seized his glasses and shoved them higher up on his nose .   mass transference .   he cried .    i saw it with my own eyes   said mandel .    and you never told me .     i was sworn to secrecy .  the man was peculiar .  i explained that .    urth pounded the desk .   how could you allow such a discovery to remain the property of an eccentric  mandel .  the knowledge should have been forced from him by psychic probe  if necessary .     it would have killed him   protested mandel .   but urth was rocking back and forth with his hands clasped tightly to his cheeks .   mass transference .  the only way a decent  civilized man should travel .  the only possible way .  the only conceivable way .  if i had known .  if i could have been there .  but the hotel is nearly thirty miles away .       ryger  who listened with an expression of annoyance on his face  interposed   i understand there s a flitter line direct to convention hall .  it could have gotten you there in ten minutes .    urth stiffened and looked at ryger strangely .  his cheeks bulged .  he jumped to his feet and scurried out of the room .   ryger said   what the devil .    mandel muttered   damn it .  i should have warned you .     about what .     dr .  urth doesn t travel on any sort of conveyance .  it s a phobia .  he moves about only on foot .    kaunas blinked about in the dimness .   but he s an extraterrologist  isn t he .  an expert on life forms of other planets .    talliaferro had risen and now stood before a galactic lens on a pedestal .   he stared at the inner gleam of the star systems .  he had never seen a lens so large or so elaborate .   mandel said   he s an extraterrologist  yes  but he s never visited any of the planets on which he is expert and he never will .  in thirty years  i doubt if he s ever been more than a mile from this room .    ryger laughed .   mandel flushed angrily .   you may find it funny  but i d appreciate your being careful what you say when dr .  urth comes back .    urth sidled in a moment later .   my apologies  gentlemen   he said in a whisper .   and now let us approach our problem .  perhaps one of you wishes to confess .    talliaferro s lips quirked sourly .  this plump  self imprisoned extraterrologist was scarcely formidable enough to force a confession from anyone .  fortunately  there would be no need of his detective talents  if any  after all .   talliaferro said   dr .  urth  are you connected with the police .    a certain smugness seemed to suffuse urth s ruddy face .   i have no official connection  dr .  talliaferro  but my unofficial relationships are very good indeed .     in that case  i will give you some information which you can carry to the police .    urth drew in his abdomen and hitched at his shirttail .  it came free  and slowly he polished his glasses with it .  when he was quite through and had perched them precariously on his nose once more  he said   and what is that .     i will tefl you who was present when villiers died and who scanned his paper .     you have solved the mystery .     i ve thought about it all day .  i think i ve solved it .   talliaferro rather enjoyed the sensation he was creating .    well  then .    talliaferro took a deep breath .  this was not going to be easy to do  though he had been planning it for hours .   the guilty man   he said   is obviously dr .  hubert mandel .    mandel stared at talliaferro in sudden  hard breathing indignation .   look here  doctor   he began  loudly   if you have any basis for such a ridiculous    urth s tenor voice soared above the interruption .   let him talk  hubert  let us hear him .  you suspected him and there is no law that forbids him to suspect you .    mandel fell angrily silent .   talliaferro  not allowing his voice to falter  said   it is more than just suspicion  dr .  urth .  the evidence is perfectly plain .  four of us knew about mass transference  but only one of us  dr .  mandel  had actually seen a  demonstration .  he knew it to be a fact .  he knew a paper on the subject existed .  we three knew only that villiers was more or less unbalanced .  oh  we might have thought there was just a chance .  we visited him at eleven  i think  just to check on that  though none of us actually said so but he just acted crazier than ever .    check special knowledge and motive then on dr .  mandel s side .  now  dr .  urth  picture something else .  whoever it was who confronted villiers at midnight  saw him collapse  and scanned his paper  let s keep him anonymous for a moment  must have been terribly startled to see villiers apparently come to life again and to hear him talking into the telephone .  our criminal  in the panic of the moment  realized one thing  he must get rid of the one piece of incriminating material evidence .    he had to get rid of the undeveloped film of the paper and he had to do it in such a way that it would be safe from discovery so that he might pick it up once more if he remained unsuspected .  the outer window sill was ideal .  quickly he threw up villiers  window  placed the strip of film outside  and left .  now  even if villiers survived or if his telephoning brought results  it would be merely villiers  word against his own and it would be easy to show that villiers was unbalanced .    talliaferro paused in something like triumph .  this would be irrefutable .   wendell urth blinked at him and wiggled the thumbs of his clasped hands so that they slapped against his ample shirt front .  he said   and the significance of all that .     the significance is that the window was thrown open and the film placed in open air .  now ryger has lived for ten years on ceres  kaunas on mercury  i on the moon barring short leaves and not many of them .  we commented to one another several times yesterday on the difficulty of growing acclimated to earth .    our work worlds are each airless objects .  we never go out in the open without a suit .  to expose ourselves to unenclosed space is unthinkable .  none of us could have opened the window without a severe inner struggle .  dr .  mandel  however  has lived on earth exclusively .  opening a window to him is only a matter of a bit of muscular exertion .  he could do it .  we couldn t .  ergo  he did it .    talliaferro sat back and smiled a bit .    space  that s it .   cried ryger  with enthusiasm .    that s not it at all   roared mandel  half rising as though tempted to throw himself at talliaferro .   i deny the whole miserable fabrication .  what about the record i have of villiers  phone call .  he used the word  classmate .   the entire tape makes it obvious     he was a dying man   said talliaferro .   much of what he said you admitted was incomprehensible .  i ask you  dr .  mandel  without having heard the tape  if it isn t true that villiers  voice is distorted past recognition .     well   said mandel in confusion .    i m sure it is .  there is no reason to suppose  then  that you might not have rigged up the tape in advance  complete with the damning word  classmate .      mandel said   good lord  how would i know there were classmates at the convention .  how would i know they knew about the mass transference .     villiers might have told you .  i presume he did .     now  look   said mandel   you three saw villiers alive at eleven .  the medical examiner  seeing villiers  body shortly after   a . m .  declared he had been dead at least two hours .  that was certain .  the time of death  therefore  was between    p . m .  and   a . m .  i was at a late conference last night .  i can prove my whereabouts  miles from the hotel  between       and      by a dozen witnesses no one of whom anyone can possibly question .  is that enough for you .    talliaferro paused a moment .  then he went on stubbornly   even so .  suppose you got back to the hotel by      .  you went to villiers  room to discuss his talk .  you found the door open  or you had a duplicate key .  anyway  you found him dead .  you seized the opportunity to scan the paper     and if he were already dead  and couldn t make phone calls  why should i hide the film .     to remove suspicion .  you may have a second copy of the film safe in your possession .  for that matter  we have only your own word that the paper itself was destroyed .     enough .  enough   cried urth .   it is an interesting hypothesis  dr .  talliaferro  but it falls to the ground of its own weight .    talliaferro frowned .   that s your opinion  perhaps     it would be anyone s opinion .  anyone  that is  with the power of human thought .  don t you see that hubert mandel did too much to be the criminal .     no   said talliaferro .   wendell urth smiled benignly .   as a scientist  dr .  talliaferro  you undoubtedly know better than to fall in love with your own theories to the exclusion of facts or reasoning .  do me the pleasure of behaving similarly as a detective .    consider that if dr .  mandel had brought about the death of villiers and faked an alibi  or if he had found villiers dead and taken advantage of that  how little he would really have had to do .  why scan the paper or even pretend that anyone had done so .  he could simply have taken the paper .  who else knew of its existence .  nobody  really .  there is no reason to think villiers told anyone else about it .  villiers was pathologically secretive .  there would have been every reason to think that he told no one .    no one knew villiers was giving a talk  except dr .  mandel .  it wasn t announced .  no abstract was published .  dr .  mandel could have walked off with the paper in perfect confidence .    even if he had discovered that villiers had talked to his classmates about the matter  what of it .  what evidence would his classmates have except the word of one whom they are themselves half willing to consider a madman .    by announcing instead that villiers  paper had been destroyed  by declaring his death to be not entirely natural  by searching for a scanned copy of the film in short by everything dr .  mandel had done he has aroused a suspicion that only he could possibly have aroused when he need only have remained quiet to have committed a perfect crime .  if he were the criminal  he would be more stupid  more colossally obtuse than anyone i have ever known .  and dr .  mandel  after all  is none of that .    talliaferro thought hard but found nothing to say .   ryger said   then who did do it .     one of you three .  that s obvious .     but which .     oh  that s obvious  too .  i knew which of you was guilty the moment dr .  mandel had completed his description of events .    talliaferro stared at the plump extraterrologist with distaste .  the bluff did not frighten him  but it was affecting the other two .  ryger s lips were thrust out and kaunas s lower jaw had relaxed moronically .  they looked like fish  both of them .   he said   which one  then .  tell us .    urth blinked .   first  i want to make it perfectly plain that the important thing is mass transference .  it can still be recovered .    mandel  scowling still  said querulously   what the devil are you talking about  urth .     the man who scanned the paper probably looked at what he was scanning .  i doubt that he had the time or presence of mind to read it  and if he did  i doubt if he could remember it consciously .  however  there is the psychic probe .  if he even glanced at the paper  what impinged on his retina could be probed .    there was an uneasy stir .   urth said at once   no need to be afraid of the probe .  proper handling is safe  particularly if a man offers himself voluntarily .  when damage is done  it is usually because of unnecessary resistance  a kind of mental tearing  you know .  so if the guilty man will voluntarily confess  place himself in my hands      talliaferro laughed .  the sudden noise rang out sharply in the dim quiet of the room .  the psychology was so transparent and artless .   wendell urth looked almost bewildered at the reaction and stared ear   nestly at talliaferro over his glasses .  he said   i have enough influence with the police to keep the probing entirely confidential .    ryger said savagely     didn t do it .    kaunas shook his head .   talliaferro disdained any answer .   urth sighed .   then i will have to point out the guilty man .  it will be traumatic .  it will make things harder .   he tightened the grip on his belly and his fingers twitched .   dr .  talliaferro pointed out that the film was hidden on the outer window sill so that it might remain safe from discovery and from harm .  i agree with him .     thank you   said talliaferro dryly .    however  why should anyone think that an outer window sill is a particularly safe hiding place .  the police would certainly look there .  even in the absence of the police it was . discovered .  who would tend to consider anything outside a building as particularly safe .  obviously  some person who has lived a long time on an airless world and has it drilled into him that no one goes outside an enclosed place without detailed precautions .    to someone on the moon  for instance  anything hidden outside a lunar dome would be comparatively safe .  men venture out only rarely and then only on specific business .  so he would overcome the hardship of opening a window and exposing himself to what he would subconsciously consider a vacuum for the sake of a safe hiding place .  the reflex thought   outside an inhabited structure is safe   would do the trick .    talliaferro said between clenched teeth   why do you mention the moon  dr .  urth .    urth said blandly   only as an example .  what i ve said so far applies to all three of you .  but now comes the crucial point  the matter of the dying night .    talliaferro frowned .   you mean the night villiers died .     i mean any night .  see here  even granted that an outer window sill was a safe hiding place  which of you would be mad enough to consider it a safe hiding place for a piece of unexposed film .  scanner film isn t very sensitive  to be sure  and is made to be developed under all sorts of hit and miss conditions .  diffuse night time illumination wouldn t seriously affect it  but diffuse daylight would ruin it in a few minutes  and direct sunlight would ruin it at once .  everyone knows that .    mandel said   go ahead  urth .  what is this leading to .     you re trying to rush me   said urth  with a massive pout .   i want you to see this clearly .  the criminal wanted  above all  to keep the film safe .  it was his only record of something of supreme value to himself and to the world .  why would he put it where it would inevitably be ruined by the morning sun .   only because he did not expect the morning sun ever to come .  he thought the night  so to speak  was immortal .    but nights aren  t immortal .  on earth  they die and give way to daytime .   even the six month polar night is a dying night eventually .  the nights on ceres last only two hours  the nights on the moon last two weeks .  they are dying nights  too  and dr .  talliaferro and ryger know that day must always come .    kaunas was on his feet .   but wait    wendell urth faced him full .   no longer any need to wait  dr .  kaunas .  mercury is the only sizable object in the solar system that turns only one face to the sun .  even taking libration into account  fully three eighths of its surface is true dark side and never sees the sun .  the polar observatory is at the rim of that dark side .  for ten years  you have grown used to the fact that nights are immortal  that a surface in darkness remains eternally in darkness  and so you entrusted unexposed film to earth s night  forgetting in your excitement that nights must die    kaunas stumbled forward .   wait    urth was inexorable .   i am told that when mandel adjusted the polarizer in villiers  room  you screamed at the sunlight .  was that your ingrained fear of mercurian sun  or your sudden realization of what sunlight meant to your plans .  you rushed forward .  was that to adjust the polarizer or to stare at the ruined film .    kaunas fell to his knees .   i didn t mean it .  i wanted to speak to him  only to speak to him  and he screamed and collapsed .  i thought he was dead and the paper was under his pillow and it all just followed .  one thing led on to another and before i knew it  i couldn t get out of it anymore .  but i meant none of it .  i swear it .    they had formed a semicircle about him and wendell urth stared at the moaning kaunas with pity in his eyes .   an ambulance had come and gone .  talliaferro finally brought himself to say stiffly to mandel   i hope  sir  there will be no hard feelings for anything said here .    and mandel had answered  as stiffly   i think we had all better forget as much as possible of what has happened during the last twenty four hours .    they were standing in the doorway  ready to leave  and wendell urth ducked his smiling head  and said   there s the question of my fee  you know .    mandel looked startled .    not money   said urth at once .   but when the first mass transference setup for humans is established  i want a trip arranged for me .    mandel continued to look anxious .   now  wait .  trips through outer space are a long way off .    urth shook his head rapidly .   not outer space .  not at all .  i would like to step across to lower falls  new hampshire .     all right .  but why .    urth looked up .  to talliaferro s outright surprise  the extra terrologist s face wore an expression compounded of shyness and eagerness .   urth said   i once quite a long time ago knew a girl there .  it s been many years but i sometimes wonder    tm in marsport without hilda  it worked itself out  to begin with  like a dream .  i didn t have to make any arrangement .  i didn t have to touch it .  i just watched things work out .   maybe that s when i should have first smelled catastrophe .   it began with my usual month s layoff between assignments .  a month on and a month off is the right and proper routine for the galactic service .  i reached marsport for the usual three day layover before the short hop to earth .   ordinarily  hilda  god bless her  as sweet a wife as any man ever had  would be there waiting for me and we d have a nice sedate time of it a nice little interlude for the two of us .  the only trouble with that is that marsport is the rowdiest spot in the system  and a nice little interlude isn t exactly what fits in .  only  how do i explain that to hilda  hey .   well  this time  my mother in law  god bless her  for a change  got sick just two days before i reached marsport  and the night before landing  i got a spacegram from hilda saying she would stay on earth with her mother and wouldn t meet me this one time .   i  grammed back my loving regrets and my feverish anxiety concerning her mother and when i landed  there i was     was in marsport without hilda .   that was still nothing  you understand .  it was the frame of the picture  the bones of the woman .  now there was the matter of the lines and coloring inside the frame  the skin and flesh outside the bones .   copyright         by fantasy house  inc .   so i called up flora  flora of certain rare episodes in the past  and for the purpose i used a video booth .   damn the expense  full speed ahead .   i was giving myself ten to one odds she d be out  she d be busy with her videophone disconnected  she d be dead  even .   but she was in  with her videophone connected  and great galaxy  was she anything but dead .   she looked better than ever .  age cannot wither  as somebody or other once said  nor custom stale her infinite variety .   was she glad to see me .  she squealed   max .  it s been years .     i know  flora  but this is it  if you re available .  because guess what .  i m in marsport without hilda .    she squealed again   isn t that nice .  then come on over .    i goggled a bit .  this was too much .   you mean you are available .   you have to understand that flora was never available without plenty of notice .  well  she was that kind of knockout .   she said   oh  i ve got some quibbling little arrangement  max  but i ll take care of that .  you come on over .     i ll come   i said happily .   flora was the kind of girl  well  i tell you  she had her rooms under martian gravity    .   earth normal .  the gadget to free her of marsport s pseudo grav field was expensive of course  but if you ve ever held a girl in your arms at   .   gees  you need no explanation .  if you haven t  explanations will do no good .  i m also sorry for you .   talk about floating on clouds .   i closed connections  and only the prospect of seeing it all in the flesh could have made me wipe out the image with such alacrity .  i stepped out of the booth .   and at that point  that precise point  that very split instant of time  the first whiff of catastrophe nudged itself up to me .   that first whiff was the bald head of that lousy rog crinton of the mars offices  gleaming over a headful of pale blue eyes  pale yellow complexion  and pale brown mustache .  i didn t bother getting on all fours and beating my forehead against the ground because my vacation had started the minute i had gotten off the ship .   so i said with only normal politeness   what do you want and i m in a hurry .  i ve got an appointment .    he said   you ve got an appointment with me .  i was waiting for you at the unloading desk .    i said   i didn t see you    he said   you didn t see anything .    he was right at that  for  come to think of it  if he was at the unloading desk  he must have been spinning ever since because i went past that desk like halley s comet skimming the solar corona .   i said   all right .  what do you want .     i ve got a little job for you .    i laughed .   it s my month off  friend .    he said   red emergency alert  friend .    which meant  no vacation  just like that .  i couldn t believe it .  i said   nuts  rog .  have a heart .  i got an emergency alert of my own .     nothing like this .     rog   i yelled   can t you get someone else .  anyone else .     you re the only class a agent on mars .     send to earth  then .  they stack agents like micro pile units at headquarters .     this has got to be done before    p . m .  what s the matter .  you haven t got three hours .    i grabbed my head .  the boy just didn t know .  i said   let me make a call  will you .    i stepped back into the booth  glared at him  and said   private .    flora shone on the screen again  like a mirage on an asteroid .  she said   something wrong  max .  don t say something s wrong .  i canceled my other engagement .    i said   flora  baby  i ll be there .  i ll be there .  but something s come up .    she asked the natural question in a hurt tone of voice and i said   no .  not another girl .  with you in the same town they don t make any other girls .  females  maybe .  not girls .  baby .  honey .    i had a wild impulse but hugging  vision screen is no pastime for a grown man .    it s business .  just hold on .  it won t take long .    she said   all right   but she said it kind of like it was just enough not all right so that i got the shivers .   i stepped out of the booth and said   all right  rog  what kind of mess have you cooked up for me .    we went into the spaceport bar and got us an insulated booth .  he said   the antares giant is coming in from sirius in exactly half an hour  at   p . m .  local time .     okay .     three men will get out  among others  and will wait for the space eater coming in from earth at    p . m .  and leaving for capella some time thereafter .  the three men will get on the space eater and will then be out of our jurisdiction .     so .     so between      and        they will be in a special waiting room and you will be with them .  i have a trimensional image of each for you so you ll know which they are and which is which .  you have between      and       to decide which one of the three is carrying contraband .     what kind of contraband .     the worst kind .  altered spaceoline .     altered spaceoline .    he had thrown me .  i knew what spaceoline was .  if you ve been on a space hop you know  too .  and in case you re earth bound yourself the bare fact is that everyone needs it on the first space trip  almost everybody needs it for the first dozen trips  lots need it every trip .  without it  there is vertigo associated with free fall  screaming terrors  semi permanent psychoses .  with it  there is nothing  no one minds a thing .  and it isn t habit forming  it has no adverse side effects .  spaceoline is ideal  essential  unsubstitutable .  when in doubt  take spaceoline .   rog said   that s right  altered spaceoline .  it can be changed chemically by a very simple reaction that can be conducted in anyone s basement into a drug that will give one giant size charge and become your baby blue habit the first time .  it is on a par with the most dangerous alkaloids we know .     and we just found out about it .     no .  the service has known about it for years  and we ve kept others from knowing by squashing every discovery flat .  only now the discovery has gone too far .     in what way .     one of the men who will be stopping over at this spaceport is carrying some of the altered spaceoline on his person .  chemists in the capellan system  which is outside the federation  will analyze it and set up ways of synthesizing more .  after that  it s either fight the worst drug menace we ve ever seen or suppress the matter by suppressing the source .     you mean spaceoline .     right .  and if we suppress spaceoline  we suppress space travel .    i decided to put my finger on the point .   which one of the three has it .    rog smiled nastily   if we knew  would we need you .  you re to find out which of the three .     you re calling on me for a lousy frisk job .     touch the wrong one at the risk of a haircut down to the larynx .  every one of the three is a big man on his own planet .  one is edward harponaster  one is joaquin lipsky  and one is andiamo ferrucci .  well .    he was right .  i d heard of every one of them .  chances are you have  too  and not one was touchable without proof in advance  as you know .  i said   would one of them touch a dirty deal like     there are trillions involved   said rog   which means any one of the three would .  and one of them is  because jack hawk got that far before he was killed     jack hawk s dead .   for a minute  i forgot about the galactic drug menace .  for a minute  i nearly forgot about flora .    right  and one of those guys arranged the killing .  now you find out which .  you put the finger on the right one before       and there s a promotion  a raise in pay  a pay back for poor jack hawk  and a rescue of the galaxy .  you put the finger on the wrong one and there ll be a nasty interstel   lar situation and you ll be out on your ear and also on every black list from here to antares and back .    i said   suppose i don t finger anybody .     that would be like fingering the wrong one as far as the service is concerned .     i ve got to finger someone but only the right one or my head s handed to me .     in thin slices .  you re beginning to understand me  max .    in a long lifetime of looking ugly  rog crinton had never looked uglier .  the only comfort i got out of staring at him was the realization that he was married  too  and that he lived with his wife at marsport all year round .  and does he deserve that .  maybe i m hard on him  but he deserves it .   i put in a quick call to flora  as soon as rog was out of sight .   she said   well .    i said   baby  honey  it s something i can t talk about  but i ve got to do it  see .  now you hang on  i ll get it over with if i have to swim the grand canal to the icecap in my underwear  see .  if i have to claw phobos out of the sky .  if i have to cut myself in pieces and mail myself parcel post .     gee   she said   if i thought i was going to have to wait    i winced .  she just wasn t the type to respond to poetry .  actually  she was a simple creature of action  but after all  if i was going to be drifting through low gravity in a sea of jasmine perfume with flora  poetry response is not the type of qualification i would consider most indispensable .   i said urgently   just hold on  flora .  i won t be any time at all .  i ll make it up to you .    i was annoyed  sure  but i wasn t worried as yet .  rog hadn t more than left me when i figured out exactly how i was going to tell the guilty man from the others .   it was easy .  i should have called rog back and told him  but there s no law against wanting egg in your beer and oxygen in your air .  it would take me five minutes and then off i would go to flora  a little late  maybe  but with a promotion  a raise  and a slobbering kiss from the service on each cheek .   you see  it s like this .  big industrialists don t go space hopping much  they use trans video reception .  when they do go to some ultra high interstellar conference  as these three were probably going  they take spaceoline .  for one thing  they don t have enough hops under their belt to risk doing without .  for another  spaceoline is the expensive way of doing it and industrialists do things the expensive way .  i know their psychology .   now that would hold for two of them .  the one who carried contraband  however  couldn t risk spaceoline even to prevent space sickness .  under spaceoline influence  he could throw the drug away  or give it away  or talk gibberish about it .  he would have to stay in control of himself .   it was as simple as that  so i waited .   the antares giant was on time and i waited with my leg muscles tense for a quick take off as soon as i collared the murdering drug toting rat and sped the two eminent captains of industry on their way .   they brought in lipsky first .  he had thick  ruddy lips  rounded jowls  very dark eyebrows  and graying hair .  he just looked at me and sat down .  nothing .  he was under spaceoline .   i said   good evening  sir .    he said  in a dreamy voice   surrealismus of panamy hearts in three quarter time for a cup of coffeedom of speech .    that was spaceoline all the way .  the buttons in the human mind were set free swing .  each syllable suggests the next in free association .   andiamo ferrucci came in next .  bkck mustache  long and waxed  olive complexion  pock marked face .  he took a seat in another chair  facing us .   i said   nice trip .    he said   trip the light fantastic tock the clock is growings on the bird .    lipsky said   bird to the wise guyed book to all places every body .    i grinned .  that left harponaster .  i had my needle gun neatly palmed out of sight and the magnetic coil ready to grip him .   and then harponaster came in .  he was thin  leathery  near bald and rather younger than he seemed in his trimensional image .  and he was spaceolined to the gills .   i said   damn .    harponaster said   damyankee note speech to his last time i saw wood you say so .    ferrucci said   sow the seed the territory under dispute do well to come along long road to a nightingale .    lipsky said   gay lords hopping pong balls .    i stared from one to the other as the nonsense ran down in shorter and shorter spurts and then silence .   i got the picture  all right .  one of them was faking .  he had thought ahead and realized that omitting the spaceoline would be a giveaway .  he might have bribed an official into injecting saline or dodged it some other way .   one of them must be faking .  it wasn t hard to fake the thing .  comedians on sub etheric had a spaceoline skit regularly .  you ve heard them .   i stared at them and got the first prickle at the base of my skull that said  what if you don t finger the right one .   it was      and there was my job  my reputation  my head growing rickety upon my neck to be considered .  i saved it all for later and thought of flora .  she wasn t going to wait for me forever .  for that matter  chances were she wouldn t wait for half an hour .   i wondered .  could the faker keep up free association if nudged gently onto dangerous territory .   i said   the floor s covered with a nice solid rug  and ran the last two words together to make it  soli drug .    lipsky said   drug from underneath the dough re mi fa sol to be saved .    ferrucci said   saved and a haircut above the common herd something about younicorny as a harmonican the cheek by razor and shine .    harponaster said   shiner wind nor snow use trying to by four ever and effervescence and sensibilityter totter .    lipsky said   totters and rags .    ferrucci said   ragsactly .    harponaster said   acth mation .    a few grunts and they ran down .   i tried again and i didn t forget to be careful .  they would remember everything i said afterward and what i said had to be harmless .  i said   this is a darned good space line .    ferrucci said   lines and tigers through the prairie dogs do bark of the bough wough      interrupted  looking at harponaster   a darned good space line .     line the bed and rest a little black sheepishion of wrong the clothes of a perfect day .    i interrupted again  glaring at lipsky   good space line .     liron is hot chocolate ain t gonna be the same on you vee and double the stakes and potatoes and heel .    some one else said   heel the sicknecessaryd and write will wincetance .     tance with mealtime .     i m comingle .      inglish .     ishter seals .     eels .    i tried a few more times and got nowhere .  the faker  whichever he was  had practiced or had natural talents at talking free association .  he was disconnecting his brain and letting the words come out any old way .  and he must be inspired by knowing exactly what i was after .  if  drug  hadn t given it away   space line  three times repeated must have .  i was safe with the other two  but he would know .    and he was having fun with me .  all three were saying phrases that might have pointed to a deep inner guilt   sol to be saved    little black sheepishion of wrong    drug from underneath   and so on  .  two were saying such things helplessly  randomly .  the third was amusing himself .   so how did i find the third .  i was in a feverish thrill of hatred against him and my fingers twitched .  the rat was subverting the galaxy .  more than than  he had killed my colleague and friend .  more than that  he was keeping me from flora .   i could go up to each of them and start searching .  the two who were really under spaceoline would make no move to stop me .  they could feel no  emotion  no fear  no anxiety  no hate  no passion  no desire for self defense .  and if one made the slightest gesture of resistance i would have my man .   but the innocent ones would remember afterward .  they would remember a personal search while under spaceoline .   i sighed .  if i tried it  i would get the criminal all right but later i would be the nearest thing to chopped liver any man had ever been .  there would be a shake up in the service  a big stink the width of the galaxy  and in the excitement and disorganization  the secret of altered spaceoline would get out anyway and so what the hell .   of course  the one i wanted might be the first one i touched .  one chance out of three .  i d have one out and only god can make a three .   nuts  something had started them going while i was muttering to myself and spaceoline is contagioust a gigolo my  oh   i stared desperately at my watch and my line of sight focused on      .   where the devil was time going to .   oh  my  oh  nuts  oh  flora .   i had no choice .  i made my way to the booth for another quick call to flora .  just a quick one  you understand  to keep things alive  assuming they weren t dead already .   i kept saying to myself  she won t answer .   i tried to prepare myself for that .  there were other girls  there were other   what s the use  there were no other girls .   if hilda had been in marsport  i never would have had flora on my mind in the first place and it wouldn t have mattered .  but i was in marsport without hilda and i had made a date with flora .   the signal was signaling and signaling and i didn t dare break off .   answer .  answer .   she answered .  she said   it s you .     of course  sweetheart  who else would it be .     lots of people .  someone who would come .     there s just this little detail of business  honey .     what business .  plastons for who .    i almost corrected her grammar but i was too busy wondering what this plastons kick was .   then i remembered .  i told her once i was a plaston salesman .  that was the time i brought her a plaston nightgown that was a honey .   i said   look .  just give me another half hour    her eyes grew moist .   i m sitting here all by myself .     i ll make it up to you .   to show you how desperate i was getting  i was definitely beginning to think along paths that could lead only to jewelry even though a sizable dent in the bankbook would show up to hilda s  piercing eye like the horsehead nebula interrupting the milky way .  but then i was desperate .   she said   i had a perfectly good date and i broke it off .    i protested   you said it was a quibbling little arrangement .    that was a mistake .  i knew it the minute i said it .   she shrieked   quibbling little arrangement .    it was what she had said .  it was what she had said .  but having the truth on your side just makes it worse in arguing with a woman .  don t i know .    you call a man who s promised me an estate on earth    she went on and on about that estate on earth .  there wasn t a gal in marsport who wasn t wangling for an estate on earth  and you could count the number who got one on the sixth finger of either hand .   i tried to stop her .  no use .   she finally said   and here i am all alone  with nobody   and broke off contact .   well  she was right .  i felt like the lowest heel in the galaxy .   i went back into the reception room .  a flunky outside the door saluted me in .   i stared at the three industrialists and speculated on the order in which i would slowly choke each to death if i could but receive choking orders .  harponaster first  maybe .  he had a thin  stringy neck that the fingers could go round neatly and a sharp adam s apple against which the thumbs could find purchase .   it cheered me up infinitesimally  to the point where i mustered   boy .   just out of sheer longing  though it was no boy i was longing for .   it started them off at once .  ferrucci said   boyl the watern the spout you goateeming rain over us  god savior pennies    harponaster of the scrawny neck added   nies and nephew don t like orporalley cat .    lipsky said   cattle corral go down off a ductilitease drunk .     drunkle aunterior passagewayt a while .     while beasts oh pray .     prayties grow .     grow way .     waiter .     terble .     ble .    then nothing .   they stared at me .  i stared at them .  they were empty of emotion  or two were  and i was empty of ideas .  and time passed .   i stared at them some more and thought about flora .  it occurred to me that i had nothing to lose that i had not already lost .  i might as well talk about her .   i said   gentlemen  there is a girl in this town whose name i will not mention for fear of compromising her .  let me describe her to you  gentlemen .    and i did .  if i say so myself  the last two hours had honed me to such a fine force field edge that the description of flora took on a kind of poetry that seemed to be coming from some wellspring of masculine force deep in the subbasement of my unconscious .   and they sat frozen  almost as though they were listening  and hardly ever interrupting .  people under spaceoline have a kind of politeness about them .  they won t speak when someone else is speaking .  that s why they take turns .   i kept it up with a kind of heartfelt sadness in my voice until the loudspeaker announced in stirring tones the arrival of the space eater .   that was that .  i said in a loud voice   rise  gentlemen .     not you  you murderer   and my magnetic coil was on ferrucci s wrist before he could breathe twice .   ferrucci fought like a demon .  he was under no spaceoline influence .  they found the altered spaceoline in thin flesh colored plastic pads hugging the inner surface of his thighs .  you couldn t see it at all  you could only feel it  and even then it took a knife to make sure .   afterward  rog crinton  grinning and half insane with relief  held me by the lapel with a death grip .   how did you do it .  what gave it away .    i said  trying to pull loose   one of them was faking a spaceoline jag .    was sure of it .  so i told them    i grew cautious none of his business as to the details  you know    .   .   .  uh  about a girl  see  and two of them never reacted  so they were spaceolined .  but ferrucci s breathing speeded up and the beads of sweat came out on his forehead .  i gave a pretty dramatic rendition  and he reacted  so he was under no spaceoline .  now will you let me go .    he let go and i almost fell over backward .   i was set to take off .  my feet were pawing the ground without any instruction from me but then i turned back .    hey  rog   i said   can you sign me a chit for a thousand credits without its going on the record for services rendered to the service .    that s when i realized he was half insane with relief and very temporary gratitude  because he said   sure  max  sure .  ten thousand credits if you want .     i want   i said  grabbing him for a change .     want .  i want .    he filled out an official service chit for ten thousand credits  good as cash anywhere in half the galaxy .  he was actually grinning as he gave it to me and you can bet i was grinning as i took it .   how he intended accounting for it was his affair  the point was that   wouldn t have to account for it to hilda .     stood in the booth  one last time  signaling flora .  i didn t dare let matters go till i reached her place .  the additional half hour might just give her time to get someone else  if she hadn t already .   make her answer .  make her answer .  make her   she answered  but she was in formal clothes .  she was going out and i had obviously caught her by two minutes .    i am going out   she announced .   some men can be decent .  and i do not wish to see you in the henceforward .    do not wish ever to find my eyes upon you .  you will do me a great favor  mister whoeveryouare  if you unhand my signal combination and never pollute it with    i wasn t saying anything .  i was just standing there holding my breath and also holding the chit up where she could see it .  just standing there .  just holding .   sure enough  at the word  pollute  she came in for a closer look .  she wasn t much on education  that girl  but she could read  ten thousand credits  faster than any college graduate in the solar system .   she said   max .  for me .     all for you  baby   i said   i told you i had a little business to do .  i wanted to surprise you .     oh  max  that s sweet of you .  i didn t really mind .  i was joking .  now you come right here to me .   she took off her coat .  fi  what about your date .   i said .      i said i was joking   she said .      i m coming   i said faintly .  i    with every single one of those credits now   she said roguishly .    with every single one   i said .     i broke contact  stepped out of the booth  and now  finally  i was set   .  . set   i heard my name called .   max .  max .   someone was running toward me .   rog crinton said i would find you here .  mamma s all right after all  so i got special passage on the space eater and what s this about ten thousand credits .    i didn t turn .  i said   hello  hilda .    and then i turned and did the hardest thing i ever succeeded in doing in  . all my good for nothing  space hopping life .   i managed to smile .   the gentle vultures  for fifteen years now  the hurrians had maintained their base on the other side of the moon .   it was unprecedented  unheard of .  no human had dreamed it possible to be delayed so long .  the decontamination squads had been ready  ready and waiting for fifteen years  ready to swoop down through the radioactive clouds and save what might be saved for the remnant of survivors .   in return  of course  for fair payment .   but fifteen times the planet had revolved about its sun .  during each revolution  the satellite had rotated not quite thirteen times about the primary .  and in all that time the nuclear war had not come .   nuclear bombs were exploded by the large primate intelligences at various points on the planet s surface .  the planet s stratosphere had grown amazingly warm with radioactive refuse .  but still no war .   devi en hoped ardently that he would be replaced .  he was the fourth captain in charge of this colonizing expedition  if it could still be called so after fifteen years of suspended animation  and he was quite content that there should be a fifth .  now that the home world was sending an arch administrator to make a personal survey of the situation  his replacement might come soon .  good .   he stood on the surface of the moon  encased in his space suit  and thought of home  of hurria .  his long  thin arms moved restlessly with the thought  as though aching  through millions of years of instinct  for the ancestral trees .  he stood only three feet high .  what could be seen of him  copyright         by headline publications  inc .   through the glass fronted head plate was a black and wrinkled face with the fleshy  mobile nose dead centered .  the little tuft of fine beard was a pure white in contrast .  in the rear of the suit  just below center  was the bulge within which the short and stubby hurrian tail might rest comfortably .   devi en took his appearance for granted  of course  but was well aware of the difference between the hurrians and all the other intelligences in the galaxy .  the hurrians alone were so small  they alone were tailed  they alone were vegetarians they alone had escaped the inevitable nuclear war that had ruined every other known intelligent species .   he stood on the walled plain that extended for so many miles that the raised and circular rim  which on hurria would have been called a crater  if it were smaller  was invisible beyond the horizon .  against the southern edge of the rim  where there was always some protection against the direct rays of the sun  a city had grown .  it had begun as a temporary camp  of course  but with the years  women had been brought in  and children had been born in it .  now there were schools and elaborate hydroponics establishments  large water reservoirs  all that went with a city on an airless world .   it was ridiculous .  all because one planet had nuclear weapons and would not fight a nuclear war .   the arch administrator  who would be arriving soon  would undoubtedly ask  almost at once  the same question that devi en had asked himself a wearisome number of times .   why had there not been a nuclear war .   devi en watched the hulking mauvs preparing the ground now for the landing  smoothing out the unevennesses and laying down the ceramic bed designed to absorb the hyperatomic field thrusts with minimum discomfort to the passengers within the ship .   even in their space suits  the mauvs seemed to exude power  but it was the power of muscle only .  beyond them was the little figure of a hurrian giving orders  and the docile mauvs obeyed .  naturally .   the mauvian race  of all the large primate intelligences  paid their fees in the most unusual coin  a quota of themselves  rather than of material goods .  it was a surprisingly useful tribute  better than steel  aluminum  or fine drugs in many ways .   devi en s receiver stuttered to life .   the ship is sighted  sir   came the report .   it will be landing within the hour .     very good   said devi en .   have my car made ready to take me to the ship as soon as landing is initiated .    he did not feel that it was very good at all .   the arch administrator came  flanked by a personal retinue of five mauvs .  they entered the city with him  one on each side  three following .  they helped him off with his space suit  then removed their own .   their thinly haired bodies  their large  coarse featured faces  their broad  noses and flat cheekbones were repulsive but not frightening .  though twice the height of the hurrians and more than twice the breadth  there was a blankness about their eyes  something completely submissive about the way they stood  with their thick sinewed necks slightly bent  their bulging arms hanging listlessly .   the arch administrator dismissed them and they trooped out .  he did not really need their protection  of course  but his position required a retinue of five and that was that .   no business was discussed during the meal or during the almost endless ritual of welcome .  at a time that might have been more appropriate for sleeping  the arch administrator passed small fingers through his tuft of beard and said   how much longer must we wait for this planet  captain .    he was visibly advancing in age .  the hair on his upper arms was grizzled and the tufts at the elbows were almost as white as his beard .    i cannot say  your height   said devi en humbly .   they have not followed the path .     that is obvious .  the point is  why have they not followed the path .  it is clear to the council that your reports promise more than they deliver .  you talk of theories but you give no details .  now we are tired of all this back on hurria .  if you know of anything you have not told us  now is the time to talk of it .     the matter  your height  is hard to prove .  we have had no experience of spying on a people over such an extended period .  until recently  we weren t watching for the right things .  each year we kept expecting the nuclear war the year after and it is only in my time as captain that we have taken to studying the people more intensively .  it is at least one benefit of the long waiting time that we have learned some of their principal languages .     indeed .  without even landing on their planet .    devi en explained .   a number of radio messages were recorded by those of our ships that penetrated the planetary atmosphere on observation missions  particularly in the early years .  i set our linguistics computers to work on them  and for the last year i have been attempting to make sense out of it ail the arch administrator stared .  his bearing was such that any outright exclamation of surprise would have been superfluous .   and have you learned anything of interest .     i may have  your height  but what i have worked out is so strange and the underpinning of actual evidence is so uncertain that i dared not speak of it officially in my reports .    the arch administrator understood .  he said  stiffly   would you object to explaining your views unofficially to me .     i would be glad to   said devi en at once .   the inhabitants of this planet are  of course  large primate in nature .  and they are competitive .    the other blew out his breath in a kind of relief and passed his tongue quickly over his nose .   i had the queer notion   he muttered   that they might not be competitive and that that might  but go on  go on .     they are competitive   devi en assured him .   much more so than one would expect on the average .     then why doesn t everything else follow .     up to a point it does  your height .  after the usual long incubation period  they began to mechanize  and after that  the usual large primate killings became truly destructive warfare .  at the conclusion of the most recent large scale war  nuclear weapons were developed and the war ended at once .    the arch administrator nodded .   and then .    devi en said   what should have happened was that a nuclear war ought to have begun shortly afterward and in the course of the war  nuclear weapons would have developed quickly in destructiveness  have been used nevertheless in typical large primate fashion  and have quickly reduced the population to starving remnants in a ruined world .     of course  but that didn t happen .  why not .    devi en said   there is one point .  i believe these people  once mechanization started  developed at an unusually high rate .     and if so .   said the other .   does that matter .  they reached nuclear weapons the more quickly .     true .  but after the most recent general war  they continued to develop nuclear weapons at an unusual rate .  that s the trouble .  the deadly potential had increased before the nuclear war had a chance to start and now it has reached a point where even large primate intelligences dare not risk a war .    the arch administrator opened his small black eyes wide .   but that is impossible .  i don t care how technically talented these creatures are .  military science advances rapidly only during a war .     perhaps that is not true in the case of these particular creatures .  but even if it were  it seems they are having a war  not a real war  but a war .     not a real war  but a war   repeated the arch administrator blankly .   what does that mean .     i m not sure .   devi en wiggled his nose in exasperation .   this is where my attempts to draw logic out of the scattered material we have picked up is least satisfactory .  this planet has something called a cold war .  whatever it is  it drives them furiously onward in research and yet it does not involve complete nuclear destruction .    the arch administrator said   impossible .    devi en said   there is the planet .  here we are .  we have been waiting fifteen years .    the arch administrator s long arms came up and crossed over his head and down again to the opposite shoulders .   then there is only one thing to do .  the council has considered the possibility that the planet may have  achieved a stalemate  a kind of uneasy peace that balances just short of a nuclear war .  something of the sort you describe  though no one suggested the actual reasons you advance .  but it s something we can t allow .     no  your height .     no   he seemed almost in pain .   the longer the stalemate continues  the greater the possibility that large primate individuals may discover the methods of interstellar travel .  they will leak out into the galaxy  in full competitive strength .  you see .     then .    the arch administrator hunched his head deeper into his arms  as though not wishing to hear what he himself must say .  his voice was a little muffled .   if they are balanced precariously  we must push them a little  captain .  we must push them .    devi en s stomach churned and he suddenly tasted his dinner once more in the back of his throat .   push them  your height .   he didn t want to understand .   but the arch administrator put it bluntly   we must help them start their nuclear war .   he looked as miserably sick as devi en felt .  he whispered   we must .    devi en could scarcely speak .  he said  in a whisper   but how could such a thing be done  your height .     i don t know how .   and do not look at me so .  it is not my decision .  it is the decision of the council .  surely you understand what would happen to the galaxy if a large primate intelligence were to enter space in full strength without having been tamed by nuclear war .    devi en shuddered at the thought .  all that competitiveness loosed on the galaxy .  he persisted though .   but how does one start a nuclear war .  how is it done .     i don t know  i tell you .  but there must be some way  perhaps a a message we might send or a a crucial rainstorm we might start by cloud seeding .  we could manage a great deal with their weather conditions     how would that start a nuclear war .   said devi en  unimpressed .    maybe it wouldn t .  i mention such a thing only as a possible example .  but large primates would know .  after all  they are the ones who do start nuclear wars in actual fact .  it is in their brain pattern to know .  that is the decision the council came to .    devi en felt the soft noise his tail made as it thumped slowly against the chair .  he tried to stop it and failed .   what decision  your height .     to trap a large primate from the planet s surface .  to kidnap one .     a wild one .     it s the only kind that exists at the moment on the planet .  of course  a wild one .     and what do you expect him to tell us .     that doesn t matter  captain .  as long as he says enough about anything  mentalic analysis will give us the answer .    devi en withdrew his head as far as he could into the space between his shoulder blades .  the skin just under his armpits quivered with repulsion .  a wild large primate being .  he tried to picture one  untouched by the stunning aftermath of nuclear war  unaltered by the civilizing influence of hur rian eugenic breeding .   the arch administrator made no attempt to hide the fact that he shared the repulsion  but he said   you will have to lead the trapping expedition  captain .  it is for the good of the galaxy .    devi en had seen the planet a number of times before but each time a ship swung about the moon and placed the world in his line of sight a wave of unbearable homesickness swept him .   it was a beautiful planet  so like hurria itself in dimensions and characteristics but wilder and grander .  the sight of it  after the desolation of the moon  was like a blow .   how many other planets like it were on hurrian master listings at this moment  he wondered .  how many other planets were there concerning which meticulous observers had reported seasonal changes in appearance that could be interpreted only as being caused by artificial cultivation of food plants .  how many times in the future would a day come when the radioactivity in the stratosphere of one of these planets would begin to climb  when colonizing squadrons would have to be sent out at once .    as they were to this planet .   it was almost pathetic  the confidence with which the hurrians had proceeded at first .  devi en could have laughed as he read through those initial reports  if he weren t trapped in this project himself now .  the hurrian scoutships had moved close to the planet to gather geographical information  to locate population centers .  they were sighted  of course  but what did it matter .  any time  now  they thought  the final explosion .   any time  but useless years passed and the scoutships wondered if they ought not to be cautious .  they moved back .   devi en s ship was cautious now .  the crew was on edge because of the unpleasantness of the mission  not all devi en s assurances that there was no harm intended to the large primate could quite calm them .  even so  they could not hurry matters .  it had to be over a fairly deserted and uncultivated tract of uneven ground that they hovered .  they stayed at a height of ten miles for days  while the crew became edgier and only the ever stolid mauvs maintained calm .   then the scope showed them a creature  alone on the uneven ground  a long staff in one hand  a pack across the upper portion of his back .   they lowered silently  supersonically .  devi en himself  skin crawling  was at the controls .   the creature was heard to say two definite things before he was taken  and they were the first comments recorded for use in mentalic computing .   the first  when the large primate caught sight of the ship almost upon him  was picked up by the direction telemike .  it was   my god .  a flying saucer .    devi en understood the second phrase .  that was a term for the hurrian ships that had grown common among the large primates those first careless years .   the second remark was made when the wild creature was brought into the ship  struggling with amazing strength  but helpless in the iron grip of the unperturbed mauvs .   devi en  panting  with his fleshy nose quivering slightly  advanced to receive him  and the creature  whose unpleasantly hairless face had become oily with some sort of fluid secretion  yelled   holy toledo  a monkey .    again  devi en understood the second part .  it was the word for little primate in one of the chief languages of the planet .   the wild creature was almost impossible to handle .  he required infinite patience before he could be spoken to reasonably .  at first  there was nothing but a series of crises .  the creature realized almost at once that he was being taken off earth  and what devi en thought might prove an exciting experience for him  proved nothing of the sort .  he talked instead of his offspring and of a large primate female .    they have wives and children  thought devi en  compassionately  and  in their way  love them  for all they are large primate .    then he had to be made to understand that the mauvs who kept him under guard and who restrained him when his violence made that necessary would not hurt him  that he was not to be damaged in any way .    devi en was sickened at the thought that one intelligent being might be damaged by another .  it was very difficult to discuss the subject  even if only to admit the possibility long enough to deny it .  the creature from the planet treated the very hesitation with great suspicion .  it was the way the large primates were .    on the fifth day  when out of sheer exhaustion  perhaps  the creature remained quiet over a fairly extended period  they talked in devi en s private quarters  and suddenly he grew angry again when the hurrian first explained  matter of factly  that they were waiting for a nuclear war .    waiting .   cried the creature .   what makes you so sure there will be one .    devi en wasn t sure  of course  but he said   there is always a nuclear var .  it is our purpose to help you afterward .     help us afterward .   his words grew incoherent .  he waved his arms violently  and the mauvs who flanked him had to restrain him gentry once again and lead him away .   devi en sighed .  the creature s remarks were building in quantity and perhaps mentalics could do something with them .  his own unaided mind could make nothing of them .   and meanwhile the creature was not thriving .  his body was almost completely hairless  a fact that long distance observation had not revealed owing to the artificial skins worn by them .  this was either for warmth or because of an instinctive repulsion even on the part of these particular large primates themselves for hairless skin .   it might be an interesting subject to take up .  mentalics computation could make as much out of one set of remarks as another .    strangely enough  the creature s face had begun to sprout hair  more  in fact  than the hurrian face had  and of a darker color .   but still  the central fact was that he was not thriving .  he had grown thinner because he was eating poorly  and if he was kept too long  his health might suffer .  devi en had no wish to feel responsible for that .   on the next day  the large primate seemed quite calm .  he talked almost eagerly  bringing the subject around to nuclear warfare almost at once .   it had a terrible attraction for the large primate mind  devi en thought .    the creature said   you said nuclear wars always happen .  does that mean there are other people than yours and mine and theirs .   he indicated the near by mauvs .    there are thousands of intelligent species  living on thousands of worlds .  many thousands   said devi en .    and they all have nuclear wars .     all who have reached a certain stage of technology .  all but us .  we were different .  we lacked competitiveness .  we had the co operative instinct .     you mean you know that nuclear wars will happen and you do nothing about it .     we do   said devi en  pained .   of course  we do .  we try to help .  in the early history of my people  when we first developed space travel  we did not understand large primates .  they repelled our attempts at friendship and we stopped trying .  then we found worlds in radioactive ruins .  finally  we found one world actually in the process of a nuclear war .  we were horrified  but could do nothing .  slowly  we learned .  we are ready  now  at every world we discover to be at the nuclear stage .  we are ready with decontamination   equipment and eugenic analyzers .     what are eugenic analyzers .    devi en had manufactured the phrase by analogy with what he knew of the wild one s language .  now he said carefully   we direct matings and sterilizations to remove  as far as possible  the competitive element in the remnant of the survivors .    for a moment  he thought the creature would grow violent again .   instead  the other said in a monotone   you make them docile  you mean  like these things .   once again he indicated the mauvs .    no .  no .  these are different .  we simply make it possible for the remnants to be content with a peaceful  nonexpanding  nonaggressive society under our guidance .  without this  they destroyed themselves  you see  and without it  they would destroy themselves again .     what do you get out of it .    devi en stared at the creature dubiously .  was it really necessary to explain the basic pleasure of life .  he said   don t you enjoy helping someone .     come on .  besides that .  what s in it for you .     of course  there are contributions to hurria .     ha .     payment for saving a species is only fair   protested devi en   and there are expenses to be covered .  the contribution is not much and is adjusted to the nature of the world .  it may be an annual supply of wood from a forested world  manganese salts from another .  the world of these mauvs is poor in physical resources and they themselves offered to supply us with a number of individuals to use as personal assistants .  they are extremely powerful even for large primates and we treat them painlessly with anticerebral drugs     to make zombies out of them .    devi en guessed at the meaning of the noun and said indignantly   not at all .  merely to make them content with their role as personal servant and forgetful of their homes .  we would not want them to be unhappy .  they are intelligent beings .     and what would you do with earth if we had a war .     we have had fifteen years to decide that   said devi en .   your world is very rich in iron and has developed a fine steel technology .  steel  i think  would be your contribution .   he sighed   but the contribution would not make up for our expense in this case  i think .  we have overwaited now by ten years at least .    the large primate said   how many races do you tax in this way .     i do not know the exact number .  certainly more than a thousand .     then you re the little landlords of the galaxy  are you .  a thousand worlds destroy themselves in order to contribute to your welfare .  you re something else  too  you know .   the wild one s voice was rising  growing shrill .   you re vultures .     vultures .   said devi en  trying to place the word .    carrion eaters .  birds that wait for some poor creature to die of thirst in the desert and then come down to eat the body .    devi en felt himself turn faint and sick at the picture conjured up for him .  he said weakly   no  no  we help the species .     you wait for the war to happen like vultures .  if you want to help  prevent the war .  don t save the remnants .  save them all .    devi en s tail twitched with sudden excitement .   how do we prevent a  war .  will you tell me that .    what was prevention of war but the reverse of bringing about a war .  learn one process and surely the other would be obvious .    but the wild one faltered .  he said finally   get down there .  explain the situation .    devi en felt keen disappointment .  that didn t help .  besides  he said   land among you .  quite impossible .   his skin quivered in half a dozen places at the thought of mingling with the wild ones in their untamed billions .   perhaps the sick look on devi en s face was so pronounced and unmistakable that the wild one could recognize it for what it was even across the barrier of species .  he tried to fling himself at the human and had to be caught virtually in mid air by one of the mauvs  who held him immobile with an effortless constriction of biceps .   the wild one screamed .   no .  just sit here and wait .  vulture .  vulture .  vulture .    it was days before devi en could bring himself to see the wild one again .  he was almost brought to disrespect of the arch administrator when the latter insisted that he lacked sufficient data for a complete analysis of the mental make up of these wild ones .   devi en said boldly   surely  there is enough to give some solution to our question .    the arch administrator s nose quivered and his pink tongue passed over it meditatively .   a solution of a kind  perhaps .  i can t trust this solution .  we are facing a very unusual species .  we know that already .  we can t afford to make mistakes .   one thing  at least .  we have happened upon a highly intelligent one .  unless unless he is at his race s norm .   the arch administrator seemed upset at that thought .   devi en said   the creature brought up the horrible picture of that that bird that     vulture   said the arch administrator .    it put our entire mission into such a distorted light .  i have not been able to eat properly since  or sleep .  in fact  i am afraid i will have to ask to be relieved     not before we have completed what we have set out to do   said the arch administrator firmly .   do you think i enjoy the picture of of carrion eat  you must collect more data .    devi en nodded finally .  he understood  of course .  the arch administrator was no more anxious to cause a nuclear war than any human would be .  he was putting off the moment of decision as long as possible .   devi en settled himself for one more interview with the wild one .  it turned out to be a completely unbearable one  and the last .   the wild one had a bruise across his cheek as though he had been resisting the mauvs again .  in fact  it was certain he had .  he had done so numerous times before  and the mauvs  despite their most earnest attempts to do no harm  could not help but bruise him on occasion .  one would expect the wild one to see how intensely they tried not to hurt him and to quiet his behavior as a result .  instead  it was as though the conviction of safety spurred him on to additional resistance .    these large primate species were vicious  vicious  thought devi en sadly .    for over an hour  the interview hovered over useless small talk and then the wild one said with sudden belligerence   how long did you say you things have been here .     fifteen of your years   said devi en .    that figures .  the first flying saucers were sighted just after world war ii .  how much longer before the nuclear war .    with automatic truth  devi en said   we wish we knew   and stopped suddenly .   the wild one said   i thought nuclear war was inevitable .  last time you said you overstayed ten years .  you expected the war ten years ago  didn t you .    devi en said   i can t discuss this subject .     no .   the wild one was screaming .   what are you going to do about it .  how long will you wait .  why not nudge it a little .  don t just wait  vulture .  start one .    devi en jumped to his feet .   what are you saying .     why else are you waiting  you dirty   he choked on a completely incomprehensible expletive  then continued  breathlessly   isn t that what vultures do when some poor miserable animal  or man  maybe  is taking too long to die .  they can t wait .  they come swirling down and peck out his eyes .  they wait till he s helpless and just hurry him along the last step .    devi en ordered him away quickly and retired to his sleeping room  where he was sick for hours .  nor did he sleep then or that night .  the word  vulture  screamed in his ears and that final picture danced before his eyes .   devi en said firmly   your height  i can speak with the wild one no more .  if you need still more data  i cannot help you .    the arch administrator looked haggard .   i know .  this vulture business  very difficult to take .  yet you notice the thought didn t affect him .  large primates are immune to such things  hardened  calloused .  it is part of their way of thinking .  horrible .     i can get you no more data .     it s all right .  i understand .   besides  each additional item only strengthens the preliminary answer  the answer i thought was only provisional  that i hoped earnestly was only provisional .   he buried his head in his grizzled arms .   we have a way to start their nuclear war for them .     oh .  what need be done .     it is something very direct  very simple .  it is something i could never have thought of .  nor you .     what is it  your height .   he felt an anticipatory dread .    what keeps them at peace now is that neither of two nearly equal sides dares take the responsibility of starting a war .  if one side did  however  the other well  let s be blunt about it would retaliate in full .    devi en nodded .   the arch administrator went on .   if a single nuclear bomb fell on the territory of either of the two sides  the victims would at once assume the other side had launched it .  they would feel they could not wait for further attacks .  retaliation in full would follow within hours  the other side would retaliate in its turn .  within weeks it would be over .     but how do we make one of them drop that first bomb .     we don t  captain .  that is the point .  we drop the first bomb ourselves .     what .   devi en swayed .    that is it .  compute a large primate s mind and that answer thrusts itself at you .     but how can we .     we assemble a bomb .  that is easy enough .  we send it down by ship and drop it over some inhabited locality     inhabited .    the arch administrator looked away and said uneasily   the effect is lost otherwise .     i see   said devi en .  he was picturing vultures  he couldn t help it .  he visualized them as large  scaled bird  like the small harmless flying creatures on hurria  but immensely large   with rubber skinned wings and long razorbills  circling down  pecking at dying eyes .   his hands covered his eyes .  he said shakily   who will pilot the ship .  who will launch the bomb .    the arch administrator s voice was no stronger than devi en s .   i don t know .     i won t   said devi en .   i can t .  there is no hurrian who can  at any price .    the arch administrator rocked back and forth miserably .   perhaps the mauvs could be given orders     who could give them such orders .    the arch administrator sighed heavily .   i will call the council .  they may have all the data .  perhaps they will suggest something .    so after a little over fifteen years  the hurrians were dismantling their base on the other side of the moon .   nothing had been accomplished .  the large primates of the planet had not had their nuclear war  they might never have .   and despite all the future horror that might bring  devi en was in an agony of happiness .  there was no point in thinking of the future .  for the present  he was getting away from this most horrible of horrible worlds .   he watched the moon fall away and shrink to a spot of light  along with the planet  and the sun of the system itself  till the whole thing was lost among the constellations .   it was only then that he could feel anything but relief .  it was only then that he felt a first tiny twinge of it might have been .   he said to the arch administrator   it might all have been well if we had been more patient .  they might yet have blundered into nuclear war .    the arch administrator said   somehow i doubt it .  the mentalic analysis of    he stopped and devi en understood .  the wild one had been replaced on his planet with minimal harm .  the events of the past weeks had been blanked out of his mind .  he had been placed near a small  inhabited locality not far from the spot where he had been first found .  his fellows would assume he had been lost .  they would blame his loss of weight  his bruises  his amnesia upon the hardships he had undergone .   but the harm done by him   if only they had not brought him up to the moon in the first place .  they might have reconciled themselves to the thought of starting a war .  they might somehow have thought of dropping a bomb  and worked out some indirect  long distance system for doing so .   it had been the wild one s word picture of the vulture that had stopped it all .  it had ruined devi en and the arch administrator .  when all data was sent back to hurria  the effect on the council itself had been notable .  the order to dismantle the base had come quickly .   devi en said   i will never take part in colonization again .    the arch administrator said mournfully   none of us may ever have to .  the wild ones of that planet will emerge and with large primates and large primate thinking loose in the galaxy  it will mean the end of of    devi en s nose twitched .  the end of everything  of all the good hurria had done in the galaxy  all the good it might have continued to do in the future .   he said   we ought to have dropped   and did not finish .   what was the use of saying that .  they couldn t have dropped the bomb for all the galaxy .  if they could have  they would have been large primate themselves in their manner of thinking  and there are worse things than merely the end of everything .   devi en thought of the vultures .   all the troubles of the world  the greatest industry on earth centered about multivac multivac  the giant computer that had grown in fifty years until its various ramifications had filled washington  d . c .   to the suburbs and had reached out tendrils into every city and town on earth .   an army of civil servants fed it data constantly and another army correlated and interpreted the answers it gave .  a corps of engineers patrolled its interior while mines and factories consumed themselves in keeping its reserve stocks of replacement parts ever complete  ever accurate  ever satisfactory in every way .   multivac directed earth s economy and helped earth s science .  most important of all  it was the central clearing house of all known facts about each individual earthman .   and each day it was part of multivac s duties to take the four billion sets of facts about individual human beings that filled its vitals and extrapolate them for an additional day of time .  every corrections department on earth received the data appropriate to its own area of jurisdiction  and the over all data was presented in one large piece to the central board of corrections in washington  d . c .   bernard gulliman was in the fourth week of his year term as chairman of the central board of corrections and had grown casual enough to accept the morning report without being frightened by it .  as usual  it was a sheaf of papers some six inches thick .  he knew by now  he was not expected to read it .   no human could .   still  it was amusing to glance through it .   copyright         by headline publications  inc .   there was the usual list of predictable crimes  frauds of all sorts  larcenies  riots  manslaughters  arsons .   he looked for one particular heading and felt a slight shock at finding it there at all  then another one at seeing two entries .  not one  but two .  two first degree murders .  he had not seen two in one day in all his term as chairman so far .   he punched the knob of the two way intercom and waited for the smooth face of his co ordinator to appear on the screen .    ali   said gulliman .   there are two first degrees this day .  is there any unusual problem .     no  sir .   the dark complexioned face with its sharp  black eyes seemed restless .   both cases are quite low probability .     i know that   said gulliman .   i observed that neither probability is higher than    per cent .  just the same  multivac has a reputation to maintain .  it has virtually wiped out crime  and the public judges that by its record on first degree murder which is  of course  the most spectacular crime .    ali othman nodded .   yes  sir .  i quite realize that .     you also realize  i hope   gulliman said   that i don t want a single consummated case of it during my term .  if any other crime slips through  i may allow excuses .  if a first degree murder slips through  i ll have your hide .  understand .     yes  sir .  the complete analyses of the two potential murders are already at the district offices involved .  the potential criminals and victims are under observation .  i have rechecked the probabilities of consummation and they are already dropping .     very good   said gulliman  and broke connection .   he went back to the list with an uneasy feeling that perhaps he had been overpompous .   but then  one had to be firm with these permanent civil service personnel and make sure they didn t imagine they were running everything  including the chairman .  particularly this othman  who had been working with multivac since both were considerably younger  and had a proprietary air that could be infuriating .   to gulliman  this matter of crime was the political chance of a lifetime .  so far  no chairman had passed through his term without a murder taking place somewhere on earth  some time .  the previous chairman had ended with a record of eight  three more  more  in fact  than under his predecessor .   now gulliman intended to have none .  he was going to be  he had decided  the first chairman without any murder at all anywhere on earth during his term .  after that  and the favorable publicity that would result   he barely skimmed the rest of the report .  he estimated that there were at least two thousand cases of prospective wife beatings listed .  undoubtedly  not all would be stopped in time .  perhaps thirty per cent would be consum   mated .  but the incidence was dropping and consummations were dropping even more quickly .   multivac had added wife beating to its list of predictable crimes only some five years earlier and the average man was not yet accustomed to the thought that if he planned to wallop his wife  it would be known in advance .  as the conviction percolated through society  woman would first suffer fewer bruises and then  eventually  none .   some husband beatings were on the list  too  gulliman noticed .   ali othrnan closed connections and stared at the screen from which gulliman s jowled and balding head had departed .  then he looked across at his assistant  rafe leemy and said   what do we do .     don t ask me .  he s worried about just a lousy murder or two .     it s an awful chance trying to handle this thing on our own .  still if we tell him  he ll have a first class fit .  these elective politicians have their skins to think of  so he s bound to get in our way and make things worse .    leemy nodded his head and put a thick lower lip between his teeth .   trouble is  though  what if we miss out .  it would just about be the end of the world  you know .     if we miss out  who cares what happens to us .  we ll just be part of the general catastrophe .   then he said in a more lively manner   but hell  the probability is only    .   per cent .  on anything else  except maybe murder  we d let the probabilities rise a bit before taking any action at all .  there could still be spontaneous correction .     i wouldn t count on it   said leemy dryly .    i don t intend to .  i was just pointing the fact out .  still  at this probability  i suggest we confine ourselves to simple observation for the moment .  no one could plan a crime like this alone  there must be accomplices .     multivac didn t name any .     i know .  still   his voice trailed off .   so they stared at the details of the one crime not included on the list handed out to gulliman  the one crime much worse than first degree murder  the one crime never before attempted in the history of multivac  and wondered what to do .   ben manners considered himself the happiest sixteen year old in baltimore .  this was  perhaps  doubtful .  but he was certainly one of the happiest  and one of the most excited .   at least  he was one of the handful admitted to the galleries of the stadium during the swearing in of the eighteen year olds .  his older brother was going to be sworn in so his parents had applied for spectator s tickets and they had allowed ben to do so  too .  but when multivac chose among all the applicants  it was ben who got the ticket .   two years later  ben would be sworn in himself  but watching big brother michael now was the next best thing .   his parents had dressed him  or supervised the dressing  at any rate  with all care  as representative of the family and sent him off with numerous messages for michael  who had left days earlier for preliminary physical and neurological examinations .   the stadium was on the outskirts of town and ben  just bursting with self importance  was shown to his seat .  below him  now  were rows upon rows of hundreds upon hundreds of eighteen year olds  boys to the right  girls to the left   all from the second district of baltimore .  at various times in the year  similar meetings were going on all over the world  but this was baltimore  this was the important one .  down there  somewhere  was mike  ben s own brother .   ben scanned the tops of heads  thinking somehow he might recognize his brother .  he didn t  of course  but then a man came out on the raised platform in front of all the crowd and ben stopped looking to listen .   the man said   good afternoon  swearers and guests .  i am randolph t .  hoch  in charge of the baltimore ceremonies this year .  the swearers have met me several times now during the progress of the physical and neurological portions of this examination .  most of the task is done  but the most important matter is left .  the swearer himself  his personality  must go into multivac s records .    each year  this requires some explanation to the young people reaching adulthood .  until now   he turned to the young people before him and his eyes went no more to the gallery   you have not been adult  you have not been individuals in the eyes of multivac  except where you were especially singled out as such by your parents or your government .    until now  when the time for the yearly up dating of information came  it was your parents who filled in the necessary data on you .  now the time has come for you to take over that duty yourself  it is a great honor  a great responsibility .  your parents have told us what schooling you ve had  what diseases  what habits  a great many things .  but now you must tell us a great deal more  your innermost thoughts  your most secret deeds .    this is hard to do the first time  embarrassing even  but it must be done .  once it is done  multivac will have a complete analysis of all of you in its files .  it will understand your actions and reactions .  it will even be able to guess with fair accuracy at your future actions and reactions .    in this way  multivac will protect you .  if you are in danger of accident  it will know .  if someone plans harm to you  it will know .  if you plan harm  it will know and you will be stopped in time so that it will not be necessary to punish you .    with its knowledge of all of you  multivac will be able to help earth adjust its economy and its laws for the good of all .  if you have a personal  problem  you may come to multivac with it and with its knowledge of all of you  multivac will be able to help you .    now you will have many forms to fill out .  think carefully and answer all questions as accurately as you can .  do not hold back through shame or caution .  no one will ever know your answers except multivac unless it becomes necessary to learn the answers in order to protect you .  and then only authorized officials of the government will know .    it may occur to you to stretch the truth a bit here or there .  don t do this .  we will find out if you do .  all your answers put together form a pattern .  if some answers are false  they will not fit the pattern and multivac will discover them .  if all your answers are false  there will be a distorted pattern of a type that multivac will recognize .  so you must tell the truth .    eventually  it was all over  however  the form filling  the ceremonies and speeches that followed .  in the evening  ben  standing tiptoe  finally spotted michael  who was still carrying the robes he had worn in the  parade of the adults .   they greeted one another with jubilation .   they shared a light supper and took the expressway home  alive and alight with the greatness of the day .   they were not prepared  then  for the sudden transition of the home coming .  it was a numbing shock to both of them to be stopped by a cold faced young man in uniform outside their own front door  to have their papers inspected before they could enter their own house  to find their own parents sitting forlornly in the living room  the mark of tragedy on their faces .   joseph manners  looking much older than he had that morning  looked out of his puzzled  deep sunken eyes at his sons  one with the robes of new adulthood still over his arm  and said   i seem to be under house arrest .    bernard gulliman could not and did not read the entire report .  he read only the summary and that was most gratifying  indeed .   a whole generation  it seemed  had grown up accustomed to the fact that multivac could predict the commission of major crimes .  they learned that corrections agents would be on the scene before the crime could be committed .  they found out that consummation of the crime led to inevitable punishment .  gradually  they were convinced that there was no way anyone could outsmart multivac .   the result was  naturally  that even the intention of crime fell off .  and as such intentions fell off and as multivac s capacity was enlarged  minor crimes could be added to the list it would predict each morning  and these crimes  too  were now shrinking in incidence .   so gulliman had ordered an analysis made  by multivac naturally  of multivac s capacity to turn its attention to the problem of predicting probabilities of disease incidence .  doctors might soon be alerted to individual  patients who might grow diabetic in the course of the next year  or suffer an attack of tuberculosis or grow a cancer .   an ounce of prevention   and the report was a favorable one .   after that  the roster of the day s possible crimes arrived and there was not a first degree murder on the list .   gulliman put in an intercom call to ali othman in high good humor .   othman  how do the numbers of crimes in the daily lists of the past week average compared with those in my first week as chairman .    it had gone down  it turned out  by   per cent and gulliman was happy indeed .  no fault of his own  of course  but the electorate would not know that .  he blessed his luck that he had come in at the right time  at the very climax of multivac  when disease  too  could be placed under its all embracing and protecting knowledge .   gulliman would prosper by this .   othman shrugged his shoulders .   well  he s happy .     when do we break the bubble .   said leemy .   putting manners under observation just raised the probabilities and house arrest gave it another boost .     don t i know it .   said othman peevishly .   what i don t know is why .     accomplices  maybe  like you said .  with manners in trouble  the rest have to strike at once or be lost .     just the other way around .  with our hand on one  the rest would scatter for safety and disappear .  besides  why aren t the accomplices named by multivac .     well  then  do we tell gulliman .     no  not yet .  the probability is still only    .   per cent .  let s get a bit more drastic first .    elizabeth manners said to her younger son   you go to your room  ben .     but what s it all about  mom .   asked ben  voice breaking at this strange ending to what had been a glorious day .    please .    he left reluctantly  passing through the door to the stairway  walking up it noisily and down again quietly .   and mike manners  the older son  the new minted adult and the hope of the family  said in a voice and tone that mirrored his brother s   what s it all about .    joe manners said   as heaven is my witness  son  i don t know .    haven t done anything .     well  sure you haven t done anything .   mike looked at his small boned  mild mannered father in wonder .   they must be here because you re thinking of doing something .     i m not .    mrs .  manners broke in angrily   how can he be thinking of doing something worth all all this .   she cast her arm about  in a gesture toward the enclosing shell of government men about the house .   when i was a little girl  i remember the father of a friend of mine was working in a bank  and they once called him up and said to leave the money alone and he did .  it was fifty thousand dollars .  he hadn t really taken it .  he was just thinking about taking it .  they didn t keep those things as quiet in those days as they do now  the story got out .  that s how i know about it .    but i mean   she went on  rubbing her plump hands slowly together   that was fifty thousand dollars  fifty thousand dollars .  yet all they did was call him  one phone call .  what could your father be planning that would make it worth having a dozen men come down and close off the house .    joe manners said  eyes filled with pain   i am planning no crime  not even the smallest .  i swear it .    mike  filled with the conscious wisdom of a new adult  said   maybe it s something subconscious  pop .  some resentment against your supervisor .     so that i would want to kill him .  no .     won t they tell you what it is  pop .    his mother interrupted again   no  they won t .  we ve asked .  i said they were ruining our standing in the community just being here .  the least they could do is tell us what it s all about so we could fight it  so we could explain .     and they wouldn t .     they wouldn t .    mike stood with his legs spread apart and his hands deep in his pockets .  he said  troubled   gee  mom  multivac doesn t make mistakes .    his father pounded his fist helplessly on the arm of the sofa .   i tell you i m not planning any crime .    the door opened without a knock and a man in uniform walked in with sharp  self possessed stride .  his face had a glazed  official appearance .  he said   are you joseph manners .    joe manners rose to his feet .   yes .  now what is it you want of me .     joseph manners  i place you under arrest by order of the government   and curtly he showed his identification as a corrections officer .   i must ask you to come with me .     for what reason .  what have i done .     i am not at liberty to discuss that .     but i can t be arrested just for planning a crime even if i were doing that .  to be arrested   must actually have done something .  you can t arrest me otherwise .  it s against the law .    the officer was impervious to the logic .   you will have to come with me .    mrs .  manners shrieked and fell on the couch  weeping hysterically .  jo   seph manners could not bring himself to violate the code drilled into him all his life by actually resisting an officer  but he hung back at least  forcing the corrections officer to use muscular power to drag him forward .   and manners called out as he went   but tell me what it is .  just tell me .  if i knew  is it murder .  am i supposed to be planning murder .    the door closed behind him and mike manners  white faced and suddenly feeling not the least bit adult  stared first at the door  then at his weeping mother .   ben manners  behind the door and suddenly feeling quite adult  pressed his lips tightly together and thought he knew exactly what to do .   if multivac took away  multivac could also give .  ben had been at the ceremonies that very day .  he had heard this man  randolph hoch  speak of multivac and all that multivac could do .  it could direct the government and it could also unbend and help out some plain person who came to it for help .   anyone could ask help of multivac and anyone meant ben .  neither his mother nor mike were in any condition to stop him now  and he had some money left of the amount they had given him for his great outing that day .  if afterward they found him gone and worried about it  that couldn t be helped .  right now  his first loyalty was to his father .   he ran out the back way and the officer at the door cast a glance at his papers and let him go .   harold quimby handled the complaints department of the baltimore substation of multivac .  he considered himself to be a member of that branch of the civil service that was most important of all .  in some ways  he may have been right  and those who heard him discuss the matter would have had to be made of iron not to feel impressed .   for one thing  quimby would say  multivac was essentially an invader of privacy .  in the past fifty years  mankind had had to acknowledge that its thoughts and impulses were no longer secret  that it owned no inner recess where anything could be hidden .  and mankind had to have something in return .   of course  it got prosperity  peace  and safety  but that was abstract .  each man and woman needed something personal as his or her own reward for surrendering privacy  and each one got it .  within reach of every human being was a multivac station with circuits into which he could freely enter his own problems and questions without control or hindrance  and from which  in a matter of minutes  he could receive answers .   at any given moment  five million individual circuits among the quadrillion or more within multivac might be involved in this question and answer program .  the answers might not always be certain  but they were the best available  and every questioner knew the answer to be the best available and had faith in it .  that was what counted .   and now an anxious sixteen year old had moved slowly up the waiting  line of men and women  each in that line illuminated by a different mixture of hope with fear or anxiety or even anguish always with hope predominating as the person stepped nearer and nearer to multivac  .   without looking up  quimby took the filled out form being handed him and said   booth   b .    ben said   how do i ask the question  sir .    quimby looked up then  with a bit of surprise .  preadults did not generally make use of the service .  he said kindly   have you ever done this before  son .     no  sir .    quimby pointed to the model on his desk .   you use this .  you see how it works .  just like a typewriter .  don t you try to write or print anything by hand .  just use the machine .  now you take booth   b  and if you need help  just press the red button and someone will come .  down that aisle  son  on the right .    he watched the youngster go down the aisle and out of view and smiled .  no one was ever turned away from multivac .  of course  there was always a certain percentage of trivia  people who asked personal questions about their neighbors or obscene questions about prominent personalities  college youths trying to outguess their professors or thinking it clever to stump multivac by asking it russell s class of all classes paradox and so on .   multivac could take care of all that .  it needed no help .   besides  each question and answer was filed and formed but another item in the fact assembly for each individual .  even the most trivial question and the most impertinent  insofar as it reflected the personality of the questioner  helped humanity by helping multivac know about humanity .   quimby turned his attention to the next person in line  a middle aged woman  gaunt and angular  with the look of trouble in her eye .   ali othman strode the length of his office  his heels thumping desperately on the carpet .   the probability still goes up .  it s    .   per cent now .  damnation .  we have joseph manners under actual arrest and it still goes up .   he was perspiring freely .   leemy turned away from the telephone .   no confession yet .  he s under psychic probing and there is no sign of crime .  he may be telling the truth .    othman said   is multivac crazy then .    another phone sprang to life .  othman closed connections quickly  glad of the interruption .  a corrections officer s face came to life in the screen .  the officer said   sir  are there any new directions as to manners  family .  are they to be allowed to come and go as they have been .     what do you mean  as they have been .     the original instructions were for the house arrest of joseph manners .  nothing was said of the rest of the family  sir .     well  extend it to the rest of the family until you are informed otherwise .     sir  that is the point .  the mother and older son are demanding information about the younger son .  the younger son is gone and they claim he is in custody and wish to go to headquarters to inquire about it .    othman frowned and said in almost a whisper   younger son .  how young .     sixteen  sir   said the officer .    sixteen and he s gone .  don t you know where .     he was allowed to leave  sir .  there were no orders to hold him .     hold the line .  don t move .   othman put the line into suspension  then clutched at his coal black hair with both hands and shrieked   fool .  fool .  fool .    leemy was startled .   what the hell .     the man has a sixteen year old son   choked out othman .   a sixteen year old is not an adult and he is not filed independently in multivac  but only as part of his father s file .   he glared at leemy .   doesn t everyone know that until eighteen a youngster does not file his own reports with multivac but that his father does it for him .  don t i know it .  don t you .     you mean multivac didn t mean joe manners .   said leemy .    multivac meant his minor son  and the youngster is gone  now .  with officers three deep around the house  he calmly walks out and goes on you know what errand .    he whirled to the telephone circuit to which the corrections officer still clung  the minute break having given othman just time enough to collect himself and to assume a cool and self possessed mien .   it would never have done to throw a fit before the eyes of the officer  however much good it did in purging his spleen .    he said   officer  locate the younger son who has disappeared .  take every man you have  if necessary .  take every man available in the district  if necessary .  i shall give the appropriate orders .  you must find that boy at all costs .     yes  sir .    connection was broken .  othman said   have another rundown on the probabilities  leemy .    five minutes later  leemy said   it s down to    .   per cent .  it s down .    othman drew a long breath .   we re on the right track at last .    ben manners sat in booth   b and punched out slowly   my name is benjamin manners  number mb          .  my father  joseph manners  has been arrested but we don t know what crime he is planning .  is there any way we can help him .    he sat and waited .  he might be only sixteen but he was old enough to know that somewhere those words were being whirled into the most com   plex structure ever conceived by man  that a trillion facts would blend and co ordinate into a whole  and that from that whole  multivac would abstract the best help .   the machine clicked and a card emerged .  it had an answer on it  a long answer .  it began   take the expressway to washington  d . c .  at once .  get off at the connecticut avenue stop .  you will find a special exit  labeled  multivac  with a guard .  inform the guard you are special courier for dr .  trumbull and he will let you enter .    you will be in a corridor .  proceed along it till you reach a small door labeled  interior .   enter and say to the men inside   message for doctor trumbull .   you will be allowed to pass .  proceed on    it went on in this fashion .  ben could not see the application to his question  but he had complete faith in multivac .  he left at a run  heading for the expressway to washington .   the corrections officers traced ben manners to the baltimore station an hour after he had left .  a shocked harold quimby found himself flabbergasted at the number and importance of the men who had focused on him in the search for a sixteen year old .    yes  a boy   he said   but i don t know where he went to after he was through here .  i had no way of knowing that anyone was looking for him .  we accept all comers here .  yes  i can get the record of the question and answer .    they looked at the record and televised it to central headquarters at once .   othman read it through  turned up his eyes  and collapsed .  they brought him to almost at once .  he said to leemy weakly   have them catch that boy .  and have a copy of multivac s answer made out for me .  there s no way any more  no way out .  i must see gulliman now .    bernard gulliman had never seen ali othman as much as perturbed before  and watching the co ordinator s wild eyes now sent a trickle of ice water down his spine .   he stammered   what do you mean  othman .  what do you mean worse than murder .     much worse than just murder .      gulliman was quite pale .   do you mean assassination of a high govern i ment official .    it did cross his mind that he himself   .   .  othman nodded .   not just a government official .  the government official .     the secretary general .  gulliman said in an appalled whisper .   .   more than that  even .  much more .  we deal with a plan to assassinate multivac .    what .     for the first time in the history of multivac  the computer came up with the report that it itself was in danger .     why was i not at once informed .    othman half truthed out of it .   the matter was so unprecedented  sir  that we explored the situation first before daring to put it on official record .     but multivac has been saved  of course .  it s been saved .     the probabilities of harm have declined to under   per cent .  i am waiting for the report now .     message for dr .  trumbull   said ben manners to the man on the high stool  working carefully on what looked like the controls of a stratojet cruiser  enormously magnified .    sure  jim   said the man .   go ahead .    ben looked at his instructions and hurried on .  eventually  he would find a tiny control lever which he was to shift to a down position at a moment when a certain indicator spot would light up red .   he heard an agitated voice behind him  then another  and suddenly  two men had him by his elbows .  his feet were lifted off the floor .   one man said   come with us  boy .    ali othman s face did not noticeably lighten at the news  even though gulliman said with great relief   if we have the boy  then multivac is safe .     for the moment .    gulliman put a trembling hand to his forehead .   what a half hour i ve had .  can you imagine what the destruction of multivac for even a short time would mean .  the government would have collapsed  the economy broken down .  it would have meant devastation worse   his head snapped up   what do you mean for the moment .     the boy  this ben manners  had no intention of doing harm .  he and his family must be released and compensation for false imprisonment given them .  he was only following multivac s instructions in order to help his father and it s done that .  his father is free now .     do you mean multivac ordered the boy to pull a lever under circumstances that would burn out enough circuits to require a month s repair work .  you mean multivac would suggest its own destruction for the comfort of one man .     it s worse than that  sir .  multivac not only gave those instructions but selected the manners family in the first place because ben manners looked exactly like one of dr .  trumbull s pages so that he could get into multivac without being stopped .     what do you mean the family was selected .     well  the boy would have never gone to ask the question if his father had not been arrested .  his father would never have been arrested if multivac had not blamed him for planning the destruction of multivac .  multivac s  own action started the chain of events that almost led to multivac s destruction .     but there s no sense to that   gulliman said in a pleading voice .  he felt small and helpless and he was virtually on his knees  begging this othman  this man who had spent nearly a lifetime with multivac  to reassure him .   othman did not do so .  he said   this is multivac s first attempt along this line as far as i know .  in some ways  it planned well  it chose the right family .  it carefully did not distinguish between father and son to send us off the track .  it was still an amateur at the game  though .  it could not overcome its own instructions that led it to report the probability of its own destruction as increasing with every step we took down the wrong road .  it could not avoid recording the answer it gave the youngster .  with further practice  it will probably learn deceit .  it will learn to hide certain facts  fail to record certain others .  from now on  every instruction it gives may have the seeds in it of its own destruction .  we will never know .  and however careful we are  eventually multivac will succeed .  i think  mr .  gulliman  you will be the last chairman of this organization .    gulliman pounded his desk in fury .   but why  why  why .  damn you  why .  what is wrong with it .  can t it be fixed .     i don t think so   said othman  in soft despair .   i ve never thought about this before .  i ve never had the occasion to until this happened  but now that i think of it  it seems to me we have reached the end of the road because multivac is too good .  multivac has grown so complicated  its reactions are no longer those of a machine  but those of a living thing .     you re mad  but even so .     for fifty years and more we have been loading humanity s troubles on multivac  on this living thing .  we ve asked it to care for us  all together and each individually .  we ve asked it to take all our secrets into itself  we ve asked it to absorb our evil and guard us against it .  each of us brings his troubles to it  adding his bit to the burden .  now we are planning to load the burden of human disease on multivac  too .    othman paused a moment  then burst out   mr .  gulliman  multivac bears all the troubles of the world on its shoulders and it is tired .     madness .  midsummer madness   muttered gulliman .    then let me show you something .  let me put it to the test .  may i have permission to use the multivac circuit line here in your office .     why .     to ask it a question no one has ever asked multivac before .     will you do it harm .   asked gulliman in quick alarm .    no .  but it will tell us what we want to know .    the chairman hesitated a trifle .  then he said   go ahead .    othman used the instrument on gulliman s desk .  his fingers punched out the question with deft strokes   multivac  what do you yourself want more than anything else .    the moment between question and answer lengthened unbearably  but neither othman nor gulliman breathed .   and there was a clicking and a card popped out .  it was a small card .  on it  in precise letters  was the answer    i want to die .    spell my name with an s  marshall zebatinsky felt foolish .  he felt as though there were eyes staring through the grimy store front glass and across the scarred wooden partition  eyes watching him .  he felt no confidence in the old clothes he had resurrected or the turned down brim of a hat he never otherwise wore or the glasses he had left in their case .   he felt foolish and it made the lines in his forehead deeper and his young old face a little paler .   he would never be able to explain to anyone why a nuclear physicist such as himself should visit a numerologist .   never  he thought .  never .   hell  he could not explain it to himself except that he had let his wife talk him into it .   the numerologist sat behind an old desk that must have been secondhand when bought .  no desk could get that old with only one owner .  the same might almost be said of his clothes .  he was little and dark and peered at zebatinsky with little dark eyes that were brightly alive .   he said   i have never had a physicist for a client before  dr .  zebatinsky .    zebatinsky flushed at once .   you understand this is confidential .    the numerologist smiled so that wrinkles creased about the comers of his mouth and the skin around his chin stretched .   all my dealings are confidential .   f zebatinsky said   i think i ought to tell you one thing .  i don t believe in  copyright         by ballantine magazine  inc .   numerology and i don t expect to begin believing in it .  if that makes a difference  say so now .     but why are you here  then .     my wife thinks you may have something  whatever it is .  i promised her and i am here .   he shrugged and the feeling of folly grew more acute .    and what is it you are looking for .  money .  security .  long life .  what .    zebatinsky sat for a long moment while the numerologist watched him quietly and made no move to hurry his client .   zebatinsky thought  what do i say anyway .  that i m thirty four and without a future .   he said   i want success .  i want recognition .     a better job .     a different job .  a different kind of job .  right now  i m part of a team  working under orders .  teams .  that s all government research is .  you re a violinist lost in a symphony orchestra .     and you want to solo .     i want to get out of a team and into into me .   zebatinsky felt carried away  almost lightheaded  just putting this into words to someone other than his wife .  he said   twenty five years ago  with my kind of training and my kind of ability  i would have gotten to work on the first nuclear power plants .  today i d be running one of them or i d be head of a pure research group at a university .  but with my start these days where will i be twenty five years from now .  nowhere .  still on the team .  still carrying my   per cent of the ball .  i m drowning in an anonymous crowd of nuclear physicists  and what i want is room on dry land  if you see what i mean .    the numerologist nodded slowly .   you realize  dr .  zebatinsky  that i don t guarantee success .    zebatinsky  for all his lack of faith  felt a sharp bite of disappointment .   you don t .  then what the devil do you guarantee .     an improvement in the probabilities .  my work is statistical in nature .  since you deal with atoms  i think you understand the laws of statistics .     do you .   asked the physicist sourly .    i do  as a matter of fact .  i am a mathematician and i work mathematically .  i don t tell you this in order to raise my fee .  that is standard .  fifty dollars .  but since you are a scientist  you can appreciate the nature of my work better than my other clients .  it is even a pleasure to be able to explain to you .    zebatinsky said   i d rather you wouldn t  if you don t mind .  it s no use telling me about the numerical values of letters  their mystic significance and that kind of thing .  i don t consider that mathematics .  let s get to the point    the numerologist said   then you want me to help you provided i don t embarrass you by telling you the silly nonscientific basis of the way in which i helped you .  is that it .     all right .  that s it .     but you still work on the assumption that i am a numerologist  and i am not .  i call myself that so that the police won t bother me and   the little man chuckled dryly   so that the psychiatrists won t either .  i am a mathematician  an honest one .    zebatinsky smiled .   the numerologist said   i build computers .  i study probable futures .     what .     does that sound worse than numerology to you .  why .  given enough data and a computer capable of sufficient number of operations in unit time  the future is predictable  at least in terms of probabilities .  when you compute the motions of a missile in order to aim an anti missile  isn t it the future you re predicting .  the missile and anti missile would not collide if the future were predicted incorrectly .  i do the same thing .  since i work with a greater number of variables  my results are less accurate .     you mean you ll predict my future .     very approximately .  once i have done that  i will modify the data by changing your name and no other fact about you .  i throw that modified datum into the operation program .  then i try other modified names .  i study each modified future and find one that contains a greater degree of recognition for you than the future that now lies ahead of you .  or no  let me put it another way .  i will find you a future in which the probability of adequate recognition is higher than the probability of that in your present future .     why change my name .     that is the only change i ever make  for several reasons .  number one  it is a simple change .  after all  if i make a great change or many changes  so many new variables enter that i can no longer interpret the result .  my machine is still crude .  number two  it is a reasonable change .  i can t change your height  can i  or the color of your eyes  or even your temperament .  number three  it is a significant change .  names mean a lot to people .  finally  number four  it is a common change that is done every day by various people .    zebatinsky said   what if you don t find a better future .     that is the risk you will have to take .  you will be no worse off than now  my friend .    zebatinsky stared at the little man uneasily   i don t believe any of this .  i d sooner believe numerology .    the numerologist sighed .   i thought a person like yourself would feel more comfortable with the truth .  i want to help you and there is much yet for you to do .  if you believed me a numerologist  you would not follow through .  i thought if i told you the truth you would let me help you .    zebatinsky said   if you can see the future     why am i not the richest man on earth .  is that it .  but i am rich in all i want .  you want recognition and i want to be left alone .  i do my work .  no  one bothers me .  that makes me a billionaire .  i need a little real money and this i get from people such as yourself .  helping people is nice and perhaps a psychiatrist would say it gives me a feeling of power and feeds my ego .  now  do you want me to help you .     how much did you say .     fifty dollars .  i will need a great deal of biographical information from you but i have prepared a form to guide you .  it s a little long  i m afraid .  still  if you can get it in the mail by the end of the week  i will have an answer for you by the    he put out his lower lip and frowned in mental calculation   the twentieth of next month .     five weeks .  so long .     i have other work  my friend  and other clients .  if i were a fake  i could do it much more quickly .  it is agreed then .    zebatinsky rose .   well  agreed .   this is all confidential  now .     perfectly .  you will have all your information back when i tell you what change to make and you have my word that i will never make any further use of any of it .    the nuclear physicist stopped at the door .   aren t you afraid i might tell someone you re not a numerologist .    the numerologist shook his head .   who would believe you  my friend .  even supposing you were willing to admit to anyone that you ve been here .    on the twentieth  marshall zebatinsky was at the paint peeling door  glancing sideways at the shop front with the little card up against the glass reading  numerology   dimmed and scarcely legible through the dust .  he peered in  almost hoping that someone else would be there already so that he might have an excuse to tear up the wavering intention in his mind and go home .   he had tried wiping the thing out of his mind several times .  he could never stick at filling out the necessary data for long .  it was embarrassing to work at it .  he felt incredibly silly filling out the names of his friends  the cost of his house  whether his wife had had any miscarriages  if so  when .  he abandoned it .   but he couldn t stick at stopping altogether either .  he returned to it each evening .   it was the thought of the computer that did it  perhaps  the thought of the infernal gall of the little man pretending he had a computer .  the temptation to call the bluff  see what would happen  proved irresistible after all .   he finally sent off the completed data by ordinary mail  putting on nine cents worth of stamps without weighing the letter .  if it comes back  he thought  i ll call it off .   it didn t come back .   he looked into the shop now and it was empty .  zebatinsky had no choice but to enter .  a bell tinkled .   the old numerologist emerged from a curtained door .    yes .   ah  dr .  zebatinsky .     you remember me .   zebatinsky tried to smile .    oh  yes .     what s the verdict .    the numerologist moved one gnarled hand over the other .   before that  sir  there s a little     a little matter of the fee .     i have already done the work  sir .  i have earned the money .    zebatinsky raised no objection .  he was prepared to pay .  if he had come this far  it would be silly to turn back just because of the money .   he counted out five ten dollar bills and shoved them across the counter .   well .    the numerologist counted the bills again slowly  then pushed them into a cash drawer in his desk .   he said   your case was very interesting .  i would advise you to change your name to sebatinsky .     seba  how do you spell that .     s e b a t i n s k y .    zebatinsky stared indignantly .   you mean change the initial .  change the z to an s .  that s all .     it s enough .  as long as the change is adequate  a small change is safer than a big one .     but how could the change affect anything .     how could any name .   asked the numerologist softly .   i can t say .  it may  somehow  and that s all i can say .  remember  i don t guarantee results .  of course  if you do not wish to make the change  leave things as they are .  but in that case i cannot refund the fee .    zebatinsky said   what do i do .  just tell everyone to spell my name with an s .     if you want my advice  consult a lawyer .  change your name legally .  he can advise you on little things .     how long will it all take .  i mean for things to improve for me .     how can i tell .  maybe never .  maybe tomorrow .     but you saw the future .  you claim you see it .    j  not as in a crystal ball .  no  no  dr .  zebatinsky .  all i get out of my  computer is a set of coded figures .  i can recite probabilities to you  but i saw no pictures .       zebatinsky turned and walked rapidly out of the place .  fifty dollars to change a letter .  fifty dollars for sebatinsky .  lord  what a name .  worse than zebatinsky .   it took another month before he could make up his mind to see a lawyer  and then he finally went .   he told himself he could always change the name back .  give it a chance  he told himself .  hell  there was no law against it .   henry brand looked through the folder page by page  with the practiced eye of one who had been in security for fourteen years .  he didn t have to read every word .  anything peculiar would have leaped off the paper and punched him in the eye .   he said   the man looks clean to me .   henry brand looked clean  too  with a soft  rounded paunch and a pink and freshly scrubbed complexion .  it was as though continuous contact with all sorts of human failings  from possible ignorance to possible treason  had compelled him into frequent washings .   lieutenant albert quincy  who had brought him the folder  was young and filled with the responsibility of being security officer at the hanford station .   but why sebatinsky .   he demanded .    why not .     because it doesn t make sense .  zebatinsky is a foreign name and i d change it myself if i had it  but i d change it to something anglo saxon .  if zebatinsky had done that  it would make sense and i wouldn t give it a second thought .  but why change a z to an s .  i think we must find out what his reasons were .     has anyone asked him directly .     certainly .  in ordinary conversation  of course .  i was careful to arrange that .  he won t say anything more than that he s tired of being last in the alphabet .     that could be  couldn t it  lieutenant .     it could  but why not change his name to sands or smith  if he wants an s .  .  or if he s that tired of z  why not go the whole way and change it to an a .  why not a name like uh aarons .     not anglo saxon enough   muttered brand .  then   but there s nothing to pin against the man .  no matter how queer a name change may be  that alone can t be used against anyone .    lieutenant quincy looked markedly unhappy .   brand said   tell me  lieutenant  there must be something specific that bothers you .  something in your mind  some theory  some gimmick .  what is it .    the lieutenant frowned .  his light eyebrows drew together and his lips tightened .   well  damn it  sir  the man s a russian .    brand said   he s not that .  he s a third generation american .     i mean his name s russian .    brand s face lost some of its deceptive softness .   no  lieutenant  wrong again .  polish .    the lieutenant pushed his hands out impatiently  palms up .   same thing .    brand  whose mother s maiden name had been wiszewski  snapped   don t tell that to a pole  lieutenant .    then  more thoughtfully   or to a russian either  i suppose .     what i m trying to say  sir   said the lieutenant  reddening   is that the poles and russians are both on the other side of the curtain .     we all know that .     and zebatinsky or sebatinsky  whatever you want to call him  may have relatives there .     he s third generation .  he might have second cousins there  i suppose .  so what .     nothing in itself .  lots of people may have distant relatives there .  but zebatinsky changed his name .     go on .     maybe he s trying to distract attention .  maybe a second cousin over there is getting too famous and our zebatinsky is afraid that the relationship may spoil his own chances of advancement .     changing his name won t do any good .  he d still be a second cousin .     sure  but he wouldn t feel as though he were shoving the relationship in our face .     have you ever heard of any zebatinsky on the other side .     no  sir .     then he can t be too famous .  how would our zebatinsky know about him .     he might keep in touch with his own relatives .  that would be suspicious under the circumstances  he being a nuclear physicist .    methodically  brand went through the folder again .   this is awfully thin  lieutenant .  it s thin enough to be completely invisible .     can you offer any other explanation  sir  of why he ought to change his name in just this way .     no  i can t .  i admit that .     then i think  sir  we ought to investigate .  we ought to look for any men named zebatinsky on the other side and see if we can draw a connection .   the lieutenant s voice rose a trifle as a new thought occurred to him .   he might be changing his name to withdraw attention from them  i mean to protect them .     he s doing just the opposite  i think .     he doesn t realize that  maybe  but protecting them could be his motive .    brand sighed .   all right  we ll tackle the zebatinsky angle .   but if nothing turns up  lieutenant  we drop the matter .  leave the folder with me .    when the information finally reached brand  he had all but forgotten the lieutenant and his theories .  his first thought on receiving data that included a list of seventeen biographies of seventeen russian and polish citizens  all named zebatinsky  was  what the devil is this .   then he remembered  swore mildly  and began reading .   it started on the american side .  marshall zebatinsky  fingerprints  had been born in buffalo  new york  date  hospital statistics  .  his father had been born in buffalo as well  his mother in oswego  new york .  his paternal grandparents had both been born in bialystok  poland  date of entry into the united states  dates of citizenship  photographs  .   the seventeen russian and polish citizens named zebatinsky were all descendants of people who  some half century earlier  had lived in or near bialystok .  presumably  they could be relatives  but this was not explicitly stated in any particular case .   vital statistics in east europe during the aftermath of world war i were kept poorly  if at all .    brand passed through the individual life histories of the current zebatinsky men and women  amazing how thoroughly intelligence did its work  probably the russians  was as thorough  .  he stopped at one and his smooth forehead sprouted lines as his eyebrows shot upward .  he put that one to one side and went on .  eventually  he stacked everything but that one and returned it to its envelope .   staring at that one  he tapped a neatly kept fingernail on the desk .   with a certain reluctance  he went to call on dr .  paul kristow of the atomic energy commission .   dr .  kristow listened to the matter with a stony expression .  he lifted a little finger occasionally to dab at his bulbous nose and remove a nonexistent speck .  his hair was iron gray  thinning and cut short .  he might as well have been bald .   he said   no  i never heard of any russian zebatinsky .  but then  i never heard of the american one either .     well   brand scratched at his hairline over one temple and said slowly   i don t think there s anything to this  but i don t like to drop it too soon .  i have a young lieutenant on my tail and you know what they can be like .  i don t want to do anything that will drive him to a congressional committee .  besides  the fact is that one of the russian zebatinsky fellows  mikhail andreyevich zebatinsky  is a nuclear physicist .  are you sure you never heard of him .     mikhail andreyevich zebatinsky .  no  no  i never did .  not that that proves anything .     i could say it was coincidence  but you know that would be piling it a trifle high .  one zebatinsky here and one zebatinsky there  both nuclear physicists  and the one here suddenly changes his name to sebatinsky  and goes around anxious about it  too .  he won t allow misspelling .  he says   emphatically   spell my name with an   .   it all just fits well enough to make my spy conscious lieutenant begin to look a little too good .   and another peculiar thing is that the russian zebatinsky dropped out of sight just about a year ago .    dr .  kristow said stolidly   executed .     he might have been .  ordinarily  i would even assume so  though the russians are not more foolish than we are and don t kill any nuclear physicist they can avoid killing .  the thing is there s another reason why a nuclear physicist  of all people  might suddenly disappear .  i don t have to tell you .     crash research  top secret .  i take it that s what you mean .  do you believe that s it .     put it together with everything else  add in the lieutenant s intuition  and i just begin to wonder .     give me that biography .   dr .  kristow reached for the sheet of paper and read it over twice .  he shook his head .  then he said   i ll check this in nuclear abstracts .    nuclear abstracts lined one wall of dr .  kristow s study in neat little boxes  each filled with its squares of microfilm .   the a . e . g .  man used his projector on the indices while brand watched with what patience he could muster .   dr .  kristow muttered   a mikhail zebatinsky authored or co authored half a dozen papers in the soviet journals in the last half dozen years .  we ll get out the abstracts and maybe we can make something out of it .  i doubt it .    a selector flipped out the appropriate squares .  dr .  kristow lined them up  ran them through the projector  and by degrees an expression of odd intent ness crossed his face .  he said   that s odd .    brand said   what s odd .    dr .  kristow sat back .   i d rather not say just yet .  can you get me a list of other nuclear physicists who have dropped out of sight in the soviet union in the last year .     you mean you see something .     not really .  not if i were just looking at any one of these papers .  it s just that looking at all of them and knowing that this man may be on a crash research program and  on top of that  having you putting suspicions in my head   he shrugged .   it s nothing .    brand said earnestly   i wish you d say what s on your mind .  we may as well be foolish about this together .     if you feel that way  it s just possible this man may have been inching toward gamma ray reflection .     and the significance .     if a reflecting shield against gamma rays could be devised  individual shelters could be built to protect against fallout .  it s fallout that s the real  danger  you know .  a hydrogen bomb might destroy a city but the fallout could slow kill the population over a strip thousands of miles long and hundreds wide .    brand said quickly   are we doing any work on this .     no .     and if they get it and we don t  they can destroy the united states in tote at the cost of  say  ten cities  after they have their shelter program completed .     that s far in the future .   and  what are we getting in a hurrah about .  all this is built on one man changing one letter in his name .     all right  i m insane   said brand .   but i don t leave the matter at this point .  not at this point .  i ll get you your list of disappearing nuclear physicists if i have to go to moscow to get it .    he got the list .  they went through all the research papers authored by any of them .  they called a full meeting of the commission  then of the nuclear brains of the nation .  dr .  kristow walked out of an all night session  finally  part of which the president himself had attended .   brand met him .  both looked haggard and in need of sleep .   brand said   well .    kristow nodded .   most agree .  some are doubtful even yet  but most agree .     how about you .  are you sure .     i m far from sure  but let me put it this way .  it s easier to believe that the soviets are working on a gamma ray shield than to believe that all the data we ve uncovered has no interconnection .     has it been decided that we re to go on shield research  too .     yes .   kristow s hand went back over his short  bristly hair  making a dry  whispery sound .   we re going to give it everything we ve got .  knowing the papers written by the men who disappeared  we can get right on their heels .  we may even beat them to it .   of course  they ll find out we re working on it .     let them   said brand .   let them .  it will keep them from attacking .  i don t see any percentage in selling ten of our cities just to get ten of theirs  if we re both protected and they re too dumb to know that .     but not too soon .  we don t want them finding out too soon .  what about the american zebatinsky sebatinsky .    brand looked solemn and shook his head .   there s nothing to connect him with any of this even yet .  hell  we ve looked .  i agree with you  of course .  he s in a sensitive spot where he is now and we can t afford to keep him there even if he s in the clear .     we can t kick him out just like that  either  or the russians will start wondering .     do you have any suggestions .    they were walking down the long corridor toward the distant elevator in the emptiness of four in the morning .   dr .  kristow said   i ve looked into his work .  he s a good man  better than most  and not happy in his job  either .  he hasn t the temperament for teamwork .     so .     but he is the type for an academic job .  if we can arrange to have a large university offer him a chair in physics  i think he would take it gladly .  there would be enough nonsensitive areas to keep him occupied  we would be able to keep him in close view  and it would be a natural development .  the russians might not start scratching their heads .  what do you think .    brand nodded .   it s an idea .  even sounds good .  i ll put it up to the chief .    they stepped into the elevator and brand allowed himself to wonder about it all .  what an ending to what had started with one letter of a name .   marshall sebatinsky could hardly talk .  he said to his wife   i swear i don t see how this happened .  i wouldn t have thought they knew me from a meson detector .   good lord  sophie  associate professor of physics at princeton .  think of it .    sophie said   do you suppose it was your talk at the a . p . s .  meetings .      don t see how .  it was a thoroughly uninspired paper once everyone in the division was done hacking at it .   he snapped his fingers .   it must have been princeton that was investigating me .  that s it .  you know all those forms i ve been filling out in the last six months  those interviews they wouldn t explain .  honestly    was beginning to think i was under suspicion as a subversive .   it was princeton investigating me .  they re thorough .    maybe it was your name   said sophie .   i mean the change .    watch me now .  my professional life will be my own finally .  i ll make my mark .  once i have a chance to do my work without   he stopped and turned to look at his wife .   my name .  you mean the   .    you didn t get the offer till after you changed your name  did you .    not till long after .  no  that part s just coincidence .  i ve told you before sophie  it was just a case of throwing out fifty dollars to please you .  lord  what a fool i ve felt all these months insisting on that stupid   .    sophie was instantly on the defensive .   i didn t make you do it  marshall .  i suggested it but i didn t nag you about it .  don t say i did .  besides  it did turn out well .  i m sure it was the name that did this .   sebatinsky smiled indulgently .   now that s superstition .    i don t care what you call it  but you re not changing your name back .    well  no  i suppose not .  i ve had so much trouble getting them to spell my name with an s  that the thought of making everyone move back is more than i want to face .  maybe i ought to change my name to jones  eh .   he laughed almost hysterically .   but sophie didn t .   you leave it alone .     oh  all right  i m just joking .   tell you what .  i ll step down to that old fellow s place one of these days and tell him everything worked out and slip him another tenner .  will that satisfy you .    he was exuberant enough to do so the next week .  he assumed no disguise this time .  he wore his glasses and his ordinary suit and was minus a hat .   he was even humming as he approached the store front and stepped to one side to allow a weary  sour faced woman to maneuver her twin baby carriage past .   he put his hand on the door handle and his thumb on the iron latch .  the latch didn t give to his thumb s downward pressure .  the door was locked .   the dusty  dim card with  numerologist  on it was gone  now that he looked .  another sign  printed and beginning to yellow and curl with the sunlight  said  to let .    sebatinslcy shrugged .  that was that .  he had tried to do the right thing .   haround  happily divested of corporeal excrescence  capered happily and his energy vortices glowed a dim purple over cubic hypermiles .  he said   have i won .  have i won .    mestack was withdrawn  his vortices almost a sphere of light in hyper space .     haven t calculated it yet .     well  go ahead .  you won t change the results any by taking a long time .   wowf  it s a relief to get back into clean energy .  it took me a microcycle of time as a corporeal body  a nearly used up one  too .  but it was worth it to show you .    mestack said   all right  i admit you stopped a nuclear war on the planet .     is that or is that not a class a effect .     it is a class a effect .  of course it is .     all right .  now check and see if i didn t get that class a effect with a ckss f stimulus .  i changed one letter of one name .     what .     oh  never mind .  it s all there .  i ve worked it out for you .    mestack said reluctantly   i yield .  a class f stimulus .     then i win .  admit it .     neither one of us will win when the watchman gets a look at this .    haround  who had been an elderly numerologist on earth and was still somewhat unsettled with relief at no longer being one  said   you weren t worried about that when you made the bet .     i didn t think you d be fool enough to go through with it .     heat waste .  besides  why worry .  the watchman will never detect a ckss f stimulus .     maybe not  but he ll detect a class a effect .  those corporeals will still be around after a dozen mkrocycles .  the watchman will notice that .     the trouble with you  mestack  is that you don t want to pay off .  you re stalling .     i ll pay .  but just wait till the watchman finds out we ve been working on an unassigned problem and made an unallowed for change .  of course  if we   he paused .   haround said   all right  we ll change it back .  he ll never know .    there was a crafty glow to mestack s brightening energy pattern .   you ll need another class f stimulus if you expect him not to notice .    haround hesitated .   i can do it .     i doubt it .     i could .     would you be willing to bet on that  too .   jubilation was creeping into mestack s radiations .    sure   said the goaded haround .   i ll put those corporeals right back where they were and the watchman will never know the difference .    mestack followed through his advantage .   suspend the first bet  then .  triple the stakes on the second .    the mounting eagerness of the gamble caught at haround  too .   all right  i m game .  triple the stakes .     done  then .     done .    the last question  the last question was asked for the first time  half in jest  on may           at a time when humanity first stepped into the light .  the question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs  and it happened this way   alexander adell and bertram lupov were two of the faithful attendants of multivac .  as well as any human beings could  they knew what lay behind the cold  clicking  flashing face miles and miles of face of that giant computer .  they had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole .   multivac was self adjusting and self correcting .  it had to be  for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough .   so adell and lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially  yet as well as any men could .  they fed it data  adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued .  certainly they  and all others like them  were fully entitled to share in the glory that was multivac s .   for decades  multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the moon  mars  and venus  but past that  earth s poor resources could not support the ships .  too much energy was needed for the long trips .  earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency  but there was only so much of both .   but slowly multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally  and on may           what had been theory  became fact .   copyright         by columbia publications  inc .   the energy of the sun was stored  converted  and utilized directly on a planet wide scale .  all earth turned off its burning coal  its fissioning uranium  and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station  one mile in diameter  circling the earth at half the distance of the moon .  all earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower .   seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and adell and lupov finally managed to escape from the public function  and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them  in the deserted underground chambers  where portions of the mighty buried body of multivac showed .  unattended  idling  sorting data with contented lazy clickings  multivac  too  had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that .  they had no intention  originally  of disturbing it .   they had brought a bottle with them  and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle .    it s amazing when you think of it   said adell .  his broad face had lines of weariness in it  and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod  watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about .   all the energy we can possibly ever use for free .  enough energy  if we wanted to draw on it  to melt all earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron  and still never miss the energy so used .  all the energy we could ever use  forever and forever and forever .    lupov cocked his head sidways .  he had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary  and he wanted to be contrary now  partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware .   not forever   he said .    oh  hell  just about forever .  till the sun runs down  bert .     that s not forever .     all right  then .  billions and billions of years .  twenty billion  maybe .  are you satisfied .    lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink .   twenty billion years isn t forever .     well  it will last our time  won t it .     so would the coal and uranium .     all right  but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the solar station  and it can go to pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel .  you can t do that on coal and uranium .  ask multivac  if you don t believe me .       don t have to ask multivac .    know that .     then stop running down what multivac s done for us   said adell  blazing up .   it did all right .     who says it didn t .  what i say is that a sun won t last forever .  that s all i m saying .  we re safe for twenty billion years  but then what .   lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other .   and don t say we ll switch to another sun .    there was silence for a while .  adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally  and lupov s eyes slowly closed .  they rested .   then lupov s eyes snapped open .   you re thinking we ll switch to another sun when ours is done  aren t you .     i m not thinking .     sure you are .  you re weak on logic  that s the trouble with you .  you re like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one .  he wasn t worried  you see  because he figured when one tree got wet through  he would just get under another one .     i get it   said adell .   don t shout .  when the sun is done  the other stars will be gone  too .     darn right they will   muttered lupov .   it all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion  whatever that was  and it ll all have an end when all the stars run down .  some run down faster than others .  hell  the giants won t last a hundred million years .  the sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are .  but just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark .  entropy has to increase to maximum  that s all .     i know all about entropy   said adell  standing on his dignity .    the hell you do .     i know as much as you do .     then you know everything s got to run down someday .     au right .  who says they won t .     you did  you poor sap .  you said we had all the energy we needed  forever .  you said  forever .      it was adell s turn to be contrary .   maybe we can build things up again someday   he said .    never .     why not .  someday .     never .     ask multivac .     you ask multivac .  i dare you .  five dollars says it can t be done .    adell was just drunk enough to try  just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which  in words  might have corresponded to this  will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age .   or maybe it could be put more simply like this  how can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased .   multivac fell dead and silent .  the slow flashing of lights ceased  the distant sounds of clicking relays ended .   then  just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer  there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to  that portion of multivac .  five words were printed  insufficient data for  meaningful answer .    no bet   whispered lupov .  they left hurriedly .  by next morning  the two  plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth  had forgotten the incident .    errodd  jerrodine  and jerrodette i and ii watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non time lapse .  at once  the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble disk  centered .    that s x      said jerrodd confidently .  his thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened .   the little jerrodettes  both girls  had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self conscious over the momentary sensation of inside outness .  they buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother  screaming   we ve reached x    we ve reached x    we ve     quiet  children   said jerrodine sharply .   are you sure  jerrodd .     what is there to be but sure .   asked jerrodd  glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling .  it ran the length of the room  disappearing through the wall at either end .  it was as long as the ship .   jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a microvac  that one asked it questions if one wished  that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination  of feeding on energies from the various sub galactic power stations  of computing the equations for the hyperspatial jumps .   jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship .   someone had once told jerrodd that the  ac  at the end of  microvac  stood for  analog computer  in ancient english  but he was on the edge of forgetting even that .   jerrodine s eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate .   i can t help it .  i feel funny about leaving earth .     why  for pete s sake .   demanded jerrodd .   we had nothing there .  we ll have everything on x    .  you won t be alone .  you won t be a pioneer .  there are over a million people on the planet already .  good lord  our greatgrandchildren will be looking for new worlds because x    will be overcrowded .   then  after a reflective pause   i tell you  it s a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing .     i know  i know   said jerrodine miserably .   jerrodette i said promptly   our microvac is the best microvac in the world .     i think so  too   said jerrodd  tousling her hair .   it was a nice feeling to have a microvac of your own and jerrodd was glad  he was part of his generation and no other .  in his father s youth  the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land .  there was only one to a planet .  planetary acs they were called .  they had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then  all at once  came refinement .  in place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest planetary ac could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship .   jerrodd felt uplifted  as he always did when he thought that his own personal microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive multivac that had first tamed the sun  and almost as complicated as earth s planetary ac  the largest  that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible .    so many stars  so many planets   sighed jerrodine  busy with her own thoughts .   i suppose families will be going out to new planets forever  the way we are now .     not forever   said jerrodd  with a smile .   it will all stop someday  but not for billions of years .  many billions .  even the stars run down  you know .  entropy must increase .     what s entropy  daddy .   shrilled jerrodette ii .    entropy  little sweet  is just a word which means the amount of running down of the universe .  everything runs down  you know  like your little walkie talkie robot  remember .     can t you just put in a new power unit  like with my robot .     the stars are the power units  dear .  once they re gone  there are no more power units .    jerrodette i at once set up a howl .   don t let them  daddy .  don t let the stars run down .     now look what you ve done   whispered jerrodine  exasperated .    how was i to know it would frighten them .   jerrodd whispered back .    ask the microvac   wailed jerrodette i .   ask him how to turn the stars on again .     go ahead   said jerrodine .   it will quiet them down .    jerrodette ii was beginning to cry  also .    jerrodd shrugged .   now  now  honeys .  i ll ask microvac .  don t worry  he ll tell us .    he asked the microvac  adding quickly   print the answer .    jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully   see now  the microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don t worry .    jerrodine said   and now  children  it s time for bed .  we ll be in our new home soon .    jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it  insufficient data for a meaningful answer .   he shrugged and looked at the visiplate .  x    was just ahead .   vj   x of lameth stared into the black depths of the three dimensional  small scale map of the galaxy and said   are we ridiculous  i wonder  in being so concerned about the matter .    mq   j of nicron shook his head .   i think not .  you know the galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion .    both seemed in their early twenties  both were tall and perfectly formed .    still   said vj   x   i hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the galactic council .     i wouldn t consider any other kind of report .  stir them up a bit .  we ve got to stir them up .    vj   x sighed .   space is infinite .  a hundred billion galaxies are there for the taking .  more .     a hundred billion is not infinite and it s getting less infinite all the time .  consider .  twenty thousand years ago  mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy  and a few centuries later  interstellar travel became possible .  it took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the galaxy .  now the population doubles every ten years    vj   x interrupted .   we can thank immortality for that .     very well .  immortality exists and we have to take it into account .  i admit it has its seamy side  this immortality .  the galactic ac has solved many problems for us  but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death  it has undone all its other solutions .     yet you wouldn t want to abandon life  i suppose .     not at all   snapped mq   j  softening it at once to   not yet .  i m by no means old enough .  how old are you .     two hundred twenty three .  and you .     i m still under two hundred .   but to get back to my point .  population doubles every ten years .  once this galaxy is filled  we ll have filled another in ten years .  another ten years and we ll have filled two more .  another decade  four more .  in a hundred years  we ll have filled a thousand galaxies .  in a thousand years  a million galaxies .  in ten thousand years  the entire known universe .  then what .    vj   x said   as a side issue  there s a problem of transportation .  i wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move galaxies of individuals from one galaxy to the next .     a very good point .  already  mankind consumes two sunpower units per year .     most of it s wasted .  after all  our own galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those .     granted  but even with a hundred per cent efficiency  we only stave off the end .  our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression  even faster than our population .  we ll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of galaxies .  a good point .  a very good point .     we ll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas .     or out of dissipated heat .   asked mq   j  sarcastically .    there may be some way to reverse entropy .  we ought to ask the galactic ac .    vj   x was not really serious  but mq   j pulled out his ac contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him .    i ve half a mind to   he said .   it s something the human race will have to face someday .    he stared somberly at his small ac contact .  it was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself  but it was connected through hyperspace with the great galactic ac that served all mankind .  hyperspace considered  it was an integral part of the galactic ac .   mq   j paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the galactic ac .  it was on a little world of its own  a spider webbing of force beams holding the matter within which surges of sub mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves .  yet despite its sub etheric workings  the galactic ac was known to be a full thousand feet across .   mq   j asked suddenly of his ac contact   can entropy ever be reversed .    vj   x looked startled and said at once   oh  say  i didn t really mean to have you ask that     why not .     we both know entropy can t be reversed .  you can t turn smoke and ash back into a tree .     do you have trees on your world .   asked mq   j .   the sound of the galactic ac startled them into silence .  its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small ac contact on the desk .  it said  there is  insufficient data for a meaningful answer .   vj   x said   see .    the two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the galactic council .   zee prime s mind spanned the new galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it .  he had never seen this one before .  would he ever see them all .  so many of them  each with its load of humanity .   but a load that was almost a dead weight .  more and more  the real essence of men was to be found out here  in space .   minds  not bodies .  the immortal bodies remained back on the planets  in suspension over the eons .  sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer .  few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng  but what matter .  there was little room in the universe for new individuals .   zee prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind .      am zee prime   said zee prime .   and you .     i am dee sub wun .  your galaxy .     we call it only the galaxy .  and you .     we call ours the same .  all men call their galaxy their galaxy and nothing more .  why not .     true .  since all galaxies are the same .     not all galaxies .  on one particular galaxy the race of man must have originated .  that makes it different .    zee prime said   on which one .     i cannot say .  the universal ac would know .     shall we ask him .  i am suddenly curious .    zee prime s perceptions broadened until the galaxies themselves shrank and became a new  more diffuse powdering on a much larger background .  so many hundreds of billions of them  all with their immortal beings  all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space .  and yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original galaxy .  one of them had  in its vague and distant past  a period when it was the only galaxy populated by man .   zee prime was consumed with curiosity to see this galaxy and he called out   universal ac .  on which galaxy did mankind originate .    the universal ac heard  for on every world and throughout space  it had its receptors ready  and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the universal ac kept itself aloof .   zee prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of universal ac  and he reported only a shining globe  two feet across  difficult to see .    but how can that be all of universal ac .   zee prime had asked .    most of it   had been the answer   is in hyperspace .  in what form it is there i cannot imagine .    nor could anyone  for the day had long since passed  zee prime knew  when any man had any part of the making of a universal ac .  each universal ac designed and constructed its successor .  each  during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate  more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged .   the universal ac interrupted zee prime s wandering thoughts  not with   words  but with guidance .  zee prime s mentality was guided into the dim  .  sea of galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars .   a thought came  infinitely distant  but infinitely clear .   this is the origi   i nal galaxy of man .      but it was the same after all  the same as any other  and zee prime stifled his disappointment .   dee sub wun  whose mind had accompanied the other  said suddenly   and is one of these stars the original star of man .   the universal ac said   man s original star has gone nova .  it is a  white dwarf .     did the men upon it die .   asked zee prime  startled and without thinking .   the universal ac said   a new world  as in such cases  was constructed for their physical bodies in time .     yes  of course   said zee prime  but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so .  his mind released its hold on the original galaxy of man  let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points .  he never wanted to see it again .   dee sub wun said   what is wrong .     the stars are dying .  the original star is dead .     they must all die .  why not .     but when all energy is gone  our bodies will finally die  and you and i with them .     it will take billions of years .       do not wish it to happen even after billions of years .  universal ac .  how may stars be kept from dying .    dee sub wun said in amusement   you re asking how entropy might be reversed in direction .    and the universal ac answered   there is as yet insufficient data  for a meaningful answer .    zee prime s thoughts fled back to his own galaxy .  he gave no further thought to dee sub wun  whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light years away  or on the star next to zee prime s own .  it didn t matter .   unhappily  zee prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own .  if the stars must someday die  at least some could yet be built .   man considered with himself  for in a way  man  mentally  was one .  he consisted of a trillion  trillion  trillion ageless bodies  each in its place  each resting quiet and incorruptible  each cared for by perfect automatons  equally incorruptible  while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other  indistinguishable .   man said   the universe is dying .    man looked about at the dimming galaxies .  the giant stars  spendthrifts  were gone long ago  back in the dimmest of the dim far past .  almost all stars were white dwarfs  fading to the end .   new stars had been built of the dust between the stars  some by natural processes  some by man himself  and those were going  too .  white dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released  new  stars built  but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed  and those would come to an end  too .   man said   carefully husbanded  as directed by the cosmic ac  the energy that is even yet left in all the universe will last for billions of years .     but even so   said man   eventually it will all come to an end .  however it may be husbanded  however stretched out  the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored .  entropy must increase forever to the maximum .    man said   can entropy not be reversed .  let us ask the cosmic ac .    the cosmic ac surrounded them but not in space .  not a fragment of it was in space .  it was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy .  the question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that man could comprehend .    cosmic ac   said man   how may entropy be reversed .    the cosmic ac said   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .    man said   collect additional data .    the cosmic ac said   i will do so .  i have been doing so for a  hundred billion years .  my predecessors and i have been asked this question many times .  all the data i have remains insufficient .     will there come a time   said man   when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances .   the cosmic ac said   no problem is insoluble in all conceivable  circumstances .    man said   when will you have enough data to answer the question .   the cosmic ac said   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .     will you keep working on it .   asked man .  the cosmic ac said   i will .   man said   we shall wait .    the stars and galaxies died and snuffed out  and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down .   one by one man fused with ac  each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain .   man s last mind paused before fusion  looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter  agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out  asymptotically  to the absolute zero .   man said   ac  is this the end .  can this chaos not be reversed into the universe once more .  can that not be done .    ac said   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .    man s last mind fused and only ac existed and that in hyperspace .   matter and energy had ended and with it space and time .  even ac existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to ac far less than was a man to man .   all other questions had been answered  and until this last question was answered also  ac might not release his consciousness .   all collected data had come to a final end .  nothing was left to be collected .   but all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships .   a timeless interval was spent in doing that .   and it came to pass that ac learned how to reverse the direction of entropy .   but there was now no man to whom ac might give the answer of the last question .  no matter .  the answer by demonstration would take care of that  too .   for another timeless interval  ac thought how best to do this .  carefully  ac organized the program .   the consciousness of ac encompassed all of what had once been a universe and brooded over what was now chaos .  step by step  it must be done .   and ac said   let there be light .    and there was light   the ugly little boy  edith fellowes smoothed her working smock as she always did before opening the elaborately locked door and stepping across the invisible dividing line between the is and the is not .  she carried her notebook and her pen although she no longer took notes except when she felt the absolute need for some report .   this time she also carried a suitcase .    games for the boy   she had said  smiling  to the guard who had long since stopped even thinking of questioning her and who waved her on .    and  as always  the ugly little boy knew that she had entered and came running to her  crying   miss fellowes miss fellowes   in his soft  slurring way .    timmie   she said  and passed her hand over the shaggy  brown hair on his misshapen little head .   what s wrong .    he said   will ferry be back to play again .  i m sorry about what happened .     never mind that now  timmie .  is that why you ve been crying .    he looked away .   not just about that  miss fellowes .  i dreamed again .     the same dream .   miss fellowes  lips set .  of course  the jerry affair would bring back the dream .   he nodded .  his too large teeth showed as he tried to smile and the lips of his forward thrusting mouth stretched wide .   when will i be big enough to go out there  miss fellowes .     soon   she said softly  feeling her heart break .   soon .    copyright         by galaxy publishing corporation .   miss fellowes let him take her hand and enjoyed the warm touch of the thick dry skin of his palm .  he led her through the three rooms that made up the whole of stasis section one comfortable enough  yes  but an eternal prison for the ugly little boy all the seven  was it seven .   years of his life .   he led her to the one window  looking out onto a scrubby woodland section of the world of is  now hidden by night   where a fence and painted instructions allowed no men to wander without permission .   he pressed his nose against the window .   out there  miss fellowes .     better places .  nicer places   she said sadly as she looked at his poor little imprisoned face outlined in profile against the window .  the forehead retreated flatly and his hair lay down in tufts upon it .  the back of his skull bulged and seemed to make the head overheavy so that it sagged and bent forward  forcing the whole body into a stoop .  already  bony ridges were beginning to bulge the skin above his eyes .  his wide mouth thrust forward more prominently than did his wide and flattened nose and he had no chin to speak of  only a jawbone that curved smoothly down and back .  he was small for his years and his stumpy legs were bowed .   he was a very ugly little boy and edith fellowes loved him dearly .   her own face was behind his line of vision  so she allowed her lips the luxury of a tremor .   they would not kill him .  she would do anything to prevent it .  anything .  she opened the suitcase and began taking out the clothes it contained .   edith fellowes had crossed the threshold of stasis  inc .  for the first time just a little over three years before .  she hadn t  at that time  the slightest idea as to what stasis meant or what the place did .  no one did then  except those who worked there .  in fact  it was only the day after she arrived that the news broke upon the world .   at the time  it was just that they had advertised for a woman with knowledge of physiology  experience with clinical chemistry  and a love for children .  edith fellowes had been a nurse in a maternity ward and believed she fulfilled those qualifications .   gerald hoskins  whose name plate on the desk included a ph . d .  after the name  scratched his cheek with his thumb and looked at her steadily .   miss fellowes automatically stiffened and felt her face  with its slightly asymmetric nose and its a trifle too heavy eyebrows  twitch .   he s no dreamboat himself  she thought resentfully .  he s getting fat and bald and he s got a sullen mouth .   but the salary mentioned had been considerably higher than she had expected  so she waited .   hoskins said   now do you really love children .     i wouldn t say i did if i didn t .     or do you just love pretty children .  nice chubby children with cute little button noses and gurgly ways .    miss fellowes said   children are children  dr .  hoskins  and the ones that aren t pretty are just the ones who may happen to need help most .     then suppose we take you on     you mean you re offering me the job now .    he smiled briefly  and for a moment  his broad face had an absentminded charm about it .  he said   i make quick decisions .  so far the offer is tentative  however .  i may make as quick a decision to let you go .  are you ready to take the chance .    miss fellowes clutched at her purse and calculated just as swiftly as she could  then ignored calculations and followed impulse .   all right .     fine .  we re going to form the stasis tonight and i think you had better be there to take over at once .  that will be at   p . m .  and i d appreciate it if you could be here at      .     but what     fine .  fine .  that will be all now .   on signal  a smiling secretary came in to usher her out .       miss fellowes stared back at dr .  hoskins  closed door for a moment .  what was stasis .  what had this large barn of a building with its badged employees  its makeshift corridors  and its unmistakable air of engineering  to do with children .   she wondered if she should go back that evening or stay away and teach that arrogant man a lesson .  but she knew she would be back if only out of sheer frustration .  she would have to find out about the children .   she came back at      and did not have to announce herself .  one after another  men and women seemed to know her and to know her function .  she found herself all but placed on skids as she was moved inward .   dr .  hoskins was there  but he only looked at her distantly and murmured   miss fellowes .    he did not even suggest that she take a seat  but she drew one calmly up to the railing and sat down .   they were on a balcony  looking down into a large pit  filled with instruments that looked like a cross between the control panel of a spaceship and the working face of a computer .  on one side were partitions that seemed to make up an unceilinged apartment  a giant dollhouse into the rooms of which she could look from above .   she could see an electronic cooker and a freeze space unit in one room and a washroom arrangement off another .  and surely the object she made out in another room could only be part of a bed  a small bed .   hoskins was speaking to another man and  with miss fellowes  they made up the total occupancy of the balcony .  hoskins did not offer to introduce the other man  and miss fellowes eyed him surreptitiously .  he was thin and quite fine looking in a middle aged way .  he had a small mustache and keen eyes that seemed to busy themselves with everything .   he was saying   i won t pretend for one moment that i understand all this  dr .  hoskins    mean  except as a layman  a reasonably intelligent layman  may be expected to understand it .  still  if there s one part i understand less than another  it s this matter of selectivity .  you can only reach out so far  that seems sensible  things get dimmer the further you go  it takes more energy .   but then  you can only reach out so near .  that s the puzzling part .     i can make it seem less paradoxical  deveney  if you will allow me to use an analogy .     miss fellowes placed the new man the moment she heard his name  and despite herself was impressed .  this was obviously candide deveney  the science writer of the telenews  who was notoriously at the scene of every major scientific break through .  she even recognized his face as one she saw on the news plate when the landing on mars had been announced .   so dr .  hoskins must have something important here .    by all means use an analogy   said deveney ruefully   if you think it will help .     well  then  you can t read a book with ordinary sized print if it is held six feet from your eyes  but you can read it if you hold it one foot from your eyes .  so far  the closer the better .  if you bring the book to within one inch of your eyes  however  you ve lost it again .  there is such a thing as being too close  you see .     hmm   said deveney .    or take another example .  your right shoulder is about thirty inches from the tip of your right forefinger and you can place your right forefinger on your right shoulder .  your right elbow is only half the distance from the tip of your right forefinger  it should by all ordinary logic be easier to reach  and yet you cannot place your right finger on your right elbow .  again  there is such a thing as being too close .    deveney said   may i use these analogies in my story .     well  of course .  only too glad .  i ve been waiting long enough for someone like you to have a story .  i ll give you anything else you want .  it is time  finally  that we want the world looking over our shoulder .  they ll see something .     miss fellowes found herself admiring his calm certainty despite herself .  there was strength there .    deveney said   how far out will you reach .     forty thousand years .    miss fellowes drew in her breath sharply .   years .   there was tension in the air .  the men at the controls scarcely moved .  one man at a microphone spoke into it in a soft monotone  in short phrases that made no sense to miss fellowes .   deveney  leaning over the balcony railing with an intent stare  said   will we see anything  dr .  hoskins .     what .  no .  nothing till the job is done .  we detect indirectly  something on the principle of radar  except that we use mesons rather than radiation .  mesons reach backward under the proper conditions .  some are reflected and we must analyze the reflections .     that sounds difficult .    hoskins smiled again  briefly as always .   it is the end product of fifty years of research  forty years of it before i entered the field .   yes  it s difficult .    the man at the microphone raised one hand .   hoskins said   we ve had the fix on one particular moment in time for weeks  breaking it  remaking it after calculating our own movements in time  making certain that we could handle time flow with sufficient precision .  this must work now .    but his forehead glistened .   edith fellowes found herself out of her seat and at the balcony railing  but there was nothing to see .   the man at the microphone said quietly   now .    there was a space of silence sufficient for one breath and then the sound of a terrified little boy s scream from the dollhouse rooms .  terror .  piercing terror .   miss fellowes  head twisted in the direction of the cry .  a child was involved .  she had forgotten .   and hoskins  fist pounded on the railing and he said in a tight voice  trembling with triumph   did it .    miss fellowes was urged down the short  spiral flight of steps by the hard press of hoskins  palm between her shoulder blades .  he did not speak to her .   the men who had been at the controls were standing about now  smiling  smoking  watching the three as they entered on the main floor .  a very soft buzz sounded from the direction of the dollhouse .   hoskins said to deveney   it s perfectly safe to enter stasis .  i ve done it a thousand times .  there s a queer sensation which is momentary and means nothing .    he stepped through an open door in mute demonstration  and deveney  smiling stiffly and drawing an obviously deep breath  followed him .   hoskins said   miss fellowes .  please .   he crooked his forefinger impatiently .   miss fellowes nodded and stepped stiffly through .  it was as though a ripple went through her  an internal tickle .   but once inside all seemed normal .  there was the smell of the fresh wood of the dollhouse and of of soil somehow .   there was silence now  no voice at last  but there was the dry shuffling of feet  a scrabbling as of a hand over wood then a low moan .    where is it .   asked miss fellowes in distress .  didn t these fool men care .   the boy was in the bedroom  at least the room with the bed in it .   it was standing naked  with its small  dirt smeared chest heaving raggedly .  a bushel of dirt and coarse grass spread over the floor at his bare brown feet .  the smell of soil came from it and a touch of something fetid .   hoskins followed her horrified glance and said with annoyance   you can t pluck a boy cleanly out of time  miss fellowes .  we had to take some of the surroundings with it for safety .  or would you have preferred to have it arrive here minus a leg or with only half a head .     please .   said miss fellowes  in an agony of revulsion .   are we just to stand here .  the poor child is frightened .  and it s filthy .    she was quite correct .  it was smeared with encrusted dirt and grease and had a scratch on its thigh that looked red and sore .   as hoskins approached him  the boy  who seemed to be something over three years in age  hunched low and backed away rapidly .  he lifted his upper lip and snarled in a hissing fashion like a cat .  with a rapid gesture  hoskins seized both the child s arms and lifted him  writhing and screaming  from the floor .   miss fellowes said   hold him  now .  he needs a warm bath first .  he needs to be cleaned .  have you the equipment .  if so  have it brought here  and i ll need to have help in handling him just at first .  then  too  for heaven s sake  have all this trash and filth removed .    she was giving the orders now and she felt perfectly good about that .  and because now she was an efficient nurse  rather than a confused spectator  she looked at the child with a clinical eye and hesitated for one shocked moment .  she saw past the dirt and shrieking  past the thrashing of limbs and useless twisting .  she saw the boy himself .   it was the ugliest little boy she had ever seen .  it was horribly ugly from misshapen head to bandy legs .   she got the boy cleaned with three men helping her and with others milling about in their efforts to clean the room .  she worked in silence and with a sense of outrage  annoyed by the continued stragglings and outcries of the boy and by the undignified drenchings of soapy water to which she was subjected .   dr .  hoskins had hinted that the child would not be pretty  but that was far from stating that it would be repulsively deformed .  and there was a stench about the boy that soap and water was only alleviating little by little .   she had the strong desire to thrust the boy  soaped as he was  into hoskins  arms and walk out  but there was the pride of profession .  she had  accepted an assignment  after all .   and there would be the look in his eyes .  a cold look that would read  only pretty children  miss fellowes .   he was standing apart from them  watching coolly from a distance with a half smile on his face when he caught her eyes  as though amused at her outrage .   she decided she would wait a while before quitting .  to do so now would only demean her .   then  when the boy was a bearable pink and smelled of scented soap  she felt better anyway .  his cries changed to whimpers of exhaustion as he watched carefully  eyes moving in quick frightened suspicion from one to another of those in the room .  his cleanness accentuated his thin nakedness as he shivered with cold after his bath .   miss fellowes said sharply   bring me a nightgown for the child .    a nightgown appeared at once .  it was as though everything were ready and yet nothing were ready unless she gave orders  as though they were deliberately leaving this in her charge without help  to test her .   the newsman  deveney  approached and said   i ll hold him  miss .  you won t get it on yourself .     thank you   said miss fellowes .  and it was a battle indeed  but the nightgown went on  and when the boy made as though to rip it off  she slapped his hand sharply .   the boy reddened  but did not cry .  he stared at her and the splayed fingers of one hand moved slowly across the flannel of the nightgown  feeling the strangeness of it .   miss fellowes thought desperately  well  what next .   everyone seemed in suspended animation  waiting for her even the ugly little boy .   miss fellowes said sharply   have you provided food .  milk .    they had .  a mobile unit was wheeled in  with its refrigeration compartment containing three quarts of milk  with a warming unit and a supply of fortifications in the form of vitamin drops  copper cobalt iron syrup and others she had no time to be concerned with .  there was a variety of canned self warming junior foods .   she used milk  simply milk  to begin with .  the radar unit heated the milk to a set temperature in a matter of ten seconds and clicked off  and she put some in a saucer .  she had a certainty about the boy s savagery .  he wouldn t know how to handle a cup .   miss fellowes nodded and said to the boy   drink .  drink .   she made a gesture as though to raise the milk to her mouth .  the boy s eyes followed but he made no move .   suddenly  the nurse resorted to direct measures .  she seized the boy s upper arm in one hand and dipped the other in the milk .  she dashed the milk across his lips  so that it dripped down cheeks and receding chin .   for a moment  the child uttered a high pitched cry  then his tongue moved over his wetted lips .  miss fellowes stepped back .   the boy approached the saucer  bent toward it  then looked up and behind sharply as though expecting a crouching enemy  bent again and licked at the milk eagerly  like a cat .  he made a slurping noise .  he did not use his hands to lift the saucer .   miss fellowes allowed a bit of the revulsion she felt show on her face .  she couldn t help it .   deveney caught that  perhaps .  he said   does the nurse know  dr .  hos kins .     know what .   demanded miss fellowes .   deveney hesitated  but hoskins  again that look of detached amusement on his face  said   well  tell her .    deveney addressed miss fellowes .   you may not suspect it  miss  but you happen to be the first civilized woman in history ever to be taking care of a neanderthal youngster .    she turned on hoskins with a kind of controlled ferocity .   you might have told me  doctor .     why .  what difference does it make .     you said a child .     isn t that a child .  have you ever had a puppy or a kitten  miss fellowes .  are those closer to the human .  if that were a baby chimpanzee  would you be repelled .  you re a nurse  miss fellowes .  your record places you in a maternity ward for three years .  have you ever refused to take care of a deformed infant .    miss fellowes felt her case slipping away .  she said  with much less decision   you might have told me .     and you would have refused the position .  well  do you refuse it now .   he gazed at her coolly  while deveney watched from the other side of the room  and the neanderthal child  having finished the milk and licked the plate  looked up at her with a wet face and wide  longing eyes .   the boy pointed to the milk and suddenly burst out in a short series of sounds repeated over and over  sounds made up of gutturals and elaborate tongue clickings .   miss fellowes said  in surprise   why  he talks .     of course   said hoskins .   homo neanderthalensis is not a truly separate species  but rather a subspecies of homo sapiens .  why shouldn t he talk .  he s probably asking for more milk .    automatically  miss fellowes reached for the bottle of milk  but hoskins seized her wrist .   now  miss fellowes  before we go any further  are you staying on the job .    miss fellowes shook free in annoyance   won t you feed him if i don t .  i ll stay with him for a while .    she poured the milk .   hoskins said   we are going to leave you with the boy  miss fellowes .  this is the only door to stasis number one and it is elaborately locked and guarded .  i ll want you to learn the details of the lock which will  of course  be keyed to your fingerprints as they are already keyed to mine .  the spaces overhead   he looked upward to the open ceilings of the dollhouse   are also guarded and we will be warned if anything untoward takes place in here .    miss fellowes said indignantly   you mean i ll be under view .   she thought suddenly of her own survey of the room interiors from the balcony .    no  no   said hoskins seriously   your privacy will be respected completely .  the view will consist of electronic symbolism only  which only a computer will deal with .  now you will stay with him tonight  miss fellowes  and every night until further notice .  you will be relieved during the day according to some schedule you will find convenient .  we will allow you to arrange that .    miss fellowes looked about the dollhouse with a puzzled expression .   but why all this  dr .  hoskins .  is the boy dangerous .     it s a matter of energy  miss fellowes .  he must never be allowed to leave these rooms .  never .  not for an instant .  not for any reason .  not to save his life .  not even to save your life  miss fellowes .  is that clear .    miss fellowes raised her chin .   i understand the orders  dr .  hoskins  and the nursing profession is accustomed to placing its duties ahead of self preservation .     good .  you can always signal if you need anyone .   and the two men left .   miss fellowes turned to the boy .  he was watching her and there was still milk in the saucer .  laboriously  she tried to show him how to lift the saucer and place it to his lips .  he resisted  but let her touch him without crying out .   always  his frightened eyes were on her  watching  watching for the one false move .  she found herself soothing him  trying to move her hand very slowly toward his hair  letting him see it every inch of the way  see there was no harm in it .   and she succeeded in stroking his hair for an instant .    she said   i m going to have to show you how to use the bathroom .  do you think you can learn .    she spoke quietly  kindly  knowing he would not understand the words but hoping he would respond to the calmness of the tone .   the boy launched into a clicking phrase again .   she said   may i take your hand .    she held out hers and the boy looked at it .  she left it outstretched and waited .  the boy s own hand crept forward toward hers .    that s right   she said .   it approached within an inch of hers and then the boy s courage failed him .  he snatched it back .    well   said miss fellowes calmly   we ll try again later .  would you like to sit down here .   she patted the mattress of the bed .   the hours passed slowly and progress was minute .  she did not succeed either with bathroom or with the bed .  in fact  after the child had given unmistakable signs of sleepiness he lay down on the bare ground and then  with a quick movement  rolled beneath the bed .   she bent to look at him and his eyes gleamed out at her as he tongue clicked at her .    all right   she said   if you feel safer there  you sleep there .    she closed the door to the bedroom and retired to the cot that had been placed for her use in the largest room .  at her insistence  a make shift canopy had been stretched over it .  she thought  those stupid men will have to place a mirror in this room and a larger chest of drawers and a separate washroom if they expect me to spend nights here .   it was difficult to sleep .  she found herself straining to hear possible sounds in the next room .  he couldn t get out  could he .  the walls were sheer and impossibly high but suppose the child could climb like a monkey .  well  hoskins said there were observational devices watching through the ceiling .   suddenly she thought  can he be dangerous .  physically dangerous .   surely  hoskins couldn t have meant that .  surely  he would not have left her here alone  if   she tried to laugh at herself .  he was only a three  or four year old child .  still  she had not succeeded in cutting his nails .  if he should attack her with nails and teeth while she slept   her breath came quickly .  oh  ridiculous  and yet   she listened with painful attentiveness  and this time she heard the sound .   the boy was crying .   not shrieking in fear or anger  not yelling or screaming .  it was crying softly  and the cry was the heartbroken sobbing of a lonely  lonely child .   for the first time  miss fellowes thought with a pang  poor thing .   of course  it was a child  what did the shape of its head matter .  it was a child that had been orphaned as no child had ever been orphaned before .  not only its mother and father were gone  but all its species .  snatched callously out of time  it was now the only creature of its kind in the world .  the last .  the only .   she felt pity for it strengthen  and with it shame at her own callousness .  tucking her own nightgown carefully about her calves  incongruously  she thought  tomorrow i ll have to bring in a bathrobe  she got out of bed and went into the boy s room .    little boy   she called in a whisper .   little boy .    she was about to reach under the bed  but she thought of a possible bite and did not .  instead  she turned on the night light and moved the bed .   the poor thing was huddled in the corner  knees up against his chin  looking up at her with blurred and apprehensive eyes .   in the dim light  she was not aware of his repulsiveness .    poor boy   she said   poor boy .   she felt him stiffen as she stroked his hair  then relax .   poor boy .  may i hold you .    she sat down on the floor next to him and slowly and rhythmically stroked his hair  his cheek  his arm .  softly  she began to sing a slow and gentle song .   he lifted his head at that  staring at her mouth in the dimness  as though wondering at the sound .   she maneuvered him closer while he listened to her .  slowly  she pressed gently against the side of his head  until it rested on her shoulder .  she put her arm under his thighs and with a smooth and unhurried motion lifted him into her lap .   she continued singing  the same simple verse over and over  while she rocked back and forth  back and forth .   he stopped crying  and after a while the smooth burr of his breathing showed he was asleep .   with infinite care  she pushed his bed back against the wall and laid him down .  she covered him and stared down .  his face looked so peaceful and little boy as he slept .  it didn t matter so much that it was so ugly .  really .   she began to tiptoe out  then thought  if he wakes up .   she came back  battled irresolutely with herself  then sighed and slowly got into bed with the child .   it was too small for her .  she was cramped and uneasy at the lack of canopy  but the child s hand crept into hers and  somehow  she fell asleep in that position .   she awoke with a start and a wild impulse to scream .  the latter she just managed to suppress into a gurgle .  the boy was looking at her  wide eyed .  it took her a long moment to remember getting into bed with him  and now  slowly  without unfixing her eyes from his  she stretched one leg carefully and let it touch the floor  then the other one .   she cast a quick and apprehensive glance toward the open ceiling  then tensed her muscles for quick disengagement .   but at that moment  the boy s stubby fingers reached out and touched her lips .  he said something .   she shrank at the touch .  he was terribly ugly in the light of day .   the boy spoke again .  he opened his own mouth and gestured with his hand as though something were coming out .   miss fellowes guessed at the meaning and said tremulously   do you want me to sing .    the boy said nothing but stared at her mouth .   in a voice slightly off key with tension  miss fellowes began the little song she had sung the night before and the ugly little boy smiled .  he swayed clumsily in rough time to the music and made a little gurgly sound that might have been the beginnings of a laugh .   miss fellowes sighed inwardly .  music hath charms to soothe the savage breast .  it might help   she said   you wait .  let me get myself fixed up .  it will just take a minute .  then i ll make breakfast for you .    she worked rapidly  conscious of the lack of ceiling at all times .  the boy remained in bed  watching her when she was in view .  she smiled at him at those times and waved .  at the end  he waved back  and she found herself being charmed by that .   finally  she said   would you like oatmeal with milk .   it took a moment to prepare  and then she beckoned to him .   whether he understood the gesture or followed the aroma  miss fellowes did not know  but he got out of bed .   she tried to show him how to use a spoon but he shrank away from it in fright .   time enough  she thought .   she compromised on insisting that he lift the bowl in his hands .  he did it clumsily enough and it was incredibly messy but most of it did get into him .   she tried the drinking milk in a glass this time  and the little boy whined when he found the opening too small for him to get his face into conveniently .  she held his hand  forcing it around the glass  making him tip it  forcing his mouth to the rim .   again a mess but again most went into him  and she was used to messes .   the washroom  to her surprise and relief  was a less frustrating matter .  he understood what it was she expected him to do .   she found herself patting his head  saying   good boy .  smart boy .    and to miss fellowes  exceeding pleasure  the boy smiled at that .   she thought  when he smiles  he s quite bearable .  really .   later in the day  the gentleman of the press arrived .   she held the boy in her arms and he clung to her wildly while across the open door they set cameras to work .  the commotion frightened the boy and he began to cry  but it was ten minutes before miss fellowes was allowed to retreat and put the boy in the next room .   she emerged again  flushed with indignation  walked out of the apartment  for the first time in eighteen hours  and closed the door behind her .   i think you ve had enough .  it will take me a while to quiet him .  go away .     sure  sure   said the gentlemen from the times herald .   but is that really a neanderthal or is this some kind of gag .     i assure you   said hoskins  voice  suddenly  from the background   that this is no gag .  the child is authentic homo neanderthalensis .     is it a boy or a girl .     boy   said miss fellowes briefly .    ape boy   said the gentleman from the news .   that s what we ve got here .  ape boy .  how does he act  nurse .     he acts exactly like a little boy   snapped miss fellowes  annoyed into the defensive   and he is not an ape boy .  his name is is timothy  timmie  and he is perfectly normal in his behavior .    she had chosen the name timothy at a venture .  it was the first that had occurred to her .    timmie the ape boy   said the gentleman from the news and  as it turned out  timmie the ape boy was the name under which the child became known to the world .   the gentleman from the globe turned to hoskins and said   doc  what do you expect to do with the ape boy .    hoskins shrugged .   my original plan was completed when i proved it possible to bring him here .  however  the anthropologists will be very interested  i imagine  and the physiologists .  we have here  after all  a creature which is at the edge of being human .  we should learn a great deal about ourselves and our ancestry from him .     how long will you keep him .     until such a time as we need the space more than we need him .  quite a while  perhaps .    the gentleman from the news said   can you bring it out into the open so we can set up sub etheric equipment and put on a real show .     i m sorry  but the child cannot be removed from stasis .     exactly what is stasis .     ah .   hoskins permitted himself one of his short smiles .   that would take a great deal of explanation  gentlemen .  in stasis  time as we know it doesn t exist .  those rooms are inside an invisible bubble that is not exactly part of our universe .  that is why the child could be plucked out of time as it was .     well  wait now   said the gentleman from the news discontentedly   what are you giving us .  the nurse goes into the room and out of it .     and so can any of you   said hoskins matter of factly .   you would be moving parallel to the lines of temporal force and no great energy gain or loss would be involved .  the child  however  was taken from the far past .  it moved across the lines and gained temporal potential .  to move it into the universe and into our own time would absorb enough energy to burn out every line in the place and probably blank out all power in the city of washington .  we had to store trash brought with him on the premises and will have to remove it little by little .    the newsmen were writing down sentences busily as hoskins spoke to  them .  they did not understand and they were sure their readers would not  but it sounded scientific and that was what counted .   the gentleman from the times herald said   would you be available for an all circuit interview tonight .     i think so   said hoskins at once  and they all moved off .   miss fellowes looked after them .  she understood all this about stasis and temporal force as little as the newsmen but she managed to get this much .  timmie s imprisonment  she found herself suddenly thinking of the little boy as timmie  was a real one and not one imposed by the arbitrary fiat of hoskins .  apparently  it was impossible to let him out of stasis at all  ever .   poor child .  poor child .   she was suddenly aware of his crying and she hastened in to console him .   miss fellowes did not have a chance to see hoskins on the all circuit hookup  and though his interview was beamed to every part of the world and even to the outpost on the moon  it did not penetrate the apartment in which miss fellowes and the ugly little boy lived .   but he was down the next morning  radiant and joyful .   miss fellowes said   did the interview go well .     extremely .  and how is timmie .    miss fellowes found herself pleased at the use of the name .   doing quite well .  now come out here  timmie  the nice gentleman will not hurt you .    but timmie stayed in the other room  with a lock of his matted hair showing behind the barrier of the door and  occasionally  the corner of an eye .    actually   said miss fellowes   he is settling down amazingly .  he is quite intelligent .     are you surprised .    she hesitated just a moment  then said   yes  i am .  i suppose   thought he was an ape boy .     well  ape boy or not  he s done a great deal for us .  he s put stasis  inc .  on the map .  we re in  miss fellowes  we re in .   it was as though he had to express his triumph to someone  even if only to miss fellowes .    oh .   she let him talk .   he put his hands in his pockets and said   we ve been working on a shoestring for ten years  scrounging funds a penny at a time wherever we could .  we had to shoot the works on one big show .  it was everything  or nothing .  and when i say the works  i mean it .  this attempt to bring in a neanderthal took every cent we could borrow or steal  and some of it was stolen funds for other projects  used for this one without permission .  if that experiment hadn t succeeded  i d have been through .    miss fellowes said abruptly   is that why there are no ceilings .     eh .   hoskins looked up .    was there no money for ceilings .     oh .  well  that wasn t the only reason .  we didn t really know in advance how old the neanderthal might be exactly .  we can detect only dimly in time  and he might have been large and savage .  it was possible we might have had to deal with him from a distance  like a caged animal .     but since that hasn t turned out to be so  i suppose you can build a ceiling now .     now  yes .  we have plenty of money  now .  funds have been promised from every source .  this is all wonderful  miss fellowes .   his broad face gleamed with a smile that lasted and when he left  even his back seemed to be smiling .   miss fellowes thought  he s quite a nice man when he s off guard and forgets about being scientific .   she wondered for an idle moment if he was married  then dismissed the thought in self embarrassment .    timmie   she called .   come here  timmie .    in the months that passed  miss fellowes felt herself grow to be an integral part of stasis  inc .  she was given a small office of her own with her name on the door  an office quite close to the dollhouse  as she never stopped calling timmie s stasis bubble  .  she was given a substantial raise .  the dollhouse was covered by a ceiling  its furnishings were elaborated and improved  a second washroom was added and even so  she gained an apartment of her own on the institute grounds and  on occasion  did not stay with timmie during the night .  an intercom was set up between the dollhouse and her apartment and timmie learned how to use it .   miss fellowes got used to timmie .  she even grew less conscious of his ugliness .  one day she found herself staring at an ordinary boy in the street and finding something bulgy and unattractive in his high domed forehead and jutting chin .  she had to shake herself to break the spell .   it was more pleasant to grow used to hoskins  occasional visits .  it was obvious he welcomed escape from his increasingly harried role as head of stasis  inc .   and that he took a sentimental interest in the child who had started it all  but it seemed to miss fellowes that he also enjoyed talking to her .    she had learned some facts about hoskins  too .  he had invented the method of analyzing the reflection of the past penetrating mesonic beam  he had invented the method of establishing stasis  his coldness was only an effort to hide a kindly nature  and  oh yes  he was married .    what miss fellowes could not get used to was the fact that she was engaged in a scientific experiment .  despite all she could do  she found herself getting personally involved to the point of quarreling with the physiologists .   on one occasion  hoskins came down and found her in the midst of a hot  urge to kill .  they had no right  they had no right  even if he was a neanderthal  he still wasn t an animal .   she was staring after them in a blind fury  staring out the open door and listening to timmie s sobbing  when she noticed hoskins standing before her .  he might have been there for minutes .   he said   may i come in .    she nodded curtly  then hurried to timmie  who clung to her  curling his little bandy legs still thin  so thin about her .   hoskins watched  then said gravely   he seems quite unhappy .    miss fellowes said   i don t blame him .  they re at him every day now with their blood samples and their probings .  they keep him on synthetic diets that i wouldn t feed a pig .     it s the sort of thing they can t try on a human  you know .     and they can t try it on timmie  either .  dr .  hoskins    insist .  you told me it was timmie s coming that put stasis  inc .  on the map .  if you have any gratitude for that at all  you ve got to keep them away from the poor thing at least until he s old enough to understand a little more .  after he s had a bad session with them  he has nightmares  he can t sleep .  now i warn you    she reached a sudden peak of fury   i m not letting them in here any more .     she realized that she had screamed that  but she couldn t help it .    she said more quietly   i know he s neanderthal but there s a great deal we don t appreciate about neanderthals .  i ve read up on them .  they had a culture of their own .  some of the greatest human inventions arose in neanderthal times .  the domestication of animals  for instance  the wheel  various techniques in grinding stone .  they even had spiritual yearnings .  they buried their dead and buried possessions with the body  showing they believed in a life after death .  it amounts to the fact that they invented religion .  doesn t that mean timmie has a right to human treatment .    she patted the little boy gently on his buttocks and sent him off into his playroom .  as the door was opened  hoskins smiled briefly at the display of toys that could be seen .   miss fellowes said defensively   the poor child deserves his toys .  it s all he has and he earns them with what he goes through .     no  no .  no objections  i assure you .  i was just thinking how you ve changed since the first day  when you were quite angry i had foisted a neanderthal on you .    miss fellowes said in a low voice   i suppose i didn t   and faded off .   hoskins changed the subject   how old would you say he is  miss fellowes .    she said   i can t say  since we don t know how neanderthals develop .  in size  he d only be three but neanderthals are smaller generally and with all the tampering they do with him  he probably isn t growing .  the way he s learning english  though  i d say he was well over four .     really .  i haven t noticed anything about learning english in the reports .     he won t speak to anyone but me .  for now  anyway .  he s terribly afraid of others  and no wonder .  but he can ask for an article of food  he can indicate any need practically  and he understands almost anything i say .  of course    she watched him shrewdly  trying to estimate if this was the time    his development may not continue .     why not .     any child needs stimulation and this one lives a life of solitary confinement .  i do what i can  but i m not with him all the time and i m not all he needs .  what i mean  dr .  hoskins  is that he needs another boy to play with .    hoskins nodded slowly .   unfortunately  there s only one of him  isn t there .  poor child .    miss fellowes warmed to him at once .  she said   you do like timmie  don t you .   it was so nice to have someone else feel like that .    oh  yes   said hoskins  and with his guard down  she could see the weariness in his eyes .   miss fellowes dropped her plans to push the matter at once .  she said  with real concern   you look worn out  dr .  hoskins .     do i  miss fellowes .  i ll have to practice looking more lifelike then .     i suppose stasis  inc .  is very busy and that that keeps you very busy .    hoskins shrugged .   you suppose right .  it s a matter of animal  vegetable  and mineral in equal parts  miss fellowes .  but then  i suppose you haven t ever seen our displays .     actually  i haven t .   but it s not because i m not interested .  it s just that i ve been so busy .     well  you re not all that busy right now   he said with impulsive decision .   i ll call for you tomorrow at eleven and give you a personal tour .  how s that .    she smiled happily .   i d love it .    he nodded and smiled in his turn and left .   miss fellowes hummed at intervals for the rest of the day .  really to think so was ridiculous  of course but really  it was almost like like making a date .   he was quite on time the next day  smiling and pleasant .  she had replaced her nurse s uniform with a dress .  one of conservative cut  to be sure  but she hadn t felt so feminine in years .   he complimented her on her appearance with staid formality and she accepted with equally formal grace .  it was really a perfect prelude  she thought .  and then the additional thought came  prelude to what .    she shut that off by hastening to say good by to timmie and to assure  him she would be back soon .  she made sure he knew all about what and where lunch was .   hoskins took her into the new wing  into which she had never yet gone .  it still had the odor of newness about it and the sound of construction  softly heard  was indication enough that it was still being extended .    animal  vegetable  and mineral   said hoskins  as he had the day before .   animal right there  our most spectacular exhibits .    the space was divided into many rooms  each a separate stasis bubble .  hoskins brought her to the view glass of one and she looked in .  what she saw impressed her first as a scaled  tailed chicken .  skittering on two thin legs it ran from wall to wall with its delicate birdlike head  surmounted by a bony keel like the comb of a rooster  looking this way and that .  the paws on its small forelimbs clenched and unclenched constantly .   hoskins said   it s our dinosaur .  we ve had it for months .  i don t know when we ll be able to let go of it .     dinosaur .     did you expect a giant .    she dimpled .   one does  i suppose .  i know some of them are small .     a small one is all we aimed for  believe me .  generally  it s under investigation  but this seems to be an open hour .  some interesting things have been discovered .  for instance  it is not entirely cold blooded .  it has an imperfect method of maintaining internal temperatures higher than that of its environment .  unfortunately  it s a male .  ever since we brought it in we ve been trying to get a fix on another that may be female  but we ve had no luck yet .     why female .    he looked at her quizzically .   so that we might have a fighting chance to obtain fertile eggs  and baby dinosaurs .     of course .    he led her to the trilobite section .   that s professor dwayne of washington university   he said .   he s a nuclear chemist .  if i recall correctly  he s taking an isotope ratio on the oxygen of the water .     why .     it s primeval water  at least half a billion years old .  the isotope ratio gives the temperature of the ocean at that time .  he himself happens to ignore the trilobites  but others are chiefly concerned in dissecting them .  they re the lucky ones because all they need are scalpels and microscopes .  dwayne has to set up a mass spectrograph each time he conducts an experiment .     why s that .  can t he     no  he can t .  he can t take anything out of the room as far as can be helped .    there were samples of primordial plant life too and chunks of rock formations .  those were the vegetable and mineral .  and every specimen had its  investigator .  it was like a museum  a museum brought to life and serving as a superactive center of research .    and you have to supervise all of this  dr .  hoskins .     only indirectly  miss feflowes .  i have subordinates  thank heaven .  my own interest is entirely in the theoretical aspects of the matter  the nature of time  the technique of mesonic intertemporal detection and so on .  i would exchange all this for a method of detecting objects closer in time than ten thousand years ago .  if we could get into historical times    he was interrupted by a commotion at one of the distant booths  a thin voice raised querulously .  he frowned  muttered hastily   excuse me   and hastened off .   miss fellowes followed as best she could without actually running .   an elderly man  thinly bearded and red faced  was saying   i had vital aspects of my investigations to complete .  don t you understand that .    a uniformed technician with the interwoven si monogram  for stasis  inc .   on his lab coat  said   dr .  hoskins  it was arranged with professor ademewski at the beginning that the specimen could only remain here two weeks .     i did not know then how long my investigations would take .  i m not a prophet   said ademewski heatedly .   dr .  hoskins said   you understand  professor  we have limited space  we must keep specimens rotating .  that piece of chalcopyrite must go back  there are men waiting for the next specimen .     why can t i have it for myself  then .  let me take it out of there .     you know you can t have it .     a piece of chalcopyrite  a miserable five kilogram piece .  why not .     we can t afford the energy expense .   said hoskins brusquely .   you know that .    the technician interrupted .   the point is  dr .  hoskins  that he tried to remove the rock against the rules and i almost punctured stasis while he was in there  not knowing he was in there .    there was a short silence and dr .  hoskins turned on the investigator with a cold formality .   is that so  professor .    professor ademewski coughed .   i saw no harm    hoskins reached up to a hand pull dangling just within reach  outside the specimen room in question .  he pulled it .   miss fellowes  who had been peering in  looking at the totally undistinguished sample of rock that occasioned the dispute  drew in her breath sharply as its existence flickered out .  the room was empty .   hoskins said   professor  your permit to investigate matters in stasis will be permanently voided .  i am sorry .     but wait     i am sorry .  you have violated one of the stringent rules .     i will appeal to the international association       appeal away .  in a case like this  you will find i can t be overruled .   he turned away deliberately  leaving the professor still protesting and said  to miss fellowes  his face still white with anger    would you care to have  lunch with me  miss fellowes .    he took her into the small administration alcove of the cafeteria .  he greeted others and introduced miss fellowes with complete ease  although she herself felt painfully self conscious .   what must they think  she thought  and tried desperately to appear businesslike .   she said   do you have that kind of trouble often  dr .  hoskins .  i mean like that you just had with the professor .   she took her fork in hand and began eating .    no   said hoskins forcefully .   that was the first time .  of course i m always having to argue men out of removing specimens but this is the first time one actually tried to do it .     i remember you once talked about the energy it would consume .     that s right .  of course  we ve tried to take it into account .  accidents will happen and so we ve got special power sources designed to stand the drain of accidental removal from stasis  but that doesn t mean we want to see a year s supply of energy gone in half a second or can afford to without having our plans of expansion delayed for years .   besides  imagine the professor s being in the room while stasis was about to be punctured .     what would have happened to him if it had been .     well  we ve experimented with inanimate objects and with mice and they ve disappeared .  presumably they ve traveled back in time  carried along  so to speak  by the pull of the object simultaneously snapping back into its natural time .  for that reason  we have to anchor objects within stasis that we don t want to move and that s a complicated procedure .  the professor would not have been anchored and he would have gone back to the pliocene at the moment when we abstracted the rock plus  of course  the two weeks it had remained here in the present .     how dreadful it would have been .     not on account of the professor  i assure you .  if he were fool enough to do what he did  it would serve him right .  but imagine the effect it would have on the public if the fact came out .  all people would need is to become aware of the dangers involved and funds could be choked off like that .   he snapped his fingers and played moodily with his food .   miss fellowes said   couldn t you get him back .  the way you got the rock in the first place .     no  because once an object is returned  the original fix is lost unless we deliberately plan to retain it and there was no reason to do that in this case .  there never is .  finding the professor again would mean relocating a specific fix and that would be like dropping a line into the oceanic abyss for the  purpose of dredging up a particular fish .   my god  when i think of the precautions we take to prevent accidents  it makes me mad .  we have every individual stasis unit set up with its own puncturing device we have to  since each unit has its separate fix and must be collapsible independently .  the point is  though  none of the puncturing devices is ever activated until the last minute .  and then we deliberately make activation impossible except by the pull of a rope carefully led outside the stasis .  the pull is a gross mechanical motion that requires a strong effort  not something that is likely to be done accidentally .    miss fellowes said   but doesn t it change history to move something in and out of time .    hoskins shrugged .   theoretically  yes  actually  except in unusual cases  no .  we move objects out of stasis all the time .  air molecules .  bacteria .  dust .  about    percent of our energy consumption goes to make up micro losses of that nature .  but moving even large objects in time sets up changes that damp out .  take that chalcopyrite from the pliocene .  because of its absence for two weeks some insect didn t find the shelter it might have found and is killed .  that could initiate a whole series of changes  but the mathematics of stasis indicates that this is a converging series .  the amount of change diminishes with time and then things are as before .     you mean  reality heals itself .     in a manner of speaking .  abstract a human from time or send one back  and you make a larger wound .  if the individual is an ordinary one  that wound still heals itself .  of course  there are a great many people who write to us each day and want us to bring abraham lincoln into the present  or mohammed  or lenin .  that can t be done  of course .  even if we could find them  the change in reality in moving one of the history molders would be too great to be healed .  there are ways of calculating when a change is likely to be too great and we avoid even approaching that limit .    miss fellowes said   then  timmie     no  he presents no problem in that direction .  reality is safe .  but   he gave her a quick  sharp glance  then went on   but never mind .  yesterday you said timmie needed companionship .     yes   miss fellowes smiled her delight .   i didn t think you paid that any attention .     of course i did .  i m fond of the child .  i appreciate your feelings for him and i was concerned enough to want to explain to you .  now i have  you ve seen what we do  you ve gotten some insight into the difficulties involved  so you know why  with the best will in the world  we can t supply companionship for timmie .     you can t .   said miss fellowes  with sudden dismay .    but i ve just explained .  we couldn t possibly expect to find another neanderthal his age without incredible luck  and if we could  it wouldn t be fair to multiply risks by having another human being in stasis .    miss fellowes put down her spoon and said energetically   but  dr .  hos kins  that is not at all what i meant .  i don t want you to bring another neanderthal into the present .  i know that s impossible .  but it isn t impossible to bring another child to play with timmie .    hoskins stared at her in concern .   a human child .     another child   said miss fellowes  completely hostile now .   timmie is human .     i couldn t dream of such a thing .     why not .  why couldn t you .  what is wrong with the notion .  you pulled that child out of time and made him an eternal prisoner .  don t you owe him something .  dr .  hoskins  if there is any man who  in this world  is that child s father in every sense but the biological  it is you .  why can t you do this little thing for him .    hoskins said   his father .   he rose  somewhat unsteadily  to his feet .   miss fellowes  i think i ll take you back now  if you don t mind .    they returned to the dollhouse in a complete silence that neither broke .   it was a long time after that before she saw hoskins again  except for an occasional glimpse in passing .  she was sorry about that at times  then  at other times  when timmie was more than usually woebegone or when he spent silent hours at the window with its prospect of little more than nothing  she thought  fiercely  stupid man .   timmie s speech grew better and more precise each day .  it never entirely lost a certain soft  slurriness that miss fellowes found rather endearing .  in times of excitement  he fell back into tongue clicking but those times were becoming fewer .  he must be forgetting the days before he came into the present except for dreams .   as he grew older  the physiologists grew less interested and the psychologists more so .  miss fellowes was not sure that she did not like the new group even less than the first .  the needles were gone  the injections and withdrawals of fluid  the special diets .  but now timmie was made to overcome barriers to reach food and water .  he had to lift panels  move bars  reach for cords .  and the mild electric shocks made him cry and drove miss fellowes to distraction .   she did not wish to appeal to hoskins  she did not wish to have to go to him  for each time she thought of him  she thought of his face over the luncheon table that last time .  her eyes moistened and she thought  stupid  stupid man .   and then one day hoskins  voice sounded unexpectedly  calling into the dollhouse   miss fellowes .    she came out coldly  smoothing her nurse s uniform  then stopped in confusion at finding herself in the presence of a pale woman  slender and of middle height .  the woman s fair hair and complexion gave her an appear   ance of fragility .  standing behind her and clutching at her skirt was a round faced  large eyed child of four .   hoskins said   dear  this is miss fellowes  the nurse in charge of the boy .  miss fellowes  this is my wife .     was this his wife .  she was not as miss fellowes had imagined her to be .  but then  why not .  a man like hoskins would choose a weak thing to be his foil .  if that was what he wanted    she forced a matter of fact greeting .   good afternoon  mrs .  hoskins .  is this your your little boy .     that was a surprise .  she had thought of hoskins as a husband  but not as a father  except  of course  she suddenly caught hoskins  grave eyes and flushed .    hoskins said   yes  this is my boy  ferry .  say hello to miss fellowes  jerry .     had he stressed the word  this  just a bit .  was he saying this was his son and not    jerry receded a bit further into the folds of the maternal skirt and muttered his hello .  mrs .  hoskins  eyes were searching over miss fellowes  shoulders  peering into the room  looking for something .   hoskins said   well  let s go in .  come  dear .  there s a trifling discomfort at the threshold  but it passes .    miss fellowes said   do you want jerry to come in  too .     of course .  he is to be timmie s playmate .  you said that timmie needed a playmate .  or have you forgotten .     but   she looked at him with a colossal  surprised wonder .   jburboy .    he said peevishly   well  whose boy  then .  isn t this what you want .  come on in  dear .  come on in .    mrs .  hoskins lifted jerry into her arms with a distinct effort and  hesitantly  stepped over the threshold .  jerry squirmed as she did so  disliking the sensation .   mrs .  hoskins said in a thin voice   is the creature here .  i don t see him .    miss fellowes called   timmie .  come out .    timmie peered around the edge of the door  staring up at the little boy who was visiting him .  the muscles in mrs .  hoskins  arms tensed visibly .   she said to her husband   gerald  are you sure it s safe .    miss fellowes said at once   if you mean is timmie safe  why  of course he is .  he s a gentle little boy .     but he s a sa savage .     the ape boy stories in the newspapers .   miss fellowes said emphatically   he is not a savage .  he is just as quiet and reasonable as you can possibly expect a five and a half year old to be .  it is very generous of you  mrs .  hoskins  to agree to allow your boy to play with timmie but please have no fears about it .    mrs .  hoskins said with mild heat   i m not sure that i agree .     we ve had it out  dear   said hoskins .   let s not bring up the matter for new argument .  put jerry down .    mrs .  hoskins did so and the boy backed against her  staring at the pair of eyes which were staring back at him from the next room .    come here  timmie   said miss fellowes .   don t be afraid .    slowly  timmie stepped into the room .  hoskins bent to disengage jerry s fingers from his mother s skirt .   step back  dear .  give the children a chance .    the youngsters faced one another .  although the younger  jerry was nevertheless an inch taller  and in the presence of his straightness and his high held  well proportioned head  timmie s grotesqueries were suddenly almost as pronounced as they had been in the first days .   miss fellowes  lips quivered .   it was the little neanderthal who spoke first  in childish treble .   what s your name .   and timmie thrust his face suddenly forward as though to inspect the other s features more closely .   startled jerry responded with a vigorous shove that sent timmie tumbling .  both began crying loudly and mrs .  hoskins snatched up her child  while miss fellowes  flushed with repressed anger  lifted timmie and comforted him .   mrs .  hoskins said   they just instinctively don t like one another .     no more instinctively   said her husband wearily   than any two children dislike each other .  now put jerry down and let him get used to the situation .  in fact  we had better leave .  miss fellowes can bring jerry to my office after a while and i ll have him taken home .    the two children spent the next hour very aware of each other .  jerry cried for his mother  struck out at miss fellowes and  finally  allowed himself to be comforted with a lollipop .  timmie sucked at another  and at the end of an hour  miss fellowes had them playing with the same set of blocks  though at opposite ends of the room .   she found herself almost maudlinly grateful to hoskins when she brought jerry to him .   she searched for ways to thank him but his very formality was a rebuff .  perhaps he could not forgive her for making him feel like a cruel father .  perhaps the bringing of his own child was an attempt  after all  to prove himself both a kind father to timmie and  also  not his father at all .  both at the same time .   so all she could say was   thank you .  thank you very much .    and all he could say was   it s all right .  don t mention it .    it became a settled routine .  twice a week  jerry was brought in for an hour s play  later extended to two hours  play .  the children learned each other s names and ways and played together .   and yet  after the first rush of gratitude  miss fellowes found herself  disliking jerry .  he was larger and heavier and in all things dominant  forcing timmie into a completely secondary role .  all that reconciled her to the situation was the fact that  despite difficulties  timmie looked forward with more and more delight to the periodic appearances of his playfellow .   it was all he had  she mourned to herself .   and once  as she watched them  she thought  hoskins  two children  one by his wife and one by stasis .   while she herself   heavens  she thought  putting her fists to her temples and feeling ashamed  i m jealous .    miss fellowes   said tirnmie  carefully  she had never allowed him to call her anything else   when will i go to school .    she looked down at those eager brown eyes turned up to hers and passed her hand softly through his thick  curly hair .  it was the most disheveled portion of his appearance  for she cut his hair herself while he sat restlessly under the scissors .  she did not ask for professional help  for the very clumsiness of the cut served to mask the retreating fore part of the skull and the bulging hinder part .   she said   where did you hear about school .     jerry goes to school .  kin der gar ten .   he said it carefully .   there are lots of places he goes .  outside .  when can i go outside  miss fellowes .    a small pain centered in miss fellowes  heart .  of course  she saw  there would be no way of avoiding the inevitability of timmie s hearing more and more of the outer world he could never enter .   she said  with an attempt at gaiety   why  whatever would you do in kindergarten  timmie .     jerry says they play games  they have picture tapes .  he says there are lots of children .  he says he says   a thought  then a triumphant upholding of both small hands with the fingers splayed apart .   he says this many .    miss fellowes said   would you like picture tapes .  i can get you picture tapes .  very nice ones .  and music tapes too .    so that timmie was temporarily comforted .   he pored over the picture tapes in jerry s absence and miss fellowes read to him out of ordinary books by the hours .   there was so much to explain in even the simplest story  so much that was outside the perspective of his three rooms .  timmie took to having his dreams more often now that the outside was being introduced to him .   they were always the same  about the outside .  he tried haltingly to describe them to miss fellowes .  in his dreams  he was outside  an empty outside  but very large  with children and queer indescribable objects half digested in his thought out of bookish descriptions half understood  or out of distant neanderthal memories half recalled .   but the children and objects ignored him and though he was in the world  he was never part of it  but was as alone as though he were in his own room   and would wake up crying .   miss fellowes tried to laugh at the dreams  but there were nights in her own apartment when she cried  too .   one day  as miss fellowes read  timmie put his hand under her chin and lifted it gently so that her eyes left the book and met his .   he said   how do you know what to say  miss fellowes .    she said   you see these marks .  they tell me what to say .  these marks make words .    he stared at them long and curiously  taking the book out of her hands .   some of these marks are the same .    she laughed with pleasure at this sign of his shrewdness and said   so they are .  would you like to have me show you how to make the marks .     all right .  that would be a nice game .    it did not occur to her that he could learn to read .  up to the very moment that he read a book to her  it did not occur to her that he could learn to read .   then  weeks later  the enormity of what had been done struck her .  timmie sat in her lap  following word by word the printing in a child s book  reading to her .  he was reading to her .   she struggled to her feet in amazement and said   now timmie  i ll be back later .  i want to see dr .  hoskins .    excited nearly to frenzy  it seemed to her she might have an answer to timmie s unhappiness .  if timmie could not leave to enter the world  the world must be brought into those three rooms to timmie the whole world in books and film and sound .  he must be educated to his full capacity .  so much the world owed him .   she found hoskins in a mood that was oddly analogous to her own  a kind of triumph and glory .  his offices were unusually busy  and for a moment  she thought she would not get to see him  as she stood abashed in the anteroom .   but he saw her  and a smile spread over his broad face .   miss fellowes  come here .    he spoke rapidly into the intercom  then shut it off .   have you heard .    no  of course  you couldn t have .  we ve done it .  we ve actually done it .  we have intertemporal detection at close range .     you mean   she tried to detach her thought from her own good news for a moment   that you can get a person from historical times into the present .     that s just what i mean .  we have a fix on a fourteenth century individual right now .  imagine .  imagine .  if you could only know how glad i ll be to shift from the eternal concentration on the mesozoic  replace the paleonto   logists with the historians  but there s something you wish to say to me  eh .  well  go ahead  go ahead .  you find me in a good mood .  anything you want you can have .    miss fellowes smiled .   i m glad .  because i wonder if we might not establish a system of instruction for timmie .     instruction .  in what .     well  in everything .  a school .  so that he might learn .     but can he learn .     certainly  he is learning .  he can read .  i ve taught him so much myself .    hoskins sat there  seeming suddenly depressed .   i don t know  miss fellowes .    she said   you just said that anything i wanted     i know and i should not have .  you see  miss fellowes  i m sure you must realize that we cannot maintain the timmie experiment forever .    she stared at him with sudden horror  not really understanding what he had said .  how did he mean  cannot maintain  .  with an agonizing flash of recollection  she recalled professor ademewski and his mineral specimen that was taken away after two weeks .  she said   but you re talking about a boy .  not about a rock    dr .  hoskins said uneasily   even a boy can t be given undue importance  miss fellowes .  now that we expect individuals out of historical time  we will need stasis space  all we can get .    she didn t grasp it .   but you can t .  timmie timmie     now  miss fellowes  please don t upset yourself .  timmie won t go right away  perhaps not for months .  meanwhile we ll do what we can .    she was still staring at him .    let me get you something  miss fellowes .     no   she whispered .   i don t need anything .   she arose in a kind of nightmare and left .   timmie  she thought  you will not die .  you will not die .   it was all very well to hold tensely to the thought that timmie must not die  but how was that to be arranged .  in the first weeks  miss fellowes clung only to the hope that the attempt to bring forward a man from the fourteenth century would fail completely .  hoskins  theories might be wrong or his practice defective .  then things could go on as before .   certainly  that was not the hope of the rest of the world and  irrationally  miss fellowes hated the world for it .   project middle ages  reached a climax of white hot publicity .  the press and the public had hungered for something like this .  stasis  inc .  had lacked the necessary sensation for a long time now .  a new rock or another ancient fish failed to stir them .  but this was it  a historical human  an adult speaking a known language  someone who could open a new page of history to the scholar .   zero time was coming and this time it was not a question of three onlookers from the balcony .  this time there would be a world wide audience .  this time the technicians of stasis  inc .  would play their role before nearly all of mankind .   miss fellowes was herself all but savage with waiting .  when young jerry hoskins showed up for his scheduled playtime with timmie  she scarcely recognized him .  he was not the one she was waiting for .    the secretary who brought him left hurriedly after the barest nod for miss fellowes .  she was rushing for a good place from which to watch the climax of project middle ages .   and so ought miss fellowes with far better reason  she thought bitterly  if only that stupid girl would arrive .    jerry hoskins sidled toward her  embarrassed .   miss fellowes .   he took the reproduction of a news strip out of his pocket .    yes .  what is it  jerry .     is this a picture of timmie .    miss fellowes stared at him  then snatched the strip from jerry s hand .  the excitement of project middle ages had brought about a pale revival of interest in timmie on the part of the press .   jerry watched her narrowly  then said   it says timmie is an ape boy .  what does that mean .    miss fellowes caught the youngster s wrist and repressed the impulse to shake him .   never say that  jerry .  never  do you understand .  it is a nasty word and you mustn t use it .    jerry struggled out of her grip  frightened .   miss fellowes tore up the news strip with a vicious twist of the wrist .   now go inside and play with timmie .  he s got a new book to show you .    and then  finally  the girl appeared .  miss fellowes did not know her .  none of the usual stand ins she had used when business took her elsewhere was available now  not with project middle ages at climax  but hoskins  secretary had promised to find someone and this must be the girl .   miss fellowes tried to keep querulousness out of her voice .   are you the girl assigned to stasis section one .     yes  i m mandy terris .  you re miss fellowes  aren t you .     that s right .     i m sorry i m late .  there s just so much excitement .     i know .  now i want you    mandy said   you ll be watching  i suppose .   her thin  vacuously pretty face filled with envy .    never mind that .  now i want you to come inside and meet timmie and jerry .  they will be playing for the next two hours so they ll be giving you no trouble .  they ve got milk handy and plenty of toys .  in fact  it will be better if you leave them alone as much as possible .  now i ll show you where everything is located and     is it timmie that s the ape b     timmie is the stasis subject   said miss fellowes firmly .    i mean  he s the one who s not supposed to get out  is that right .     yes .  now  come in .  there isn t much time .    and when she finally left  mandy terris called after her shrilly   i hope you get a good seat and  golly  i sure hope it works .    miss fellowes did not trust herself to make a reasonable response .  she hurried on without looking back .   but the delay meant she did not get a good seat .  she got no nearer than the wall viewing plate in the assembly hall .  bitterly  she regretted that .  if she could have been on the spot  if she could somehow have reached out for some sensitive portion of the instrumentations  if she were in some way able to wreck the experiment   she found the strength to beat down her madness .  simple destruction would have done no good .  they would have rebuilt and reconstructed and made the effort again .  and she would never be allowed to return to timmie .   nothing would help .  nothing but that the experiment itself fail  that it break down irretrievably .   so she waited through the countdown  watching every move on the giant screen  scanning the faces of the technicians as the focus shifted from one to the other  watching for the look of worry and uncertainty that would mark something going unexpectedly wrong  watching  watching   there was no such look .  the count reached zero  and very quietly  very unassumingly  the experiment succeeded .   in the new stasis that had been established there stood a bearded  stoop shouldered peasant of indeterminate age  in ragged dirty clothing and wooden shoes  staring in dull horror at the sudden mad change that had flung itself over him .   and while the world went mad with jubilation  miss fellowes stood frozen in sorrow  jostled and pushed  all but trampled  surrounded by triumph while bowed down with defeat .   and when the loud speaker called her name with strident force  it sounded it three times before she responded .    miss fellowes .  miss fellowes .  you are wanted in stasis section one immediately .  miss fellowes .  miss fell     let me through .   she cried breathlessly  while the loud speaker continued its repetitions without pause .  she forced her way through the crowds with wild energy  beating at it  striking out with closed fists  flailing  moving toward the door in a nightmare slowness .   mandy terris was in tears .   i don t know how it happened .  i just went down to the edge of the corridor to watch a pocket viewing plate they had put up .  just for a minute .  and then before i could move or do anything    she cried out in sudden accusation   you said they would make no trouble  you said to leave them alone    miss fellowes  disheveled and trembling uncontrollably  glared at her .   where s timmie .    a nurse was swabbing the arm of a wailing jerry with disinfectant and another was preparing an anti tetanus shot .  there was blood on jerry s clothes .    he bit me  miss fellowes   jerry cried in rage .   he bit me .    but miss fellowes didn t even see him .    what did you do with timmie .   she cried out .    i locked him in the bathroom   said mandy .   i just threw the little monster in there and locked him in .    miss fellowes ran into the dollhouse .  she fumbled at the bathroom door .  it took an eternity to get it open and to find the ugly little boy cowering in the corner .    don t whip me  miss fellowes   he whispered .  his eyes were red .  his lips were quivering .   i didn t mean to do it .     oh  timmie  who told you about whips .   she caught him to her  hugging him wildly .   he said tremulously   she said  with a long rope .  she said you would hit me and hit me .     you won t be .  she was wicked to say so .  but what happened .  what happened .     he called me an ape boy .  he said i wasn t a real boy .  he said i was an animal .   timmie dissolved in a flood of tears .   he said he wasn t going to play with a monkey anymore .  i said i wasn t a monkey  i wasn  t a monkey .  he said i was all funny looking .  he said i was horrible ugly .  he kept saying and saying and i bit him .    they were both crying now .  miss fellowes sobbed   but it isn t true .  you know that  timmie .  you re a real boy .  you re a dear real boy and the best boy in the world .  and no one  no one will ever take you away from me .    it was easy to make up her mind  now  easy to know what to do .  only it had to be done quickly .  hoskins wouldn t wait much longer  with his own son mangled   no  it would have to be done this night  this night  with the place four fifths asleep and the remaining fifth intellectually drunk over project middle ages .   it would be an unusual time for her to return but not an unheard of one .  the guard knew her well and would not dream of questioning her .  he would think nothing of her carrying a suitcase .  she rehearsed the noncommittal phrase   games for the boy   and the calm smile .   why shouldn t he believe that .   he did .  when she entered the dollhouse again  timmie was still awake   and she maintained a desperate normality to avoid frightening him .  she talked about his dreams with him and listened to him ask wistfully after jerry .   there would be few to see her afterward  none to question the bundle she would be carrying .  timmie would be very quiet and then it would be a fait accompli .  it would be done and what would be the use of trying to undo it .  they would leave her be .  they would leave them both be .   she opened the suitcase  took out the overcoat  the woolen cap with the ear flaps and the rest .   timmie said  with the beginning of alarm   why are you putting all these clothes on me  miss fellowes .    she said   i am going to take you outside  timmie .  to where your dreams are .     my dreams .   his face twisted in sudden yearning  yet fear was there  too .    you won t be afraid .  you ll be with me .  you won t be afraid if you re with me  will you  timmie .     no  miss fellowes .   he buried his little misshapen head against her side  and under her enclosing arm she could feel his small heart thud .   it was midnight and she lifted him into her arms .  she disconnected the alarm and opened the door softly .   and she screamed  for facing her across the open door was hoskins .   there were two men with him and he stared at her  as astonished as she .   miss fellowes recovered first by a second and made a quick attempt to push past him  but even with the second s delay he had time .  he caught her roughly and hurled her back against a chest of drawers .  he waved the men in and confronted her  blocking the door .    i didn t expect this .  are you completely insane .    she had managed to interpose her shoulder so that it  rather than timmie  had struck the chest .  she said pleadingly   what harm can it do if i take him  dr .  hoskins .  you can t put energy loss ahead of a human life .    firmly  hoskins took timmie out of her arms .   an energy loss this size would mean millions of dollars lost out of the pockets of investors .  it would mean a terrible setback for stasis  inc .  it would mean eventual publicity about a sentimental nurse destroying all that for the sake of an ape boy .     ape boy .   said miss fellowes  in helpless fury .    that s what the reporters would call him   said hoskins .   one of the men emerged now  looping a nylon rope through eyelets along the upper portion of the wall .   miss fellowes remembered the rope that hoskins had pulled outside the room containing professor ademewski s rock specimen so long ago .   she cried out   no .    but hoskins put timmie down and gently removed the overcoat he was  wearing .   you stay here  timmie .  nothing will happen to you .  we re just going outside for a moment .  all right .    timmie  white and wordless  managed to nod .   hoskins steered miss fellowes out of the dollhouse ahead of himself .  for the moment  miss fellowes was beyond resistance .  dully  she noticed the hand pull being adjusted outside the dollhouse .    i m sorry  miss fellowes   said hoskins .   i would have spared you this .  i planned it for the night so that you would know only when it was over .    she said in a weary whisper   because your son was hurt .  because he tormented this child into striking out at him .     no .  believe me .  i understand about the incident today and   know it was jerry s fault .  but the story has leaked out .  it would have to with the press surrounding us on this day of all days .  i can t risk having a distorted story about negligence and savage neanderthalers  so called  distract from the success of project middle ages .  timmie has to go soon anyway  he might as well go now and give the sensationalists as small a peg as possible on which to hang their trash .     it s not like sending a rock back .  you ll be killing a human being .     not killing .  there ll be no sensation .  he ll simply be a neanderthal boy in a neanderthal world .  he will no longer be a prisoner and alien .  he will have a chance at a free life .     what chance .  he s only seven years old  used to being taken care of  fed  clothed  sheltered .  he will be alone .  his tribe may not be at the point where he left them now that four years have passed .  and if they were  they would not recognize him .  he will have to take care of himself .  how will he know how .    hoskins shook his head in hopeless negative .   lord  miss fellowes  do you think we haven t thought of that .  do you think we would have brought in a child if it weren t that it was the first successful fix of a human or near human we made and that we did not dare to take the chance of unfixing him and finding another fix as good .  why do you suppose we kept timmie as long as we did  if it were not for our reluctance to send a child back into the past .  it s just  his voice took on a desperate urgency  that we can wait no longer .  timmie stands in the way of expansion .  timmie is a source of possible bad publicity  we are on the threshold of great things  and i m sorry  miss fellowes  but we can t let timmie block us .  we cannot .  we cannot .  i m sorry  miss fellowes .     well  then   said miss fellowes sadly .   let me say good by .  give me five minutes to say good by .  spare me that much .    hoskins hesitated .   go ahead .    timmie ran to her .  for the kst time he ran to her and for the last time miss fellowes clasped him in her arms .   for a moment  she hugged him blindly .  she caught at a chair with the toe of one foot  moved it against the wall  sat down .    don t be afraid  timmie .     i m not afraid if you re here  miss fellowes .  is that man mad at me  the man out there .     no  he isn t .  he just doesn t understand about us .   timmie  do you know what a mother is .     like jerry s mother .     did he tell you about his mother .     sometimes .  i think maybe a mother is a lady who takes care of you and who s very nice to you and who does good things .     that s right .  have you ever wanted a mother  timmie .    timmie pulled his head away from her so that he could look into her face .  slowly  he put his hand to her cheek and hair and stroked her  as long  long ago she had stroked him .  he said   aren t you my mother .     oh  timmie .     are you angry because i asked .     no .  of course not .     because i know your name is miss fellowes  but but sometimes  i call you  mother  inside .  is that all right .     yes .  yes .  it s all right .  and i won t leave you any more and nothing will hurt you .  i ll be with you to care for you always .  call me mother  so i can hear you .     mother   said timmie contentedly  leaning his cheek against hers .   she rose  and  still holding him  stepped up on the chair .  the sudden beginning of a shout from outside went unheard and  with her free hand  she yanked with all her weight at the cord where it hung suspended between two eyelets .   i and stasis was punctured and the room was empty .   nightfall  if the stars should appear one night in a thousand years  how would men believe and adore  and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of god .    emerson  aton     director of saro university  thrust out a belligerent lower lip and glared at the young newspaperman in a hot fury .   theremon     took that fury in his stride .  in his earlier days  when his now widely syndicated column was only a mad idea in a cub reporter s mind  he had specialized in  impossible  interviews .  it had cost him bruises  black eyes  and broken bones  but it had given him an ample supply of coolness and self confidence .  so he lowered the outthrust hand that had been so pointedly ignored and calmly waited for the aged director to get over the worst .  astronomers were queer ducks  anyway  and if aton s actions of the last two months meant anything  this same aton was the queer duckiest of the lot .   aton    found his voice  and though it trembled with restrained emotion  the careful  somewhat pedantic phraseology  for which the famous astronomer was noted  did not abandon him .    sir   he said   you display an infernal gall in coming to me with that impudent proposition of yours .   the husky telephotographer of the observatory  beenay     thrust a tongue s tip across dry lips and interposed nervously   now  sir  after all       the director turned to him and lifted a white eyebrow .    do not interfere  beenay .  i will credit you with good intentions in bringing this man here  but i will tolerate no insubordination now .    theremon decided it was time to take a part .   director aton  if you ll let me finish what i started saying  i think        i don t believe  young man   retorted aton   that anything you could say now would count much as compared with your daily columns of these last two months .  you have led a vast newspaper campaign against the efforts of myself and my colleagues to organize the world against the menace which it is now too late to avert .  you have done your best with your highly personal attacks to make the staff of this observatory objects of ridicule .    the director lifted a copy of the saro city chronicle from the table and shook it at theremon furiously .   even a person of your well known impudence should have hesitated before coming to me with a request that he be allowed to cover today s events for his paper .  of all newsmen  you .    aton dashed the newspaper to the floor  strode to the window  and clasped his arms behind his back .    you may leave   he snapped over his shoulder .  he stared moodily out at the skyline where gamma  the brightest of the planet s six suns  was setting .  it had already faded and yellowed into the horizon mists  and aton knew he would never see it again as a sane man .  he whirled .   no  wait  come here .   he gestured peremptorily .  i ll give you your story .    the newsman had made no motion to leave  and now he approached the old man slowly .  aton gestured outward .    of the six suns  only beta is left in the sky .  do you see it .    the question was rather unnecessary .  beta was almost at zenith  its ruddy light flooding the landscape to an unusual orange as the brilliant rays of setting gamma died .  beta was at aphelion .  it was small  smaller than theremon had ever seen it before  and for the moment it was undisputed ruler of lagash s sky .   lagash s own sun .  alpha  the one about which it revolved  was at the antipodes  as were the two distant companion pairs .  the red dwarf beta    alpha s immediate companion    was alone  grimly alone .   aton s upturned face flushed redly in the sunlight .   in just under four hours   he said   civilization  as we know it  comes to an end .  it will do so because  as you see .  beta is the only sun in the sky .   he smiled grimly .   print that .  there ll be no one to read it .     but if it turns out that four hours pass    and another four    and nothing happens .   asked theremon softly .    don t let that worry you .  enough will happen .     granted .  and still    if nothing happens .    for a second time  beenay    spoke .   sir  i think you ought to listen to him .    theremon said   put it to a vote  director aton .    there was a stir among the remaining five members of the observatory staff  who till now had maintained an attitude of wary neutrality .    that   stated aton flatly   is not necessary .   he drew out his pocket watch .   since your good friend  beenay  insists so urgently  i will give you five minutes .  talk away .     good .  now  just what difference would it make if you allowed me to take down an eyewitness account of what s to come .  if your prediction comes true  my presence won t hurt  for in that case my column would never be written .  on the other hand  if nothing comes of it  you will just have to expect ridicule or worse .  it would be wise to leave that ridicule to friendly hands .    aton snorted .   do you mean yours when you speak of friendly hands .     certainly .   theremon sat down and crossed his legs .    my columns may have been a little rough  but i gave you people the benefit of the doubt every time .  after all .  this is not the century to preach  the end of the world is at hand  to lagash .  you have to understand that people don t believe the book of revelations anymore  and it annoys them to have scientists turn aboutface and tell us the cultists are right after all        no such thing  young man   interrupted aton .   while a great deal of our data has been supplied us by the cult  our results contain none of the cult s mysticism .  facts are facts  and the cult s so called mythology has certain facts behind it .  we ve exposed them and ripped away their mystery .  i assure you that the cult hates us now worse than you do .     i don t hate you .  i m just trying to tell you that the public is in an ugly humor .  they re angry .    aton twisted his mouth in derision .   let them be angry .     yes  but what about tomorrow .     there ll be no tomorrow .     but if there is .  say that there is    just to see what happens .  that anger might take shape into something serious .  after all  you know  business has taken a nosedive these last two months .  investors don t really believe the world is coming to an end  but just the same they re being cagy with their money until it s all over .  johnny public doesn t believe you  either  but the new spring furniture might just as well wait a few months    just to make sure .    you see the point .  just as soon as this is all over  the business interests will be after your hide .  they ll say that if crackpots    begging your pardon    can upset the country s prosperity any time they want  simply by making some cockeyed prediction    it s up to the planet to prevent them .  the sparks will fly  sir .    the director regarded the columnist sternly .   and just what were you proposing to do to help the situation .     well     theremon grinned     i was proposing to take charge of the publicity .  i can handle things so that only the ridiculous side will show .  it would be hard to stand  i admit  because i d have to make you all out to be a bunch of gibbering idiots  but if i can get people laughing at you  they might forget to be angry .  in return for that  all my publisher asks is an exclusive story .    beenay nodded and burst out   sir  the rest of us think he s right .  these last two months we ve considered everything but the million to one chance that there is an error somewhere in our theory or in our calculations .  we ought to take care of that  too .    there was a murmur of agreement from the men grouped about the table  and aton s expression became that of one who found his mouth full of something bitter and couldn t get rid of it .    you may stay if you wish  then .  you will kindly refrain  however  from hampering us in our duties in any way .  you will also remember that i am in charge of all activities here  and in spite of your opinions as expressed in your columns  i will expect full cooperation and full respect       his hands were behind his back  and his wrinkled face thrust forward determinedly as he spoke .  he might have continued indefinitely but for the intrusion of a new voice .    hello  hello  hello .   it came in a high tenor  and the plump cheeks of the newcomer expanded in a pleased smile .   what s this morgue like atmosphere about here .  no one s losing his nerve  i hope .    aton started in consternation and said peevishly   now what the devil are you doing here  sheerin .  i thought you were going to stay behind in the hideout .    sheerin laughed and dropped his stubby figure into a chair .   hideout be blowed .  the place bored me .  i wanted to be here  where things are getting hot .  don t you suppose i have my share of curiosity .  i want to see these stars the cultists are forever speaking about .   he rubbed his hands and added in a soberer tone .   it s freezing outside .  the wind s enough to hang icicles on your nose .  beta doesn t seem to give any heat at all  at the distance it is .    the white haired director ground his teeth in sudden exasperation .   why do you go out of your way to do crazy things  sheerin .  what kind of good are you around here .     what kind of good am i around there .   sheerin spread his palms in comical resignation .   a psychologist isn t worth his salt in the hideout .  they need men of action and strong  healthy women that can breed children .  me .  i m a hundred pounds too heavy for a man of action  and i wouldn t be a success at breeding children .  so why bother them with an extra mouth to feed .  i feel better over here .    theremon spoke briskly .   just what is the hideout  sir .    sheerin seemed to see the columnist for the first time .  he frowned and blew his ample cheeks out .   and just who in lagash are you  redhead .    aton compressed his lips and then muttered sullenly   that s theremon      the newspaper fellow .  i suppose you ve heard of him .    the columnist offered his hand .   and  of course  you re sheerin     of saro university .  i ve heard of you .   then he repeated   what is this hideout  sir .     well   said sheerin   we have managed to convince a few people of the validity of our prophecy of    er    doom  to be spectacular about it  and those few have taken proper measures .  they consist mainly of the immediate members of the families of the observatory staff  certain of the faculty of saro university  and a few outsiders .  altogether  they number about three hundred  but three quarters are women and children .     i see .  they re supposed to hide where the darkness and the    er    stars can t get at them  and then hold out when the rest of the world goes poof .     if they can .  it won t be easy .  with all of mankind insane  with the great cities going up in flames    environment will not be conducive to survival .  but they have food  water  shelter  and weapons        they ve got more   said aton .   they ve got all our records  except for what we will collect today .  those records will mean everything to the next cycle  and that s what must survive .  the rest can go hang .    theremon uttered a long  low whistle and sat brooding for several minutes .  the men about the table had brought out a multi chess board and started a six member game .  moves were made rapidly and in silence .  all eyes bent in furious concentration on the board .  theremon watched them intently and then rose and approached aton  who sat apart in whispered conversation with sheerin .    listen   he said  let s go somewhere where we won t bother the rest of the fellows .  i want to ask some questions .    the aged astronomer frowned sourly at him  but sheerin chirped up   certainly .  it will do me good to talk .  it always does .  aton was telling me about your ideas concerning world reaction to a failure of the prediction    and i agree with you .  i read your column pretty regularly  by the way  and as a general thing i like your views .     please  sheerin   growled aton .    eh .  oh  all right .  we ll go into the next room .  it has softer chairs  anyway .    there were softer chairs in the next room .  there were also thick red curtains on the windows and a maroon carpet on the floor .  with the bricky light of beta pouring in  the general effect was one of dried blood .   theremon shuddered .   say  i d give ten credits for a decent dose of white light for just a second .  i wish gamma or delta were in the sky .     what are your questions .   asked aton .   please remember that our time is limited .  in a little over an hour and a quarter we re going upstairs  and after that there will be no time for talk .     well  here it is .   theremon leaned back and folded his hands on his chest .   you people seem so all fired serious about this that i m beginning to believe you .  would you mind explaining what it s all about .    aton exploded   do you mean to sit there and tell me that you ve been bombarding us with ridicule without even finding out what we ve been trying to say .    the columnist grinned sheepishly .   it s not that bad  sir .  i ve got the general idea .  you say there is going to be a world wide darkness in a few hours and that all mankind will go violently insane .  what i want now is the science behind it .     no  you don t .  no  you don t   broke in sheerin .   if you ask aton for that    supposing him to be in the mood to answer at all    he ll trot out pages of figures and volumes of graphs .  you won t make head or tail of it .  now if you were to ask me  i could give you the layman s standpoint .     all right  i ask you .     then first i d like a drink .   he rubbed his hands and looked at aton .    water .   grunted aton .    don t be silly .     don t you be silly .  no alcohol today .  it would be too easy to get my men drunk .  i can t afford to tempt them .    the psychologist grumbled wordlessly .  he turned to theremon  impaled him with his sharp eyes  and began .    you realize  of course  that the history of civilization on lagash displays a cyclic character    but i mean cyclic .     i know   replied theremon cautiously   that that is the current archaeological theory .  has it been accepted as a fact .     just about .  in this last century it s been generally agreed upon .  this cyclic character is    or rather  was    one of the great mysteries .  we ve located series of civilizations  nine of them definitely  and indications of others as well  all of which have reached heights comparable to our own  and all of which  without exception  were destroyed by fire at the very height of their culture .    and no one could tell why .  all centers of culture were thoroughly gutted by fire  with nothing left behind to give a hint as to the cause .    theremon was following closely .   wasn t there a stone age  too .     probably  but as yet practically nothing is known of it  except that men of that age were little more than rather intelligent apes .  we can forget about that .     i see .  go on .    there have been explanations of these recurrent catastrophes  all of a more or less fantastic nature .  some say that there are periodic rains of fire  some that lagash passes through a sun every so often  some even wilder things .  but there is one theory  quite different from all of these  that has been handed down over a period of centuries .     i know .  you mean this myth of the  stars  that the cultists have in their book of revelations .     exactly   rejoined sheerin with satisfaction .   the cultists said that every two thousand and fifty years lagash entered a huge cave  so that all the suns disappeared  and there came total darkness all over the world .  and then  they say  things called stars appeared  which robbed men of their souls and left them unreasoning brutes  so that they destroyed the civilization they themselves had built up .  of course they mix all this up with a lot of religio mystic notions  but that s the central idea .    there was a short pause in which sheerin drew a long breath .   and now we come to the theory of universal gravitation .   he pronounced the phrase so that the capital letters sounded    and at that point aton turned from the window  snorted loudly  and stalked out of the room .   the two stared after him  and theremon said   what s wrong .     nothing in particular   replied sheerin .   two of the men were due several hours ago and haven t shown up yet .  he s terrifically short handed  of course  because all but the really essential men have gone to the hideout .     you don t think the two deserted  do you .     who .  faro and yimot .  of course not .  still  if they re not back within the hour  things would be a little sticky .   he got to his feet suddenly  and his eyes twinkled .   anyway  as long as aton is gone       tiptoeing to the nearest window  he squatted  and from the low window box beneath withdrew a bottle of red liquid that gurgled suggestively when he shook it .    i thought aton didn t know about this   he remarked as he trotted back to the table .   here .  we ve only got one glass so  as the guest  you can have it .  i ll keep the bottle .    and he filled the tiny cup with judicious care .  theremon rose to protest  but sheerin eyed him sternly .    respect your elders  young man .    the newsman seated himself with a look of anguish on his face .   go ahead  then  you old villain .    the psychologist s adam s apple wobbled as the bottle upended  and then  with a satisfied grunt and a smack of the lips  he began again .   but what do you know about gravitation .     nothing  except that it is a very recent development  not too well established  and that the math is so hard that only twelve men in lagash are supposed to understand it .     tcha .  nonsense .  baloney .  i can give you all the essential math in a sentence .  the law of universal gravitation states that there exists a cohesive force among all bodies of the universe  such that the amount of this force between any two given bodies is proportional to the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them .     is that all .     that s enough .  it took four hundred years to develop it .     why that long .  it sounded simple enough  the way you said it .     because great laws are not divined by flashes of inspiration  whatever you may think .  it usually takes the combined work of a world full of scientists over a period of centuries .  after genovi  i discovered that lagash rotated about the sun alpha rather than vice versa    and that was four hundred years ago    astronomers have been working .  the complex motions of the six suns were recorded and analyzed and unwoven .  theory after theory was advanced and checked and counterchecked and modified and abandoned and revived and converted to something else .  it was a devil of a job .    theremon nodded thoughtfully and held out his glass for more liquor .  sheerin grudgingly allowed a few ruby drops to leave the bottle .    it was twenty years ago   he continued after remoistening his own throat   that it was finally demonstrated that the law of universal gravitation accounted exactly for the orbital motions of the six suns .  it was a great triumph .    sheerin stood up and walked to the window  still clutching his bottle .   and now we re getting to the point .  in the last decade  the motions of lagash about alpha were computed according to gravity  and it did not account for the orbit observed  not even when all perturbations due to the other suns were included .  either the law was invalid  or there was another  as yet unknown  factor involved .    theremon joined sheerin at the window and gazed out past the wooded slopes to where the spires of saro city gleamed bloodily on the horizon .  the newsman felt the tension of uncertainty grow within him as he cast a short glance at beta .  it glowered redly at zenith  dwarfed and evil .    go ahead  sir   he said softly .   sheerin replied   astronomers stumbled about for year  each proposed theory more untenable than the one before    until aton had the inspiration of calling in the cult .  the head of the cult  sor    had access to certain data that simplified the problem considerably .  aton set to work on a new track .    what if there were another nonluminous planetary body such as lagash .  if there were  you know  it would shine only by reflected light  and if it were composed of bluish rock  as lagash itself largely is  then  in the redness of the sky  the eternal blaze of the suns would make it invisible    drown it out completely .    theremon whistled .   what a screwy idea .     you think that s screwy .  listen to this  suppose this body rotated about lagash at such a distance and in such an orbit and had such a mass that its attention would exactly account for the deviations of lagash s orbit from theory    do you know what would happen .    the columnist shook his head .    well  sometimes this body would get in the way of a sun .   and sheerin emptied what remained in the bottle at a draft .    and it does  i suppose   said theremon flatly .    yes .  but only one sun lies in its plane of revolution .   he jerked a thumb at the shrunken sun above .   beta .  and it has been shown that the eclipse will occur only when the arrangement of the suns is such that beta is alone in its hemisphere and at maximum distance  at which time the moon is invariably at minimum distance .  the eclipse that results  with the moon seven times the apparent diameter of beta  covers all of lagash and lasts well over half a day  so that no spot on the planet escapes the effects .  that eclipse comes once every two thousand and forty nine years .    theremon s face was drawn into an expressionless mask .    and that s my story .    the psychologist nodded .   that s all of it .  first the eclipse    which will start in three quarters of an hour    then universal darkness and  maybe  these mysterious stars    then madness  and end of the cycle .    he brooded .   we had two months  leeway    we at the observatory    and that wasn t enough time to persuade lagash of the danger .  two centuries might not have been enough .  but our records are at the hideout  and today we photograph the eclipse .  the next cycle will start off with the truth  and when the next eclipse comes  mankind will at last be ready for it .  come to think of it  that s part of your story too .    a thin wind ruffled the curtains at the window as theremon opened it and leaned out .  it played coldly with his hair as he stared at the crimson sunlight on his hand .  then he turned in sudden rebellion .    what is there in darkness to drive me mad .    sheerin smiled to himself as he spun the empty liquor bottle with abstracted motions of his hand .   have you ever experienced darkness  young man .    the newsman leaned against the wall and considered .   no .  can t say i have .  but i know what it is .  just    uh      he made vague motions with his fingers and then brightened .   just no light .  like in caves .       have you ever been in a cave .     in a cave .  of course not .     i thought not .  i tried last week    just to see    but i got out in a hurry .  i went in until the mouth of the cave was just visible as a blur of light  with black everywhere else .  i never thought a person my weight could run that fast .    theremon s lip curled .   well  if it comes to that  i guess i wouldn t have run if i had been there .    the psychologist studied the young man with an annoyed frown .    my  don t you talk big .  i dare you to draw the curtain .    theremon looked his surprise and said   what for .  if we had four or five suns out there  we might want to cut the light down a bit for comfort  but now we haven t enough light as it is .     that s the point .  just draw the curtain  then come here and sit down .     all right .   theremon reached for the tasseled string and jerked .  the red curtain slid across the wide window  the brass rings hissing their way along the crossbar  and a dusk red shadow clamped down on the room .   theremon s footsteps sounded hollowly in the silence as he made his way to the table  and then they stopped halfway .   i can t see you  sir   he whispered .    feel your way   ordered sheerin in a strained voice .    but i can t see you  sir .   the newsman was breathing harshly .   i can t see anything .     what did you expect .   came the grim reply .   come here and sit down .    the footsteps sounded again  waveringly  approaching slowly .  there was the sound of someone fumbling with a chair .  theremon s voice came thinly   here i am .  i feel  .   .   .  ulp  .   .   .  all right .     you like it  do you .     n    no .  it s pretty awful .  the walls seem to be      he paused .   they seem to be closing in on me .  i keep wanting to push them away .  but i m not going mad .  in fact  the feeling isn t as bad as it was .     all right .  draw the curtain back again .    there were cautious footsteps through the dark  the rustle of theremon s body against the curtain as he felt for the tassel  and then the triumphant roo osh of the curtain slithering back .  red light flooded the room  and with a cry of joy theremon looked up at the sun .   sheerin wiped the moistness off his forehead with the back of a hand and said shakily   and that was just a dark room .     it can be stood   said theremon lightly .    yes  a dark room can .  but were you at the jonglor centennial exposition two years ago .     no  it so happens i never got around to it .  six thousand miles was just a bit too much to travel  even for the exposition .     well  i was there .  you remember hearing about the  tunnel of mystery  that broke all records in the amusement area    for the first month or so  anyway .     yes .  wasn t there some fuss about it .     very little .  it was hushed up .  you see  that tunnel of mystery was just a mile long tunnel    with no lights .  you got into a little open car and jolted along through darkness for fifteen minutes .  it was very popular    while it lasted .     popular .     certainly .  there s a fascination in being frightened when it s part of a game .  a baby is born with three instinctive fears  of loud noises  of falling  and of the absence of light .  that s why it s considered so funny to jump at someone and shout  boo .   that s why it s such fun to ride a roller coaster .  and that s why that tunnel of mystery started cleaning up .  people came out of that darkness shaking  breathless  half dead with fear  but they kept on paying to get in .     wait a while  i remember now .  some people came out dead  didn t they .  there were rumors of that after it shut down .    the psychologist snorted .   bah .  two or three died .  that was nothing .  they paid off the families of the dead ones and argued the jonglor city council into forgetting it .  after all  they said  if people with weak hearts want to go through the tunnel  it was at their own risk    and besides  it wouldn t happen again .  so they put a doctor in the front office and had every customer go through a physical examination before getting into the car .  that actually boosted ticket sales .     well  then .     but you see  there was something else .  people sometimes came out in perfect order  except that they refused to go into buildings    any buildings  including palaces  mansions  apartment houses  tenements  cottages  huts  shacks  lean tos  and tents .    theremon looked shocked .   you mean they refused to come in out of the open .  where d they sleep .     in the open .     they should have forced them inside .     oh  they did  they did .  whereupon these people went into violent hysterics and did their best to bat their brains out against the nearest wall .  once you got them inside  you couldn t keep them there without a strait jacket or a heavy dose of tranquilizer .     they must have been crazy .     which is exactly what they were .  one person out of every ten who went into that tunnel came out that way .  they called in the psychologists  and we did the only thing possible .  we closed down the exhibit .   he spread his hands .    what was the matter with these people .   asked theremon finally .    essentially the same thing that was the matter with you when you thought the walls of the room were crushing in on you in the dark .  there is a psychological term for mankind s instinctive fear of the absence of light .  we call it  claustrophobia   because the lack of light is always tied up with enclosed places  so that fear of one is fear of the other .  you see .     and those people of the tunnel .     those people of the tunnel consisted of those unfortunates whose mentality did not quite possess the resiliency to overcome the claustrophobia that overtook them in the darkness .  fifteen minutes without light is a long time  you only had two or three minutes  and i believe you were fairly upset .    the people of the tunnel had what is called a  claustrophobic fixation  .  their latent fear of darkness and enclosed places had crystalized and become active  and  as far as we can tell  permanent .  that s what fifteen minutes in the dark will do .    there was a long silence  and theremon s forehead wrinkled slowly into a frown .   i don t believe it s that bad .     you mean you don t want to believe   snapped sheerin .   you re afraid to believe .  look out the window .    theremon did so  and the psychologist continued without pausing .   imagine darkness    everywhere .  no light  as far as you can see .  the houses  the trees  the fields  the earth  the sky    black .  and stars thrown in  for all i know    whatever they are .  can you conceive it .     yes  i can   declared theremon truculently .   and sheerin slammed his fist down upon the table in sudden passion .   you lie .  you can t conceive that .  your brain wasn t built for the conception any more than it was built for the conception of infinity or of eternity .  you can only talk about it .  a fraction of the reality upsets you  and when the real thing comes  your brain is going to be presented with the phenomenon outside its limits of comprehension .  you will go mad  completely and permanently .  there is no question of it .    he added sadly   and another couple of millennia of painful struggle comes to nothing .  tomorrow there won t be a city standing unharmed in all lagash .    theremon recovered part of his mental equilibrium .   that doesn t follow .  i still don t see that i can go loony just because there isn t a sun in the sky    but even if i did  and everyone else did  how does that harm the cities .  are we going to blow them down .    but sheerin was angry  too .   if you were in darkness  what would you want more than anything else  what would it be that every instinct would call for .  light  damn you  light .     well .     and how would you get light .     i don t know   said theremon flatly .    what s the only way to get light  short of a sun .     how should i know .    they were standing face to face and nose to nose .   sheerin said   you burn something  mister .  ever see a forest fire .  ever go camping and cook a stew over a wood fire .  heat isn t the only thing burning wood gives off  you know .  it gives off light  and people know that .  and when it s dark they want light  and they re going to get it .     so they burn wood .     so they burn whatever they can get .  they ve got to have light .  they ve got to burn something  and wood isn t handy    so they ll burn whatever is nearest .  they ll have their light    and every center of habitation goes up in flames .    eyes held each other as though the whole matter were a personal affair of respective will powers  and then theremon broke away wordlessly .  his breathing was harsh and ragged  and he scarcely noted the sudden hubbub that came from the adjoining room behind the closed door .   sheerin spoke  and it was with an effort that he made it sound matter of fact .   i think i heard yimot s voice .  he and faro are probably back .  let s go in and see what kept them .     might as well .   muttered theremon .  he drew a long breath and seemed to shake himself .  the tension was broken .   the room was in an uproar  with members of the staff clustering about two young men who were removing outer garments even as they parried the miscellany of questions being thrown at them .   aton hustled through the crowd and faced the newcomers angrily .   do you realize that it s less than half an hour before deadline .  where have you two been .    faro    seated himself and rubbed his hands .  his cheeks were red with the outdoor chill .   yimot and i have just finished carrying through a little crazy experiment of our own .  we ve been trying to see if we couldn t construct an arrangement by which we could simulate the appearance of darkness and stars so as to get an advance notion as to how it looked .    there was a confused murmur from the listeners  and a sudden look of interest entered aton s eyes .   there wasn t anything said of this before .  how did you go about it .     well   said faro   the idea came to yimot and myself long ago  and we ve been working it out in our spare time .  yimot knew of a low one story house down in the city with a domed roof    it had once been used as a museum  i think .  anyway  we bought it        where did you get the money .   interrupted aton peremptorily .    our bank accounts   grunted yimot    .   it cost two thousand credits .   then  defensively   well  what of it .  tomorrow  two thousand credits will be two thousand pieces of paper .  that s all .     sure .   agreed faro .   we bought the place and rigged it up with black velvet from top to bottom so as to get as perfect a darkness as possible .  then we punched tiny holes in the ceiling and through the roof and covered them with little metal caps  all of which could be shoved aside simultaneously at the close of a switch .  at least we didn t do that part ourselves  we got a carpenter and an electrician and some others    money didn t count .  the point was that we could get the light to shine through those holes in the roof  so that we could get a starlike effect .    not a breath was drawn during the pause that followed .  aton said stiffly   you had no right to make a private       faro seemed abashed .   i know  sir    but frankly  yimot and i thought the experiment was a little dangerous .  if the effect really worked  we half expected to go mad    from what sheerin says about all this  we thought that would be rather likely .  we wanted to take the risk ourselves .  of course if we found we could retain sanity  it occurred to us that we might develop immunity to the real thing  and then expose the rest of you the same way .  but things didn t work out at all        why  what happened .    it was yimot who answered .   we shut ourselves in and allowed our eyes to get accustomed to the dark .  it s an extremely creepy feeling because the total darkness makes you feel as if the walls and ceiling are crushing in on you .  but we got over that and pulled the switch .  the caps fell away and the roof glittered all over with little dots of light        well .     well    nothing .  that was the whacky part of it .  nothing happened .  it was just a roof with holes in it  and that s just what it looked like .  we tried it over and over again    that s what kept us so late    but there just isn t any effect at all .    there followed a shocked silence  and all eyes turned to sheerin  who sat motionless  mouth open .   theremon was the first to speak .   you know what this does to this whole theory you ve built up  sheerin  don t you .   he was grinning with relief .   but sheerin raised his hand .   now wait a while .  just let me think this through .   and then he snapped his fingers  and when he lifted his head there was neither surprise nor uncertainty in his eyes .   of course       he never finished .  from somewhere up above there sounded a sharp clang  and beenay  starting to his feet  dashed up the stairs with a  what the devil .    the rest followed after .   things happened quickly .  once up in the dome  beenay cast one horrified glance at the shattered photographic plates and at the man bending over them  and then hurled himself fiercely at the intruder  getting a death grip on his throat .  there was a wild threshing  and as others of the staff joined in  the stranger was swallowed up and smothered under the weight of half a dozen angry men .   aton came up last  breathing heavily .   let him up .    there was a reluctant unscrambling and the stranger  panting harshly  with his clothes torn and his forehead bruised  was hauled to his feet .  he had a short yellow beard curled elaborately in the style affected by the cultists .  beenay shifted his hold to a collar grip and shook the man savagely .   all right  rat  what s the idea .  these plates        i wasn t after them   retorted the cultist coldly .   that was an accident .    beenay followed his glowering stare and snarled   i see .  you were after the cameras themselves .  the accident with the plates was a stroke of luck for you  then .  if you had touched snapping bertha or any of the others  you would have died by slow torture .  as it is      he drew his fist back .   aton grabbed his sleeve .   stop that .  let him go .    the young technician wavered  and his arm dropped reluctantly .  aton pushed him aside and confronted the cultist .   you re latimer  aren t you .    the cultist bowed stiffly and indicated the symbol upon his hip .  i am latimer     adjutant of the third class to his serenity  sor   .     and     aton s white eyebrows lifted     you were with his serenity when he visited me last week  weren t you .    latimer bowed a second time .    now  then  what do you want .     nothing that you would give me of your own free will .     sor   sent you  i suppose    or is this your own idea .     i won t answer that question .     will there be any further visitors .     i won t answer that  either .    aton glanced at his timepiece and scowled .   now  man  what is it your master wants of me .  i have fulfilled my end of the bargain .    latimer smiled faintly  but said nothing .    i asked him   continued aton angrily   for data only the cult could supply  and it was given to me .  for that  thank you .  in return i promised to prove the essential truth of the creed of the cult .     there was no need to prove that   came the proud retort .  it stands proven by the book of revelations .     for the handful that constitute the cult  yes .  don t pretend to mistake my meaning .  i offered to present scientific backing for your beliefs .  and i did .    the cultist s eyes narrowed bitterly .   yes  you did    with a fox s subtlety  for your pretended explanation backed our beliefs  and at the same time removed all necessity for them .  you made of the darkness and of the stars a natural phenomenon and removed all its real significance .  that was blasphemy .     if so  the fault isn t mine .  the facts exist .  what can i do but state them .     your  facts  are a fraud and a delusion .    aton stamped angrily .   how do you know .    and the answer came with the certainty of absolute faith .   i know .    the director purpled and beenay whispered urgently .  aton waved him silent .   and what does sor   want us to do .  he still thinks .  i suppose  that in trying to warn the world to take measures against the menace of madness  we are placing innumerable souls in jeopardy .  we aren t succeeding  if that means anything to him .     the attempt itself has done harm enough  and your vicious effort to gain information by means of your devilish instruments must be stopped .  we obey the will of the stars  and i only regret that my clumsiness prevented me from wrecking your infernal devices .     it wouldn t have done you too much good   returned aton .   all our data  except for the direct evidence we intend collecting right now  is already safely cached and well beyond possibility of harm .   he smiled grimly .   but that does not affect your present status as an attempted burglar and criminal .    he turned to the men behind him .   someone call the police at saro city .    there was a cry of distaste from sheerin .   damn it  aton  what s wrong with you .  there s no time for that .  here     he hustled his way forward     let me handle this .    aton stared down his nose at the psychologist .   this is not the time for your monkeyshines  sheerin .  will you please let me handle this my own way .  right now you are a complete outsider here  and don t forget it .    sheerin s mouth twisted eloquently .   now why should we go to the impossible trouble of calling the police    with beta s eclipse a matter of minutes from now    when this young man here is perfectly willing to pledge his word of honor to remain and cause no trouble whatsoever .    the cultist answered promptly   i will do no such thing .  you re free to do what you want  but it s only fair to warn you that just as soon as i get my chance i m going to finish what i came out here to do .  if it s my word of honor you re relying on  you d better call the police .    sheerin smiled in a friendly fashion .   you re a determined cuss  aren t you .  well  i ll explain something .  do you see that young man at the window .  he s a strong  husky fellow  quite handy with his fists  and he s an outsider besides .  once the eclipse starts there will be nothing for him to do except keep an eye on you .  besides him  there will be myself    a little too stout for active fisticuffs  but still able to help .     well  what of it .   demanded latimer frozenly .    listen and i ll tell you   was the reply .   just as soon as the eclipse starts  we re going to take you  theremon and i  and deposit you in a little closet with one door  to which is attached one giant lock and no windows .  you will remain there for the duration .     and afterward   breathed latimer fiercely   there ll be no one to let me out .  i know as well as you do what the coming of the stars means    i know it far better than you .  with all your minds gone  you are not likely to free me .  suffocation or slow starvation  is it .  about what i might have expected from a group of scientists .  but i don t give my word .  it s a matter of principle  and i won t discuss it further .    aton seemed perturbed .  his faded eyes were troubled .    really  sheerin  locking him        please .   sheerin motioned him impatiently to silence .   i don t think for a moment things will go that far .  latimer has just tried a clever little bluff  but i m not a psychologist just because i like the sound of the word .   he grinned at the cultist .   come now  you don t really think i m trying anything as crude as slow starvation .  my dear latimer  if i lock you in the closet  you are not going to see the darkness  and you are not going to see the stars .  it does not take much knowledge of the fundamental creed of the cult to realize that for you to be hidden from the stars when they appear means the loss of your immortal soul .  now  i believe you to be an honorable man .  i ll accept your word of honor to make no further effort to disrupt proceedings  if you ll offer it .    a vein throbbed in latimer s temple  and he seemed to shrink within himself as he said thickly   you have it .   and then he added with swift fury .   but it is my consolation that you will all be damned for your deeds of today .   he turned on his heel and stalked to the high three legged stool by the door .   sheerin nodded to the columnist .   take a seat next to him  theremon    just as a formality .  hey  theremon .    but the newspaperman didn t move .  he had gone pale to the lips .   look at that .   the finger he pointed toward the sky shook  and his voice was dry and cracked .   there was one simultaneous gasp as every eye followed the pointing finger and  for one breathless moment  stared frozenly .   beta was chipped on one side .   the tiny bit of encroaching blackness was perhaps the width of a fingernail  but to the staring watchers it magnified itself into the crack of doom .   only for a moment they watched  and after that there was a shrieking confusion that was even shorter of duration and which gave way to an orderly scurry of activity    each man at his prescribed job .  at the crucial moment there was no time for emotion .  the men were merely scientists with work to do .  even aton had melted away .   sheerin said prosaically .   first contact must have been made fifteen minutes ago .  a little early  but pretty good considering the uncertainties involved in the calculation .   he looked about him and then tiptoed to theremon  who still remained staring out the window  and dragged him away gently .    aton is furious   he whispered   so stay away .  he missed first contact on account of this fuss with latimer  and if you get in his way he ll have you thrown out the window .    theremon nodded shortly and sat down .  sheerin stared in surprise at him .    the devil  man   he exclaimed   you re shaking .     eh .   theremon licked dry lips and then tried to smile .   i don t feel very well  and that s a fact .    the psychologist s eyes hardened .   you re not losing your nerve .     no .   cried theremon in a flash of indignation .   give me a chance  will you .  i haven t really believed this rigmarole    not way down beneath  anyway    till just this minute .  give me a chance to get used to the idea .  you ve been preparing yourself for two months or more .     you re right  at that   replied sheerin thoughtfully .   listen .  have you got a family    parents  wife  children .    theremon shook his head .   you mean the hideout  i suppose .  no  you don t have to worry about that .  i have a sister  but she s two thousand miles away .  i don t even know her exact address .     well  then  what about yourself .  you ve got time to get there  and they re one short anyway  since i left .  after all  you re not needed here  and you d make a darned fine addition       theremon looked at the other wearily .   you think i m scared stiff  don t you .  well  get this  mister .  i m a newspaperman and i ve been assigned to cover a story .  i intend covering it .    there was a faint smile on the psychologist s face .   i see .  professional honor  is that it .     you might call it that .  but  man .  i d give my right arm for another bottle of that sockeroo juice even half the size of the one you bogged .  if ever a fellow needed a drink  i do .    he broke off .  sheerin was nudging him violently .   do you hear that .  listen .    theremon followed the motion of the other s chin and stared at the cultist  who  oblivious to all about him  faced the window  a look of wild elation on his face  droning to himself the while in singsong fashion .    what s he saying .   whispered the columnist .    he s quoting book of revelations  fifth chapter   replied sheerin .  then  urgently   keep quiet and listen  i tell you .    the cultist s voice had risen in a sudden increase of fervor     and it came to pass that in those days the sun  beta  held lone vigil in the sky for ever longer periods asthe revolutions passed  until such time as for full half a revolution  it alone  shrunken and cold  shone down upon lagash .      and men did assemble in the public squares and in the highways  there to debate and to marvel at the sight  for a strange depression had seized them .  their minds were troubled and their speech confused  for the souls of men awaited the coming of the stars .      and in the city of trigon  at high noon  vendret   came forth and said unto the men of trigon   lo  ye sinners .  though ye scorn the ways of righteousness  yet will the time of reckoning come .  even now the cave approaches to swallow lagash  yea  and all it contains .       and even as he spoke the lip of the cave of darkness passed the edge of beta so that to all lagash it was hidden from sight .  loud were the cries of men as it vanished  and great the fear of soul that fell upon them .      it came to pass that the darkness of the cave fell upon lagash  and there was no light on all the surface of lagash .  men were even as blinded  nor could one man see his neighbor  though he felt his breath upon his face .      and in this blackness there appeared the stars  in countless numbers  and to the strains of music of such beauty that the very leaves of the trees cried out in wonder .      and in that moment the souls of men departed from them  and their abandoned bodies became even as beasts  yea  even as brutes of the wild  so that through the blackened streets of the cities of lagash they prowled with wild cries .      from the stars there then reached down the heavenly flame  and where it touched  the cities of lagash flamed to utter destruction  so that of man and of the works of man nought remained .    even then         there was a subtle change in latimer s tone .  his eyes had not shifted  but somehow he had become aware of the absorbed attention of the other two .  easily  without pausing for breath  the timbre of his voice shifted and the syllables became more liquid .   theremon  caught by surprise  stared .  the words seemed on the border of familiarity .  there was an elusive shift in the accent  a tiny change in the vowel stress  nothing more    yet latimer had become thoroughly unintelligible .   sheerin smiled slyly .   he shifted to some old cycle tongue  probably their traditional second cycle .  that was the language in which the book of revelations was originally written  you know .     it doesn t matter  i ve heard enough .   theremon shoved his chair back and brushed his hair back with hands that no longer shook .   i feel much better now .     you do .   sheerin seemed mildly surprised .    i ll say i do .  i had a bad case of jitters just a while back .  listening to you and your gravitation and seeing that eclipse start almost finished me .  but this     he jerked a contemptuous thumb at the yellow bearded cultist     this is the sort of thing my nurse used to tell me .  i ve been laughing at that sort of thing all my life .  i m not going to let it scare me now .    he drew a deep breath and said with a hectic gaiety   but if i expect to keep on the good side of myself .  i m going to turn my chair away from the window .    sheerin said   yes  but you d better talk lower .  aton just lifted his head out of that box he s got it stuck into and gave you a look that should have killed you .    theremon made a mouth .   i forgot about the old fellow .   with elaborate care he turned the chair from the window  cast one distasteful look over his shoulder  and said   it has occurred to me that there must be considerable immunity against this star madness .    the psychologist did not answer immediately .  beta was past its zenith now  and the square of bloody sunlight that outlined the window upon the floor had lifted into sheerin s lap .  he stared at its dusky color thoughtfully and then bent and squinted into the sun itself .   the chip in its side had grown to a black encroachment that covered a third of beta .  he shuddered  and when he straightened once more his florid cheeks did not contain quite as much color as they had had previously .   with a smile that was almost apologetic  he reversed his chair also .   there are probably two million people in saro city that are all trying to join the cult at once in one gigantic revival .   then  ironically .   the cult is in for an hour of unexampled prosperity .  i trust they ll make the most of it .  now  what was it you said .     just this .  how did the cultists manage to keep the book of revelations going from cycle to cycle  and how on lagash did it get written in the first place .  there must have been some sort of immunity  for if everyone had gone mad  who would be left to write the book .    sheerin stared at his questioner ruefully .   well  now  young man  there isn t any eyewitness answer to that  but we ve got a few damned good notions as to what happened .  you see .  there are three kinds of people who might remain relatively unaffected .  first  the very few who don t see the stars at all  the seriously retarded or those who drink themselves into a stupor at the beginning of the eclipse and remain so to the end .  we leave them out    because they aren t really witnesses .    then there are children below six  to whom the world as a whole is too new and strange for them to be too frightened at stars and darkness .  they would be just another item in an already surprising world .  you see that  don t you .    the other nodded doubtfully .   i suppose so .     lastly  there are those whose minds are too coarsely grained to be entirely toppled .  the very insensitive would be scarcely affected    oh  such people as some of our older  work broken peasants .  well  the children would have fugitive memories  and that  combined with the confused  incoherent babblings of the half mad morons  formed the basis for the book of revelations .    naturally  the book was based  in the first place  on the testimony of those least qualified to serve as historians  that is  children and morons  and was probably edited and re edited through the cycles .     do you suppose   broke in theremon   that they carried the book through the cycles the way we re planning on handing on the secret of gravitation .    sheerin shrugged .   perhaps  but their exact method is unimportant .  they do it  somehow .  the point i was getting at was that the book can t help but be a mass of distortion  even if it is based on fact .  for instance  do you remember the experiment with the holes in the roof that faro and yimot tried    the one that didn t work .     yes .     you know why it didn t w      he stopped and rose in alarm  for aton was approaching  his face a twisted mask of consternation .   what s happened .    aton drew him aside and sheerin could feel the fingers on his elbow twitching .    not so loud .   aton s voice was low and tortured .   i ve just gotten word from the hideout on the private line .    sheerin broke in anxiously .   they are in trouble .     not they .   aton stressed the pronoun significantly .   they sealed themselves off just a while ago  and they re going to stay buried till day after tomorrow .  they re safe .  but the city .  sheerin    it s a shambles .  you have no idea      he was having difficulty in speaking .    well .   snapped sheerin impatiently .   what of it .  it will get worse .  what are you shaking about .   then  suspiciously   how do you feel .    aton s eyes sparked angrily at the insinuation  and then faded to anxiety once more .   you don t understand .  the cultists are active .  they re rousing the people to storm the observatory    promising them immediate entrance into grace  promising them salvation  promising them anything .  what are we to do  sheerin .    sheerin s head bent  and he stared in long abstraction at his toes .  he tapped his chin with one knuckle  then looked up and said crisply   do .  what is there to do .  nothing at all .  do the men know of this .     no  of course not .     good .  keep it that way .  how long till totality .     not quite an hour .     there s nothing to do but gamble .  it will take time to organize any really formidable mob  and it will take more time to get them out here .  we re a good five miles from the city       he glared out the window  down the slopes to where the farmed patches gave way to clumps of white houses in the suburbs  down to where the metropolis itself was a blur on the horizon    a mist in the waning blaze of beta .   he repeated without turning .   it will take time .  keep on working and pray that totality comes first .    beta was cut in half  the line of division pushing a slight concavity into the still bright portion of the sun .  it was like a gigantic eyelid shutting slantwise over the light of a world .   the faint clatter of the room in which he stood faded into oblivion  and he sensed only the thick silence of the fields outside .  the very insects seemed frightened mute .  and things were dim .   he jumped at the voice in his ear .  theremon said .   is something wrong .     eh .  er    no .  get back to the chair .  we re in the way .   they slipped back to their comer  but the psychologist did not speak for a time .  he lifted a finger and loosened his collar .  he twisted his neck back and forth but found no relief .  he looked up suddenly .    are you having any difficulty in breathing .    the newspaperman opened his eyes wide and drew two or three long breaths .   no .  why .     i looked out the window too long  i suppose .  the dimness got me .  difficulty in breathing is one of the first symptoms of a claustrophobic attack .     theremon drew another long breath .   well  it hasn t got me yet .  say  here s another of the fellows .    beenay had interposed his bulk between the light and the pair in the corner  and sheerin squinted up at him anxiously .   hello  beenay .    the astronomer shifted his weight to the other foot and smiled feebly .   you won t mind if i sit down awhile and join in the talk .  my cameras are set  and there s nothing to do till totality .   he paused and eyed the cultist  who fifteen minutes earlier had drawn a small  skin bound book from his sleeve and had been poring intently over it ever since .    that rat hasn t been making trouble  has he .    sheerin shook his head .  his shoulders were thrown back and he frowned his concentration as he forced himself to breathe regularly .  he said   have you had any trouble breathing  beenay .    beenay sniffed the air in his turn .   it doesn t seem stuffy to me .     a touch of claustrophobia   explained sheerin apologetically .    ohhh .  it worked itself differently with me .  i get the impression that my eyes are going back on me .  things seem to blur and    well  nothing is clear .  and it s cold  too .     oh  it s cold  all right .  that s no illusion .   theremon grimaced .   my toes feel as if i ve been shipping them cross country in a refrigerating car .     what we need   put in sheerin   is to keep our minds busy with extraneous affairs .  i was telling you a while ago  theremon  why faro s experiments with the holes in the roof came to nothing .     you were just beginning   replied theremon .  he encircled a knee with both arms and nuzzled his chin against it .    well  as i started to say  they were misled by taking the book of revelations literally .  there probably wasn t any sense in attaching any physical significance to the stars .  it might be  you know  that in the presence of total darkness  the mind finds it absolutely necessary to create light .  this illusion of light might be all the stars there really are .     in other words   interposed theremon   you mean the stars arc the results of the madness and not one of the causes .  then  what good will beenay s photographs be .     to prove that it is an illusion  maybe  or to prove the opposite  for all i know .  then again       but beenay had drawn his chair closer  and there was an expression of sudden enthusiasm on his face .   say  i m glad you two got onto this subject .   his eyes narrowed and he lifted one finger .   i ve been thinking about these stars and i ve got a really cute notion .  of course it s strictly ocean foam  and i m not trying to advance it seriously  but i think it s interesting .  do you want to hear it .    he seemed half reluctant  but sheerin leaned back and said   go ahead .  i m listening .     well  then  supposing there were other suns in the universe .   he broke off a little bashfully .   i mean suns that are so far away that they re too dim to see .  it sounds as if i ve been reading some of that fantastic fiction  i suppose .     not necessarily .  still  isn t that possibility eliminated by the fact that  according to the law of gravitation  they would make themselves evident by their attractive forces .     not if they were far enough off   rejoined beenay   really far off    maybe as much as four light years  or even more .  we d never be able to detect perturbations then  because they d be too small .  say that there were a lot of suns that far off  a dozen or two  maybe .    theremon whistled melodiously .   what an idea for a good sunday supplement article .  two dozen suns in a universe eight light years across .  wow .  that would shrink our world into insignificance .  the readers would eat it up .     only an idea   said beenay with a grin   but you see the point .  during an eclipse  these dozen suns would become visible because there d be no real sunlight to drown them out .  since they re so far off  they d appear small  like so many little marbles .  of course the cultists talk of millions of stars  but that s probably exaggeration .  there just isn t any place in the universe you could put a million suns    unless they touch one another .    sheerin had listened with gradually increasing interest .   you ve hit something there  beenay .  and exaggeration is just exactly what would happen .  our minds  as you probably know  can t grasp directly any number higher than five  above that there is only the concept of  many  .  a dozen would become a million just like that .  a damn good idea .     and i ve got another cute little notion   beenay said .   have you ever thought what a simple problem gravitation would be if only you had a sufficiently simple system .  supposing you had a universe in which there was a planet with only one sun .  the planet would travel in a perfect ellipse and the exact nature of the gravitational force would be so evident it could be accepted as an axiom .  astronomers on such a world would start off with gravity probably before they even invented the telescope .  naked eye observation would be enough .     but would such a system be dynamically stable .   questioned sheerin doubtfully .    sure .  they call it the  one and one  case .  it s been worked out mathematically  but it s the philosophical implications that interest me .     it s nice to think about   admitted sheerin   as a pretty abstraction    like a perfect gas  or absolute zero .     of course   continued beenay   there s the catch that life would be impossible on such a planet .  it wouldn t get enough heat and light  and if it rotated there would be total darkness half of each day .  you couldn t expect life    which is fundamentally dependent upon light    to develop under those conditions .  besides       sheerin s chair went over backward as he sprang to his feet in a rude interruption .   aton s brought out the lights .    beenay said   huh   turned to stare  and then grinned halfway around his head in open relief .   there were half a dozen foot long  inch thick rods cradled in aton s arms .  he glared over them at the assembled staff members .    get back to work  all of you .  sheerin  come here and help me .    sheerin trotted to the older man s side and  one by one  in utter silence  the two adjusted the rods in makeshift metal holders suspended from the walls .   with the air of one carrying through the most sacred item of a religious ritual  sheerin scraped a large  clumsy match into spluttering life and passed it to aton  who carried the flame to the upper end of one of the rods .   it hesitated there awhile  playing futilely about the tip  until a sudden  crackling flare cast aton s lined face into yellow highlights .  he withdrew the match and a spontaneous cheer rattled the window .   the rod was topped by six inches of wavering flame .  methodically  the other rods were lighted  until six independent fires turned the rear of the room yellow .   the light was dim  dimmer even than the tenuous sunlight .  the flames reeled crazily  giving birth to drunken  swaying shadows .  the torches smoked devilishly and smelled like a bad day in the kitchen .  but they emitted yellow light .   there was something about yellow light  after four hours of somber  dimming beta .  even latimer had lifted his eyes from his book and stared in wonder .   sheerin warmed his hands at the nearest  regardless of the soot that gathered upon them in a fine  gray powder  and muttered ecstatically to himself .   beautiful .  beautiful .  i never realized before what a wonderful color yellow is .    but theremon regarded the torches suspiciously .  he wrinkled his nose at the rancid odor and said   what are those things .     wood   said sheerin shortly .    oh  no  they re not .  they aren t burning .  the top inch is charred and the flame just keeps shooting up out of nothing .     that s the beauty of it .  this is a really efficient artificial light mechanism .  we made a few hundred of them  but most went to the hideout  of course .  you see     he turned and wiped his blackened hands upon his handkerchief     you take the pithy core of coarse water reeds  dry them thoroughly  and soak them in animal grease .  then you set fire to it and the grease burns  little by little .  these torches will burn for almost half an hour without stopping .  ingenious  isn t it .  it was developed by one of our own young men at saro university .    after the momentary sensation  the dome had quieted .  latimer had carried his chair directly beneath a torch and continued reading  lips moving in the monotonous recital of invocations to the stars .  beenay had drifted away to his cameras once more  and theremon seized the opportunity to add to his notes on the article he was going to write for the saro city chronicle the next day    a procedure he had been following for the last two hours in a perfectly methodical  perfectly conscientious and  as he was well aware  perfectly meaningless fashion .  but  as the gleam of amusement in sheerin s eyes indicated  careful note taking occupied his mind with something other than the fact that the sky was gradually turning a horrible deep purple red  as if it were one gigantic  freshly peeled beet  and so it fulfilled its purpose .   the air grew  somehow  denser .  dusk  like a palpable entity  entered the room  and the dancing circle of yellow light about the torches etched itself into ever sharper distinction against the gathering grayness beyond .  there was the odor of smoke and the presence of little chuckling sounds that the torches made as they burned  the soft pad of one of the men circling the table at which he worked  on hesitant tiptoes  the occasional indrawn breath of someone trying to retain composure in a world that was retreating into the shadow .   it was theremon who first heard the extraneous noise .  it was a vague  unorganized impression of sound that would have gone unnoticed but for the dead silence that prevailed within the dome .   the newsman sat upright and replaced his notebook .  he held his breath and listened  then  with considerable reluctance  threaded his way between the solarscope and one of beenay s cameras and stood before the window .   the silence ripped to fragments at his startled shout   sheerin .    work stopped .  the psychologist was at his side in a moment .  aton joined him .  even yimot     high in his little lean back seat at the eyepiece of the gigantic solarscope  paused and looked downward .   outside  beta was a mere smoldering splinter  taking one last desperate look at lagash .  the eastern horizon  in the direction of the city  was lost in darkness  and the road from saro to the observatory was a dull red line bordered on both sides by wooded tracts  the trees of which had somehow lost individuality and merged into a continuous shadowy mass .   but it was the highway itself that held attention  for along it there surged another  and infinitely menacing  shadowy mass .   aton cried in a cracked voice   the madmen from the city .  they ve come .     how long to totality .   demanded sheerin .    fifteen minutes  but  .   .   .  but they ll be here in five .     never mind  keep the men working .  we ll hold them off .  this place is built like a fortress .  aton  keep an eye on our young cultist just for luck .  theremon  come with me .    sheerin was out the door  and theremon was at his heels .  the stairs stretched below them in tight  circular sweeps about the central shaft  fading into a dank and dreary grayness .   the first momentum of their rush had carried them fifty feet down  so that the dim  flickering yellow from the open door of the dome had disappeared and both above and below the same dusky shadow crushed in upon them .   sheerin paused  and his pudgy hand clutched at his chest .  his eyes bulged and his voice was a dry cough .   i can t  .   .   .  breathe  .   .   .  go down  .   .   .  yourself .  close all doors       theremon took a few downward steps  then turned .    wait .  can you hold out a minute .   he was panting himself .  the air passed in and out his lungs like so much molasses  and there was a little germ of screeching panic in his mind at the thought of making his way into the mysterious darkness below by himself .   theremon  after all  was afraid of the dark .    stay here   he said .  i ll be back in a second .   he dashed upward two steps at a time  heart pounding    not altogether from the exertion    tumbled into the dome and snatched a torch from its holder .  it was foul smelling  and the smoke smarted his eyes almost blind  but he clutched that torch as if he wanted to kiss it for joy  and its flame streamed backward as he hurtled down the stairs again .   sheerin opened his eyes and moaned as theremon bent over him .  theremon shook him roughly .   all right  get a hold on yourself .  we ve got light .    he held the torch at tiptoe height and  propping the tottering psychologist by an elbow  made his way downward in the middle of the protecting circle of illumination .   the offices on the ground floor still possessed what light there was  and theremon felt the horror about him relax .    here   he said brusquely  and passed the torch to sheerin .   you can hear them outside .    and they could .  little scraps of hoarse  wordless shouts .   but sheerin was right  the observatory was built like a fortress .  erected in the last century  when the neo gavottian style of architecture was at its ugly height  it had been designed for stability and durability rather than for beauty .   the windows were protected by the grillwork of inch thick iron bars sunk deep into the concrete sills .  the walls were solid masonry that an earthquake couldn t have touched  and the main door was a huge oaken slab rein    forced with iron .  theremon shot the bolts and they slid shut with a dull clang .   at the other end of the corridor  sheerin cursed weakly .  he pointed to the lock of the back door which had been neatly jimmied into uselessness .    that must be how latimer got in   he said .    well  don t stand there   cried theremon impatiently .   help drag up the furniture    and keep that torch out of my eyes .  the smoke s killing me .    he slammed the heavy table up against the door as he spoke  and in two minutes had built a barricade which made up for what it lacked in beauty and symmetry by the sheer inertia of its massiveness .   somewhere  dimly  far off  they could hear the battering of naked fists upon the door  and the screams and yells from outside had a sort of half reality .   that mob had set off from saro city with only two things in mind  the attainment of cultist salvation by the destruction of the observatory  and a maddening fear that all but paralyzed them .  there was no time to think of ground cars  or of weapons  or of leadership  or even of organization .  they made for the observatory on foot and assaulted it with bare hands .   and now that they were there  the last flash of beta  the last ruby red drop of flame  flickered feebly over a humanity that had left only stark  universal fear .   theremon groaned   let s get back to the dome .    in the dome  only yimot  at the solarscope  had kept his place .  the rest were clustered about the cameras  and beenay was giving his instructions in a hoarse  strained voice .    get it straight  all of you .  i m snapping beta just before totality and changing the plate .  that will leave one of you to each camera .  you all know about  .   .   .  about times of exposure       there was a breathless murmur of agreement .   beenay passed a hand over his eyes .   are the torches still burning .  never mind  i see them .   he was leaning hard against the back of a chair .   now remember  don t .   .   .  don t try to look for good shots .  don t waste time trying to get t two stars at a time in the scope field .  one is enough .  and  .   .   .  and if you feel yourself going  get away from the camera .    at the door  sheerin whispered to theremon   take me to aton .  i don t see him .    the newsman did not answer immediately .  the vague forms of the astronomers wavered and blurred  and the torches overhead had become only yellow splotches .    it s dark   he whimpered .   sheerin held out his hand .   aton .   he stumbled forward .   aton .    theremon stepped after and seized his arm .   wait  i ll take you .   somehow he made his way across the room .  he closed his eyes against the darkness and his mind against the chaos within it .   no one heard them or paid attention to them .  sheerin stumbled against the wall .   aton .    the psychologist felt shaking hands touching him  then withdrawing  a voice muttering   is that you  sheerin .     aton .   he strove to breathe normally .   don t worry about the mob .  the place will hold them off .    latimer  the cultist  rose to his feet  and his face twisted in desperation .  his word was pledged  and to break it would mean placing his soul in mortal peril .  yet that word had been forced from him and had not been given freely .  the stars would come soon .  he could not stand by and allow    and yet his word was pledged .   beenay s face was dimly flushed as it looked upward at beta s last ray  and latimer  seeing him bend over his camera  made his decision .  his nails cut the flesh of his palms as he tensed himself .   he staggered crazily as he started his rush .  there was nothing before him but shadows  the very floor beneath his feet lacked substance .  and then someone was upon him and he went down with clutching fingers at his throat .   he doubled his knee and drove it hard into his assailant .   let me up or i ll kill you .    theremon cried out sharply and muttered through a blinding haze of pain .   you double crossing rat .    the newsman seemed conscious of everything at once .  he heard beenay croak   i ve got it .  at your cameras  men .   and then there was the strange awareness that the last thread of sunlight had thinned out and snapped .   simultaneously he heard one last choking gasp from beenay  and a queer little cry from sheerin  a hysterical giggle that cut off in a rasp    and a sudden silence  a strange  deadly silence from outside .   and latimer had gone limp in his loosening grasp .  theremon peered into the cultist s eyes and saw the blankness of them  staring upward  mirroring the feeble yellow of the torches .  he saw the bubble of froth upon latimer s lips and heard the low animal whimper in latimer s throat .   with the slow fascination of fear  he lifted himself on one arm and turned his eyes toward the blood curdling blackness of the window .   through it shone the stars .   not earth s feeble thirty six hundred stars visible to the eye  lagash was in the center of a giant cluster .  thirty thousand mighty suns shone down in a soul searing splendor that was more frighteningly cold in its awful indifference than the bitter wind that shivered across the cold  horribly bleak world .   theremon staggered to his feet  his throat  constricting him to breathlessness  all the muscles of his body writhing in an intensity of terror and sheer fear beyond bearing .  he was going mad and knew it  and somewhere deep inside a bit of sanity was screaming  struggling to fight off the hopeless flood of black terror .  it was very horrible to go mad and know that you were going mad    to know that in a little minute you would be here physically and yet all the real essence would be dead and drowned in the black madness .  for this was the dark    the dark and the cold and the doom .  the bright walls of the universe were shattered and their awful black fragments were falling down to crush and squeeze and obliterate him .   he jostled someone crawling on hands and knees  but stumbled somehow over him .  hands groping at his tortured throat  he limped toward the flame of the torches that filled all his mad vision .    light .   he screamed .   aton  somewhere  was crying  whimpering horribly like a terribly frightened child .   stars    all the stars    we didn t know at all .  we didn t know anything .  we thought six stars in a universe is something the stars didn t notice is darkness forever and ever and ever and the walls are breaking in and we didn t know we couldn t know and anything       someone clawed at the torch  and it fell and snuffed out .  in the instant  the awful splendor of the indifferent stars leaped nearer to them .   on the horizon outside the window  in the direction of saro city  a crimson glow began growing  strengthening in brightness  that was not the glow of a sun .   the long night had come again .   green patches  he had slipped aboard the ship .  there had been dozens waiting outside the energy barrier when it had seemed that waiting would do no good .  then the barrier had faltered for a matter of two minutes  which showed the superiority of unified organisms over life fragments  and he was across .   none of the others had been able to move quickly enough to take advantage of the break  but that didn t matter .  all alone  he was enough .  no others were necessary .   and the thought faded out of satisfaction and into loneliness .  it was a terribly unhappy and unnatural thing to be parted from all the rest of the unified organism  to be a life fragment oneself .  how could these aliens stand being fragments .   it increased his sympathy for the aliens .  now that he experienced fragmentation himself  he could feel  as though from a distance  the terrible isolation that made them so afraid .  it was fear born of that isolation that dictated their actions .  what but the insane fear of their condition could have caused them to blast an area  one mile in diameter  into dull red heat before landing their ship .  even the organized life ten feet deep in the soil had been destroyed in the blast .   he engaged reception  listening eagerly  letting the alien thought saturate him .  he enjoyed the touch of life upon his consciousness .  he would have to ration that enjoyment .  he must not forget himself .   but it could do no harm to listen to thoughts .  some of the fragments of  copyright         by world editions  inc .   original titte  misbegotten missionary .     life on the ship thought quite clearly  considering that they were such primitive  incomplete creatures .  their thoughts were like tiny bells .   roger oldenn said   i feel contaminated .  you know what i mean .  i keep washing my hands and it doesn t help .    jerry thorn hated dramatics and didn t look up .  they were still maneuvering in the stratosphere of saybrook s planet and he preferred to watch the panel dials .  he said   no reason to feel contaminated .  nothing happened .     i hope not   said oldenn .   at least they had all the field men discard their spacesuits in the air lock for complete disinfection .  they had a radiation bath for all men entering from outside .  i suppose nothing happened .     why be nervous  then .     i don t know .  i wish the barrier hadn t broken down .     who doesn t .  it was an accident .     i wonder .   oldenn was vehement .   i was here when it happened .  my shift  you know .  there was no reason to overload the power line .  there was equipment plugged into it that had no damn business near it .  none whatsoever .     all right .  people are stupid .     not that stupid .  i hung around when the old man was checking into the matter .  none of them had reasonable excuses .  the armor baking circuits  which were draining off two thousand watts  had been put into the barrier line .  they d been using the second subsidiaries for a week .  why not this time .  they couldn t give any reason .     can you .    oldenn flushed .   no    was just wondering if the men had been  he searched for a word  hypnotized into it .  by those things outside .    thorn s eyes lifted and met those of the other levelly .   i wouldn t repeat that to anyone else .  the barrier was down only two minutes .  if anything had happened  if even a spear of grass had drifted across it would have shown up in our bacteria cultures within half an hour  in the fruit fly colonies in a matter of days .  before we got back it would show up in the hamsters  the rabbits  maybe the goats .  just get it through your head  oldenn  that nothing happened .  nothing .    oldenn turned on his heel and left .  in leaving  his foot came within two feet of the object in the comer of the room .  he did not see it .   he disengaged his reception centers and let the thoughts flow past him unperceived .  these life fragments were not important  in any case  since they were not fitted for the continuation of life .  even as fragments  they were incomplete .   the other types of fragments now they were different .  he had to be careful of them .  the temptation would be great  and he must give no  indication  none at all  of his existence on board ship till they landed on their home planet .   he focused on the other parts of the ship  marveling at the diversity of life .  each item  no matter how small  was sufficient to itself .  he forced himself to contemplate this  until the unpleasantness of the thought grated on him and he longed for the normality of home .   most of the thoughts he received from the smaller fragments were vague and fleeting  as you would expect .  there wasn t much to be had from them  but that meant their need for completeness was all the greater .  it was that which touched him so keenly .   there was the life fragment which squatted on its haunches and fingered the wire netting that enclosed it .  its thoughts were clear  but limited .  chiefly  they concerned the yellow fruit a companion fragment was eating .  it wanted the fruit very deeply .  only the wire netting that separated the fragments prevented its seizing the fruit by force .   he disengaged reception in a moment of complete revulsion .  these fragments competed for food .   he tried to reach far outward for the peace and harmony of home  but it was already an immense distance away .  he could reach only into the nothingness that separated him from sanity .   he longed at the moment even for the feel of the dead soil between the barrier and the ship .  he had crawled over it last night .  there had been no life upon it  but it had been the soil of home  and on the other side of the barrier there had still been the comforting feel of the rest of organized life .   he could remember the moment he had located himself on the surface of the ship  maintaining a desperate suction grip until the air lock opened .  he had entered  moving cautiously between the outgoing feet .  there had been an inner lock and that had been passed later .  now he lay here  a life fragment himself  inert and unnoticed .   cautiously  he engaged reception again at the previous focus .  the squatting fragment of life was tugging furiously at the wire netting .  it still wanted the other s food  though it was the less hungry of the two .   larsen said   don t feed the damn thing .  she isn t hungry  she s just sore because tillie had the nerve to eat before she herself was crammed full .  the greedy ape .  i wish we were back home and i never had to look another animal in the face again .    he scowled at the older female chimpanzee frowningly and the chimp mouthed and chattered back to him in full reciprocation .   rizzo said   okay  okay .  why hang around here  then .  feeding time is over .  let s get out .    they went past the goat pens  the rabbit hutches  the hamster cages .   larsen said bitterly   you volunteer for an exploration voyage .  you re a hero .  they send you off with speeches and make a zoo keeper out of you .     they give you double pay .     all right  so what .  i didn t sign up just for the money .  they said at the original briefing that it was even odds we wouldn t come back  that we d end up like saybrook .  i signed up because i wanted to do something important .     just a bloomin  bloody hero   said rizzo .    i m not an animal nurse .    rizzo paused to lift a hamster out of the cage and stroke it .   hey   he said   did you ever think that maybe one of these hamsters has some cute little baby hamsters inside  just getting started .     wise guy .  they re tested every day .     sure  sure .   he muzzled the little creature  which vibrated its nose at him .   but just suppose you came down one morning and found them there .  new little hamsters looking up at you with soft  green patches of fur where the eyes ought to be .     shut up  for the love of mike   yelled larsen .    little soft  green patches of shining fur   said rizzo  and put the hamster down with a sudden loathing sensation .   he engaged reception again and varied the focus .  there wasn t a specialized life fragment at home that didn t have a rough counterpart on shipboard .   there were the moving runners in various shapes  the moving swimmers  and the moving fliers .  some of the fliers were quite large  with perceptible thoughts  others were small  gauzy winged creatures .  these last transmitted only patterns of sense perception  imperfect patterns at that  and added nothing intelligent of their own .   there were the non movers  which  like the non movers at home  were green and lived on the air  water  and soil .  these were a mental blank .  they knew only the dim  dim consciousness of light  moisture  and gravity .   and each fragment  moving and non moving  had its mockery of life .   not yet .  not yet .   .   .   .   he clamped down hard upon his feelings .  once before  these life fragments had come  and the rest at home had tried to help them too quickly .  it had not worked .  this time they must wait .   if only these fragments did not discover him .   they had not  so far .  they had not noticed him lying in the corner of the pilot room .  no one had bent down to pick up and discard him .  earlier  it had meant he could not move .  someone might have turned and stared at the stiff wormlike thing  not quite six inches long .  first stare  then shout  and then it would all be over .   but now  perhaps  he had waited long enough .  the takeoff was long past .  the controls were locked  the pilot room was empty .   it did not take him long to find the chink in the armor leading to the recess where some of the wiring was .  they were dead wires .   the front end of his body was a rasp that cut in two a wire of just the right diameter .  then  six inches away  he cut it in two again .  he pushed the snipped off section of the wire ahead of him packing it away neatly and invisibly into a corner of recess .  its outer covering was a brown elastic material and its core was gleaming  ruddy metal .  he himself could not reproduce the core  of course  but that was not necessary .  it was enough that the pellicle that covered him had been carefully bred to resemble a wire s surface .   he returned and grasped the cut sections of the wire before and behind .  he tightened against them as his little suction disks came into play .  not even a seam showed .   they could not find him now .  they could look right at him and see only a continuous stretch of wire .   unless they looked very closely indeed and noted that  in a certain spot on this wire  there were two tiny patches of soft and shining green fur .    it is remarkable   said dr .  weiss   that little green hairs can do so much .    captain loring poured the brandy carefully .  in a sense  this was a celebration .  they would be ready for the jump through hyper space in two hours  and after that  two days would see them back on earth .    you are convinced  then  the green fur is the sense organ .   he asked .    it is   said weiss .  brandy made him come out in splotches  but he was aware of the need of celebration quite aware .   the experiments were conducted under difficulties  but they were quite significant .    the captain smiled stiffly .     under difficulties  is one way of phrasing it .  i would never have taken the chances you did to run them .     nonsense .  we re all heroes aboard this ship  all volunteers  all great men with trumpet  fife  and fanfarade .  you took the chance of coming here .     you were the first to go outside the barrier .     no particular risk involved   weiss said .   i burned the ground before me as i went  to say nothing of the portable barrier that surrounded me .  nonsense  captain .  let s all take our medals when we come back  let s take them without attempt at gradation .  besides  i m a male .     but you re filled with bacteria to here .   the captain s hand made a quick  cutting gesture three inches above his head .   which makes you as vulnerabk as a female would be .    they paused for drinking purposes .     refill .   asked the captain .    no  thanks .  i ve exceeded my quota already .     then one last for the spaceroad .   he lifted his glass in the general direction of saybrook s planet  no longer visible  its sun only a bright star in the visiplate .   to the little green hairs that gave saybrook his first lead .    weiss nodded .   a lucky thing .  we ll quarantine the planet  of course .    the captain said   that doesn t seem drastic enough .  someone might always land by accident someday and not have saybrook s insight  or his guts .  suppose he did not blow up his ship  as saybrook did .  suppose he got back to some inhabited place .    the captain was somber .   do you suppose they might ever develop interstellar travel on their own .     i doubt it .  no proof  of course .  it s just that they have such a completely different orientation .  their entire organization of life has made tools unnecessary .  as far as we know  even a stone ax doesn t exist on the planet .     i hope you re right .  oh  and  weiss  would you spend some time with drake .     the galactic press fellow .     yes .  once we get back  the story of saybrook s planet will be released for the public and i don t think it would be wise to oversensationalize it .  i ve asked drake to let you consult with him on the story .  you re a biologist and enough of an authority to carry weight with him .  would you oblige .     a pleasure .    the captain closed his eyes wearily and shook his head .    headache  captain .     no .  just thinking of poor saybrook .    he was weary of the ship .  awhile back there had been a queer  momentary sensation  as though he had been turned inside out .  it was alarming and he had searched the minds of the keen thinkers for an explanation .  apparently the ship had leaped across vast stretches of empty space by cutting across something they knew as  hyper space .   the keen thinkers were ingenious .   but he was weary of the ship .  it was such a futile phenomenon .  these life fragments were skillful in their constructions  yet it was only a measure of their unhappiness  after all .  they strove to find in the control of inanimate matter what they could not find in themselves .  in their unconscious yearning for completeness  they built machines and scoured space  seeking  seeking  .   .   .   these creatures  he knew  could never  in the very nature of things  find that for which they were seeking .  at least not until such time as he gave it to them .  he quivered a little at the thought .   completeness .   these fragments had no concept of it  even .   completeness  was a poor word .   in their ignorance they would even fight it .  there had been the ship that had come before .  the first ship had contained many of the keen thinking fragments .  there had been two varieties  life producers and the sterile ones .   how different this second ship was .  the keen thinkers were all sterile   while the other fragments  the fuzzy thinkers and the no thinkers  were all producers of life .  it was strange .    how gladly that first ship had been welcomed by all the planet .  he could remember the first intense shock at the realization that the visitors were fragments and not complete .  the shock had give way to pity  and the pity to action .  it was not certain how they would fit into the community  but there had been no hesitation .  all life was sacred and somehow room would have been made for them for all of them  from the large keen thinkers to the little multipliers in the darkness .   but there had been a miscalculation .  they had not correctly analyzed the course of the fragments  ways of thinking .  the keen thinkers became aware of what had been done and resented it .  they were frightened  of course  they did not understand .   they had developed the barrier first  and then  later  had destroyed themselves  exploding their ships to atoms .   poor  foolish fragments .   this time  at least  it would be different .  they would be saved  despite themselves .   john drake would not have admitted it in so many words  but he was very proud of his skill on the photo typer .  he had a travel kit model  which was a six by eight  featureless dark plastic slab  with cylindrical bulges on either end to hold the roll of thin paper .  it fitted into a brown leather case  equipped with a beltlike contraption that held it closely about the waist and at one hip .  the whole thing weighed less than a pound .   drake could operate it with either hand .  his fingers would flick quickly and easily  placing their light pressure at exact spots on the blank surface  and  soundlessly  words would be written .   he looked thoughtfully at the beginning of his story  then up at dr .  weiss .   what do you think  doc .     it starts well .    drake nodded .   i thought i might as well start with saybrook himself .  they haven t released his story back home yet .  i wish i could have seen saybrook s original report .  how did he ever get it through  by the way .     as near as i could tell  he spent one last night sending it through the sub ether .  when he was finished  he shorted the motors  and converted the entire ship into a thin cloud of vapor a millionth of a second later .  the crew and himself along with it .     what a man .  you were in this from the beginning  doc .     not from the beginning   corrected weiss gently .   only since the receipt of saybrook s report .    he could not help thinking back .  he had read that report  realizing even then how wonderful the planet must have seemed when saybrook s coloniz   ing expedition first reached it .  it was practically a duplicate of earth  with an abounding plant life and a purely vegetarian animal life .   there had been only the little patches of green fur  how often had he used that phrase in his speaking and thinking .   which seemed strange .  no living individual on the planet had eyes .  instead  there was this fur .  even the plants  each blade or leaf or blossom  possessed the two patches of richer green .   then saybrook had noticed  startled and bewildered  that there was no conflict for food on the planet .  all plants grew pulpy appendages which were eaten by the animals .  these were regrown in a matter of hours .  no other parts of the plants were touched .  it was as though the plants fed the animals as part of the order of nature .  and the plants themselves did not grow in overpowering profusion .  they might almost have been cultivated  they were spread across the available soil so discriminately .   how much time  weiss wondered  had saybrook had to observe the strange law and order on the planet .  the fact that insects kept their numbers reasonable  though no birds ate them  that the rodent like things did not swarm  though no carnivores existed to keep them in check .   and then there had come the incident of the white rats .   that prodded weiss .  he said   oh  one correction  drake .  hamsters were not the first animals involved .  it was the white rats .     white rats   said drake  making the correction in his notes .    every colonizing ship   said weiss   takes a group of white rats for the purpose of testing any alien foods .  rats  of course  are very similar to human beings from a nutritional viewpoint .  naturally  only female white rats are taken .    naturally .  if only one sex was present  there was no danger of unchecked multiplication in case the planet proved favorable .  remember the rabbits in australia .    incidentally  why not use males .   asked drake .    females are hardier   said weiss   which is lucky  since that gave the situation away .  it turned out suddenly that all the rats were bearing young .     right .  now that s where i m up to  so here s my chance to get some things straight .  for my own information  doc  how did saybrook find out they were in a family way .     accidentally  of course .  in the course of nutritional investigations  rats are dissected for evidence of internal damage .  their condition was bound to be discovered .  a few more were dissected  same results .  eventually  all that lived gave birth to young with no male rats aboard .     and the point is that all the young were born with little green patches of fur instead of eyes .     that is correct .  saybrook said so and we corroborate him .  after the rats  the pet cat of one of the children was obviously affected .  when it finally  kittened  the kittens were not bom with closed eyes but with little patches of green fur .  there was no tomcat aboard .    eventually saybrook had the women tested .  he didn t tell them what for .  he didn t want to frighten them .  every single one of them was in the early stages of pregnancy  leaving out of consideration those few who had been pregnant at the time of embarkation .  saybrook never waited for any child to be born  of course .  he knew they would have no eyes  only shining patches of green fur .    he even prepared bacterial cultures  saybrook was a thorough man  and found each bacillus to show microscopic green spots .    drake was eager .   that goes way beyond our briefing or  at least  the briefing i got .  but granted that life on saybrook s planet is organized into a unified whole  how is it done .     how .  how are your cells organized into a unified whole .  take an individual cell out of your body  even a brain cell  and what is it by itself .  nothing .  a little blob of protoplasm with no more capacity for anything human than an amoeba .  less capacity  in fact  since it couldn t live by itself .  but put the cells together and you have something that could invent a spaceship or write a symphony .     i get the idea   said drake .   weiss went on   all life on saybrook s planet is a single organism .  in a sense  all life on earth is too  but it s a fighting dependence  a dog eat dog dependence .  the bacteria fix nitrogen  the plants fix carbon  animals eat plants and each other  bacterial decay hits everything .  it comes full circle .  each grabs as much as it can  and is  in turn  grabbed .    on saybrook s planet  each organism has its place  as each cell in our body does .  bacteria and plants produce food  on the excess of which animals feed  providing in turn carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes .  nothing is produced more or less than is needed .  the scheme of life is intelligently altered to suit the local environment .  no group of life forms multiplies more or less than is needed  just as the cells in our body stop multiplying when there are enough of them for a given purpose .  when they don t stop multiplying  we call it cancer .  and that s what life on earth really is  the kind of organic organization we have  compared to that on saybrook s planet .  one big cancer .  every species  every individual doing its best to thrive at the expense of every other species and individual .     you sound as if you approve of saybrook s planet  doc .     i do  in a way .  it makes sense out of the business of living .  i can see their viewpoint toward us .  suppose one of the cells of your body could be conscious of the efficiency of the human body as compared with that of the cell itself  and could realize that this was only the result of the union of many cells into a higher whole .  and then suppose it became conscious of the existence of free living cells  with bare life and nothing more .  it might feel a very strong desire to drag the poor thing into an organization .  it might feel  sorry for it  feel perhaps a sort of missionary spirit .  the things on saybrook s planet or the thing  one should use the singular feels just that  perhaps .     and went ahead by bringing about virgin births  eh  doc .  i ve got to go easy on that angle of it .  post office regulations  you know .     there s nothing ribald about it  drake .  for centuries we ve been able to make the eggs of sea urchins  bees  frogs  et cetera develop without the intervention of male fertilization .  the touch of a needle was sometimes enough  or just immersion in the proper salt solution .  the thing on saybrook s planet can cause fertilization by the controlled use of radiant energy .  that s why an appropriate energy barrier stops it  interference  you see  or static .    they can do more than stimulate the division and development of an unfertilized egg .  they can impress their own characteristics upon its nucleo proteins  so that the young are born with the little patches of green fur  which serve as the planet s sense organ and means of communication .  the young  in other words  are not individuals  but become part of the thing on saybrook s planet .  the thing on the planet  not at all incidentally  can impregnate any species plant  animal  or microscopic .     potent stuff   muttered drake .    totipotent   dr .  weiss said sharply .   universally potent .  any fragment of it is totipotent .  given time  a single bacterium from saybrook s planet can convert all of earth into a single organism .  we ve got the experimental proof of that .    drake said unexpectedly   you know  i think i m a millionaire  doc .  can you keep a secret .    weiss nodded  puzzled .    i ve got a souvenir from saybrook s planet   drake told him  grinning .   it s only a pebble  but after the publicity the planet will get  combined with the fact that it s quarantined from here on in  the pebble will be all any human being will ever see of it .  how much do you suppose i could sell the thing for .    weiss stared .   a pebble .   he snatched at the object shown him  a hard  gray ovoid .   you shouldn t have done that  drake .  it was strictly against regulations .     i know .  that s why i asked if you could keep a secret .  if you could give me a signed note of authentication what s the matter  doc .    instead of answering  weiss could only chatter and point .  drake ran over and stared down at the pebble .  it was the same as before   except that the light was catching it at an angle  and it showed up two little green spots .  look very closely  they were patches of green hairs .   he was disturbed .  there was a definite air of danger within the ship .  there was the suspicion of his presence aboard .  how could that be .  he had done nothing yet .  had another fragment of home come aboard and been  less cautious .  that would be impossible without his knowledge  and though he probed the ship intensely  he found nothing .   and then the suspicion diminished  but it was not quite dead .  one of the keen thinkers still wondered  and was treading close to the truth .   how long before the landing .  would an entire world of life fragments be deprived of completeness .  he clung closer to the severed ends of the wire he had been specially bred to imitate  afraid of detection  fearful for his altruistic mission .   dr .  weiss had locked himself in his own room .  they were already within the solar system  and in three hours they would be landing .  he had to think .  he had three hours in which to decide .   drake s devilish  pebble  had been part of the organized life on saybrook s planet  of course  but it was dead .  it was dead when he had first seen it  and if it hadn t been  it was certainly dead after they fed it into the hyper atomic motor and converted it into a blast of pure heat .  and the bacterial cultures still showed normal when weiss anxiously checked .   that was not what bothered weiss now .   drake had picked up the  pebble  during the last hours of the stay on saybrook s planet after the barrier breakdown .  what if the breakdown had been the result of a slow  relentless mental pressure on the part of the thing on the planet .  what if parts of its being waited to invade as the barrier dropped .  if the  pebble  had not been fast enough and had moved only after the barrier was reestablished  it would have been killed .  it would have lain there for drake to see and pick up .   it was a  pebble   not a natural life form .  but did that mean it was not some kind of life form .  it might have been a deliberate production of the planet s single organism a creature deliberately designed to look like a pebble  harmless seeming  unsuspicious .  camouflage  in other words a shrewd and frighteningly successful camouflage .   had any other camouflaged creature succeeded in crossing the barrier before it was re established with a suitable shape filched from the minds of the humans aboard ship by the mind reading organism of the planet .  would it have the casual appearance of a paperweight .  of an ornamental brass head nail in the captain s old fashioned chair .  and how would they locate it .  could they search every part of the ship for the telltale green patches  even down to individual microbes .   and why camouflage .  did it intend to remain undetected for a time .  why .  so that it might wait for the landing on earth .   an infection after landing could not be cured by blowing up a ship .  the bacteria of earth  the molds  yeasts  and protozoa  would go first .  within a year the non human young would be arriving by the uncountable billions .   weiss closed his eyes and told himself it might not be such a bad thing .  there would be no more disease  since no bacterium would multiply at the  expense of its host  but instead would be satisfied with its fair share of what was available .  there would be no more overpopulation  the hordes of mankind would decline to adjust themselves to the food supply .  there would be no more wars  no crime  no greed .   but there would be no more individuality  either .   humanity would find security by becoming a cog in a biological machine .  a man would be brother to a germ  or to a liver cell .   he stood up .  he would have a talk with captain loring .  they would send their report and blow up the ship  just as saybrook had done .   he sat down again .  saybrook had had proof  while he had only the conjectures of a terrorized mind  rattled by the sight of two green spots on a pebble .  could he kill the two hundred men on board ship because of a feeble suspicion .   he had to think .   he was straining .  why did he have to wait .  if he could only welcome those who were aboard now .  now .   yet a cooler  more reasoning part of himself told him that he could not .  the little multipliers in the darkness would betray their new status in fifteen minutes  and the keen thinkers had them under continual observation .  even one mile from the surface of their planet would be too soon  since they might still destroy themselves and their ship out in space .   better to wait for the main air locks to open  for the planetary air to swirl in with millions of the little multipliers .  better to greet each one of them into the brotherhood of unified life and let them swirl out again to spread the message .   then it would be done .  another world organized  complete .   he waited .  there was the dull throbbing of the engines working mightily to control the slow dropping of the ship  the shudder of contact with planetary surface  then   he let the jubilation of the keen thinkers sweep into reception  and his own jubilant thoughts answered them .  soon they would be able to receive as well as himself .  perhaps not these particular fragments  but the fragments that would grow out of those which were fitted for the continuation of life .   the main air locks were about to be opened   and all thought ceased .   jerry thorn thought  damn it  something s wrong now .   he said to captain loring   sorry .  there seems to be a power breakdown .  the locks won t open .     are you sure  thorn .  the lights are on .     yes  sir .  we re investigating it now .    he tore away and joined roger oldenn at the air lock wiring box .   what s wrong .     give me a chance  will you .   oldenn s hands were busy .  then he said   for the love of pete  there s a six inch break in the twenty amp lead .     what .  that can t be .    oldenn held up the broken wires with their clean  sharp  sawn through ends .   dr .  weiss joined them .  he looked haggard and there was the smell of brandy on his breath .   he said shakily   what s the matter .    they told him .  at the bottom of the compartment  in one corner  was the missing section .   weiss bent over .  there was a black fragment on the floor of the compartment .  he touched it with his finger and it smeared  leaving a sooty smudge on his finger tip .  he rubbed it off absently .   there might have been something taking the place of the missing section of wire .  something that had been alive and only looked like wire  yet something that would heat  die  and carbonize in a tiny fraction of a second once the electrical circuit which controlled the air lock had been closed .   he said   how are the bacteria .    a crew member went to check  returned and said   all normal  doc .    the wires had meanwhile been spliced  the locks opened  and dr .  weiss stepped out into the anarchic world of life that was earth .    anarchy   he said  laughing a little wildly .   and it will stay that way .    hostess  rose smollett was happy about it  almost triumphant .  she peeled off her gloves  put her hat away  and turned her brightening eyes upon her husband .   f   she said   drake  we re going to have him here .    drake looked at her with annoyance .   you ve missed supper .    thought you were going to be back by seven .     oh  that doesn t matter .  i ate something on the way home .  but  drake  we re going to have him here .     who here .  what are you talking about .     the doctor from hawkin s planet .  didn t you realize that was what today s conference was about .  we spent all day talking about it .  it s the most exciting thing that could possibly have happened .    drake smollett removed the pipe from the vicinity of his face .  he stared first at it and then at his wife .   let me get this straight .  when you say the doctor from hawkin s planet  do you mean the hawkinsite you ve got at the institute .     well  of course .  who else could i possibly mean .     and may i ask what the devil you mean by saying we ll have him here .     drake  don t you understand .     what is there to understand .  your institute may be interested in the thing  but i m not .  what have we to do with it personally .  it s institute business  isn t it .     but  darling   rose said  patiently   the hawkinsite would like to stay at a private house somewhere  where he won t be bothered with official cere copyright         by world editions  inc .   mony  and where he ll be able to proceed more according to his own likes and dislikes .  i find it quite understandable .     why at our house .     because our place is convenient for the purpose  i suppose .  they asked if i would allow it  and frankly   she added with some stiffness   i consider it a privilege .     look .   drake put his fingers through his brown hair and succeeded in rumpling it .   we ve got a convenient little place here granted .  it s not the most elegant place in the world  but it does well enough for us .  however  i don t see where we ve got room for extraterrestrial visitors .    rose began to look worried .  she removed her glasses and put them away in their case .   he can stay in the spare room .  he ll take care of it himself .  i ve spoken to him and he s very pleasant .  honestly  all we have to do is show a certain amount of adaptability .    drake said   sure  just a little adaptability .  the hawkinsites breathe cyanide .  we ll just adapt ourselves to that  i suppose .     he carries cyanide in a little cylinder .  you won t even notice it .     and what else about them that i won t notice .     nothing else .  they re perfectly harmless .  goodness  they re even vegetarians .     and what does that mean .  do we feed him a bale of hay for dinner .    rose s lower lip trembled .   drake  you re being deliberately hateful .  there are many vegetarians on earth  they don t eat hay .     and what about us .  do we eat meat ourselves or will that make us look like cannibals to him .  i won t live on salads to suit him  i warn you .     you re being quite ridiculous .    rose felt helpless .  she had married late in life  comparatively .  her career had been chosen  she herself had seemed well settled in it .  she was a fellow in biology at the jenkins institute for the natural sciences  with over twenty publications to her credit .  in a word  the line was hewed  the path cleared  she had been set for a career and spinsterhood .  and now  at thirty five  she was still a little amazed to find herself a bride of less than a year .   occasionally  it embarrassed her  too  since she sometimes found that she had not the slightest idea of how to handle her husband .  what did one do when the man of the family became mulish .  that was not included in any of her courses .  as a woman of independent mind and career  she couldn t bring herself to cajolery .   so she looked at him steadily and said simply   it means very much to me .     why .     because  drake  if he stays here for any length of time  i can study him really closely .  very little work has been done on the biology and psychology of the individual hawkinsite or of any of the extraterrestrial intelligences  we have some of their sociology and history  of course  but that s all .  surely  you must see the opportunity .  he stays here  we watch him  speak to him  observe his habits     not interested .     oh  drake  i don t understand you .     you re going to say i m not usually like this  i suppose .     well  you re not .    drake was silent for a while .  he seemed withdrawn and his high cheekbones and large chin were twisted and frozen into a brooding position .   he said finally   look  i ve heard a bit about the hawkinsites in the way of my own business .  you say there have been investigations of their sociology  but not of their biology .  sure .  it s because the hawkinsites don t like to be studied as specimens any more than we would .  i ve spoken to men who were in charge of security groups watching various hawkinsite missions on earth .  the missions stay in the rooms assigned to them and don t leave for anything but the most important official business .  they have nothing to do with earthmen .  it s quite obvious that they are as revolted by us as i personally am by them .    in fact  i just don t understand why this hawkinsite at the institute should be any different .  it seems to me to be against all the rules to have him come here by himself  anyway and to have him want to stay in an earthman s home just puts the maraschino cherry on top .    rose said  wearily   this is different .  i m surprised you can t understand it  drake .  he s a doctor .  he s coming here in the way of medical research  and i ll grant you that he probably doesn t enjoy staying with human beings and will find us perfectly horrible .  but he must stay just the same .  do you suppose human doctors enjoy going into the tropics  or that they are particularly fond of letting themselves be bitten by infected mosquitoes .    drake said sharply   what s this about mosquitoes .  what have they to do with it .     why  nothing   rose answered  surprised .   it just came to my mind  that s all .  i was thinking of reed and his yellow fever experiments .    drake shrugged .   well  have it your own way .    for a moment  rose hesitated .   you re not angry about this  are you .   to her own ears she sounded unpleasantly girlish .    no .    and that  rose knew  meant that he was .   rose surveyed herself doubtfully in the full length mirror .  she had never been beautiful and was quite reconciled to the fact  so much so that it no longer mattered .  certainly  it would not matter to a being from hawkin s planet .  what did bother her was this matter of being a hostess under the very queer circumstances of having to be tactful to an extraterrestrial crea   ture and  at the same time  to her husband as well .  she wondered which would prove the more difficult .   drake was coming home late that day  he was not due for half an hour .  rose found herself inclined to believe that he had arranged that purposely in a sullen desire to leave her alone with her problem .  she found herself in a state of mild resentment .   he had called her just before noon at the institute and had asked abruptly   when are you taking him home .    she answered  curtly   in about three hours .     all right .  what s his name .  his hawkinsite name .     why do you want to know .   she could not keep the chill from her words .    let s call it a small investigation of my own .  after all  the thing will be in my house .     oh  for heaven s sake  drake  don t bring your job home with you .    drake s voice sounded tinny and nasty in her ears .   why not  rose .  isn t that exactly what you re doing .    it was  of course  so she gave him the information he wanted .   this was the first time in their married life that they had had even the semblance of a quarrel  and  as she sat there before the full length mirror  she began to wonder if perhaps she ought not make an attempt to see his side of it .  in essence  she had married a policeman .  of course he was more than simply a policeman  he was a member of the world security board .   it had been a surprise to her friends .  the fact of the marriage itself had been the biggest surprise  but if she had decided on marriage  the attitude was  why not with another biologist .  or  if she had wanted to go afield  an anthropologist  perhaps  even a chemist  but why  of all people  a policeman .  nobody had exactly said those things  naturally  but it had been in the very atmosphere at the time of her marriage .   she had resented it then  and ever since .  a man could marry whom he chose  but if a doctor of philosophy  female variety  chose to marry a man who never went past the bachelor s degree  there was shock .  why should there be .  what business was it of theirs .  he was handsome  in a way  intelligent  in another way  and she was perfectly satisfied with her choice .   yet how much of this same snobbishness did she bring home with her .  didn t she always have the attitude that her own work  her biological investigations  were important  while his job was merely something to be kept within the four walls of his little office in the old u . n .  buildings on the east river .   she jumped up from her seat in agitation and  with a deep breath  decided to leave such thoughts behind her .  she desperately did not want to quarrel with him .  and she just wasn t going to interfere with him .  she was committed to accepting the hawkinsite as guest  but otherwise she would  let drake have his own way .  he was making enough of a concession as it  was .   harg tholan was standing quietly in the middle of the living room when she came down the stairs .  he was not sitting  since he was not anatomically constructed to sit .  he stood on two sets of limbs placed close together  while a third pair entirely different in construction were suspended from a region that would have been the upper chest in a human being .  the skin of his body was hard  glistening and ridged  while his face bore a distant resemblance to something alienly bovine .  yet he was not completely repulsive  and he wore clothes of a sort over the lower portion of his body in order to avoid offending the sensibilities of his human hosts .   he said   mrs .  smollett  i appreciate your hospitality beyond my ability to express it in your language   and he drooped so that his forelimbs touched the ground for a moment .   rose knew this to be a gesture signifying gratitude among the beings of hawkin s planet .  she was grateful that he spoke english as well as he did .  the construction of his mouth  combined with an absence of incisors  gave a whistling sound to the sibilants .  aside from that  he might have been born on earth for all the accent his speech showed .   she said   my husband will be home soon  and then we will eat .     your husband .   for a moment  he said nothing more  and then added   yes  of course .    she let it go .  if there was one source of infinite confusion among the five intelligent races of the known galaxy  it lay in the differences among them with regard to their sex life and the social institutions that grew around it .  the concept of husband and wife  for instance  existed only on earth .  the other races could achieve a sort of intellectual understanding of what it meant  but never an emotional one .   she said   i have consulted the institute in preparing your menu .  i trust you will find nothing in it that will upset you .    the hawkinsite blinked its eyes rapidly .  rose recalled this to be a gesture of amusement .   he said   proteins are proteins  my dear mrs .  smollett .  for those trace factors which i need but are not supplied in your food  i have brought concentrates that will be most adequate .    and proteins were proteins .  rose knew this to be true .  her concern for the creature s diet had been largely one of formal politeness .  in the discovery of life on the planets of the outer stars  one of the most interesting generalizations that had developed was the fact that  although life could be formed on the basis of substances other than proteins even on elements other than carbon it remained true that the only known intelligences were proteinaceous in nature .  this meant that each of the five forms of intelli   gent life could maintain themselves over prolonged periods on the food of any of the other four .   she heard drake s key in the door and went stiff with apprehension .   she had to admit he did well .  he strode in  and  without hesitation  thrust his hand out at the hawkinsite  saying firmly   good evening  dr .  tholan .    the hawkinsite put out his large and rather clumsy forelimb and the two  so to speak  shook hands .  rose had already gone through that procedure and knew the queer feeling of a hawkinsite hand in her own .  it had felt rough and hot and dry .  she imagined that  to the hawkinsite  her own and drake s felt cold and slimy .   at the time of the formal greeting  she had taken the opportunity to observe the alien hand .  it was an excellent case of converging evolution .  its morphological development was entirely different from that of the human hand  yet it had brought itself into a fairly approximate similarity .  there were four fingers but no thumb .  each finger had five independent ball and socket joints .  in this way  the flexibility lost with the absence of the thumb was made up for by the almost tentacular properties of the fingers .  what was even more interesting to her biologist s eyes was the fact that each hawkinsite finger ended in a vestigial hoof  very small and  to the layman  unidentifiable as such  but clearly adapted at one time to running  just as man s had been to climbing .   drake said  in friendly enough fashion   are you quite comfortable  sir .    the hawkinsite answered   quite .  your wife has been most thoughtful in all her arrangements .     would you care for a drink .    the hawkinsite did not answer but looked at rose with a slight facial contortion that indicated some emotion which  unfortunately  rose could not interpret .  she said  nervously   on earth there is the custom of drinking liquids which have been fortified with ethyl alcohol .  we find it stimulating .     oh  yes .  i am afraid  then  that i must decline .  ethyl alcohol would interfere most unpleasantly with my metabolism .     why  so it does to earthmen  too  but i understand  dr .  tholan   drake replied .   would you object to my drinking .     of course not .    drake passed close to rose on his way to the sideboard and she caught only one word .  he said   god .   in a tightly controlled whisper  yet he managed to put seventeen exclamation points after it .   the hawkinsite stood at the table .  his fingers were models of dexterity as they wove their way around the cutlery .  rose tried not to look at him as he ate .  his wide lipless mouth split his face alarmingly as he ingested food  and  in chewing  his large jaws moved disconcertingly from side to side .  it was another evidence of his ungulate ancestry .  rose found herself wondering if  in the quiet of his own room  he would later chew his cud  and was then panic stricken lest drake get the same idea and leave the table in disgust .  but drake was taking everything quite calmly .   he said   i imagine  dr .  tholan  that the cylinder at your side holds cyanide .    rose started .  she had actually not noticed it .  it was a curved metal object  something like a water canteen  that fitted flatly against the creature s skin  half hidden behind its clothing .  but  then  drake had a policeman s eyes .       the hawkinsite was not in the least disconcerted .   quite so   he said  and his hoofed fingers held out a thin  flexible hose that ran up his body  its tint blending into that of his yellowish skin  and entered the corner of his wide mouth .  rose felt slightly embarrassed  as though at the display of intimate articles of clothing .   drake said   and does it contain pure cyanide .    the hawkinsite humorously blinked his eyes .   i hope you are not considering possible danger to earthites .  i know the gas is highly poisonous to you and i do not need a great deal .  the gas contained in the cylinder is five per cent hydrogen cyanide  the remainder oxygen .  none of it emerges except when i actually suck at the tube  and that need not be done frequently .     i see .  and you really must have the gas to live .    rose was slightly appalled .  one simply did not ask such questions without careful preparation .  it was impossible to foresee where the sensitive points of an alien psychology might be .  and drake must be doing this deliberately  since he could not help realizing that he could get answers to such questions as easily from herself .  or was it that he preferred not to ask her .   the hawkinsite remained apparently unperturbed .   are you not a biologist  mr .  smollett .     no  dr .  tholan .     but you are in close association with mrs .  dr .  smollett .    drake smile a bit .   yes  i am married to a mrs .  doctor  but just the same i am not a biologist  merely a minor government official .  my wife s friends   he added   call me a policeman .    rose bit the inside of her cheek .  in this case it was the hawkinsite who had impinged upon the sensitive point of an alien psychology .  on hawkin s planet  there was a tight caste system and intercaste associations were limited .  but drake wouldn t realize that .   the hawkinsite turned to her .   may i have your permission  mrs .  smollett  to explain a little of our biochemistry to your husband .  it will be dull for you  since i am sure you must understand it quite well already .    she said   by all means do  dr .  tholan .    he said   you see  mr .  smollett  the respiratory system in your body and  in the bodies of all air breathing creatures on earth is controlled by certain metal containing enzymes  i am taught .  the metal is usually iron  though sometimes it is copper .  in either case  small traces of cyanide would combine with these metals and immobilize the respiratory system of the terrestrial living cell .  they would be prevented from using oxygen and killed in a few minutes .    the life on my own planet is not quite so constituted .  the key respiratory compounds contain neither iron nor copper  no metal at all  in fact .  it is for this reason that my blood is colorless .  our compounds contain certain organic groupings which are essential to life  and these groupings can only be maintained intact in the presence of a small concentration of cyanide .  undoubtedly  this type of protein has developed through millions of years of evolution on a world which has a few tenths of a per cent of hydrogen cyanide occurring naturally in the atmosphere .  its presence is maintained by a biological cycle .  various of our native micro organisms liberate the free gas .     you make it extremely clear  dr .  tholan  and very interesting   drake said .   what happens if you don t breathe it .  do you just go  like that .   he snapped his fingers .    not quite .  it isn t equivalent to the presence of cyanide for you .  in my case  the absence of cyanide would be equivalent to slow strangulation .  it happens sometimes  in ill ventilated rooms on my world  that the cyanide is gradually consumed and falls below the minimum necessary concentration .  the results are very painful and difficult to treat .    rose had to give drake credit  he really sounded interested .  and the alien  thank heaven  did not mind the catechism .   the rest of the dinner passed without incident .  it was almost pleasant .   throughout the evening  drake remained that way  interested .  even more than that absorbed .  he drowned her out  and she was glad of it .  he was the one who was really colorful and it was only her job  her specialized training  that stole the color from him .  she looked at him gloomily and thought  why did he many me .   drake sat  one leg crossed over the other  hands clasped and tapping his chin gently  watching the hawkinsite intently .  the hawkinsite faced him  standing in his quadruped fashion .   drake said   i find it difficult to keep thinking of you as a doctor .    the hawkinsite laughingly blinked his eyes .   i understand what you mean   he said .   i find it difficult to think of you as a policeman .  on my world  policemen are very specialized and distinctive people .     are they .   said drake  somewhat drily  and then changed the subject .   i gather that you are not here on a pleasure trip .     no  i am here very much on business .  i intend to study this queer plane  you call earth  as it has never been studied before by any of my people .     queer .   asked drake .   in what way .    the hawkinsite looked at rose .   does he know of the inhibition death .    rose felt embarrassed .   his work is important   she said .   i am afraid that my husband has little time to listen to the details of my work .   she knew that this was not really adequate and she felt herself to be the recipient  yet again  of one of the hawkinsite s unreadable emotions .   the extraterrestrial creature turned back to drake .   it is always amazing to me to find how little you earthmen understand your own unusual characteristics .  look  there are five intelligent races in the galaxy .  these have all developed independently  yet have managed to converge in remarkable fashion .  it is as though  in the long run  intelligence requires a certain physical makeup to flourish .  i leave that question for philosophers .  but i need not belabor the point  since it must be a familiar one to you .    now when the differences among the intelligences are closely investigated  it is found over and over again that it is you earthmen  more than any of the others  who are unique .  for instance  it is only on earth that life depends upon metal enzymes for respiration .  your people are the only ones which find hydrogen cyanide poisonous .  yours is the only form of intelligent life which is carnivorous .  yours is the only form of life which has not developed from a grazing animal .  and  most interesting of all  yours is the only form of intelligent life known which stops growing upon reaching maturity .    drake grinned at him .  rose felt her heart suddenly race .  it was the nicest thing about him  that grin  and he was using it perfectly naturally .  it wasn t forced or false .  he was adjusting to the presence of this alien creature .  he was being pleasant and he must be doing it for her .  she loved that thought and repeated it to herself .  he was doing it for her  he was being nice to the hawkinsite for her sake .   drake was saying with his grin   you don t look very large  dr .  tholan .  i should say that you are an inch taller than i am  which would make you six feet two inches tall .  is it that you are young  or is it that the others on your world are generally small .     neither   said the hawkinsite .   we grow at a diminishing rate with the years  so that at my age it would take fifteen years to grow an additional inch  but and this is the important point we never entirely stop .  and  of course  as a consequence  we never entirely die .    drake gasped and even rose felt herself sitting stiffly upright .  this was something new .  this was something which  to her knowledge  the few expeditions to hawkin s planet had never brought back .  she was torn with excitement but held an exclamation back and let drake speak for her .   he said   they don t entirely die .  you re not trying to say  sir  that the people on hawkin s planet are immortal .     no people are truly immortal .  if there were no other way to die  there  would always be accident  and if that fails  there is boredom .  few of us live more than several centuries of your time .  still  it is unpleasant to think that death may come involuntarily .  it is something which  to us  is extremely horrible .  it bothers me even as i think of it now  this thought that against my will and despite all care  death may come .     we   said drake  grimly   are quite used to it .     you earthmen live with the thought  we do not .  and this is why we are disturbed to find that the incidence of inhibition death has been increasing in recent years .     you have not yet explained   said drake   just what the inhibition death is  but let me guess .  is the inhibition death a pathological cessation of growth .     exactly .     and how long after growth s cessation does death follow .     within the year .  it is a wasting disease  a tragic one  and absolutely incurable .     what causes it .    the hawkinsite paused a long time before answering  and even then there was something strained and uneasy about the way he spoke .   mr .  smollett  we know nothing about the cause of the disease .    drake nodded thoughtfully .  rose was following the conversation as though she were a spectator at a tennis match .   drake said   and why do you come to earth to study this disease .     because again earthmen are unique .  they are the only intelligent beings who are immune .  the inhibition death affects all the other races .  do your biologists know that  mrs .  smollett .    he had addressed her suddenly  so that she jumped slightly .  she said   no  they don t .     i am not surprised .  that piece of information is the result of very recent research .  the inhibition death is easily diagnosed incorrectly and the incidence is much lower on the other planets .  in fact  it is a strange thing  something to philosophize over  that the incidence of the death is highest on my world  which is closest to earth  and lower on each more distant planet so that it is lowest on the world of the star tempora  which is farthest from earth  while earth itself is immune .  somewhere in the biochemistry of the earthite  there is the secret of that immunity .  how interesting it would be to find it .    drake said   but look here  you can t say earth is immune .  from where i sit  it looks as if the incidence is a hundred per cent .  all earthmen stop growing and all earthmen die .  we ve all got the inhibition death .     not at all .  earthmen live up to seventy years after the cessation of growth .  that is not the death as we know it .  your equivalent disease is rather one of unrestrained growth .  cancer  you call it .   but come  i bore you .    rose protested instantly .  drake did likewise with even more vehemence  but the hawkinsite determinedly changed the subject .  it was then that rose had her first pang of suspicion  for drake circled harg tholan warily with his words  worrying him  jabbing at him  attempting always to get the information back to the point where the hawkinsite had left off .  not badly  not unskillfully  but rose knew him  and could tell what he was after .  and what could he be after but that which was demanded by his profession .  and  as though in response to her thoughts  the hawkinsite took up the phrase which had begun careening in her mind like a broken record on a perpetual turntable .   he asked   did you not say you were a policeman .    drake said  curtly   yes .     then there is something i would like to request you to do for me .  i have been wantisg to all this evening  since i discovered your profession  and yet i hesitate .  i do not wish to be troublesome to my host and hostess .     we ll do what we can .     i have a profound curiosity as to how earthmen live  a curiosity which is not perhaps shared by the generality of my countrymen .  so i wonder  could you show me through one of the police departments on your planet .     i do not belong to a police department in exactly the way you imagine   said drake  cautiously .   however  i am known to the new york police department .  i can manage it without trouble .  tomorrow .     that would be most convenient for me .  would i be able to visit the missing persons bureau .     the what .    the hawkinsite drew his four standing legs closer together  as if he were becoming more intense .   it is a hobby of mine  a little queer comer of interest i have always had .  i understand you have a group of police officers whose sole duty it is to search for men who are missing .     and women and children   added drake .   but why should that interest you so particularly .     because there again you are unique .  there is no such thing as a missing person on our planet .  i can t explain the mechanism to you  of course  but among the people of other worlds  there is always an awareness of one another s presence  especially if there is a strong  affectionate tie .  we are always aware of each other s exact location  no matter where on the planet we might be .    rose grew excited again .  the scientific expeditions to hawkin s planet had always had the greatest difficulty in penetrating the internal emotional mechanisms of the natives  and here was one who talked freely  who would explain .  she forgot to worry about drake and intruded into the conversations .   can you feel such awareness even now .  on earth .    the hawkinsite said   you mean across space .  no  i m afraid not .  but you see the importance of the matter .  all the uniqueness of earth should be  linked .  if the lack of this sense can be explained  perhaps the immunity to inhibition death can be  also .  besides  it strikes me as very curious that any form of intelligent community life can be built among people who lack this community awareness .  how can an earthman tell  for instance  when he has formed a congenial sub group  a family .  how can you two  for instance  know that there is a true tie between you .    rose found herself nodding .  how strongly she missed such a sense .   but drake only smiled .   we have our ways .  it is as difficult to explain what we call  love  to you as it is for you to explain your sense to us .     i suppose so .  yet tell me truthfully  mr .  smollett if mrs .  smollett were to leave this room and enter another without your having seen her do so  would you really not be aware of her location .     i really would not .    the hawkinsite said   amazing .   he hesitated  then added   please do not be offended at the fact that i find it revolting as well .    after the light in the bedroom had been put out  rose went to the door three times  opening it a crack and peering out .  she could feel drake watching her .  there was a hard kind of amusement in his voice as he asked  finally   what s the matter .    she said   i want to talk to you .     are you afraid our friend can hear .    rose was whispering .  she got into bed and put her head on his pillow so that she could whisper better .  she said   why were you talking about the inhibition death to dr .  tholan .     i am taking an interest in your work  rose .  you ve always wanted me to take an interest .     i d rather you weren t sarcastic .   she was almost violent  as nearly violent as she could be in a whisper .   i know that there s something of your own interest in this of police interest  probably .  what is it .     he said   i ll talk to you tomorrow .   i  no  right now .    he put his hand under her head  lifting it .  for a wild moment she thought he was going to kiss her just kiss her on impulse the way husbands sometimes did  or as she imagined they sometimes did .  drake never did  and he didn t now .   he merely held her close and whispered   why are you so interested .    his hand was almost brutally hard upon the nape of her neck  so that she stiffened and tried to draw back .  her voice was more than a whisper now .   stop it  drake .    he said   i want no questions from you and no interference .  you do your job  and i ll do mine .     the nature of my job is open and known .     the nature of my job   he retorted   isn t  by definition .  but i ll tell you  this .  our six legged friend is here in this house for some definite reason .  you weren t picked as biologist in charge for any random reason .  do you know that two days ago  he d been inquiring about me at the commission .     you re joking .     don t believe that for a minute .  there are depths to this that you know nothing about .  but that s my job and i won t discuss it with you any further .  do you understand .     no  but i won t question you if you don t want me to .     then go to sleep .    she lay stiffly on her back and the minutes passed  and then the quarter hours .  she was trying to fit the pieces together .  even with what drake had told her  the curves and colors refused to blend .  she wondered what drake would say if he knew she had a recording of that night s conversation .   one picture remained clear in her mind at that moment .  it hovered over her mockingly .  the hawkinsite  at the end of the long evening  had turned to her and said gravely   good night  mrs .  smollett .  you are a most charming hostess .    she had desperately wanted to giggle at the time .  how could he call her a charming hostess .  to him  she could only be a horror  a monstrosity with too few limbs and a too narrow face .   and then  as the hawkinsite delivered himself of this completely meaningless piece of politeness  drake had turned white .  for one instant  his eyes had burned with something that looked like terror .   she had never before known drake to show fear of anything  and the picture of that instant of pure panic remained with her until all her thoughts finally sagged into the oblivion of sleep .   it was noon before rose was at her desk the next day .  she had deliberately waited until drake and the hawkinsite had left  since only then was she able to remove the small recorder that had been behind drake s armchair the previous evening .  she had had no original intention of keeping its presence secret from him .  it was just that he had come home so late  and she couldn t say anything about it with the hawkinsite present .  later on  of course  things had changed   the placing of the recorder had been only a routine maneuver .  the hawkinsite s statements and intonations needed to be preserved for future intensive studies by various specialists at the institute .  it had been hidden in order to avoid the distortions of self consciousness that the visibility of such a device would bring  and now it couldn t be shown to the members of the institute at all .  it would have to serve a different function altogether .  a rather nasty function .   she was going to spy on drake .   she touched the little box with her fingers and wondered  irrelevantly  how drake was going to manage  that day .  social intercourse between in   habited worlds was  even now  not so commonplace that the sight of a hawkinsite on the city streets would not succeed in drawing crowds .  but drake would manage  she knew .  drake always managed .   she listened once again to the sounds of last evening  repeating the interesting moments .  she was dissatisfied with what drake had told her .  why should the hawkinsite have been interested in the two of them particularly .  yet drake wouldn t lie .  she would have liked to check at the security commission  but she knew she could not do that .  besides  the thought made her feel disloyal  drake would definitely not lie .   but  then again  why should harg tholan not have investigated them .  he might have inquired similarly about the families of all the biologists at the institute .  it would be no more than natural to attempt to choose the home he would find most pleasant by his own standards  whatever they were .   and if he had even if he had investigated only the smolletts why should that create the great change in drake from intense hostility to intense interest .  drake undoubtedly had knowledge he was keeping to himself .  only heaven knew how much .   her thoughts churned slowly through the possibilities of interstellar intrigue .  so far  to be sure  there were no signs of hostility or ill feeling among any of the five intelligent races known to inhabit the galaxy .  as yet they were spaced at intervals too wide for enmity .  even the barest contact among them was all but impossible .  economic and political interests just had no point at which to conflict .   but that was only her idea and she was not a member of the security commission .  if there were conflict  if there were danger  if there were any reason to suspect that the mission of a hawkinsite might be other than peaceful drake would know .   yet was drake sufficiently high in the councils of the security commission to know  off hand  the dangers involved in the visit of a hawkinsite physician .  she had never thought of his position as more than that of a very minor functionary in the commission  he had never presented himself as more .  and yet   might he be more .   she shrugged at the thought .  it was reminiscent of twentieth century spy novels and of costume dramas of the days when there existed such things as atom bomb secrets .   the thought of costume dramas decided her .  unlike drake  she wasn t a real policeman  and she didn t know how a real policeman would go about it .  but she knew how such things were done in the old dramas .   she drew a piece of paper toward her and  with a quick motion  slashed a vertical pencil mark down its center .  she headed one column  harg tholan   the other  drake .   under  harg tholan  she wrote  bonafide  and thoughtfully put three question marks after it .  after all  was he a doctor at  all  or was he what could only be described as an interstellar agent .  what proof had even the institute of his profession except his own statements .  was that why drake had quizzed him so relentlessly concerning the inhibition death .  had he boned up in advance and tried to catch the hawkinsite in an error .   for a moment  she was irresolute  then  springing to her feet  she folded the paper  put it in the pocket of her short jacket  and swept out of her office .  she said nothing to any of those she passed as she left the institute .  she left no word at the reception desk as to where she was going  or when she would be back .   once outside  she hurried into the third level tube and waited for an empty compartment to pass .  the two minutes that elapsed seemed unbearably long .  it was all she could do to say   new york academy of medicine   into the mouthpiece just above the seat .   the door of the little cubicle closed  and the sound of the air flowing past the compartment hissed upward in pitch .   the new york academy of medicine had been enlarged both vertically and horizontally in the past two decades .  the library alone occupied one entire wing of the third floor .  undoubtedly  if all the books  pamphlets and periodicals it contained were in their original printed form  rather than in microfilm  the entire building  huge though it was  would not have been sufficiently vast to hold them .  as it was  rose knew there was already talk of limiting printed works to the last five years  rather than to the last ten  as was now the case .   rose  as a member of the academy  had free entry to the library .  she hurried toward the alcoves devoted to extraterrestrial medicine and was relieved to find them unoccupied .   it might have been wiser to have enlisted the aid of a librarian  but she chose not to .  the thinner and smaller the trail she left  the less likely it was that drake might pick it up .   and so  without guidance  she was satisfied to travel along the shelves  following the titles anxiously with her fingers .  the books were almost all in english  though some were in german or russian .  none  ironically enough  were in extraterrestrial symbolisms .  there was a room somewhere for such originals  but they were available only to official translators .   her traveling eye and finger stopped .  she had found what she was looking for .   she dragged half a dozen volumes from the shelf and spread them out upon the small dark table .  she fumbled for the light switch and opened the first of the volumes .  it was entitled studies on inhibition  she leafed through it and then turned to the author index .  the name of harg tholan was there .   w one by one  she looked up the references indicated  then returned to the shelves for translations of such original papers as she could find .   she spent more than two hours in the academy .  when she was finished  she knew this much there was a hawkinsite doctor named harg tholan  who was an expert on the inhibition death .  he was connected with the hawkinsite research organization with which the institute had been in correspondence .  of course  the harg tholan she knew might simply be impersonating an actual doctor to make the role more realistic  but why should that be necessary .   she took the paper out of her pocket and  where she had written  bo nafide  with three question marks  she now wrote a yes in capitals .  she went back to the institute and at   p . m .  was once again at her desk .  she called the switchboard to say that she would not answer any phone calls and then she locked her door .   underneath the column headed  harg tholan  she now wrote two questions   why did harg tholan come to earth alone .   she left considerable space .  then   what is his interest in the missing persons bureau .    certainly  the inhibition death was all the hawkinsite said it was .  from her reading at the academy  it was obvious that it occupied the major share of medical effort on hawkin s planet .  it was more feared there than cancer was on earth .  if they had thought the answer to it lay on earth  the hawkinsites would have sent a full scale expedition .  was it distrust and suspicion on their part that made them send only one investigator .   what was it harg tholan had said the night before .  the incidence of the death was highest upon his own world  which was closest to earth  lowest upon the world farthest from earth .  add to that the fact implied by the hawkinsite  and verified by her own readings at the academy  that the incidence had expanded enormously since interstellar contact had been made with earth .   .   .   .   slowly and reluctantly she came to one conclusion .  the inhabitants of hawkin s planet might have decided that somehow earth had discovered the cause of the inhibition death  and was deliberately fostering it among the alien peoples of the galaxy  with the intention  perhaps  of becoming supreme among the stars .   she rejected this conclusion with what was almost panic .  it could not be  it was impossible .  in the first place  earth wouldn  t do such a horrible thing .  secondly  it couldn  t  as far as scientific advance was concerned  the beings of hawkin s planet were certainly the equals of earthmen .  the death had occurred there for thousands of years and their medical record was one of total failure .  surely  earth  in its long distance investigations into alien biochemistry  could not have succeeded so quickly .  in fact  as far as she knew  there were no investi   gations to speak of into hawkinsite pathology on the part of earth biologists and physicians .   yet all the evidence indicated that harg tholan had come in suspicion and had been received in suspicion .  carefully  she wrote down under the question   why did harg tholan come to earth alone .   the answer   haw kin s planet believes earth is causing the inhibition death .    but  then  what was this business about the bureau of missing persons .  as a scientist  she was rigorous about the theories she developed .  all the facts had to fit in  not merely some of them .   missing persons bureau .  if it was a false trail  deliberately intended to deceive drake  it had been done clumsily  since it came only after an hour of discussion of the inhibition death .   was it intended as an opportunity to study drake .  if so  why .  was this perhaps the major point .  the hawkinsite had investigated drake before coming to them .  had he come because drake was a policeman with entry to bureaus of missing persons .   but why .  why .   she gave it up and turned to the column headed  drake .    and there a question wrote itself  not in pen and ink upon the paper  but in the much more visible letters of thought on mind .  why did he marry me .  thought rose  and she covered her eyes with her hands so that the unfriendly light was excluded .   they had met quite by accident somewhat more than a year before  when he had moved into the apartment house in which she then lived .  polite greetings had somehow become friendly conversation and this  in turn  had led to occasional dinners in a neighborhood restaurant .  it had been very friendly and normal and an exciting new experience  and she had fallen in love .   when he asked her to marry him  she was pleased and overwhelmed .  at the time  she had many explanations for it .  he appreciated her intelligence and friendliness .  she was a nice girl .  she would make a good wife  a splendid companion .   she had tried all those explanations and had half believed every one of them .  but half belief was not enough .   it was not that she had any definite fault to find in drake as a husband .  he was always thoughtful  kind and a gentleman .  their married life was not one of passion  and yet it suited the paler emotional surges of the late thirties .  she wasn t nineteen .  what did she expect .   that was it  she wasn t nineteen .  she wasn t beautiful  or charming  or glamorous .  what did she expect .  could she have expected drake handsome and rugged  whose interest in intellectual pursuits was quite minor  who neither asked about her work in all the months of their marriage  nor offered to discuss his own with her .  why  then  did he marry her .     but there was no answer to that question  and it had nothing to do with what rose was trying to do now .  it was extraneous  she told herself fiercely  it was a childish distraction from the task she had set herself .  she was acting like a girl of nineteen  after all  with no chronological excuse for it .   she found that the point of her pencil had somehow broken  and took a new one .  in the column headed  drake  she wrote   why is he suspicious of harg tholan .   and under it she put an arrow pointing to the other column .   what she had already written there was sufficient explanation .  if earth was spreading the inhibition death  or if earth knew it was suspected of such a deed  then  obviously  it would be preparing for eventual retaliation on the part of the aliens .  in fact  the setting would actually be one of preliminary maneuvering for the first interstellar war of history .  it was an adequate but horrible explanation .   now there was left the second question  the one she could not answer .  she wrote it slowly   why drake s reaction to tholan s words   you are a most charming hostess  .    she tried to bring back the exact setting .  the hawkinsite had said it innocuously  matter of factly  politely  and drake had frozen at the sound of it .  over and over  she had listened to that particular passage in the recording .  an earthman might have said it in just such an inconsequential tone on leaving a routine cocktail party .  the recording did not carry the sight of drake s face  she had only her memory for that .  drake s eyes had become alive with fear and hate  and drake was one who feared practically nothing .  what was there to fear in the phrase   you are a most charming hostess   that could upset him so .  jealousy .  absurd .  the feeling that tholan had been sarcastic .  maybe  though unlikely .  she was sure tholan was sincere .   she gave it up and put a large question mark under that second question .  there were two of them now  one under  harg tholan  and one under  drake .   could there be a connection between tholan s interest in missing persons and drake s reaction to a polite party phrase .  she could think of none .   she put her head down upon her arms .  it was getting dark in the office and she was very tired .  for a while  she must have hovered in that queer land between waking and sleeping  when thoughts and phrases lose the control of the conscious and disport themselves erratically and surrealisti cally through one s head .  but  no matter where they danced and leaped  they always returned to that one phrase   you are a most charming hostess .   sometimes she heard it in harg tholan s cultured  lifeless voice  and sometimes in drake s vibrant one .  when drake said it  it was full of love  full of a love she never heard from him .  she liked to hear him say it .   she startled herself to wakefulness .  it was quite dark in the office now  and she put on the desk light .  she blinked  then frowned a little .  another  thought must have come to her in that fitful half sleep .  there had been another phrase which had upset drake .  what was it .  her forehead furrowed with mental effort .  it had not been last evening .  it was not anything in the recorded conversation  so it must have been before that .  nothing came and she grew restless .   looking at her watch  she gasped .  it was almost eight .  they would be at home waiting for her .   but she did not want to go home .  she did not want to face them .  slowly  she took up the paper upon which she had scrawled her thoughts of the afternoon  tore it into little pieces and let them flutter into the little atomic flash ashtray upon her desk .  they were gone in a little flare and nothing was left of them .   if only nothing were left of the thoughts they represented as well .   it was no use .  she would have to go home .   they were not there waiting for her  after all .  she came upon them getting out of a gyrocab just as she emerged from the tubes on to street level .  the gyrocabbie  wide eyed  gazed after his fares for a moment  then hovered upward and away .  by unspoken mutual consent  the three waited until they had entered the apartment before speaking .   rose said disinterestedly   i hope you have had a pleasant day  dr .  tho lan .     quite .  and a fascinating and profitable one as well  i think .     have you had a chance to eat .   though rose had not herself eaten  she was anything but hungry .    yes  indeed .    drake interrupted   we had lunch and supper sent up to us .  sandwiches .   he sounded tired .   rose said   hello  drake .   it was the first time she had addressed him .   drake scarcely looked at her .   hello .    the hawkinsite said   your tomatoes are remarkable vegetables .  we have nothing to compare with them in taste on our own planet .  i believe i ate two dozen  as well as an entire bottle of tomato derivative .     ketchup   explained drake  briefly .   rose said   and your visit at the missing persons bureau  dr .  tholan .  you say you found it profitable .     i should say so .  yes .    rose kept her back to him .  she plumped up sofa cushions as she said   in what way .     i find it most interesting that the large majority of missing persons are males .  wives frequently report missing husbands  while the reverse is practically never the case .    rose said   oh  that s not mysterious  dr .  tholan .  you simply don t realize the economic setup we have on earth .  on this planet  you see  it is  the male who is usually the member of the family that maintains it as an economic unit .  he is the one whose labor is repaid in units of currency .  the wife s function is generally that of taking care of home and children .     surely this is not universal .    drake put in   more or less .  if you are thinking of my wife  she is an example of the minority of women who are capable of making their own way in the world .    rose looked at him swiftly .  was he being sarcastic .   the hawkinsite said   your implication  mrs .  smollett  is that women  being economically dependent upon their male companions  find it less feasible to disappear .     that s a gentle way of putting it   said rose   but that s about it .     and would you call the missing persons bureau of new york a fair sampling of such cases in the planet at large .     why  i should think so .    the hawkinsite said  abruptly   and is there  then  an economic explanation for the fact that since interstellar travel has been developed  the percentage of young males among the missing is more pronounced than ever .    it was drake who answered  with a verbal snap .   good lord  that s even less of a mystery than the other .  nowadays  the runaway has all space to disappear into .  anyone who wants to get away from trouble need only hop the nearest space freighter .  they re always looking for crewmen  no questions asked  and it would be almost impossible to locate the runaway after that  if he really wanted to stay out of circulation .     and almost always young men in their first year of marriage .    rose laughed suddenly .  she said   why  that s just the time a man s troubles seem the greatest .  if he survives the first year  there is usually no need to disappear at all .    drake was obviously not amused .  rose thought again that he looked tired and unhappy .  why did he insist on bearing the load alone .  and then she thought that perhaps he had to .   the hawkinsite said  suddenly   would it offend you if i disconnected for a period of time .    rose said   not at all .  i hope you haven t had too exhausting a day .  since you come from a planet whose gravity is greater than that of earth s  i m afraid we too easily presume that you would show greater endurance than we do .     oh  i am not tired in a physical sense .   he looked for a moment at her legs and blinked very rapidly  indicating amusement .   you know  i keep expecting earthmen to fall either forward or backward in view of their meager equipment of standing limbs .  you must pardon me if my comment is overfamiliar  but your mention of the lesser gravity of earth brought it to my mind .  on my planet  two legs would simply not be enough .  but this is  all beside the point at the moment .  it is just that i have been absorbing so many new and unusual concepts that i feel the desire for a little disconnection .    rose shrugged inwardly .  well  that was as close as one race could get to another  anyway .  as nearly as the expeditions to hawkin s planet could make out  hawkinsites had the faculty for disconnecting their conscious mind from all its bodily functions and allowing it to sink into an undisturbed meditative process for periods of time lasting up to terrestrial days .  hawkinsites found the process pleasant  even necessary sometimes  though no earthman could truly say what function it served .   conversely  it had never been entirely possible for earthmen to explain the concept of  sleep  to a hawkinsite  or to any extraterrestrial .  what an earthman would call sleep or a dream  a hawkinsite would view as an alarming sign of mental disintegration .   rose thought uneasily  here is another way earthmen are unique .   the hawkinsite was backing away  drooping so that his forelimbs swept the floor in polite farewell .  drake nodded curtly at him as he disappeared behind the bend in the corridor .  they heard his door open  close  then silence .   after minutes in which the silence was thick between them  drake s chair creaked as he shifted restlessly .  with a mild horror  rose noticed blood upon his lips .  she thought to herself  he s in some kind of trouble .  i ve got to talk to him .  i can t let it go on like this .   she said   drake .    drake seemed to look at her from a far  far distance .  slowly  his eyes focused closer at hand and he said   what is it .  are you through for the day  too .     no  i m ready to begin .  it s the tomorrow you spoke of .  aren t you going to speak to me .     pardon me .     last night  you said you would speak to me tomorrow .  i am ready now .    drake frowned .  his eyes withdrew beneath a lowered brow and rose felt some of her resolution begin to leave her .  he said   i thought it was agreed that you would not question me about my business in this matter .     i think it s too late for that .  i know too much about your business by now .     what do you mean .   he shouted  jumping to his feet .  recollecting himself  he approached  laid his hands upon her shoulders and repeated in a lower voice   what do you mean .    rose kept her eyes upon her hands  which rested limply in her lap .  she bore the painfully gripping fingers patiently  and said slowly   dr .  tholan thinks that earth is spreading the inhibition death purposely .  that s it  isn t it .    she waited .  slowly  the grip relaxed and he was standing there  hands at his side  face baffled and unhappy .  he said   where did you get that notion .     it s true  isn t it .    he said breathlessly  unnaturally   i want to know exactly why you say that .  don t play foolish games with me  rose .  this is for keeps .     if i tell you  will you answer one question .     what question .     is earth spreading the disease deliberately  drake .    drake flung his hands upward .   oh  for heaven s sake .    he knelt before her .  he took her hands in his and she could feel their trembling .  he was forcing his voice into soothing  loving syllables .   he was saying   rose dear  look  you ve got something red hot by the tail and you think you can use it to tease me in a little husband wife repartee .  no  i m not asking much .  just tell me exactly what causes you to say what  what you have just said .   he was terribly earnest about it .    i was at the new york academy of medicine this afternoon .  i did some reading there .     but why .  what made you do it .     you seemed so interested in the inhibition death  for one thing .  and dr .  tholan made those statements about the incidence increasing since interstellar travel  and being the highest on the planet nearest earth .   she paused .    and your reading .   he prompted .   what about your reading  rose .   c    she said   it backs him up .  all i could do was to skim hastily into the direction of their research in recent decades .  it seems obvious to me  though  that at least some of the hawkinsites are considering the possibility the inhibition death originates on earth .     do they say so outright .     no .  or  if they have  i haven t seen it .   she gazed at him in surprise .  in a matter like this  certainly the government would have investigated hawkinsite research on the matter .  she said  gently   don t you know about hawkinsite research in the matter  drake .  the government     never mind about that .   drake had moved away from her and now he turned again .  his eyes were bright .  he said  as though making a wonderful discovery   why  you re an expert in this .    was she .  did he find that out only now that he needed her .  her nostrils flared and she said flatly   i am a biologist .    he said   yes  i know that  but i mean your particular specialty is growth .  didn t you once tell me you had done work on growth .     you might call it that .  i ve had twenty papers published on the relationship of nucleic acid fine structure and embryonic development on my cancer society grant .     good .  i should have thought of that .   he was choked with a new excitement .   tell me  rose  look  i m sorry if i lost my temper with you a moment ago .  you d be as competent as anyone to understand the direction of their researches if you read about it  wouldn t you .     fairly competent  yes .     then tell me how they think the disease is spread .  the details  i mean .     oh  now look  that s asking a little too much .    spent a few hours in the academy  that s all .  i d need much more time than that to be able to answer your question .     an intelligent guess  at least .  you can t imagine how important it is .    she said  doubtfully   of course   studies on inhibition  is a major treatise in the field .  it would summarize all of the available research data .     yes .  and how recent is it .     it s one of those periodic things .  the last volume is about a year old .     does it have any account of his work in it .   his finger jabbed in the direction of harg tholan s bedroom .    more than anyone else s .  he s an outstanding worker in the field .  i looked over his papers especially .     and what are his theories about the origin of the disease .  try to remember  rose .    she shook her head at him .   i could swear he blames earth  but he admits they know nothing about how the disease is spread .  i could swear to that  too .    he stood stiffly before her .  his strong hands were clenched into fists at his side and his words were scarcely more than a mutter .   it could be a matter of complete overestimation .  who knows    he whirled away .   i ll find out about this right now  rose .  thank you for your help .    she ran after him .   what are you going to do .     ask him a few questions .   he was rummaging through the drawers of his desk and now his right hand withdrew .  it held a needle gun .   she cried   no  drake .    he shook her off roughly  and turned down the corridor toward the hawkinsite s bedroom .   drake threw the door open and entered .  rose was at his heels  still trying to grasp his arm  but now he stopped and looked at harg tholan .   the hawkinsite was standing there motionless  eyes unfocused  his four standing limbs sprawled out in four directions as far as they would go .  rose felt ashamed of intruding  as though she were violating an intimate rite .  but drake  apparently unconcerned  walked to within four feet of the creature and stood there .  they were face to face  drake holding the needle gun easily at a level of about the center of the hawkinsite s torso .   drake said   now keep quiet .  he ll gradually become aware of me .       how do you know .     the answer was flat .   i know .  now get out of here .    but she did not move and drake was too absorbed to pay her further attention .   portions of the skin on the hawkinsite s face were beginning to quiver slightly .  it was rather repulsive and rose found herself preferring not to watch .   drake suddenly   that s about all  dr .  tholan .  don t throw in connection with any of the limbs .  your sense organs and voice box will be quite enough .    the hawkinsite s voice was dim .   why do you invade my disconnection chamber .   then  more strongly   and why are you armed .    his head wobbled slightly atop a still frozen torso .  he had  apparently  followed drake s suggestion against limb connection .  rose wondered how drake knew such partial reconnection to be possible .  she herself had not known of it .   the hawkinsite spoke again .   what do you want .    and this time drake answered .  he said   the answer to certain questions .     with a gun in your hand .  i would not humor your discourtesy so far .     you would not merely be humoring me .  you might be saving your own life .     that would be a matter of considerable indifference to me  under the circumstances .  i am sorry  mr .  smollett  that the duties toward a guest are so badly understood on earth .     you are no guest of mine  dr .  tholan   said drake .   you entered my house on false pretenses .  you had some reason for it  some way you had planned of using me to further your own purposes .  i have no compunction in reversing the process .     you had better shoot .  it will save time .     you are convinced that you will answer no questions .  that  in itself  is suspicious .  it seems that you consider certain answers to be more important than your life .     i consider the principles of courtesy to be very important .  you  as an earthman  may not understand .     perhaps not .  but i  as an earthman  understand one thing .   drake had jumped forward  faster than rose could cry out  faster than the hawkinsite could connect his limbs .  when he sprang backward  the flexible hose of harg tholan s cyanide cylinder was in his hand .  at the corner of the hawkinsite s wide mouth  where the hose had once been affixed  a droplet of colorless liquid oozed sluggishly from a break in the rough skin  and slowly solidified into a brown jellylike globule  as it oxidized .   drake yanked at the hose and the cylinder jerked free .  he plunged home the knob that controlled the needle valve at the head of the cylinder and the small hissing ceased .    i doubt   said drake   that enough will have escaped to endanger us .  i hope  however  that you realize what will happen to you now  if you do not answer the questions i am going to ask you and answer them in such a way that i am convinced you are being truthful .     give me back my cylinder   said the hawkinsite  slowly   if not  it will be necessary for me to attack you and then it will be necessary for you to kill me .    drake stepped back .   not at all .  attack me and i shoot your legs from under you .  you will lose them  all four  if necessary  but you will still live  in a horrible way .  you will live to die of cyanide lack .  it would be a most uncomfortable death .  i am only an earthman and i can t appreciate its true horrors  but you can  can t you .    the hawkinsite s mouth was open and something within quivered yellow green .  rose wanted to throw up .  she wanted to scream .  give him bock the cylinder  drake .  but nothing would come .  she couldn t even turn her head .   drake said   you have about an hour  i think  before the effects are irreversible .  talk quickly  dr .  tholan  and you will have your cylinder back .     and after that   said the hawkinsite .    after that  what does it matter to you .  even if i kill you then  it will be a clean death  not cyanide lack .    something seemed to pass out of the hawkinsite .  his voice grew guttural and his words blurred as though he no longer had the energy to keep his english perfect .  he said   what are your questions .   and as he spoke  his eyes followed the cylinder in drake s hand .   drake swung it deliberately  tantalizingly  and the creature s eyes followed  followed   drake said   what are your theories concerning the inhibition death .  why did you really come to earth .  what is your interest in the missing persons bureau .    rose found herself waiting in breathless anxiety .  these were the questions she would like to have asked  too .  not in this manner  perhaps  but in drake s job  kindness and humanity had to take second place to necessity .   she repeated that to herself several times in an effort to counteract the fact that she found herself loathing drake for what he was doing to dr .  tholan .   the hawkinsite said   the proper answer would take more than the hour i have left me .  you have bitterly shamed me by forcing me to talk under duress .  on my own planet  you could not have done so under any circumstances .  it is only here  on this revolting planet  that i can be deprived of cyanide .     you are wasting your hour  dr .  tholan .     i would have told you this eventually  mr .  smollett .  i needed your help .  it is why i came here .     you are still not answering my questions .     i will answer them now .  for years  in addition to my regular scientific work  i have been privately investigating the cells of my patients suffering from inhibition death .  i have been forced to use the utmost secrecy and to work without assistance  since the methods i used to investigate the bodies of my patients were frowned upon by my people .  your society would have similar feelings against human vivisection  for instance .  for this reason  i could not present the results i obtained to my fellow physicians until i had verified my theories here on earth .     what were your theories .   demanded drake .  the feverishness had returned to his eyes .    it became more and more obvious to me as i proceeded with my studies that the entire direction of research into the inhibition death was wrong .  physically  there was no solution to its mystery .  the inhibition death is entirely a disease of the mind .    rose interrupted   surely  dr .  tholan  it isn t psychosomatic .    a thin  gray translucent film had passed over the hawkinsite s eyes .  he no longer looked at them .  he said   no  mrs .  smollett  it is not psychosomatic .  it is a true disease of the mind  a mental infection .  my patients had double minds .  beyond and beneath the one that obviously belonged to them  there was evidence of another one an alien mind .  i worked with inhibition death patients of other races than my own  and the same could be found .  in short  there are not five intelligences in the galaxy  but six .  and the sixth is parasitic .    rose said   this is wild impossible .  you must be mistaken  dr .  tholan .     i am not mistaken .  until i came to earth  i thought i might be .  but my stay at the institute and my researches at the missing persons bureau convinced me that is not so .  what is so impossible about the concept of a parasitic intelligence .  intelligences like these would not leave fossil remains  nor even leave artifacts if their only function is to derive nourishment somehow from the mental activities of other creatures .  one can imagine such a parasite  through the course of millions of years  perhaps  losing all portions of its physical being but that which remains necessary  just as a tapeworm  among your earthly physical parasites  eventually lost all its functions but the single one of reproduction .  in the case of the parasitic intelligence  all physical attributes would eventually be lost .  it would become nothing but pure mind  living in some mental fashion we cannot conceive of on the minds of others .  particularly on the minds of earthmen .    rose said   why particularly earthmen .    drake simply stood apart  intent  asking no further questions .  he was content  apparently  to let the hawkinsite speak .    have you not surmised that the sixth intelligence is a native of earth .  mankind from the beginning has lived with it  has adapted to it  is unconscious of it .  it is why the higher species of terrestrial animals  including man  do not grow after maturity and  eventually  die what is called natural death .  it is the result of this universal parasitic infestation .  it is why you sleep and dream  since it is then that the parasitic mind must feed and then that you are a little more conscious of it  perhaps .  it is why the terrestrial mind alone of the intelligences is so subject to instability .  where else in the galaxy are found split personalities and other such manifestations .  after all  even now there must be occasional human minds which are visibly harmed by the presence of the parasite .    somehow  these parasitic minds could traverse space .  they had no physical limitations .  they could drift between the stars in what would correspond to a state of hibernation .  why the first ones did it  i don t know  probably no one will ever know .  but once those first discovered the presence of intelligence on other planets in the galaxy  there was a small  steady stream of parasitic intelligences making their way through space .  we of the outer worlds must have been a gourmet s dish for them or they would have never struggled so hard to get to us .  i imagine many must have failed to make the trip  but it must have been worth the effort to those who succeeded .    but you see  we of the other worlds had not lived with these parasites for millions of years  as man and his ancestors had .  we had not adapted ourselves to it .  our weak strains had not been killed off gradually through hundreds of generations until only the resistants were left .  so  where earthmen could survive the infection for decades with little harm  we others die a quick death within a year .     and is that why the incidence has increased since interstellar travel between earth and the other planets has begun .     yes .   for a moment there was silence  and then the hawkinsite said with a sudden access of energy   give me back my cylinder .  you have your answer .    drake said  coolly   what about the missing persons bureau .   he was swinging the cylinder again  but now the hawkinsite did not follow its movements .  the gray translucent film on his eyes had deepened and rose wondered whether that was simply an expression of weariness or an example of the changes induced by cyanide lack .   the hawkinsite said   as we are not well adapted to the intelligence that infests man  neither is it well adapted to us .  it can live on us it even prefers to  apparently but it cannot reproduce with ourselves alone as the source of its life .  the inhibition death is therefore not directly contagious among our people .    rose looked at him with growing horror .   what are you implying  dr .  tholan .     the earthman remains the prime host for the parasite .  an earthman may infect one of us if he remains among us .  but the parasite  once it is located in an intelligence of the outer worlds  must somehow return to an earthman  if it expects to reproduce .  before interstellar travel  this was possible only by a re passage of space and therefore the incidence of infection remained infinitesimal .  now we are infected and reinfected as the parasites return to earth and come back to us via the mind of earthmen who travel through space .    rose said faintly   and the missing persons     are the intermediate hosts .  the exact process by which it is done  i  of course  do not know .  the masculine terrestrial mind seems better suited for their purposes .  you ll remember that at the institute i was told that the life expectancy of the average human male is three years less than that of the average female .  once reproduction has been taken care of  the infested male leaves  by spaceship  for the outer worlds .  he disappears .     but this is impossible   insisted rose .   what you say implies that the parasite mind can control the actions of its host .  this cannot be  or we of earth would have noticed their presence .     the control  mrs .  smollett  may be very subtle  and may  moreover  be exerted only during the period of active reproduction .  i simply point to your missing persons bureau .  why do the young men disappear .  you have economic and psychological explanations  but they are not sufficient .   but i am quite ill now and cannot speak much longer .  i have only this to say .  in the mental parasite  your people and mine have a common enemy .  earthmen  too  need not die involuntarily  except for its presence .  i thought that if i found myself unable to return to my own world with my information because of the unorthodox methods i used to obtain it  i might bring it to the authorities on earth  and ask their help in stamping out this menace .  imagine my pleasure when i found that the husband of one of the biologists at the institute was a member of one of earth s most important investigating bodies .  naturally  i did what i could to be made a guest at his home in order that i might deal with him privately  convince him of the terrible truth  utilize his position to help in the attack on the parasites .    this is  of course  now impossible .  i cannot blame you too far .  as earthmen  you cannot be expected to understand the psychology of my people .  nevertheless  you must understand this .  i can have no further dealing with either of you .  i could not even bear to remain any longer on earth .    drake said   then you alone  of all your people  have any knowledge of this theory of yours .     i atone .    drake held out the cylinder .   your cyanide  dr .  tholan .    the hawkinsite groped for it eagerly .  his supple fingers manipulated the hose and the needle valve with the utmost delicacy .  in the space of ten  seconds  he had it in place and was inhaling the gas in huge breaths .  his eyes were growing clear and transparent .   drake waited until the hawkinsite breathings had subsided to normal  and then  without expression  he raised his needle gun and fired .  rose screamed .  the hawkinsite remained standing .  his four lower limbs were incapable of buckling  but his head lolled and from his suddenly flaccid mouth  the cyanide hose fell  disregarded .  once again  drake closed the needle valve and now he tossed the cylinder aside and stood there somberly  looking at the dead creature .  there was no external mark to show that he had been killed .  the needle gun s pellet  thinner than the needle which gave the gun its name  entered the body noiselessly and easily  and exploded with devastating effect only within the abdominal cavity .   rose ran from the room  still screaming .  drake pursued her  seized her arm .  she heard the hard  flat sounds of his palm against her face without feeling them and subsided into little bubbling sobs .   drake said   i told you to have nothing to do with this .  now what do you think you ll do .    she said   let me go .  i want to leave .  i want to go away .     because of something it was my job to do .  you heard what the creature was saying .  do you suppose i could allow him to return to his world and spread those lies .  they would believe him .  and what do you think would happen then .  can you imagine what an interstellar war might be like .  they would imagine they would have to kill us all to stop the disease .    with an effort that seemed to turn her inside out  rose steadied .  she looked firmly into drake s eyes and said   what dr .  tholan said were no lies and no mistakes  drake     oh  come now  you re hysterical .  you need sleep .     i know what he said is so because the security commission knows all about that same theory  and knows it to be true .     why do you say such a preposterous thing .     because you yourself let that slip twice .    drake said   sit down .   she did so  and he stood there  looking curiously at her .   so i have given myself away twice  have i .  you ve had a busy day of detection  my dear .  you have facets you keep well hidden .   he sat down and crossed his legs .   rose thought  yes  she had had a busy day .  she could see the electric clock on the kitchen wall from where she sat  it was more than two hours past midnight .  harg tholan had entered their house thirty five hours before and now he lay murdered in the spare bedroom .   drake said   well  aren t you going to tell me where i pulled my two boners .     you turned white when harg tholan referred to me as a charming hostess .  hostess has a double meaning  you know  drake .  a host is one who harbors a parasite .     .   number one   said drake .   what s number two .     that s something you did before harg tholan entered the house .  i ve been trying to remember it for hours .  do you remember  drake .  you spoke about how unpleasant it was for hawkinsites to associate with earthmen  and i said harg tholan was a doctor and had to .  i asked you if you thought that human doctors particularly enjoyed going to the tropics  or letting infected mosquitoes bite them .  do you remember how upset you became .    drake laughed .   i had no idea i was so transparent .  mosquitoes are hosts for the malaria and yellow fever parasites .   he sighed .   i ve done my best to keep you out of this .  i tried to keep the hawkinsite away .  i tried threatening you .  now there s nothing left but to tell you the truth .  i must  because only the truth or death will keep you quiet .  and i don t want to kill you .    she shrank back in her chair  eyes wide .   drake said   the commission knows the truth .  it does us no good .  we can only do all in our power to prevent the other worlds from finding out .     but the truth can t be held down forever .  harg tholan found out .  you ve killed him  but another extraterrestrial will repeat the same discovery  over and over again .  you can t kill them all .     we know that  too   agreed drake .   we have no choice .     why .   cried rose .   harg tholan gave you the solution .  he made no suggestions or threats of war between worlds .  he suggested that we combine with the other intelligences and help to wipe out the parasite .  and we can .  if we  in common with all the others  put every scrap of effort into it     you mean we can trust him .  does he speak for his government or for the other races .     can we dare to refuse the risk .    drake said   you don t understand .   he reached toward her and took one of her cold  unresisting hands between both of his .  he went on   i may seem silly trying to teach you anything about your specialty  but i want you to hear me out .  harg tholan was right .  man and his prehistoric ancestors have been living with this parasitic intelligence for uncounted ages  certainly for a much longer period than we have been truly homo sapiens .  in that interval  we have not only become adapted to it  we have become dependent upon it .  it is no longer a case of parasitism .  it is a case of mutual cooperation .  you biologists have a name for it .    she tore her hand away .   what are you talking about .  symbiosis .     exactly .  we have a disease of our own  remember .  it is a reverse disease  one of unrestrained growth .  we ve mentioned it already as a contrast to the inhibition death .  well  what is the cause of cancer .  how long have biologists  physiologists  biochemists and all the others been working on it .  how much success have they had with it .  why .  can t you answer that for yourself now .    she said  slowly   no  i can t .  what are you talking about .     it s all very well to say that if we could remove the parasite  we would  have eternal growth and life if we wanted it  or at least until we got tired of being too big or of living too long  and did away with ourselves neatly .  but how many millions of years has it been since the human body has had occasion to grow in such an unrestrained fashion .  can it do so any longer .  is the chemistry of the body adjusted to that .  has it got the proper whatch amacallits .     enzymes   rose supplied in a whisper .    yes  enzymes .  it s impossible for us .  if for any reason the parasitic intelligence  as harg tholan calls it  does leave the human body  or if its relationship to the human mind is in any way impaired  growth does take place  but not in any orderly fashion .  we call the growth cancer .  and there you have it .  there s no way of getting rid of the parasite .  we re together for all eternity .  to get rid of their inhibition death  extraterrestrials must first wipe out all vertebrate life on earth .  there is no other solution for them  and so we must keep knowledge of it from them .  do you understand .    her mouth was dry and it was difficult to talk .   i understand  drake .   she noticed that his forehead was damp and that there was a line of perspiration down each cheek .   and now you ll have to get it out of the apartment .     it s late at night and i ll be able to get the body out of the building .  from there on   he turned to her .   i don t know when i ll be back .     i understand  drake   she said again .   harg tholan was heavy .  drake had to drag him through the apartment .  rose turned away  retching .  she hid her eyes until she heard the front door close .  she whispered to herself   i understand  drake .    it was   a . m .  nearly an hour had passed since she had heard the front door click gently into place behind drake and his burden .  she didn t know where he was going  what he intended doing   she sat there numbly .  there was no desire to sleep  no desire to move .  she kept her mind traveling in tight circles  away from the thing she knew and which she wanted not to know .   parasitic minds .  was it only a coincidence or was it some queer racial memory  some tenuous long sustained wisp of tradition or insight  stretching back through incredible millennia  that kept current the odd myth of human beginnings .  she thought to herself  there were two intelligences on earth to begin with .  there were humans in the garden of eden and also the serpent  which  was more subtil than any beast of the field .   the serpent infected man and  as a result  it lost its limbs .  its physical attributes were no longer necessary .  and because of the infection  man was driven out of the garden of eternal life .  death entered the world .   yet  despite her efforts  the circle of her thoughts expanded and returned to drake .  she shoved and it returned  she counted to herself  she recited the  names of the objects in her field of vision  she cried   no  no  no   and it returned .  it kept returning .   drake had lied to her .  it had been a plausible story .  it would have held good under most circumstances  but drake was not a biologist .  cancer could not be  as drake had said  a disease that was an expression of a lost ability for normal growth .  cancer attacked children while they were still growing  it could even attack embryonic tissue .  it attacked fish  which  like extraterrestrials  never stopped growing while they lived  and died only by disease or accident .  it attacked plants which had no minds and could not be parasitized .  cancer had nothing to do with the presence or absence of normal growth  it was the general disease of life  to which no tissue of no multicellular organism was completely immune .   he should not have bothered lying .  he should not have allowed some obscure sentimental weakness to persuade him to avoid the necessity of killing her in that manner .  she would tell them at the institute .  the parasite could be beaten .  its absence would not cause cancer .  but who would believe her .   she put her hands over her eyes .  the young men who disappeared were usually in the first year of their marriage .  whatever the process of reproduction of the parasite intelligences  it must involve close association with another parasite the type of close and continuous association that might only be possible if their respective hosts were in equally close relationship .  as in the case of newly married couples .   she could feel her thoughts slowly disconnect .  they would be coming to her .  they would be saying   where is harg tholan .   and she would answer   with my husband .   only they would say   where is your husband .   because he would be gone  too .  he needed her no longer .  he would never return .  they would never find him  because he would be out in space .  she would report them both  drake smollett and harg tholan  to the missing persons bureau .   she wanted to weep  but couldn t  she was dry eyed and it was painful .   and then she began to giggle and couldn t stop .  it was very funny .  she had looked for the answers to so many questions and had found them all .  she had even found the answer to the question she thought had no bearing on the subject .   she had finally learned why drake had married her .    breeds there  a man .  .  .  .    police sergeant mankiewicz was on the telephone and he wasn t enjoying it .  his conversation was sounding like a one sided view of a firecracker .   he was saying   that s right .  he came in here and said   put me in jail  because i want to kill myself .      .  .  .  i can t help that .  those were his exact words .  it sounds crazy to me  too .     .   .   .  look  mister  the guy answers the description .  you asked me for information and i m giving it to you .     .   .   .  he has exactly that scar on his right cheek and he said his name was john smith .  he didn t say it was doctor anything at all .     .   .   .  well  sure it s a phony .  nobody is named john smith .  not in a police station  anyway .     .   .   .  he s in jail now .     .   .   .  yes  i mean it .     .  .  .  resisting an officer  assault and battery  malicious mischief .  that s three counts .     .  .  .  i don t care who he is .     .   .   .  all right .  i ll hold on .    he looked up at officer brown and put his hand over the mouthpiece of the phone .  it was a ham of a hand that nearly swallowed up the phone altogether .  his blunt featured face was ruddy and steaming under a thatch of pale yellow hair .   copyright         by street and smith publications  inc .   he said   trouble .  nothing but trouble at a precinct station .  i d rather be pounding a beat any day .     who s on the phone .   asked brown .  he had just come in and didn t really care .  he thought mankiewicz would look better on a suburban beat  too .    oak ridge .  long distance .  a guy called grant .  head of somethingo logical division  and now he s getting somebody else at seventy five cents a min  .   .   .  hello .    mankiewicz got a new grip on the phone and held himself down .    look   he said   let me go through this from the beginning .  i want you to get it straight and then if you don t like it  you can send someone down here .  the guy doesn t want a lawyer .  he claims he just wants to stay in jail and  brother  that s all right with me .    well  will you listen .  he came in yesterday  walked right up to me  and said   officer  i want you to put me in jail because i want to kill myself .   so i said   mister  i m sorry you want to kill yourself .  don t do it  because if you do  you ll regret it the rest of your life .      .  .  .  i am serious .  i m just telling you what i said .  i m not saying it was a funny joke  but i ve got my own troubles here  if you know what i mean .  do you think all i ve got to do here is to listen to cranks who walk in and     .   .   .  give me a chance  will you .   i said   i can t put you in jail for wanting to kill yourself .  that s no crime .   and he said   but i don t want to die .   so i said   look  bud  get out of here .   i mean if a guy wants to commit suicide  all right  and if he doesn t want to  all right  but i don t want him weeping on my shoulder .     .   .   .  i m getting on with it .  so he said to me .   if i commit a crime  will you put me in jail .   i said   if you re caught and if someone files a charge and you can t put up bail  we will .  now beat it .   so he picked up the inkwell on my desk and  before i could stop him  he turned it upside down on the open police blotter .     .   .   .  that s right .  why do you think we have  malicious mischief tabbed on him .  the ink ran down all over my pants .     .   .   .  yes  assault and battery  too .  i came hopping down to shake a little sense into him  and he kicked me in the shins and handed me one in the eye .     .   .   .  i m not making this up .  you want to come down here and look at my face .     .   .   .  he ll be up in court one of these days .  about thursday  maybe .     .   .   .  ninety days is the least he ll get  unless the psychoes say otherwise .  i think he belongs in the loony bin myself .     .   .   .  officially  he s john smith .  that s the only name he ll give .     .   .   .  no  sir  he doesn t get released without the proper legal steps .       .   .  o . k .   you do that  if you want to  bud .  i just do my job here .    he banged the phone into its cradle  glowered at it  then picked it up and  began dialing .  he said  gianetti .    got the proper answer and began talking .    what s the a . e . c .  .  i ve been talking to some joe on the phone and he says     .   .   .  no  i m not kidding  lunk head .  if i were kidding  i d put up a sign .  what s the alphabet soup .    he listened  said   thanks  in a small voice and hung up again .   he had lost some of his color .   that second guy was the head of the atomic energy commission   he said to brown .   they must have switched me from oak ridge to washington .    brown lounged to his feet   maybe the f . b . i  is after this john smith guy .  maybe he s one of these here scientists .   he felt moved to philosophy .   they ought to keep atomic secrets away from those guys .  things were o . k .  as long as general groves was the only fella who knew about the atom bomb .  once they cut in these here scientists on it  though     ah  shut up   snarled mankiewicz .   dr .  oswald grant kept his eyes fixed on the white line that marked the highway and handled the car as though it were an enemy of his .  he always did .  he was tall and knobby with a withdrawn expression stamped on his face .  his knees crowded the wheel  and his knuckles whitened whenever he made a turn .   inspector darrity sat beside him with his legs crossed so that the sole of his left shoe came up hard against the door .  it would leave a sandy mark when he took it away .  he tossed a nut brown penknife from hand to hand .  earlier  he had unsheathed its wicked  gleaming blade and scraped casually at his nails as they drove  but a sudden swerve had nearly cost him a finger and he desisted .   he said   what do you know about this ralson .    dr .  grant took his eyes from the road momentarily  then returned them .  he said  uneasily   i ve known him since he took his doctorate at princeton .  he s a very brilliant man .     yes .  brilliant  huh .  why is it that all you scientific men describe one another as  brilliant  .  aren t there any mediocre ones .     many .  i m one of them .  but ralson isn t .  you ask anyone .  ask oppen heimer .  ask bush .  he was the youngest observer at alamogordo .     o . k .  he was brilliant .  what about his private life .    grant waited .   i wouldn t know .     you know him since princeton .  how many years is that .    they had been scouring north along the highway from washington for two hours with scarcely a word between them .  now grant felt the atmosphere change and the grip of the law on his coat collar .    he got his degree in     .     you ve known him eight years then .       that s right .    us  and you don t know about his private life .     a man s life is his own  inspector .  he wasn t very sociable .  a great many of the men are like that .  they work under pressure and when they re off the job  they re not interested in continuing the lab acquaintanceships .     did he belong to any organizations that you know of .     no .    the inspector said   did he ever say anything to you that might indicate he was disloyal .    grant shouted  no .   and there was silence for a while .   then darrity said   how important is ralson in atomic research .    grant hunched over the wheel and said   as important as any one man can be .  i grant you that no one is indispensable  but ralson has always seemed to be rather unique .  he has the engineering mentality .     what does that mean .     he isn t much of a mathematician himself  but he can work out the gadgets that put someone else s math into life .  there s no one like him when it comes to that .  time and again  inspector  we ve had a problem to lick and no time to lick it in .  there were nothing but blank minds all around until he put some thought into it and said   why don t you try so and so .   then he d go away .  he wouldn t even be interested enough to see if it worked .  but it always did .  always .  maybe we would have got it ourselves eventually  but it might have taken months of additional time .  i don t know how he does it .  it s no use asking him either .  he just looks at you and says  it was obvious   and walks away .  of course  once he s shown us how to do it  it is obvious .    the inspector let him have his say out .  when no more came  he said   would you say he was queer  mentally .  erratic  you know .     when a person is a genius  you wouldn t expect him to be normal  would you .     maybe not .  but just how abnormal was this particular genius .     he never talked  particularly .  sometimes  he wouldn t work .       stayed at home and went fishing instead .     no .  he came to the labs all right  but he would just sit at his desk .  sometimes that would go on for weeks .  wouldn t answer you  or even look at you  when you spoke to him .     did he ever actually leave work altogether .     before now  you mean .  never .     did he ever claim he wanted to commit suicide .  ever say he wouldn t feel safe except in jail .     no .     you re sure this john smith is ralson .     i m almost positive .  he has a chemical bum on his right cheek that can t be mistaken .     o . k .  that s that  then i ll speak to him and see what he sounds like .   the silence fell for good this time .  dr .  grant followed the snaking line as inspector darrity tossed the penknife in low arcs from hand to hand .   the warden listened to the call box and looked up at his visitors .   we can have him brought up here  inspector  regardless .    no   dr .  grant shook his head .   let s go to him .   darrity said   is that normal for ralson  dr .  grant .  would you expect him to attack a guard trying to take him out of a prison cell .   grant said   i can t say .    the warden spread a calloused palm .  his thick nose twitched a little .   we haven t tried to do anything about him so far because of the telegram from washington  but  frankly  he doesn t belong here .  i ll be glad to have him taken off my hands .    we ll see him in his cell   said darrity .   they went down the hard  barlined corridor .  empty  incurious eyes watched their passing .   dr .  grant felt his flesh crawl .   has he been kept here all the time .   darrity did not answer .   the guard  pacing before them  stopped .   this is the cell .   darrity said   is that dr .  ralson .    dr .  grant looked silently at the figure upon the cot .  the man had been lying down when they first reached the cell  but now he had risen to one elbow and seemed to be trying to shrink into the wall .  his hair was sandy and thin  his figure slight  his eyes blank and china blue .  on his right cheek there was a raised pink patch that tailed off like a tadpole .  dr .  grant said   that s ralson .    the guard opened the door and stepped inside  but inspector darrity sent him out again with a gesture .  ralson watched them mutely .  he had drawn both feet up to the cot and was pushing backwards .  his adam s apple bobbled as he swallowed .   darrity said quietly   dr .  elwood ralson .    what do you want .   the voice was a surprising baritone .   would you come with us  please .  we have some questions we would like to ask you .     no .  leave me alone .     dr .  ralson   said grant   i ve been sent here to ask you to come back to  work .    ralson looked at the scientist and there was a momentary glint of something other than fear in his eyes .  he said   hello  grant .   he got off his cot .   listen  i ve been trying to have them put me into a padded cell .  can t you make them do that for me .  you know me  grant  i wouldn t ask for something i didn t feel was necessary .  help me .  i can t stand the hard walls .  it makes me want to  .  .  .  bash   he brought the flat of his palm thudding down against the hard  dull gray concrete behind his cot .     i darrity looked thoughtful .  he brought out his penknife and unbent the reaming blade .  carefully  he scraped at his thumbnail  and said   would you like to see a doctor .    i  but ralson didn t answer that .  he followed the gleam of metal and his lips parted and grew wet .  his breath became ragged and harsh .   j he said   put that away .      darrity paused .   put what away .     the knife .  don t hold it in front of me .  i can t stand looking at it .   j darrity said   why not .   he held it out .   anything wrong with it .  it s a good knife .    ralson lunged .  darrity stepped back and his left hand came down on the other s wrist .  he lifted the knife high in the air .   what s the matter  ralson .  what are you after .    grant cried a protest but darrity waved him away .  i darrity said   what do you want  ralson .         .  ralson tried to reach upward  and bent under the other s appalling grip .   he gasped   give me the knife .     why  ralson .  what do you want to do with it .      please .  i ve got to   he was pleading .   i ve got to stop living .     you want to die .   i  no .  but i must .    darrity shoved .  ralson flailed backward and tumbled into his cot  so that it squeaked noisily .  slowly  darrity bent the blade of his penknife into its sheath and put it away .  ralson covered his face .  his shoulders were shaking but otherwise he did not move .   there was the sound of shouting from the corridor  as the other prisoners reacted to the noise issuing from ralson s cell .  the guard came hurrying down  yelling   quiet .   as he went .   darrity looked up .   it s all right  guard .    he was wiping his hands upon a large white handkerchief .   i think we ll get a doctor for him .    dr .  gottfried blaustein was small and dark and spoke with a trace of an austrian accent .  he needed only a small goatee to be the layman s caricature of a psychiatrist .  but he was clean shaven  and very carefully dressed .  he watched grant closely  assessing him  blocking in certain observations and deductions .  he did this automatically  now  with everyone he met .   he said   you give me a sort of picture .  you describe a man of great talent  perhaps even genius .  you tell me he has always been uncomfortable with people  that he has never fitted in with his laboratory environment  even though it was there that he met the greatest of success .  is there another environment to which he has fitted himself .       don t understand .     it is not given to all of us to be so fortunate as to find a congenial type of  company at the place or in the field where we find it necessary to make a living .  often  one compensates by playing an instrument  or going hiking  or joining some club .  in other words  one creates a new type of society  when not working  in which one can feel more at home .  it need not have the slightest connection with what one s ordinary occupation is .  it is an escape  and not necessarily an unhealthy one .   he smiled and added   myself  i collect stamps .  i am an active member of the american society of philatelists .    grant shook his head .   i don t know what he did outside working hours .  i doubt that he did anything like what you ve mentioned .     um m m .  well  that would be sad .  relaxation and enjoyment are wherever you find them  but you must find them somewhere  no .     have you spoken to dr .  ralson  yet .     about his problems .  no .     aren t you going to .     oh  yes .  but he has been here only a week .  one must give him a chance to recover .  he was in a highly excited state when he first came here .  it was almost a delirium .  let him rest and become accustomed to the new environment .  i will question him  then .     will you be able to get him back to work .    blaustein smiled .   how should i know .  i don t even know what his sickness is .     couldn t you at least get rid of the worst of it  this suicidal obsession of his  and take care of the rest of the cure while he s at work .     perhaps .  i couldn t even venture an opinion so far without several interviews .     how long do you suppose it will all take .     in these matters  dr .  grant  nobody can say .    grant brought his hands together in a sharp slap .   do what seems best then .  but this is more important than you know .     perhaps .  but you may be able to help me  dr .  grant .     how .     can you get me certain information which may be classified as top secret .     what kind of information .     i would like to know the suicide rate  since       among nuclear scientists .  also  how many have left their jobs to go into other types of scientific work  or to leave science altogether .     is this in connection with ralson .     don t you think it might be an occupational disease  this terrible unhap piness of his .     well a good many have left their jobs  naturally .     why naturally  dr .  grant .     you must know how it is  dr .  blaustein  the atmosphere in modem  atomic research is one of great pressure and red tape .  you work with the government  you work with military men .  you can t talk about your work  you have to be careful what you say .  naturally  if you get a chance at a job in a university  where you can fix your own hours  do your own work  write papers that don t have to be submitted to the a . e . c .   attend conventions that aren t held behind locked doors  you take it .     and abandon your field of specialty forever .     there are always non military applications .  of course  there was one man who did leave for another reason .  he told me once he couldn t sleep nights .  he said he d hear one hundred thousand screams coming from hiroshima  when he put the lights out .  the last i heard of him he was a clerk in a haberdashery .     and do you ever hear a few screams yourself .    grant nodded .   it isn t a nice feeling to know that even a little of the responsibility of atomic destruction might be your own .     how did ralson feel .     he never spoke of anything like that .     in other words  if he felt it  he never even had the safety valve effect of letting off steam to the rest of you .     i guess he hadn t .     yet nuclear research must be done  no .     i ll say .     what would you do  dr .  grant  if you felt you had to do something that you couldn t do .    grant shrugged .   i don t know .      some people kill themselves .   j  you mean that s what has ralson down .     i don t know .  i do not know .  i will speak to dr .  ralson this evening .  i obn promise nothing  of course  but i will let you know whatever i can .    grant rose .   thanks  doctor .  i ll try to get the information you want .    elwood ralson s appearance had improved in the week he had been at dr .  blaustein s sanatorium .  his face had filled out and some of the restlessness had gone out of him .  he was tieless and beltless .  his shoes were without laces .   blaustein said   how do you feel  dr .  ralson .     rested .     you have been treated well .     no complaints  doctor .    blaustein s hand fumbled for the letter opener with which it was his habit to play during moments of abstraction  but his fingers met nothing .  it had been put away  of course  with anything else possessing a sharp edge .  there was nothing on his desk  now  but papers .   he said   sit down  dr .  ralson .  how do your symptoms progress .     you mean  do i have what you would call a suicidal impulse .  yes .  it gets worse or better  depending on my thoughts  i think .  but it s always with me .  there is nothing you can do to help .     perhaps you are right .  there are often things i cannot help .  but i would like to know as much as i can about you .  you are an important man    ralson snorted .    you do not consider that to be so .   asked blaustein .    no  i don t .  there are no important men  any more than there are important individual bacteria .     i don t understand .     i don t expect you to .     and yet it seems to me that behind your statement there must have been much thought .  it would certainly be of the greatest interest to have you tell me some of this thought .    for the first time  ralson smiled .  it was not a pleasant smile .  his nostrils were white .  he said   it is amusing to watch you  doctor .  you go about your business so conscientiously .  you must listen to me  mustn t you  with just that air of phony interest and unctuous sympathy .  i can tell you the most ridiculous things and still be sure of an audience  can t i .     don t you think my interest can be real  even granted that it is professional  too .     no  i don t .     why not .     i m not interested in discussing it .     would you rather return to your room .     if you don t mind .  no .   his voice had suddenly suffused with fury as he stood up  then almost immediately sat down again .   why shouldn t i use you .  i don t like to talk to people .  they re stupid .  they don t see things .  they stare at the obvious for hours and it means nothing to them .  if i spoke to them  they wouldn t understand  they d lose patience  they d laugh .  whereas you must listen .  it s your job .  you can t interrupt to tell me i m mad  even though you may think so .     i d be glad to listen to whatever you would like to tell me .    ralson drew a deep breath .   i ve known something for a year now  that very few people know .  maybe it s something no live person knows .  do you know that human cultural advances come in spurts .  over a space of two generations in a city containing thirty thousand free men  enough literary and artistic genius of the first rank arose to supply a nation of millions for a century under ordinary circumstances .  i m referring to the athens of pericles .    there are other examples .  there is the florence of the medicis  the england of elizabeth  the spain of the cordovan emirs .  there was the spasm of social reformers among the israelites of the eighth and seventh centuries before christ .  do you know what i mean .      r blaustein nodded .   i see that history is a subject that interests you .      why not .  i suppose there s nothing that says i must restrict myself to nuclear cross sections and wave mechanics .     nothing at all .  please proceed .     at first  i thought i could learn more of the true inwardness of historical cycles by consulting a specialist .  i had some conferences with a professional historian .  a waste of time .     what was his name  this professional historian .     does it matter .     perhaps not  if you would rather consider it confidential .  what did he tell you .     he said i was wrong  that history only appeared to go in spasms .  he said that after closer studies the great civilizations of egypt and sumeria did not arise suddenly or out of nothing  but upon the basis of a long developing sub civilization that was already sophisticated in its arts .  he said that peri clean athens built upon a pre periclean athens of lower accomplishments  without which the age of pericles could not have been .    i asked why was there not a post periclean athens of higher accomplishments still  and he told me that athens was ruined by a plague and by a long war with sparta .  i asked about other cultural spurts and each time it was a war that ended it  or  in some cases  even accompanied it .  he was like all the rest .  the truth was there  he had only to bend and pick it up  but he didn t .    ralson stared at the floor  and said in a tired voice   they come to me in the laboratory sometimes  doctor .  they say   how the devil are we going to get rid of the such and such effect that is ruining all our measurements  ralson .   they show me the instruments and the wiring diagrams and i say   it s staring at you .  why don t you do so and so .  a child could tell you that .   then i walk away because i can t endure the slow puzzling of their stupid faces .  later  they come to me and say   it worked  ralson .  how did you figure it out .   i can t explain to them  doctor  it would be like explaining that water is wet .  and i couldn t explain to the historian .  and i can t explain to you .  it s a waste of time .     would you like to go back to your room .     yes .    blaustein sat and wondered for many minutes after ralson had been escorted out of his office .  his fingers found their way automatically into the upper right drawer of his desk and lifted out the letter opener .  he twiddled it in his fingers .   finally  he lifted the telephone and dialed the unlisted number he had been given .   he said   this is blaustein .  there is a professional historian who was consulted by dr .  ralson some time in the past  probably a bit over a year  ago .  i don t know his name .  i don t even know if he was connected with a university .  if you could find him  i would like to see him .    thaddeus milton  ph . d .   blinked thoughtfully at blaustein and brushed his hand through his iron gray hair .  he said   they came to me and i said that i had indeed met this man .  however  i have had very little connection with him .  none  in fact  beyond a few conversations of a professional nature .     how did he come to you .     he wrote me a letter  why me  rather than someone else  i do not know .  a series of articles written by myself had appeared in one of the semi learned journals of semi popular appeal about that time .  it may have attracted his attention .     i see .  with what general topic were the articles concerned .     they were a consideration of the validity of the cyclic approach to history .  that is  whether one can really say that a particular civilization must follow laws of growth and decline in any matter analogous to those involving individuals .     i have read toynbee  dr .  milton .     well  then  you know what i mean .    blaustein said   and when dr .  ralson consulted you  was it with reference to this cyclic approach to history .     u m m m .  in a way  i suppose .  of course  the man is not an historian and some of his notions about cultural trends are rather dramatic and .   .   .   .  what shall i say .   .   .   .  tabloidish .  pardon me  doctor  if i ask a question which may be improper .  is dr .  ralson one of your patients .     dr .  ralson is not well and is in my care .  this  and all else we say here  is confidential  of course .     quite .  i understand that .  however  your answer explains something to me .  some of his ideas almost verged on the irrational .  he was always worried  it seemed to me  about the connection between what he called  cultural spurts  and calamities of one sort or another .  now such connections have been noted frequently .  the time of a nation s greatest vitality may come at a time of great national insecurity .  the netherlands is a good case in point .  her great artists  statesmen  and explorers belong to the early seventeenth century at the time when she was locked in a death struggle with the greatest european power of the time  spain .  when at the point of destruction at home  she was building an empire in the far east and had secured footholds on the northern coast of south america  the southern tip of africa  and the hudson valley of north america .  her fleets fought england to a standstill .  and then  once her political safety was assured  she declined .    well  as i say  that is not unusual .  groups  like individuals  will rise to strange heights in answer to a challenge  and vegetate in the absence of a  challenge .  where dr .  ralson left the paths of sanity  however  was in insisting that such a view amounted to confusing cause and effect .  he deckred that it was not times of war and danger that stimulated  cultural spurts   but rather vice versa .  he claimed that each time a group of men snowed too much vitality and ability  a war became necessary to destroy the possibility of their further development .     i see   said blaustein .    i rather laughed at him  i am afraid .  it may be that that was why he did not keep the last appointment we made .  just toward the end of that last conference he asked me  in the most intense fashion imaginable  whether i did not think it queer that such an improbable species as man was dominant on earth  when all he had in his favor was intelligence .  there i laughed aloud .  perhaps i should not have  poor fellow .     it was a natural reaction   said blaustein   but i must take no more of your time .  you have been most helpful .    they shook hands  and thaddeus milton took his leave .    well   said darrity   there are your figures on the recent suicides among scientific personnel .  get any deductions out of it .     i should be asking you that   said blaustein  gently .   the f . b . i  must have investigated thoroughly .     you can bet the national debt on that .  they are suicides .  there s no mistake about it .  there have been people checking on it in another department .  the rate is about four times above normal  taking age  social status  economic class into consideration .     what about british scientists .     just about the same .     and the soviet union .     who can tell .   the investigator leaned forward .   doc  you don t think the soviets have some sort of ray that can make people want to commit suicide  do you .  it s sort of suspicious that men in atomic research are the only ones affected .     is it .  perhaps not .  nuclear physicists may have peculiar strains imposed upon them .  it is difficult to tell without thorough study .     you mean complexes might be coming through .   asked darrity  warily .   blaustein made a face .   psychiatry is becoming too popular .  everybody talks of complexes and neuroses and psychoses and compulsions and whatnot .  one man s guilt complex is another man s good night s sleep .  if i could talk to each one of the men who committed suicide  maybe i could know something .     you re talking to ralson .     yes  i m talking to ralson .     has he got a guilt complex .     not particularly .  he has a background out of which it would not surprise  me if he obtained a morbid concern with death .  when he was twelve he saw his mother die under the wheels of an automobile .  his father died slowly of cancer .  yet the effect of those experiences on his present troubles is not clear .    darrity picked up his hat .   well  i wish you d get a move on  doc .  there s something big on  bigger than the h bomb .  i don t know how anything can be bigger than that  but it is .    ralson insisted on standing .   i had a bad night last night  doctor .     i hope   said blaustein   these conferences are not disturbing you .     well  maybe they are .  they have me thinking on the subject again .  it makes things bad  when i do that .  how do you imagine it feels being part of a bacterial culture  doctor .     i had never thought of that .  to a bacterium  it probably feels quite normal .    ralson did not hear .  he said  slowly   a culture in which intelligence is being studied .  we study all sorts of things as far as their genetic relationships are concerned .  we take fruit flies and cross red eyes and white eyes to see what happens .  we don t care anything about red eyes and white eyes  but we try to gather from them certain basic genetic principles .  you see what i mean .     certainly .     even in humans  we can follow various physical characteristics .  there are the hapsburg lips  and the haemophilia that started with queen victoria and cropped up in her descendants among the spanish and russian royal families .  we can even follow feeble mindedness in the jukeses and kal likakas .  you learn about it in high school biology .  but you can t breed human beings the way you do fruit flies .  humans live too long .  it would take centuries to draw conclusions .  it s a pity we don t have a special race of men that reproduce at weekly intervals  eh .    he waited for an answer  but blaustein only smiled .   ralson said   only that s exactly what we would be for another group of beings whose life span might be thousands of years .  to them  we would reproduce rapidly enough .  we would be short lived creatures and they could study the genetics of such things as musical aptitude  scientific intelligence  and so on .  not that those things would interest them as such  any more than the white eyes of the fruit fly interest us as white eyes .     this is a very interesting notion   said blaustein .    it is not simply a notion .  it is true .  to me  it is obvious  and i don t care how it seems to you .  look around you .  look at the planet  earth .  what kind of a ridiculous animal are we to be lords of the world after the dinosaurs had failed .  sure  we re intelligent  but what s intelligence .  we think it is important because we have it .  if the tyrannosaurus could have picked out the one quality that he thought would ensure species domination  it would  be size and strength .  and he would make a better case for it .  he lasted longer than we re likely to .    intelligence in itself isn t much as far as survival values are concerned .  the elephant makes out very poorly indeed when compared to the sparrow even though he is much more intelligent .  the dog does well  under man s protection  but not as well as the house fly against whom every human hand is raised .  or take the primates as a group .  the small ones cower before their enemies  the large ones have always been remarkably unsuccessful in doing more than barely holding their own .  the baboons do the best and that is because of their canines  not their brains .    a light film of perspiration covered ralson s forehead .   and one can see that man has been tailored  made to careful specifications for those things that study us .  generally  the primate is short lived .  naturally  the larger ones live longer  which is a fairly general rule in animal life .  yet the human being has a life span twice as long as any of the other great apes  considerably longer even than the gorilla that outweighs him .  we mature later .  it s as though we ve been carefully bred to live a little longer so that our life cycle might be of a more convenient length .    he jumped to his feet  shaking his fists above his head .   a thousand years are but as yesterday    blaustein punched a button hastily .   for a moment  ralson struggled against the white coated orderly who entered  and then he allowed himself to be led away .   blaustein looked after him  shook his head  and picked up the telephone .   he got darrity .   inspector  you may as well know that this may take a long time .    he listened and shook his head .   i know .  i don t minimize the urgency .    the voice in the receiver was tinny and harsh .   doctor  you are minimizing it .  i ll send dr .  grant to you .  he ll explain the situation to you .    dr .  grant asked how ralson was  then asked somewhat wistfully if he could see him .  blaustein shook his head gently .   grant said   i ve been directed to explain the current situation in atomic research to you .     so that i will understand  no .     i hope so .  it s a measure of desperation .  i ll have to remind you     not to breathe a word of it .  yes  i know .  this insecurity on the part of you people is a very bad symptom .  you must know these things cannot be hidden .     you live with secrecy .  it s contagious .     exactly .  what is the current secret .     there is  .  .  .  or  at least  there might be a defense against the atomic bomb .     and that is a secret .  it would be better if it were shouted to all the people of the world instantly .     for heaven s sake  no .  listen to me  dr .  blaustein .  it s only on paper so far .  it s at the e equal me square stage  almost .  it may not be practical .  it would be bad to raise hopes we would have to disappoint .  on the other hand  if it were known that we almost had a defense  there might be a desire to start and win a war before the defense were completely developed .     that i don t believe .  but  nevertheless  i distract you .  what is the nature of this defense  or have you told me as much as you dare .     no  i can go as far as i like  as far as is necessary to convince you we have to have ralson and fast .     well  then tell me  and i too  will know secrets .  i ll feel like a member of the cabinet .     you ll know more than most .  look  dr .  blaustein  let me explain it in lay language .  so far  military advances have been made fairly equally in both offensive and defensive weapons .  once before there seemed to be a definite and permanent tipping of all warfare in the direction of the offense  and that was with the invention of gunpowder .  but the defense caught up .  the medieval man in armor on horse became the modem man in tank on treads  and the stone castle became the concrete pillbox .  the same thing  you see  except that everything has been boosted several orders of magnitude .     very good .  you make it clear .  but with the atomic bomb comes more orders of magnitude  no .  you must go past concrete and steel for protection .     right .  only we can t just make thicker and thicker walls .  we ve run out of materials that are strong enough .  so we must abandon materials altogether .  if the atom attacks  we must let the atom defend .  we will use energy itself  a force field .     and what   asked blaustein  gently   is a force field .     i wish i could tell you .  right now  it s an equation on paper .  energy can be so channeled as to create a wall of matterless inertia  theoretically .  in practice  we don t know how to do it .     it would be a wall you could not go through  is that it .  even for atoms .     even for atom bombs .  the only limit on its strength would be the amount of energy we could pour into it .  it could even theoretically be made to be impermeable to radiation .  the gamma rays would bounce off it .  what we re dreaming of is a screen that would be in permanent place about cities  at minimum strength  using practically no energy .  it could then be triggered to maximum intensity in a fraction of a millisecond at the impingement of short wave radiation  say the amount radiating from the mass of plutonium large enough to be an atomic war head .  all this is theoretically possible .     and why must you have ralson .     because he is the only one who can reduce it to practice  if it can be made practical at all  quickly enough .  every minute counts these days .  you  know what the international situation is .  atomic defense must arrive before atomic war .     you are so sure of ralson .     i am as sure of him as i can be of anything .  the man is amazing  dr .  blaustein .  he is always right .  nobody in the field knows how he does it .     a sort of intuition  no .   the psychiatrist looked disturbed .   a kind of reasoning that goes beyond ordinary human capacities .  is that it .     i make no pretense of knowing what it is .     let me speak to him once more then .  i will let you know .     good .   grant rose to leave  then  as if in afterthought  he said   i might say  doctor  that if you don t do something  the commission plans to take dr .  ralson out of your hands .     and try another psychiatrist .  if they wish to do that  of course  i will not stand in their way .  it is my opinion  however  that no reputable practitioner will pretend there is a rapid cure .     we may not intend further mental treatment .  he may simply be returned to work .     that  dr .  grant  i will fight .  you will get nothing out of him .  it will be his death .     we get nothing out of him anyway .     this way there is at least a chance  no .     i hope so .  and by the way  please don t mention the fact that i said anything about taking ralson away .     i will not  and i thank you for the warning .  good bye  dr .  grant .     i made a fool of myself last time  didn t i  doctor .   said ralson .  he was frowning .    you mean you don t believe what you said then .     ida .   ralson s slight form trembled with the intensity of his affirmation .   he rushed to the window  and blaustein swiveled in his chair to keep him in view .  there were bars in the window .  he couldn t jump .  the glass was unbreakable .   twilight was ending  and the stars were beginning to come out .  ralson stared at them in fascination  then he turned to blaustein and flung a finger outward .   every single one of them is an incubator .  they maintain temperatures at the desired point .  different experiments  different temperatures .  and the planets that circle them are just huge cultures  containing different nutrient mixtures and different life forms .  the experimenters are economical  too whatever and whoever they are .  they ve cultured many types of life forms in this particular test tube .  dinosaurs in a moist  tropical age and ourselves among the glaciers .  they turn the sun up and down and we try to work out the physics of it .  physics .   he drew his lips back in a snarl .    surely   said dr .  blaustein   it is not possible that the sun can be turned up and down at will .     why not .  it s just like a heating element in an oven .  you think bacteria know what it is that works the heat that reaches them .  who knows .  maybe they evolve theories  too .  maybe they have their cosmogonies about cosmic catastrophes  in which clashing light bulbs create strings of petri dishes .  maybe they think there must be some beneficent creator that supplies them with food and warmth and says to them   be fruitful and multiply .     we breed like them  not knowing why .  we obey the so called laws of nature which are only our interpretation of the not understood forces imposed upon us .    and now they ve got the biggest experiment of any yet on their hands .  it s been going on for two hundred years .  they decided to develop a strain for mechanical aptitude in england in the seventeen hundreds  i imagine .  we call it the industrial revolution .  it began with steam  went on to electricity  then atoms .  it was an interesting experiment  but they took their chances on letting it spread .  which is why they ll have to be very drastic indeed in ending it .    blaustein said   and how would they plan to end it .  do you have an idea about that .     you ask me how they plan to end it .  you can look about the world today and still ask what is likely to bring our technological age to an end .  all the earth fears an atomic war and would do anything to avoid it  yet all the earth fears that an atomic war is inevitable .     in other words  the experimenters will arrange an atom war whether we want it or not  to kill off the technological era we are in  and to start fresh .  that is it  no .     yes .  it s logical .  when we sterilize an instrument  do the germs know where the killing heat comes from .  or what has brought it about .  there is some way the experimenters can raise the heat of our emotions  some way they can handle us that passes our understanding .     tell me   said blaustein   is that why you want to die .  because you think the destruction of civilization is coming and can t be stopped .    ralson said   i don t want to die .  it s just that i must .   his eyes were tortured .   doctor  if you had a culture of germs that were highly dangerous and that you had to keep under absolute control  might you not have an agar medium impregnated with  say  penicillin  in a circle at a certain distance from the center of inoculation .  any germs spreading out too far from the center would die .  you would have nothing against the particular germs who were killed  you might not even know that any germs had spread that far in the first place .  it would be purely automatic .    doctor  there is a penicillin ring about our intellects .  when we stray too far  when we penetrate the true meaning of our own existence  we have reached into the penicillin and we must die .  it works slowly but it s hard to stay alive .    he smiled briefly and sadly .  then he said   may i go back to my room   ow  doctor .    dr .  blaustein went to ralson s room about noon the next day .  it was a small room and featureless .  the walls were gray with padding .  two small windows were high up and could not be reached .  the mattress lay directly on the padded floor .  there was nothing of metal in the room  nothing that could be utilized in tearing life from body .  even ralson s nails were clipped short .    ralson sat up .   hello .     hello  dr .  ralson .  may i speak to you .     here .  there isn t any seat i can offer you .     it is all right .  i ll stand .  i have a sitting job and it is good for my sitting down place that i should stand sometimes .  dr .  ralson  i have thought all night of what you told me yesterday and in the days before .     and now you are going to apply treatment to rid me of what you think are delusions .     no .  it is just that i wish to ask questions and perhaps to point out some consequences of your theories which  .   .   .  you will forgive me .   .   .   .  you may not have thought of .     oh .     you see  dr .  ralson  since you have explained your theories  i  too  know what you know .  yet i have no feeling about suicide .     belief is more than something intellectual  doctor .  you d have to believe this with all your insides  which you don t .     do you not think perhaps it is rather a phenomenon of adaptation .     how do you mean .     you are not really a biologist  dr .  ralson .  and although you are very brilliant indeed in physics  you do not think of everything with respect to these bacterial cultures you use as analogies .  you know that it is possible to breed bacterial strains that are resistant to penicillin or to almost any bacterial poison .     well .     the experimenters who breed us have been working with humanity for many generations  no .  and this particular strain which they have been culturing for two centuries shows no sign of dying out spontaneously .  rather  it is a vigorous strain and a very infective one .  older high culture strains were confined to single cities or to small areas and lasted only a generation or two .  this one is spreading throughout the world .  it is a very infective strain .  do you not think it may have developed penicillin immunity .  in other words  the methods the experimenters use to wipe out the culture may not work too well any more  no .    ralson shook his head .   it s working on me .     you are perhaps non resistant .  or you have stumbled into a very high  concentration of penicillin indeed .  consider all the people who have been trying to outlaw atomic warfare and to establish some form of world government and lasting peace .  the effort has risen in recent years  without too awful results .     it isn t stopping the atomic war that s coming .     no  but maybe only a little more effort is all that is required .  the peace advocates do not kill themselves .  more and more humans are immune to the experimenters .  do you know what they are doing in the laboratory .     i don t want to know .     you must know .  they are trying to invent a force field that will stop the atom bomb .  dr .  ralson  if i am culturing a virulent and pathological bacterium  then  even with all precautions  it may sometimes happen that i will start a plague .  we may be bacteria to them  but we are dangerous to them  also  or they wouldn t wipe us out so carefully after each experiment .    they are not quick  no .  to them a thousand years is as a day  no .  by the time they realize we are out of the culture  past the penicillin  it will be too late for them to stop us .  they have brought us to the atom  and if we can only prevent ourselves from using it upon one another  we may turn out to be too much even for the experimenters .    ralson rose to his feet .  small though he was  he was an inch and a half taller than blaustein .   they are really working on a force field .     they are trying to .  but they need you .     no .  i can t .     they must have you in order that you might see what is so obvious to you .  it is not obvious to them .  remember  it is your help  or else defeat of man by the experimenters .    ralson took a few rapid steps away  staring into the blank  padded wall .  he muttered   but there must be that defeat .  if they build a force field  it will mean death for all of them before it can be completed .     some or all of them may be immune  no .  and in any case  it will be death for them anyhow .  they are trying .    ralson said   i ll try to help them .     do you still want to kill yourself .     yes .     but you ll try not to  no .     i ll try not to  doctor .   his lip quivered .   i ll have to be watched .    blaustein climbed the stairs and presented his pass to the guard in the lobby .  he had already been inspected at the outer gate  but he  his pass  and its signature were now scrutinized once again .  after a moment  the guard retired to his little booth and made a phone call .  the answer satisfied him .  blaustein took a seat and  in half a minute  was up again  shaking hands with dr .  grant .         the president of the united states would have trouble getting in here  no .   said blaustein .   the lanky physicist smiled .   you re right  if he came without warning .   v they took an elevator which traveled twelve floors .  the office to which grant led the way had windows in three directions .  it was sound proofed and air conditioned .  its walnut furniture was in a state of high polish .   blaustein said   my goodness .  it is like the office of the chairman of a board of directors .  science is becoming big business .    grant looked embarrassed .   yes  i know  but government money flows easily and it is difficult to persuade a congressman that your work is important unless he can see  smell  and touch the surface shine .    blaustein sat down and felt the upholstered seat give way slowly .  he said   dr .  elwood ralson has agreed to return to work .     wonderful .  i was hoping you would say that .  i was hoping that was why you wanted to see me .   as though inspired by the news  grant offered the psychiatrist a cigar  which was refused .    however   said blaustein   he remains a very sick man .  he will have to be treated carefully and with insight .     of course .  naturally .     it s not quite as simple as you may think .  i want to tell you something of ralson s problems  so that you will really understand how delicate the situation is .    he went on talking and grant listened first in concern  and then in astonishment .   but then the man is out of his head  dr .  blaustein .  he ll be of no use to us .  he s crazy .    blaustein shrugged .   it depends on how you define  crazy .   it s a bad word  don t use it .  he had delusions  certainly .  whether they will affect his peculiar talents one cannot know .     but surely no sane man could possibly     please .  please .  let us not launch into long discussions on psychiatric definitions of sanity and so on .  the man has delusions and  ordinarily  i would dismiss them from all consideration .  it is just that i have been given to understand that the man s particular ability lies in his manner of proceeding to the solution of a problem by what seems to be outside ordinary reason .  that is so  no .     yes .  that must be admitted .     how can you and i judge then as to the worth of one of his conclusions .  let me ask you  do you have suicidal impulses lately .     i don t think so .     and other scientists here .     no  of course not .     i would suggest  however  that while research on the force field proceeds  the scientists concerned be watched here and at home .  it might even  be a good enough idea that they should not go home .  offices like these could be arranged to be a small dormitory     sleep at work .  you would never get them to agree .     oh  yes .  if you do not tell them the real reason but say it is for security purposes  they will agree .   security purposes  is a wonderful phrase these days  no .  ralson must be watched more than anyone .     of course .     but all this is minor .  it is something to be done to satisfy my conscience in case ralson s theories are correct .  actually  i don t believe them .  they are delusions  but once fiiat is granted  it is necessary to ask what the causes of those delusions are .  what is it in ralson s mind  in his background  in his life that makes it so necessary for him to have these particular delusions .  one cannot answer that simply .  it may well take years of constant psychoanalysis to discover the answer .  and until the answer is discovered  he will not be cured .    but  meanwhile  we can perhaps make intelligent guesses .  he has had an unhappy childhood  which  in one way or another  has brought him face to face with death in very unpleasant fashion .  in addition  he has never been able to form associations with other children  or  as he grew older  with other men .  he was always impatient with their slower forms of reasoning .  whatever difference there is between his mind and that of others  it has built a wall between him and society as strong as the force field you are trying to design .  for similar reasons  he has been unable to enjoy a normal sex life .  he has never married  he has had no sweethearts .    it is easy to see that he could easily compensate to himself for this failure to be accepted by his social milieu by taking refuge in the thought that other human beings are inferior to himself .  which is  of course  true  as far as mentality is concerned .  there are  of course  many  many facets to the human personality and in not all of them is he superior .  no one is .  others  then  who are more prone to see merely what is inferior  just as he himself is  would not accept his affected pre eminence of position .  they would think him queer  even laughable  which would make it even more important to ralson to prove how miserable and inferior the human species was .  how could he better do that than to show that mankind was simply a form of bacteria to other superior creatures which experiment upon them .  and then his impulses to suicide would be a wild desire to break away completely from being a man at all  to stop this identification with the miserable species he has created in his mind .  you see .    grant nodded .   poor guy .     yes  it is a pity .  had he been properly taken care of in childhood  well  it is best for dr .  ralson that he have no contact with any of the other men here .  he is too sick to be trusted with them .  you  yourself  must arrange to be the only man who will see him or speak to him .  dr .  ralson has agreed to that .  he apparently thinks you are not as stupid as some of the others .        .  grant smiled faintly .   that is agreeable to me .    vi  you will  of course  be careful .  i would not discuss anything with him but his work .  if he should volunteer information about his theories  which i doubt  confine yourself to something non committal  and leave .  and at all times  keep away anything that is sharp and pointed .  do not let him reach a window .  try to have his hands kept in view .  you understand .  i leave my patient in your care  dr .  grant .    i will do my best  dr .  blaustein .    for two months  ralson lived in a comer of grant s office  and grant lived with him .  gridwork had been built up before the windows  wooden furniture was removed and upholstered sofas brought in .  ralson did his thinking on the couch and his calculating on a desk pad atop a hassock .   the  do not enter  was a permanent fixture outside the office .  meals were left outside .  the adjoining men s room was marked off for private use and the door between it and the office removed .  grant switched to an electric razor .  he made certain that ralson took sleeping pills each night and waited till the other slept before sleeping himself .   and always reports were brought to ralson .  he read them while grant watched and tried to seem not to watch .   then ralson would let them drop and stare at the ceiling  with one hand shading his eyes .    anything .   asked grant .    ralson shook his head from side to side .      grant said   look  i ll clear the building during the swing shift .  it s important that you see some of the experimental jigs we ve been setting   up       they did so  wandering through the lighted  empty buildings like drifting    ghosts  hand in hand .  always hand in hand .  grant s grip was tight .  but after  each trip  ralson would still shake his head from side to side .    half a dozen times he would begin writing  each time there would be a   few scrawls and then he would kick the hassock over on its side .   until  finally  he began writing once again and covered half a page rapidly .  automatically  grant approached .  ralson looked up  covering the sheet of paper with a trembling hand .  he said   call blaustein .    what .     i said   call blaustein .   get him here .  now .   grant moved to the telephone .   ralson was writing rapidly now  stopping only to brush wildly at his forehead with the back of a hand .  it came away wet .  he looked up and his voice was cracked   is he coming .   grant looked worried .   he isn t at his office .     get him at his home .  get him wherever he is .  use that telephone .  don t play with it .    grant used it  and ralson pulled another sheet toward himself .   five minutes later  grant said   he s coming .  what s wrong .  you re looking sick .    ralson could speak only thickly   no time  can t talk    he was writing  scribbling  scrawling  shakily diagraming .  it was as though he were driving his hands  fighting it .    dictatp .   urged grant .   i ll write .    ralson shook him off .  his words were unintelligible .  he held his wrist with his other hand  shoving it as though it were a piece of wood  and then he collapsed over the papers .   grant edged them out from under and laid ralson down on the couch .  he hovered over him restlessly and hopelessly until blaustein arrived .   blaustein took one look .   what happened .    grant said   i think he s alive   but by that time blaustein had verified that for himself  and grant told him what had happened .   blaustein used a hypodermic and they waited .  ralson s eyes were blank when they opened .  he moaned .   blaustein leaned close .   ralson .    ralson s hands reached out blindly and clutched at the psychiatrist .   doc .  take me back .     i will .  now .  it is that you have the force field worked out  no .     it s on the papers .  grant  it s on the papers .    grant had them and was leafing through them dubiously .  ralson said  weakly   it s not all there .  it s all i can write .  you ll have to make it out of that .  take me back  doc .     wait   said grant .  he whispered urgently to blaustein .   can t you leave him here till we test this thing .  i can t make out what most of this is .  the writing is illegible .  ask him what makes him think this will work .     ask him .   said blaustein  gentry .   isn t he the one who always knows .     ask me  anyway   said ralson  overhearing from where he lay on the couch .  his eyes were suddenly wide and blazing .   they turned to him .   he said   they don t want a force field .  they .  the experimenters .  as long as i had no true grasp  things remained as they were .  but i hadn t followed up that thought that thought which is there in the papers i hadn t followed it up for thirty seconds before i felt  .  .  .  i felt  doctor    blaustein said   what is it .    ralson was whispering again   i m deeper in the penicillin .  i could feel myself plunging in and in  the further i went with that .  i ve never been in  .  .  .  so deep .  that s how i knew i was right .  take me away .    blaustein straightened .   i ll have to take him away  grant .  there s no alternative .  if you can make out what he s written  that s it .  if you can t  make it out  i can t help you .  that man can do no more work in his field  without dying  do you understand .     but   said grant   he s dying of something imaginary .     all right .  say that he is .  but he will be really dead just the same  no .    ralson was unconscious again and heard nothing of this .  grant looked at  him somberly  then said   well  take him away  then .    ten of the top men at the institute watched glumly as slide after slide filled the illuminated screen .  grant faced them  expression hard and frowning .   he said   i think the idea is simple enough .  you re mathematicians and you re engineers .  the scrawl may seem illegible  but it was done with meaning behind it .  that meaning must somehow remain in the writing  distorted though it is .  the first page is clear enough .  it should be a good lead .  each one of you will look at every page over and over again .  you re going to put down every possible version of each page as it seems it might be .  you will work independently .  i want no consultations .    one of them said   how do you know it means anything  grant .     because those are ralson s notes .     ralson .  i thought he was     you thought he was sick   said grant .  he had to shout over the rising hum of conversation .   i know .  he is .  that s the writing of a man who was nearly dead .  it s all we ll ever get from ralson  any more .  somewhere in that scrawl is the answer to the force field problem .  if we can t find it  we may have to spend ten years looking for it elsewhere .    they bent to their work .  the night passed .  two nights passed .  three nights   grant looked at the results .  he shook his head .   i ll take your word for it that it is all self consistent .  i can t say i understand it .    lowe  who  in the absence of ralson  would readily have been rated the best nuclear engineer at the institute  shrugged .   it s not exactly clear to me .  if it works  he hasn t explained why .     he had no time to explain .  can you build the generator as he describes it .     i could try .     would you look at all the other versions of the pages .     the others are definitely not self consistent .     would you double check .     sure .     and could you start construction anyway .     i ll get the shop started .  but i tell you frankly that i m pessimistic .     i know .  so am i .      i     i   .  .  .   the thing grew .  hal ross  senior mechanic  was put in charge of the actual construction  and he stopped sleeping .  at any hour of the day or night  he could be found at it  scratching his bald head .   he asked questions only once   what is it  dr .  lowe .  never saw anything like it .  what s it supposed to do .    lowe said   you know where you are  ross .  you know we don t ask questions here .  don t ask again .    ross did not ask again .  he was known to dislike the structure that was being built .  he called it ugly and unnatural .  but he stayed at it .   blaustein called one day .   grant said   how s ralson .     not good .  he wants to attend the testing of the field projector he designed .    grant hesitated   i suppose we should .  it s his after all .     i would have to come with him .    grant looked unhappier .   it might be dangerous  you know .  even in a pilot test  we d be playing with tremendous energies .    blaustein said   no more dangerous for us than for you .     very well .  the list of observers will have to be cleared through the commission and the f . b . i .   but i ll put you in .    blaustein looked about him .  the field projector squatted in the very center of the huge testing laboratory  but all else had been cleared .  there was no visible connection with the plutonium pile which served as energy source  but from what the psychiatrist heard in scraps about him he knew better than to ask ralson the connection was from beneath .   at first  the observers had circled the machine  talking in incomprehen sibles  but they were drifting away now .  the gallery was filling up .  there were at least three men in generals  uniforms on the other side  and a real coterie of lower scale military .  blaustein chose an unoccupied portion of the railing  for ralson s sake  most of all .   he said   do you still think you would like to stay .    it was warm enough within the laboratory  but ralson was in his coat  with his collar turned up .  it made little difference  blaustein felt .  he doubted that any of ralson s former acquaintances would now recognize him .   ralson said   i ll stay .    blaustein was pleased .  he wanted to see the test .  he turned again at a new voice .    hello  dr .  blaustein .    for a minute  blaustein did not place him  then he said   ah  inspector darrity .  what are you doing here .     just what you would suppose .   he indicated the watchers .   there isn t  any way you can weed them out so that you can be sure there won t be any mistakes .  i once stood as near to klaus fuchs as i am standing to you .   he tossed his pocketknife into the air and retrieved it with a dexterous motion .    ah  yes .  where shall one find perfect security .  what man can trust even his own unconscious .  and you will now stand near to me  no .     might as well .   darrity smiled .   you were very anxious to get in here  weren t you .     not for myself  inspector .  and would you put away the knife  please .    darrity turned in surprise in the direction of blaustein s gentle head gesture .  he put his knife away and looked at blaustein s companion for the second time .  he whistled softly .   he said   hello  dr .  ralson .    ralson croaked   hello .    blaustein was not surprised at darrity s reaction .  ralson had lost twenty pounds since returning to the sanatorium .  his face was yellow and wrinkled  the face of a man who had suddenly become sixty .   blaustein said   will the test be starting soon .    darrity said   it looks as if they re starting now .    he turned and leaned on the rail .  blaustein took ralson s elbow and began leading him away  but darrity said  softly   stay here  doc .  i don t want you wandering about .    blaustein looked across the laboratory .  men were standing about with the uncomfortable air of having turned half to stone .  he could recognize grant  tall and gaunt  moving his hand slowly to light a cigarette  then changing his mind and putting lighter and cigarette in his pocket .  the young men at the control panels waited tensely .   then there was a low humming and the faint smell of ozone filled the air .   ralson said harshly   look .    blaustein and darrity looked along the pointing finger .  the projector seemed to flicker .  it was as though there were heated air rising between it and them .  an iron ball came swinging down pendulum fashion and passed through the flickering area .    it slowed up  no .   said blaustein  excitedly .   ralson nodded .   they re measuring the height of rise on the other side to calculate the loss of momentum .  fools .  i said it would work .   he was speaking with obvious difficulty .   blaustein said   just watch  dr .  ralson .  i would not allow myself to grow needlessly excited .    the pendulum was stopped in its swinging  drawn up .  the flickering about the projector became a little more intense and the iron sphere arced down once again .   over and over again  and each time the sphere s motion was slowed with more of a jerk .  it made a clearly audible sound as it struck the flicker .  and  eventually  it bounced .  first  soggily  as though it hit putty  and then ring ingly  as though it hit steel  so that the noise filled the place .   they drew back the pendulum bob and used it no longer .  the projector could hardly be seen behind the haze that surrounded it .   grant gave an order and the odor of ozone was suddenly sharp and pungent .  there was a cry from the assembled observers  each one exclaiming to his neighbor .  a dozen fingers were pointing .   blaustein leaned over the railing  as excited as the rest .  where the projector had been  there was now only a huge semi globular mirror .  it was perfectly and beautifully clear .  he could see himself in it  a small man standing on a small balcony that curved up on each side .  he could see the fluorescent lights reflected in spots of glowing illumination .  it was wonderfully sharp .   he was shouting   look  ralson .  it is reflecting energy .  it ie reflecting light waves like a mirror .  ralson    he turned   ralson .  inspector  where is ralson .     what .   darrity whirled .   i haven t seen him .    he looked about  wildly .   well  he won t get away .  no way of getting out of here now .  you take the other side .   and then he clapped hand to thigh  fumbled for a moment in his pocket  and said   my knife is gone .    bkustein found him .  he was inside the small office belonging to hal ross .  it led off the balcony  but under the circumstances  of course  it had been deserted .  ross himself was not even an observer .  a senior mechanic need not observe .  but his office would do very well for the final end of the long fight against suicide .   blaustein stood in the doorway for a sick moment  then turned .  he caught darrity s eye as the latter emerged from a similar office a hundred feet down the balcony .  he beckoned  and darrity came at a run .   dr .  grant was trembling with excitement .  he had taken two puffs at each of two cigarettes and trodden each underfoot thereafter .  he was fumbling with the third now .   he was saying   this is better than any of us could possibly have hoped .  we ll have the gunfire test tomorrow .  i m sure of the result now  but we ve planned it  we ll go through with it .  we ll skip the small arms and start with the bazooka levels .  or maybe not .  it might be necessary to construct a special testing structure to take care of the ricochet problem .    he discarded his third cigarette .   a general said   we d have to try a literal atom bombing  of course .     naturally .  arrangements have already been made to build a mock city at eniwetok .  we could build a generator on the spot and drop the bomb .  there d be animals inside .     and you really think if we set up a field in full power it would hold the bomb .     it s not just that  general .  there d be no noticeable field at all until the  bomb is dropped .  the radiation of the plutonium would have to energize the field before explosion .  as we did here in the last step .  that s the essence of it all .     you know   said a princeton professor   i see disadvantages  too .  when the field is on full  anything it protects is in total darkness  as far as the sun is concerned .  besides that  it strikes me that the enemy can adopt the practice of dropping harmless radioactive missiles to set off the field at frequent intervals .  it would have nuisance value and be a considerable drain on our pile as well .     nuisances   said grant   can be survived .  these difficulties will be met eventually  i m sure  now that the main problem has been solved .    the british observer had worked his way toward grant and was shaking hands .  he said   i feel better about london already .  i cannot help but wish your government would allow me to see the complete plans .  what i have seen strikes me as completely ingenious .  it seems obvious now  of course  but how did anyone ever come to think of it .    grant smiled .   that question has been asked before with reference to dr .  ralson s devices    he turned at the touch of a hand upon his shoulder .   dr .  blaustein .  i had nearly forgotten .  here  i want to talk to you .    he dragged the small psychiatrist to one side and hissed in his ear   listen  can you persuade ralson to be introduced to these people .  this is his triumph .    blaustein said   ralson is dead .   i   what     can you leave these people for a time .      yes  .   .   .  yes  gentlemen  you will excuse me for a few minutes .    he hurried off with blaustein .   the federal men had already taken over .  unobtrusively  they barred the doorway to ross s office .  outside there were the milling crowd discussing the answer to alamogordo that they had just witnessed .  inside  unknown to them  was the death of the answerer .  the g man barrier divided to allow grant and blaustein to enter .  it closed behind them again .   for a moment  grant raised the sheet .  he said   he looks peaceful .   i  i would say happy   said blaustein .      darrity said  colorlessly   the suicide weapon was my own knife .  it was  . my negligence  it will be reported as such .        no  no   said blaustein   that would be useless .  he was my patient and i am responsible .  in any case  he would not have lived another week .  since he invented the projector  he was a dying man .    grant said   how much of this has to be placed in the federal files .  can t we forget all about his madness .     i m afraid not  dr .  grant   said darrity .    i have told him the whole story   said blaustein  sadly .   grant looked from one to the other .   i ll speak to the director .  i ll go to the president  if necessary .  i don t see that there need be any mention of suicide or of madness .  he ll get full publicity as inventor of the field projector .  it s the least we can do for him .   his teeth were gritting .   blaustein said   he left a note .     a note .    darrity handed him a sheet of paper and said   suicides almost always do .  this is one reason the doctor told me about what really killed ralson .    the note was addressed to blaustein and it went    the projector works  i knew it would .  the bargain is done .  you ve got it and you don t need me any more .  so i ll go .  you needn t worry about the human race  doc .  you were right .  they ve bred us too long  they ve taken too many chances .  we re out of the culture now and they won t be able to stop us .  i know .  that s all i can say .  i know .    he had signed his name quickly and then underneath there was one scrawled line  and it said    provided enough men are penicillin resistant .    grant made a motion to crumple the paper  but darrity held out a quick hand .    for the record  doctor   he said .   grant gave it to him and said   poor ralson .  he died believing all that trash .    blaustein nodded .   so he did .  ralson will be given a great funeral  i suppose  and the fact of his invention will be publicized without the madness and the suicide .  but the government men will remain interested in his mad theories .  they may not be so mad  no  mr .  darrity .     that s ridiculous  doctor   said grant .   there isn t a scientist on the job who has shown the least uneasiness about it at all .     tell him  mr .  darrity   said blaustein .   darrity said   there has been another suicide .  no  no  none of the scientists .  no one with a degree .  it happened this morning  and we investigated because we thought it might have some connection with today s test .  there didn t seem any  and we were going to keep it quiet till the test was over .  only now there seems to be a connection .    the man who died was just a guy with a wife and three kids .  no reason to die .  no history of mental illness .  he threw himself under a car .  we have witnesses  and it s certain he did it on purpose .  he didn t die right away and they got a doctor to him .  he was horribly mangled  but his last words were  i feel much better now  and he died .     but who was he .   cried grant .    hal ross .  the guy who actually built the projector .  the guy whose office this is .    blaustein walked to the window .  the evening sky was darkening into starriness .           he said   the man knew nothing about ralson s views .  he had never spoken to ralson  mr .  darrity tells me .  scientists are probably resistant as a whole .  they must be or they are quickly driven out of the profession .  ralson was an exception  a penicillin sensitive who insisted on remaining .  you see what happened to him .  but what about the others  those who have remained in walks of life where there is no constant weeding out of the sensitive ones .  how much of humanity is penicillin resistant .     you believe ralson .   asked grant in horror .    i don t really know .    blaustein looked at the stars .   incubators .   c chute  even from the cabin into which he and the other passengers had been herded  colonel anthony windham could still catch the essence of the battle s progress .  for a while  there was silence  no jolting  which meant the spaceships were fighting at astronomical distance in a duel of energy blasts and powerful force field defenses .   he knew that could have only one end .  their earth ship was only an armed merchantman and his glimpse of the kloro enemy just before he had been cleared off deck by the crew was sufficient to show it to be a light cruiser .   and in less than half an hour  there came those hard little shocks he was waiting for .  the passengers swayed back and forth as the ship pitched and veered  as though it were an ocean liner in a storm .  but space was calm and silent as ever .  it was their pilot sending desperate bursts of steam through the steam tubes  so that by reaction the ship would be sent rolling and tumbling .  it could only mean that the inevitable had occurred .  the earth ship s screens had been drained and it no longer dared withstand a direct hit .   colonel windham tried to steady himself with his aluminum cane .  he was thinking that he was an old man  that he had spent his life in the militia and had never seen a battle  that now  with a battle going on around him  he was old and fat and lame and had no men under his command .   they would be boarding soon  those kloro monsters .  it was their way of fighting .  they would be handicapped by spacesuits and their casualties  copyright         by galaxy publishing corporation .   would be high  but they wanted the earth ship .  windham considered the passengers .  for a moment  he thought  if they were armed and i could lead them   he abandoned the thought .  porter was in an obvious state of funk and the young boy  leblanc  was hardly better .  the polyorketes brothers dash it  he couldn  t tell them apart huddled in a corner speaking only to one another .  mullen was a different matter .  he sat perfectly erect  with no signs of fear or any other emotion in his face .  but the man was just about five feet tall and had undoubtedly never held a gun of any sort in his hands in all his life .  he could do nothing .   and there was stuart  with his frozen half smile and the high pitched sarcasm which saturated all he said .  windham looked sidelong at stuart now as stuart sat there  pushing his dead white hands through his sandy hair .  with those artificial hands he was useless  anyway .   windham felt the shuddering vibration of ship to ship contact  and in five minutes  there was the noise of the fight through the corridors .  one of the polyorketes brothers screamed and dashed for the door .  the other called   aristides .  wait .   and hurried after .   it happened so quickly .  aristides was out the door and into the corridor  running in brainless panic .  a carbonizer glowed briefly and there was never even a scream .  windham  from the doorway  turned in horror at the blackened stump of what was left .  strange a lifetime in uniform and he had never before seen a man killed in violence .   it took the combined force of the rest to carry the other brother back struggling into the room .   the noise of battle subsided .   stuart said   that s it .  they ll put a prize crew of two aboard and take us to one of their home planets .  we re prisoners of war  naturally .     only two of the kloros will stay aboard .   asked windham  astonished .   stuart said   it is their custom .  why do you ask  colonel .  thinking of leading a gallant raid to retake the ship .    windham flushed .   simply a point of information  dash it .   but the dignity and tone of authority he tried to assume failed him  he knew .  he was simply an old man with a limp .   and stuart was probably right .  he had lived among the kloros and knew their ways .   john stuart had claimed from the beginning that the kloros were gentlemen .  twenty four hours of imprisonment had passed  and now he repeated the statement as he flexed the fingers of his hands and watched the crinkles come and go in the soft artiplasm .   he enjoyed the unpleasant reaction it aroused in the others .  people were made to be punctured  windy bladders  all of them .  and they had hands of the same stuff as their bodies .   there was anthony windham  in particular .  colonel windham  he called himself  and stuart was willing to believe it .  a retired colonel who had probably drilled a home guard militia on a village green  forty years ago  with such lack of distinction that he was not called back to service in any capacity  even during the emergency of earth s first interstellar war .    dashed unpleasant thing to be saying about the enemy  stuart .  don t know that i like your attitude .   windham seemed to push the words through his clipped mustache .  his head had been shaven  too  in imitation of the current military style  but now a gray stubble was beginning to show about a centered bald patch .  his flabby cheeks dragged downward .  that and the fine red lines on his thick nose gave him a somewhat undone appearance  as though he had been wakened too suddenly and too early in the morning .   stuart said   nonsense .  just reverse the present situation .  suppose an earth warship had taken a kloro liner .  what do you think would have happened to any kloro civilians aboard .     i m sure the earth fleet would observe all the interstellar rules of war   windham said stiffly .    except that there aren t any .  if we landed a prize crew on one of their ships  do you think we d take the trouble to maintain a chlorine atmosphere for the benefit of the survivors  allow them to keep their non contraband possessions  give them the use of the most comfortable stateroom  etcetera  etcetera  etcetera .    ben porter said   oh  shut up  for god s sake .  if i hear your etcetera  etcetera once again  i ll go nuts .    stuart said   sorry .   he wasn t .   porter was scarcely responsible .  his thin face and beaky nose glistened with perspiration  and he kept biting the inside of his cheek until he suddenly winced .  he put his tongue against the sore spot  which made him look even more clownish .   stuart was growing weary of baiting them .  windham was too flabby a target and porter could do nothing but writhe .  the rest were silent .  deme trios polyorketes was off in a world of silent internal grief for the moment .  he had not slept the night before  most probably .  at least  whenever stuart woke to change his position he himself had been rather restless there had been poryorketes  thick mumble from the next cot .  it said many things  but the moan to which it returned over and over again was   oh  my brother .    he sat dumbly on his cot now  his red eyes rolling at the other prisoners out of his broad swarthy  unshaven face .  as stuart watched  his face sank into calloused palms so that only his mop of crisp and curly black hair could be seen .  he rocked gently  but now that they were all awake  he made no sound .   claude leblanc was trying very unsuccessfully  to read a letter .  he was  the youngest of the six  scarcely out of college  returning to earth to get married .  stuart had found him that morning weeping quietly  his pink and white face flushed and blotched as though it were a heartbroken child s .  he was very fair  with almost a girl s beauty about his large blue eyes and full lips .  stuart wondered what kind of girl it was who had promised to be his wife .  he had seen her picture .  who on the ship had not .  she had the characterless prettiness that makes all pictures of fiancees indistinguishable .  it seemed to stuart that if he were a girl  however  he would want someone a little more pronouncedly masculine .   that left only randolph mullen .  stuart frankly did not have the least idea what to make of him .  he was the only one of the six that had been on the arcturian worlds for any length of time .  stuart  himself  for instance  had been there only long enough to give a series of lectures on astronautical engineering at the provincial engineering institute .  colonel windham had been on a cook s tour  porter was trying to buy concentrated alien vegetables for his canneries on earth  and the polyorketes brothers had attempted to establish themselves in arcturus as truck farmers and  after two growing seasons  gave it up  had somehow unloaded at a profit  and were returning to earth .   randolph mullen  however  had been in the arcturian system for seventeen years .  how did voyagers discover so much about one another so quickly .  as far as stuart knew  the little man had scarcely spoken aboard ship .  he was unfailingly polite  always stepped to one side to allow another to pass  but his entire vocabulary appeared to consist only of  thank you  and  pardon me .   yet the word had gone around that this was his first trip to earth in seventeen yeais .   he was a little man  very precise  almost irritatingly so .  upon awaking that morning  he had made his cot neatly  shaved  bathed and dressed .  the habit of years seemed not in the least disturbed by the fact that he was a prisoner of the kloros now .  he was unobtrusive about it  it had to be admitted  and gave no impression of disapproving of the sloppiness of the others .  he simply sat there  almost apologetic  trussed in his overconserva tive clothing  and hands loosely clasped in his lap .  the thin line of hair on his upper lip  far from adding character to his face  absurdly increased its primness .   he looked like someone s idea of a caricature of a bookkeeper .  and the queer thing about it all  stuart thought  was that that was exactly what he was .  he had noticed it on the registry randolph fluellen mullen  occupation  bookkeeper  employers  prime paper box co .      tobias avenue  new warsaw  arcturus ii .    mr .  stuart .    stuart looked up .  it was leblanc  his lower lip trembling slightly .  stuart  tried to remember how one went about being gentle .  he said   what is it  leblanc .     tell me  when will they let us go .     how should i know .     everyone says you lived on a kloro planet  and just now you said they were gentlemen .     well  yes .  but even gentlemen fight wars in order to win .  probably  we ll be interned for the duration .     but that could be years .  margaret is waiting .  she ll think i m dead .     i suppose they ll allow messages to be sent through once we re on their planet .    porter s hoarse voice sounded in agitation .   look here  if you know so much about these devils  what will they do to us while we re interned .  what will they feed us .  where will they get oxygen for us .  they ll kill us  i tell you .   and as an afterthought   i ve got a wife waiting for me  too   he added .   but stuart had heard him speaking of his wife in the days before the attack .  he wasn t impressed .  porter s nail bitten fingers were pulling and plucking at stuart s sleeve .  stuart drew away in sharp revulsion .  he couldn t stand those ugly hands .  it angered him to desperation that such monstrosities should be real while his own white and perfectly shaped hands were only mocking imitations grown out of an alien latex .   he said   they won t kill us .  if they were going to  they would have done it before now .  look  we capture kloros too  you know  and it s just a matter of common sense to treat your prisoners decently if you want the other side to be decent to your men .  they ll do their best .  the food may not be very good  but they re better chemists than we are .  it s what they re best at .  they ll know exactly what food factors we ll need and how many calories .  we ll live .  they ll see to that .    windham rumbled   you sound more and more like a blasted greenie sympathizer  stuart .  it turns my stomach to hear an earthman speak well of the green fellas the way you ve been doing .  burn it  man  where s your loyalty .     my loyalty s where it belongs .  with honesty and decency  regardless of the shape of the being it appears in .   stuart held up his hands .   see these .  kloros made them .  i lived on one of their planets for six months .  my hands were mangled in the conditioning machinery of my own quarters .  i thought the oxygen supply they gave me was a little poor it wasn t  by the way  and i tried making the adjustments on my own .  it was my fault .  you should never trust yourself with the machines of another culture .  by the time someone among the kloros could put on an atmosphere suit and get to me  it was too late to save my hands .    they grew these artiplasm things for me and operated .  you know what that meant .  it meant designing equipment and nutrient solutions that  would work in oxygen atmosphere .  it meant that their surgeons had to perform a delicate operation while dressed in atmosphere suits .  and now i ve got hands again .   he laughed harshly  and clenched them into weak fists .   hands    windham said   and you d sell your loyalty to earth for that .     sell my loyalty .  you re mad .  for years  i hated the kloros for this .  i was a master pilot on the trans galactic spacelines before it happened .  now .  desk job .  or an occasional lecture .  it took me a long time to pin the fault on myself and to realize that the only role played by the kloros was a decent one .  they have their code of ethics  and it s as good as ours .  if it weren t for the stupidity of some of their people and  by god  of some of ours we wouldn t be at war .  and after it s over    polyorketes was on his feet .  his thick fingers curved inward before him and his dark eyes glittered .   i don t like what you say  mister .     why don t you .     because you talk too nice about these damned green bastards .  the kloros were good to you  eh .  well  they weren t good to my brother .  they killed him .  i think maybe i kill you  you damned greenie spy .    and he charged .   stuart barely had time to raise his arms to meet the infuriated farmer .  he gasped out   what the hell   as he caught one wrist and heaved a shoulder to block the other which groped toward his throat .   his artiplasm hand gave way .  polyorketes wrenched free with scarcely an effort .   windham was bellowing incoherently  and leblanc was calling out in his reedy voice   stop it .  stop it .   but it was little mulkn who threw his arms about the farmer s neck from behind and pulled with all his might .  he was not very effective  polyorketes seemed scarcely aware of the little man s weight upon his back .  mullen s feet left the floor so that he tossed helplessly to right and left .  but he held his grip and it hampered polyorketes sufficiently to allow stuart to break free long enough to grasp windham s aluminum cane .   he said   stay away  polyorketes .    he was gasping for breath and fearful of another rush .  the hollow aluminum cylinder was scarcely heavy enough to accomplish much  but it was better than having only his weak hands to defend himself with .   mullen had loosed his hold and was now circling cautiously  his breathing roughened and his jacket in disarray .   polyorketes  for a moment  did not move .  he stood there  his shaggy head bent low .  then he said   it is no use .  i must kill kloros .  just watch your tongue  stuart .  if it keeps on rattling too much  you re liable to get hurt .  really hurt  i mean .    stuart passed a forearm over his forehead and thrust the cane back at  windham  who seized it with his left hand  while mopping his bald pate vigorously with a handkerchief in his right .   windham said   gentlemen  we must avoid this .  it lowers our prestige .  we must remember the common enemy .  we are earthmen and we must act what we are the ruling race of the galaxy .  we dare not demean ourselves before the lesser breeds .     yes  colonel   said stuart  wearily .   give us the rest of the speech tomorrow .    he turned to mullen   i want to say thanks .    he was uncomfortable about it  but he had to .  the little accountant had surprised him completely .   but mullen said  in a dry voice that scarcely raised above a whisper   don t thank me  mr .  stuart .  it was the logical thing to do .  if we are to be interned  we would need you as an interpreter  perhaps  one who would understand the kloros .    stuart stiffened .  it was  he thought  too much of the bookkeeper type of reasoning  too logical  too dry of juice .  present risk and ultimate advantage .  the assets and debits balanced neatly .  he would have liked mullen to leap to his defense out of well  out of what .  out of pure  unselfish decency .   stuart laughed silently at himself .  he was beginning to expect idealism of human beings  rather than good  straight forward  self centered motivation .   polyorketes was numb .  his sorrow and rage were like acid inside him  but they had no words to get out .  if he were stuart  big mouth  white hands stuart  he could talk and talk and maybe feel better .  instead  he had to sit there with half of him dead  with no brother  no aristides   it had happened so quickly .  if he could only go back and have one second more warning  so that he might snatch aristides  hold him  save him .   but mostly he hated the kloros .  two months ago  he had hardly ever heard of them  and now he hated them so hard  he would be glad to die if he could kill a few .   he said  without looking up   what happened to start this war  eh .    he was afraid stuart s voice would answer .  he hated stuart s voice .  but it was windham  the bald one .   windham said   the immediate cause  sir  was a dispute over mining concessions in the wyandotte system .  the kloros had poached on earth property .     room for both  colonel .    polyorketes looked up at that  snarling .  stuart could not be kept quiet for long .  he was speaking again  the cripple hand  wiseguy  kloros lover .   stuart was saying   is that anything to fight over  colonel .  we can t use one another s worlds .  their chlorine planets are useless to us and our oxygen ones are useless to them .  chlorine is deadly to us and oxygen is deadly to them .  there s no way we could maintain permanent hostility .  our races just  don t coincide .  is there reason to fight then because both races want to dig iron out of the same airless planetoids when there are millions like them in the galaxy .    windham said   there is the question of planetary honor     planetary fertilizer .  how can it excuse a ridiculous war like this one .  it can only be fought on outposts .  it has to come down to a series of holding actions and eventually be settled by negotiations that might just as easily have been worked out in the first place .  neither we nor the kloros will gain a thing .    grudgingly  polyorketes found that he agreed with stuart .  what did he and aristides care where earth or the kloros got their iron .   was that something for aristides to die over .   the little warning buzzer sounded .   polyorketes  head shot up and he rose slowly  his lips drawing back .  only one thing could be at the door .  he waited  arms tense  fists balled .  stuart was edging toward him .  polyorketes saw that and laughed to himself .  let the kloro come in  and stuart  along with all the rest  could not stop him .   wait  aristides  wait just a moment  and a fraction of revenge will be paid back .   the door opened and a figure entered  completely swathed in a shapeless  billowing travesty of a spacesuit .   an odd  unnatural  but not entirely unpleasant voice began   it is with some misgivings  earthmen  that my companion and myself    it ended abruptly as polyorketes  with a roar  charged once again .  there was no science in the lunge .  it was sheer bull momentum .  dark head low  burly arms spread out with the hair tufted fingers in choking position  he clumped on .  stuart was whirled to one side before he had a chance to intervene  and was spun tumbling across a cot .   the kloro might have  without undue exertion  straight armed polyorketes to a halt  or stepped aside  allowing the whirlwind to pass .  he did neither .  with a rapid movement  a hand weapon was up and a gentle pinkish line of radiance connected it with the plunging earthman .  polyorketes stumbled and crashed down  his body maintaining its last curved position  one foot raised  as though a lightning paralysis had taken place .  it toppled to one side and he lay there  eyes all alive and wild with rage .   the kloro said   he is not permanently hurt .   he seemed not to resent the offered violence .  then he began again   it is with some misgiving  earthmen  that my companion and myself were made aware of a certain commotion in this room .  are you in any need which we can satisfy .    stuart was angrily nursing his knee which he had scraped in colliding with the cot .  he said   no  thank you  kloro .     now  look here   puffed windham   this is a dashed outrage .  we demand that our release be arranged .    the kloro s tiny  insectlike head turned in the fat old man s direction .  he  was not a pleasant sight to anyone unused to him .  he was about the height of an earthman  but the top of him consisted of a thin stalk of a neck with a head that was the merest swelling .  it consisted of a blunt triangular proboscis in front and two bulging eyes on either side .  that was all .  there was no brain pan and no brain .  what corresponded to the brain in a kloro was located in what would be an earthly abdomen  leaving the head as a mere sensory organ .  the kloro s spacesuit followed the outlines of the head more or less faithfully  the two eyes being exposed by two clear semicircles of glass  which looked faintly green because of the chlorine atmosphere inside .   one of the eyes was now cocked squarely at windham  who quivered uncomfortably under the glance  but insisted   you have no right to hold us prisoner .  we are noncombatants .    the kloro s voice  sounding thoroughly artificial  came from a small attachment of chromium mesh on what served as its chest .  the voice box was manipulated by compressed air under the control of one or two of the many delicate  forked tendrils that radiated from two circles about its upper body and were  mercifully enough  hidden by the suit .   the voice said   are you serious  earthman .  surely you have heard of war and rules of war and prisoners of war .    it looked about  shifting eyes with quick jerks of its head  staring at a particular object first with one  then with another .  it was stuart s understanding that each eye transferred a separate message to the abdominal brain  which had to coordinate the two to obtain full information .   windham had nothing to say .  no one had .  the kloro  its four main limbs  roughly arms and legs in pairs  had a vaguely human appearance under the masking of the suit  if you looked no higher than its chest  but there was no way of telling what it felt .   they watched it turn and leave .   porter coughed and said in a strangled voice   god  smell that chlorine .  if they don t do something  we ll all die of rotted lungs .    stuart said   shut up .  there isn t enough chlorine in the air to make a mosquito sneeze  and what there is will be swept out in two minutes .  besides  a little chlorine is good for you .  it may kill your cold virus .    windham coughed and said   stuart  i feel that you might have said something to your kloro friend about releasing us .  you are scarcely as bold in their presence  dash it  as you are once they are gone .     you heard what the creature said  colonel .  we re prisoners of war  and prisoner exchanges are negotiated by diplomats .  we ll just have to wait .    leblanc  who had turned pasty white at the entrance of the kloro  rose and hurried into the privy .  there was the sound of retching .   an uncomfortable silence fell while stuart tried to think of something to say to cover the unpleasant sound .  mullen filled in .  he had rummaged through a little box he had taken from under his pillow .   he said   perhaps mr .  leblanc had better take a sedative before retiring .  i have a few .  i d be glad to give him one .   he explained his generosity immediately   otherwise he may keep the rest of us awake  you see .     very logical   said stuart  dryly .   you d better save one for sir launcelot here  save half a dozen .   he walked to where polyorketes still sprawled and knelt at his side .   comfortable  baby .    windham said   deuced poor taste speaking like that  stuart .     well  if you re so concerned about him  why don t you and porter hoist him onto his cot .    he helped them do so .  polyorketes  arms were trembling erratically now .  from what stuart knew of the kloro s nerve weapons  the man should be in an agony of pins and needles about now .   stuart said   and don t be too gentle with him  either .  the damned fool might have gotten us all killed .  and for what .    he pushed polyorketes  stiff carcass to one side and sat at the edge of the cot .  he said   can you hear me  polyorketes .    polyorketes  eyes gleamed .  an arm lifted abortively and fell back .    okay then  listen .  don t try anything like that again .  the next time it may be the finish for all of us .  if you had been a kloro and he had been an earthman  we d be dead now .  so just get one thing through your skull .  we re sorry about your brother and it s a rotten shame  but it was his own fault .    polyorketes tried to heave and stuart pushed him back .    no  you keep on listening   he said .   maybe this is the only time i ll get to talk to you when you have to listen .  your brother had no right leaving passenger s quarters .  there was no place for him to go .  he just got in the way of our own men .  we don t even know for certain that it was a kloro gun that killed him .  it might have been one of our own .     oh  i say  stuart   objected windham .   stuart whirled at him .   do you have proof it wasn t .  did you see the shot .  could you tell from what was left of the body whether it was kloro energy or earth energy .    polyorketes found his voice  driving his unwilling tongue into a fuzzy verbal snarl .   damned stinking greenie bastard .     me .   said stuart .   i know what s going on in your mind  polyorketes .  you think that  when the paralysis wears off  you ll ease your feelings by slamming me around .  well  if you do  it will probably be curtains for all of us .    he rose  put his back against the wall .  for the moment  he was fighting all of them .   none of you know the kloros the way i do .  the physical differences you see are not important .  the differences in their temperament are .  they don t understand our views on sex  for instance .  to them  it s just a biological reflex like breathing .  they attach no importance to it .  but they do attach importance to social groupings .  remember  their evolutionary  ancestors had lots in common with our insects .  they always assume that any group of earthmen they find together makes up a social unit .    that means just about everything to them .  i don t understand exactly what it means .  no earthman can .  but the result is that they never break up a group  just as we don t separate a mother and her children if we can help it .  one of the reasons they may be treating us with kid gloves right now is that they imagine we re all broken up over the fact that they killed one of us  and they feel guilt about it .    but this is what you ll have to remember .  we re going to be interned together and kept together for duration .  i don t like the thought .  i wouldn t have picked any of you for co internees and i m pretty sure none of you would have picked me .  but there it is .  the kloros could never understand that our being together on the ship is only accidental .    that means we ve got to get along somehow .  that s not just goodie goodie talk about birds in their little nest agreeing .  what do you think would have happened if the kloros had come in earlier and found poly orketes and myself trying to kill each other .  you don t know .  well  what do you suppose you would think of a mother you caught trying to kill her children .    that s it  then .  they would have killed every one of us as a bunch of kloro type perverts and monsters .  got that .  how about you  polyorketes .  have you got it .  so let s call names if we have to  but let s keep our hands to ourselves .  and now  if none of you mind  i ll massage my hands back into shape these synthetic hands that i got from the kloros and that one of my own kind tried to mangle again .    for claude leblanc  the worst was over .  he had been sick enough  sick with many things  but sick most of all over having ever left earth .  it had been a great thing to go to college off earth .  it had been an adventure and had taken him away from his mother .  somehow  he had been sneakingly glad to make that escape after the first month of frightened adjustment .   and then on the summer holidays  he had been no longer claude  the shy spoken scholar  but leblanc  space traveler .  he had swaggered the fact for all it was worth .  it made him feel such a man to talk of stars and jumps and the customs and environments of other worlds  it had given him corkage with margaret .  she had loved him for the dangers he had undergone   except that this had been the first one  really  and he had not done so well .  he knew it and was ashamed and wished he were like stuart .   he used the excuse of mealtime to approach .  he said   mr .  stuart .    stuart looked up and said shortly   how do you feel .    leblanc felt himself blush .  he blushed easily and the effort not to blush only made it worse .  he said   much better  thank you .  we are eating .  i thought i d bring you your ration    stuart took the offered can  it was standard space ration  thoroughly  synthetic  concentrated  nourishing and  somehow  unsatisfying .  it heated automatically when the can was opened  but could be eaten cold  if necessary .  though a combined fork spoon utensil was enclosed  the ration was of a consistency that made the use of fingers practical and not particularly messy .   stuart said   did you hear my little speech .     yes  sir .  i want you to know you can count on me .     well  good .  now go and eat .     may i eat here .     suit yourself .    for a moment  they ate in silence  and then leblanc burst out   you are so sure of yourself  mr .  stuart .  it must be very wonderful to be like that .     sure of myself .  thanks  but there s your self assured one .    leblanc followed the direction of the nod in surprise .   mr .  mullen .  that little man .  oh  no .     you don t think he s self assured .    leblanc shook his head .  he looked at stuart intently to see if he could detect humor in his expression .   that one is just cold .  he has no emotion in him .  he s like a little machine .  i find him repulsive .  you re different  mr .  stuart .  you have it all inside  but you control it .  i would like to be like that .    and as though attracted by the magnetism of the mention  even though unheard  of his name  mullen joined them .  his can of ration was barely touched .  it was still steaming gently as he squatted opposite them .   his voice had its usual quality of furtively rustling underbrush .   how long  mr .  stuart  do you think the trip will take .     can t say  mullen .  they ll undoubtedly be avoiding the usual trade routes and they ll be making more jumps through hyper space than usual to throw off possible pursuit .  i wouldn t be surprised if it took as long as a week .  why do you ask .  i presume you have a very practical and logical reason .     why  yes .  certainly .   he seemed quite shellbacked to sarcasm .  he said   it occurred to me that it might be wise to ration the rations  so to speak .     we ve got enough food and water for a month .  i checked on that first thing .     i see .  in that case  i will finish the can .   he did  using the all purpose utensil daintily and patting a handkerchief against his unstained lips from time to time .   polyorketes struggled to his feet some two hours later .  he swayed a bit  looking like the spirit of hangover .  he did not try to come closer to stuart  but spoke from where he stood .   he said   you stinking greenie spy  you watch yourself .     you heard what i said before  polyorketes .     i heard .  but i also heard what you said about aristides .  i won t bother  with you  because you re a bag of nothing but noisy air .  but wait  someday you ll blow your air in one face too many and it will be let out of you .     i ll wait   said stuart .   windham hobbled over  leaning heavily on his cane .   now  now   he called with a wheezing joviality that overkid his sweating anxiety so thinly as to emphasize it .   we re all earthmen  dash it .  got to remember that  keep it as a glowing light of inspiration .  never let down before the blasted kloros .  we ve got to forget private feuds and remember only that we are earthmen united against alien blighters .    stuart s comment was unprintable .   porter was right behind windham .  he had been in a close conference with the shaven headed colonel for an hour  and now he said with indignation   it doesn t help to be a wiseguy  stuart .  you listen to the colonel .  we ve been doing some hard thinking about the situation .    he had washed some of the grease off his face  wet his hair and slicked it back .  it did not remove the little tic on his right cheek just at the point where his lips ended  or make his hangnail hands more attractive in appearance .    all right  colonel   said stuart .   what s on your mind .    windham said   i d prefer to have all the men together .     okay  call them .    leblanc hurried over  mullen approached with greater deliberation .   stuart said   you want that fellow .   he jerked his head at polyorketes .    why  yes .  mr .  polyorketes  may we have you  old fella .     ah  leave me alone .     go ahead   said stuart   leave him alone .  i don t want him .     no  no   said windham .   this is a matter for all earthmen .  mr .  polyorketes  we must have you .    polyorketes rolled off one side of his cot .   i m close enough  i can hear you .    windham said to stuart   would they the kloros  i mean have this room wired .     no   said stuart .   why should they .     are you sure .     of course i m sure .  they didn t know what happened when polyorketes jumped me .  they just heard the thumping when it started rattling the ship .     maybe they were trying to give us the impression the room wasn t wired .     listen  colonel  i ve never known a kloro to tell a deliberate lie    polyorketes interrupted calmly   that lump of noise just loves the kloros .    windham said hastily   let s not begin that .  look  stuart  porter and i  have been discussing matters and we have decided that you know the kloros well enough to think of some way of getting us back to earth .     it happens that you re wrong .  i can t think of any way .     maybe there is some way we can take the ship back from the blasted green fellas   suggested windham .   some weakness they may have .  dash it  you know what i mean .     tell me  colonel  what are you after .  your own skin or earth s welfare .     i resent that question .  i ll have you know that while i m as careful of my own life as anyone has a right to be  i m thinking of earth primarily .  and i think that s true of all of us .     damn right   said porter  instantly .  leblanc looked anxious  polyorketes resentful  and mullen had no expression at all .    good   said stuart .   of course  i don t think we can take the ship .  they re armed and we aren t .  but there s this .  you know why the kloros took this ship intact .  it s because they need ships .  they may be better chemists than earthmen are  but earthmen are better astronautical engineers .  we have bigger  better and more ships .  in fact  if our crew had had a proper respect for military axioms in the first place  they would have blown the ship up as soon as it looked as though the kloros were going to board .    leblanc looked horrified .   and kill the passengers .     why not .  you heard what the good colonel said .  every one of us puts his own lousy little life after earth s interests .  what good are we to earth alive right now .  none at all .  what harm will this ship do in kloro hands .  a hell of a lot  probably .     just why   asked mullen   did our men refuse to blow up the ship .  they must have had a reason .     they did .  it s the firmest tradition of earth s military men that there must never be an unfavorable ratio of casualties .  if we had blown ourselves up  twenty fighting men and seven civilians of earth would be dead as compared with an enemy casualty total of zero .  so what happens .  we let them board  kill twenty eight i m sure we killed at least that many and let them have the ship .     talk  talk  talk   jeered polyorketes .    there s a moral to this   said stuart .   we can t take the ship away from the kloros .  we might be able to rush them  though  and keep them busy long enough to allow one of us enough time to short the engines .     what .   yelled porter  and windham shushed him in fright .    short the engines   stuart repeated .   that would destroy the ship  of course  which is what we want to do  isn t it .    leblanc s lips were white .   i don t think that would work .     we can t be sure till we try .  but what have we to lose by trying .     our lives  damn it .   cried porter .   you insane maniac  you re crazy .     if i m a maniac   said stuart   and insane to boot  then naturally i m crazy .  but just remember that if we lose our lives  which is overwhelmingly  probable  we lose nothing of value to earth  whereas if we destroy the ship  as we just barely might  we do earth a lot of good .  what patriot would hesitate .  who here would put himself ahead of his world .   he looked about in the silence .   surely not you  colonel windham .    windham coughed tremendously .   my dear man  that is not the question .  there must be a way to save the ship for earth without losing our lives  eh .     all right .  you name it .     let s all think about it .  now there are only two of the kloros aboard ship .  if one of us could sneak up on them and     how .  the rest of the ship s all filled with chlorine .  we d have to wear a spacesuit .  gravity in their part of the ship is hopped up to kloro level  so whoever is patsy in the deal would be clumping around  metal on metal  slow and heavy .  oh  he could sneak up on them  sure like a skunk trying to sneak downwind .     then we ll drop it all   porter s voice shook .   listen  windham  there s not going to be any destroying the ship .  my life means plenty to me and if any of you try anything like that  i ll call the kloros .  i mean it .     well   said stuart   there s hero number one .    leblanc said   i want to go back to earth  but i    mullen interrupted   i don t think our chances of destroying the ship are good enough unless     heroes number two and three .  what about you  polyorketes  you would have the chance of killing two kloros .     i want to kill them with my bare hands   growled the farmer  his heavy fists writhing .   on their planet  i will kill dozens .     that s a nice safe promise for now .  what about you  colonel .  don t you want to march to death and glory with me .     your attitude is very cynical and unbecoming  stuart .  it s obvious that if the rest are unwilling  then your plan will fall through .     unless i do it myself  huh .     you won t  do you hear .   said porter  instantly .    damn right i won t   agreed stuart .   i don t claim to be a hero .  i m just an average patriot  perfectly willing to head for any planet they take me to and sit out the war .    mullen said  thoughtfully   of course  there is a way we could surprise the kloros .    the statement would have dropped flat except for polyorketes .  he pointed a black nailed  stubby forefinger and laughed harshly .   mr .  bookkeeper .   he said .   mr .  bookkeeper is a big shot talker like this damned greenie spy  stuart .  all right  mr .  bookkeeper  go ahead .  you make big speeches also .  let the words roll like an empty barrel .    he turned to stuart and repeated venomously   empty barrel .  cripple hand empty barrel .  no good for anything but talk .    mullen s soft voice could make no headway until polyorketes was through  but then he said  speaking directly to stuart   we might be able to reach them from outside .  this room has a c chute i m sure .     what s a c chute .   asked leblanc .    well   began mullen  and then stopped  at a loss .   stuart said  mockingly   it s a euphemism  my boy .  its full name is  casualty chute .   it doesn t get talked about  but the main rooms on any ship would have them .  they re just little airlocks down which you slide a corpse .  burial at space .  always lots of sentiment and bowed heads  with the captain making a rolling speech of the type polyorketes here wouldn t like .    leblanc s face twisted .   use that to leave the ship .     why not .  superstitious .   go on  mullen .    the little man had waited patiently .  he said   once outside  one could re enter the ship by the steam tubes .  it can be done with luck .  and then you would be an unexpected visitor in the control room .    stuart stared at him curiously .   how do you figure this out .  what do you know about steam tubes .    mullen coughed .   you mean because i m in the paper box business .  well   he grew pink  waited a moment  then made a new start in a colorless  unemotional voice .   my company  which manufactures fancy paper boxes and novelty containers  made a line of spaceship candy boxes for the juvenile trade some years ago .  it was designed so that if a string were pulled  small pressure containers were punctured and jets of compressed air shot out through the mock steam tubes  sailing the box across the room and scattering candy as it went .  the sales theory was that the youngsters would find it exciting to play with the ship and fun to scramble for the candy .    actually  it was a complete failure .  the ship would break dishes and sometimes hit another child in the eye .  worse still  the children would not only scramble for the candy but would fight over it .  it was almost our worst failure .  we lost thousands .    still  while the boxes were being designed  the entire office was extremely interested .  it was like a game  very bad for efficiency and office morale .  for a while  we all became steam tube experts .  i read quite a few books on ship construction .  on my own time  however  not the company s .    stuart was intrigued .  he said   you know it s a video sort of idea  but it might work if we had a hero to spare .  have we .     what about you .   demanded porter  indignantly .   you go around sneering at us with your cheap wisecracks .  i don t notice you volunteering for anything .     that s because i m no hero  porter .  i admit it .  my object is to stay alive  and shinnying down steam tubes is no way to go about staying alive .  but the  rest of you are noble patriots .  the colonel says so .  what about you  colonel .  you re the senior hero here .    windham said   if i were younger  blast it  and if you had your hands  i would take pleasure  sir  in trouncing you soundly .     i ve no doubt of it  but that s no answer .     you know very well that at my time of life and with my leg   he brought the flat of his hand down upon his stiff knee   i am in no position to do anything of the sort  however much i should wish to .     ah  yes   said stuart   and i  myself  am crippled in the hands  as pory orketes tells me .  that saves us .  and what unfortunate deformities do the rest of us have .     listen   cried porter   i want to know what this is all about .  how can anyone go down the steam tubes .  what if the kloros use them while one of us is inside .     why  porter  that s part of the sporting chance .  it s where the excitement comes in .     but he d be boiled in the shell like a lobster .     a pretty image  but inaccurate .  the steam wouldn t be on for more than a very short time  maybe a second or two  and the suit insulation would hold that long .  besides  the jet comes scooting out at several hundred miles a minute  so that you would be blown clear of the ship before the steam could even warm you .  in fact  you d be blown quite a few miles out into space  and after that you would be quite safe from the kloros .  of course  you couldn t get back to the ship .    porter was sweating freely .   you don t scare me for one minute  stuart .     i don t .  then you re offering to go .  are you sure you ve thought out what being stranded in space means .  you re all alone  you know  really all alone .  the steam jet will probably leave you turning or tumbling pretty rapidly .  you won t feel that .  you ll seem to be motionless .  but all the stars will be going around and around so that they re just streaks in the sky .  they won t ever stop .  they won f even slow up .  then your heater will go off  your oxygen will give out  and you will die very slowly .  you ll have lots of time to think .  or  if you are in a hurry  you could open your suit .  that wouldn t be pleasant  either .  i ve seen faces of men who had a torn suit happen to them accidentally  and it s pretty awful .  but it would be quicker .  then    porter turned and walked unsteadily away .   stuart said  lightly   another failure .  one act of heroism still ready to be knocked down to the highest bidder with nothing offered yet .    polyorketes spoke up and his harsh voice roughed the words .   you keep on talking  mr .  big mouth .  you just keep banging that empty barrel .  pretty soon  we ll kick your teeth in .  there s one boy i think would be willing to do it now  eh  mr .  porter .    porter s look at stuart confirmed the truth of polyorketes  remarks  but he said nothing .   i i stuart said   then what about you  polyorketes .  you re the barehand man with guts .  want me to help you into a suit .       i ll ask you when i want help .      what about you  leblanc .    the young man shrank away .    not even to get back to margaret .    but leblanc could only shake his head .    mullen .     well i ll try .     you ll what .     i said  yes  i ll try .  after all  it s my idea .    stuart looked stunned .   you re serious .  how come .    mullen s prim mouth pursed .   because no one else will .     but that s no reason .  especially for you .    mullen shrugged .   there was a thump of a cane behind stuart .  windham brushed past .   he said   do you really intend to go  mullen .     yes  colonel .     in that case  dash it  let me shake your hand .  i like you .  you re an an earthman  by heaven .  do this  and win or die  i ll bear witness for you .    mullen withdrew his hand awkwardly from the deep and vibrating grasp of the other .   and stuart just stood there .  he was in a very unusual position .  he was  in fact  in the particular position of all positions in which he most rarely found himself .   he had nothing to say .   the quality of tension had changed .  the gloom and frustration had lifted a bit  and the excitement of conspiracy had replaced it .  even polyorketes was fingering the spacesuits and commenting briefly and hoarsely on which he considered preferable .   mullen was having a certain amount of trouble .  the suit hung rather limply upon him even though the adjustable joints had been tightened nearly to minimum .  he stood there now with only the helmet to be screwed on .  he wiggled his neck .   stuart was holding the helmet with an effort .  it was heavy  and his ar tiplasmic hands did not grip it well .  he said   better scratch your nose if it itches .  it s your last chance for a while .   he didn t add   maybe forever   but he thought it .   mullen said  tonelessly   i think perhaps i had better have a spare oxygen cylinder .     good enough .     with a reducing valve .    stuart nodded .   i see what you re thinking of .  if you do get blown clear  of the ship  you could try to blow yourself back by using the cylinder as an action reaction motor .    they clamped on the headpiece and buckled the spare cylinder to mul len s waist .  polyorketes and leblanc lifted him up to the yawning opening of the c tube .  it was ominously dark inside  the metal lining of the interior having been painted a mournful black .  stuart thought he could detect a musty odor about it  but that  he knew  was only imagination .   he stopped the proceedings when mullen was half within the tube .  he tapped upon the little man s faceplate .    can you hear me .    within  there was a nod .    air coming through all right .  no last minute troubles .    mullen lifted his armored arm in a gesture of reassurance .    then remember  don t use the suit radio out there .  the kloros might pick up the signals .    reluctantly  he stepped away .  polyorketes  brawny hands lowered mullen until they could hear the thumping sound made by the steel shod feet against the outer valve .  the inner valve then swung shut with a dreadful finality  its beveled silicone gasket making a slight soughing noise as it crushed hard .  they clamped it into place .   stuart stood at the toggle switch that controlled the outer valve .  he threw it and the gauge that marked the air pressure within the tube fell to zero .  a little pinpoint of red light warned that the outer valve was open .  then the light disappeared  the valve closed  and the gauge climbed slowly to fifteen pounds again .   they opened the inner valve again and found the tube empty .   polyorketes spoke first .  he said   the little son of a gun .  he went .   he looked wonderingly at the others .   a little fellow with guts like that .    stuart said   look  we d better get ready in here .  there s just a chance that the kloros may have detected the valves opening and closing .  if so  they ll be here to investigate and we ll have to cover up .     how .   asked windham .    they won t see mullen anywhere around .  we ll say he s in the head .  the kloros know that it s one of the peculiar characteristics of earthmen that they resent intrusion on their privacy in lavatories  and they ll make no effort to check .  if we can hold them off     what if they wait  or if they check the spacesuits .   asked porter .   stuart shrugged .   let s hope they don t .  and listen  polyorketes  don t make any fuss when they come in .    polyorketes grunted   with that little guy out there .  what do you think i am .   he stared at stuart without animosity  then scratched his curly hair vigorously .   you know  i laughed at him .  i thought he was an old woman .  it makes me ashamed .    stuart cleared his throat .  he said   look  i ve been saying some things  that maybe weren t too funny after all  now that i come to think of it .  i d like to say i m sorry if i have .    he turned away morosely and walked toward his cot .  he heard the steps behind him  felt the touch on his sleeve .  he turned  it was leblanc .   the youngster said softly   i keep thinking that mr .  mullen is an old man .     well  he s not a kid .  he s about forty five or fifty  i think .    leblanc said   do you think  mr .  stuart  that   should have gone  instead .  i m the youngest here .  i don t like the thought of having let an old man go in my place .  it makes me feel like the devil .     i know .  if he dies  it will be too bad .     but he volunteered .  we didn t make him  did we .     don t try to dodge responsibility  leblanc .  it won t make you feel better .  there isn t one of us without a stronger motive to run the risk than he had .   and stuart sat there silently  thinking .   mullen felt the obstruction beneath his feet yield and the walls about him slip away quickly  too quickly .  he knew it was the puff of air escaping  carrying him with it  and he dug arms and legs frantically against the wall to brake himself .  corpses were supposed to be flung well clear of the ship  but he was no corpse for the moment .   his feet swung free and threshed .  he heard the clunk of one magnetic boot against the hull just as the rest of his body puffed out like a tight cork under air pressure .  he teetered dangerously at the lip of the hole in the ship  he had changed orientation suddenly and was looking down on it then took a step backward as its lid came down of itself and fitted smoothly against the hull .   a feeling of unreality overwhelmed him .  surely  it wasn t he standing on the outer surface of a ship .  not randolph f .  mullen .  so few human beings could ever say they had  even those who traveled in space constantly .   he was only gradually aware that he was in pain .  popping out of that hole with one foot clamped to the hull had nearly bent him in two .  he tried moving  cautiously  and found his motions to be erratic and almost impossible to control .  he thought nothing was broken  though the muscles of his left side were badly wrenched .   and then he came to himself and noticed that the wrist lights of his suit were on .  it was by their light that he had stared into the blackness of the c chute .  he stirred with the nervous thought that from within  the kloros might see the twin spots of moving light just outside the hull .  he flicked the switch upon the suit s midsection .   mullen had never imagined that  standing on a ship  he would fail to see its hull .  but it was dark  as dark below as above .  there were the stars  hard and bright little non dimensional dots .  nothing more .  nothing more anywhere .  under his feet  not even the stars not even his feet .   he bent back to look at the stars .  his head swam .  they were moving slowly .  or  rather  they were standing still and the ship was rotating  but he could not tell his eyes that .  they moved .  his eyes followed down and behind the ship .  new stars up and above from the other side .  a black horizon .  the ship existed only as a region where there were no stars .   no stars .  why  there was one almost at his feet .  he nearly reached for it  then he realized that it was only a glittering reflection in the mirroring metal .   they were moving thousands of miles an hour .  the stars were .  the ship was .  he was .  but it meant nothing .  to his senses  there was only silence and darkness and that slow wheeling of the stars .  his eyes followed the wheeling   and his head in its helmet hit the ship s hull with a soft bell like ring .   he felt about in panic with his thick  insensitive  spun silicate gloves .  his feet were still firmly magnetized to the hull  that was true  but the rest of his body bent backward at the knees in a right angle .  there was no gravity outside the ship .  if he bent back  there was nothing to pull the upper part of his body down and tell his joints they were bending .  his body stayed as he put it .   he pressed wildly against the hull and his torso shot upward and refused to stop when upright .  he fell forward .   he tried more slowly  balancing with both hands against the hull  until he squatted evenly .  then upward .  very slowly .  straight up .  arms out to balance .   he was straight now  aware of his nausea and lightheadedness .   he looked about .  my god  where were the steam tubes .  he couldn t see them .  they were black on black  nothing on nothing .   quickly  he turned on the wrist lights .  in space  there were no beams  only elliptical  sharply defined spots of blue steel  winking light back at him .  where they struck a rivet  a shadow was cast  knife sharp and as black as space  the lighted region illuminated abruptly and without diffusion .   he moved his arms  his body swaying gently in the opposite direction  action and reaction .  the vision of a steam tube with its smooth cylindrical sides sprang at him .   he tried to move toward it .  his foot held firmly to the hull .  he pulled and it slogged upward  straining against quicksand that eased quickly .  three inches up and it had almost sucked free  six inches up and he thought it would fly away .   he advanced it and let it down  felt it enter the quicksand .  when the sole was within two inches of the hull  it snapped down  out of control  hitting the hull ringingly .  his spacesuit carried the vibrations  amplifying them in his ears .   he stopped in absolute terror .  the dehydrators that dried the atmosphere  within his suit could not handle the sudden gush of perspiration that drenched his forehead and armpits .   he waited  then tried lifting his foot again a bare inch  holding it there by main force and moving it horizontally .  horizontal motion involved no effort at all  it was motion perpendicular to the lines of magnetic force .  but he had to keep the foot from snapping down as he did so  and then lower it slowly .   he puffed with the effort .  each step was agony .  the tendons of his knees were cracking  and there were knives in his side .   mullen stopped to let the perspiration dry .  it wouldn t do to steam up the inside of his faceplate .  he flashed his wrist lights  and the steam cylinder was right ahead .   the ship had four of them  at ninety degree intervals  thrusting out at an angle from the midgirdle .  they were the  fine adjustment  of the ship s course .  the coarse adjustment was the powerful thrusters back and front which fixed final velocity by their accelerative and the decelerative force  and the hyperatomics that took care of the space swallowing jumps .   but occasionally the direction of flight had to be adjusted slightly and then the steam cylinders took over .  singly  they could drive the ship up  down  right  left .  by twos  in appropriate ratios of thrust  the ship could be turned in any desired direction .   the device had been unimproved in centuries  being too simple to improve .  the atomic pile heated the water content of a closed container into steam  driving it  in less than a second  up to temperatures where it would have broken down into a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen  and then into a mixture of electrons and ions .  perhaps the breakdown actually took place .  no one ever bothered testing  it worked  so there was no need to .   at the critical point  a needle valve gave way and the steam thrust madly out in a short but incredible blast .  and the ship  inevitably and majestically  moved in the opposite direction  veering about its own center of gravity .  when the degrees of turn were sufficient  an equal and opposite blast would take place and the turning would be canceled .  the ship would be moving at its original velocity  but in a new direction .   mullen had dragged himself out to the lip of the steam cylinder .  he had a picture of himself   small speck teetering at the extreme end of a structure thrusting out of an ovoid that was tearing through space at ten thousand miles an hour .   but there was no air stream to whip him off the hull  and his magnetic soles held him more firmly than he liked .   with lights on  he bent down to peer into the tube and the ship dropped down precipitously as his orientation changed .  he reached out to steady himself  but he was not falling .  there was no up or down in space except for what his confused mind chose to consider up or down .   the cylinder was just large enough to hold a man  so that it might be  entered for repair purposes .  his light caught the rungs almost directly opposite his position at the lip .  he puffed a sigh of relief with what breath he could muster .  some ships didn t have ladders .   he made his way to it  the ship appearing to slip and twist beneath him as he moved .  he lifted an arm over the lip of the tube  feeling for the rung  loosened each foot  and drew himself within .   the knot in his stomach that had been there from the first was a convulsed agony now .  if they should choose to manipulate the ship  if the steam should whistle out now   he would never hear it  never know it .  one instant he would be holding a rung  feeling slowly for the next with a groping arm .  the next moment he would be alone in space  the ship a dark  dark nothingness lost forever among the stars .  there would be  perhaps  a brief glory of swirling ice crystals drifting with him  shining in his wrist lights and slowly approaching and rotating about him  attracted by his mass like infinitesimal planets to an absurdly tiny sun .   he was trickling sweat again  and now he was also conscious of thirst .  he put it out of his mind .  there would be no drinking until he was out of his suit if ever .   up a rung  up another  and another .  how many were there .  his hand slipped and he stared in disbelief at the glitter that showed under his light .   ice .   why not .  the steam  incredibly hot as it was  would strike metal that was at nearly absolute zero .  in the few split seconds of thrust  there would not be time for the metal to warm above the freezing point of water .  a sheet of ice would condense that would sublime slowly into the vacuum .  it was the speed of all that happened that prevented the fusion of the tubes and of the original water container itself .   his groping hand reached the end .  again the wrist lights .  he stared with crawling horror at the steam nozzle  half an inch in diameter .  it looked dead  harmless .  but it always would  right up to the micro second before   around it was the outer steam lock .  it pivoted on a central hub that was springed on the portion toward space  screwed on the part toward the ship .  the springs allowed it to give under the first wild thrust of steam pressure before the ship s mighty inertia could be overcome .  the steam was bled into the inner chamber  breaking the force of the thrust  leaving the total energy unchanged  but spreading it over time so that the hull itself was in that much less danger of being staved in .   mullen braced himself firmly against a rung and pressed against the outer lock so that it gave a little .  it was stiff  but it didn t have to give much  just enough to catch on the screw .  he felt it catch .   he strained against it and turned it  feeling his body twist in the opposite direction .  it held tight  the screw taking up the strain as he carefully ad   justed the small control switch that allowed the springs to fall free .  how well he remembered the books he had read .   he was in the interlock space now  which was large enough to hold a man comfortably  again for convenience in repairs .  he could no longer be blown away from the ship .  if the steam blast were turned on now  it would merely drive him against the inner lock hard enough to crush him to a pulp .  a quick death he would never feel  at least .   slowly  he unhooked his spare oxygen cylinder .  there was only an inner lock between himself and the control room now .  this lock opened outward into space so that the steam blast could only close it tighter  rather than blow it open .  and it fitted tightly and smoothly .  there was absolutely no way to open it from without .   he lifted himself above the lock  forcing his bent back against the inner surface of the interlock area .  it made breathing difficult .  the spare oxygen cylinder dangled at a queer angle .  he held its metal mesh hose and straightened it  forcing it against the inner lock so that vibration thudded .  again  again   it would have to attract the attention of the kloros .  they would have to investigate .   he would have no way of telling when they were about to do so .  ordinarily  they would first let air into the interlock to force the outer lock shut .      but now the outer lock was on the central screw  well away from its rim .  air would suck about it ineffectually  dragging out into space .   mullen kept on thumping .  would the kloros look at the air gauge  note that it scarcely lifted from zero  or would they take its proper working for granted .   porter said   he s been gone an hour and a half .     i know   said stuart .   they were all restless  jumpy  but the tension among themselves had disappeared .  it was as though all the threads of emotion extended to the hull of the ship .   porter was bothered .  his philosophy of life had always been simple take care of yourself because no one will take care of you for you .  it upset him to see it shaken .   he said   do you suppose they ve caught him .     if they had  we d hear about it   replied stuart  briefly .   porter felt  with a miserable twinge  that there was little interest on the part of the others in speaking to him .  he could understand it  he had not exactly earned their respect .  for the moment  a torrent of self excuse poured     through his mind .  the others had been frightened  too .  a man had a right to be afraid .  no one likes to die .  at least  he hadn t broken like aristides polyorketes .  he hadn t wept like leblanc .  he  but there was mullen  out there on the hull .        listen   he cried   why did he do it .   they turned to look at him  not understanding  but porter didn t care .  it bothered him to the point where it had to come out .   i want to know why mullen is risking his life .     the man   said windham   is a patriot     no  none of that .   porter was almost hysterical .   that little fellow has no emotions at all .  he just has reasons and i want to know what those reasons are  because    he didn t finish the sentence .  could he say that if those reasons applied to a little middle aged bookkeeper  they might apply even more forcibly to himself .   polyorketes said   he s one brave damn little fellow .    porter got to his feet .   listen    he said   he may be stuck out there .  whatever he s doing  he may not be able to finish it alone .  i i volunteer to go out after him .    he was shaking as he said it and he waited in fear for the sarcastic lash of stuart s tongue .  stuart was staring at him  probably with surprise  but porter dared not meet his eyes to make certain .   stuart said  mildly   let s give him another half hour .    porter looked up  startled .  there was no sneer on stuart s face .  it was even friendly .  they all looked friendly .   he said   and then     and then all those who do volunteer will draw straws or something equally democratic .  who volunteers  besides porter .    they all raised their hands  stuart did  too .   but porter was happy .  he had volunteered first .  he was anxious for the half hour to pass .   it caught mullen by surprise .  the outer lock flew open and the long  thin  snakelike  almost headless neck of a kloro sucked out  unable to fight the blast of escaping air .   mullen s cylinder flew away  almost tore free .  after one wild moment of frozen panic  he fought for it  dragging it above the airstream  waiting as long as he dared to let the first fury die down as the air of the control room thinned out  then bringing it down with force .   it caught the sinewy neck squarely  crushing it .  mullen  curled above the lock  almost entirely protected from the stream  raised the cylinder again and plunging it down again striking the head  mashing the staring eyes to liquid ruin .  in the near vacuum  green blood was pumping out of what was left of the neck .   mullen dared not vomit  but he wanted to .   with eyes averted  he backed away  caught the outer lock with one hand and imparted a whirl .  for several seconds  it maintained that whirl .  at the end of the screw  the springs engaged automatically and pulled it shut .   what was left of the atmosphere tightened it and the laboring pumps could now begin to fill the control room once again .   mullen crawled over the mangled kloro and into the room .  it was empty .   he had barely time to notice that when he found himself on his knees .  he rose with difficulty .  the transition from non gravity to gravity had taken him entirely by surprise .  it was klorian gravity  too  which meant that with this suit  he carried a fifty percent overload for his small frame .  at least  though  his heavy metal clogs no longer clung so exasperatingly to the metal underneath .  within the ship  floors and wall were of cork covered aluminum alloy .   he circled slowly .  the neckless kloro had collapsed and lay with only an occasional twitch to show it had once been a living organism .  he stepped over it  distastefully  and drew the steam tube lock shut .   the room had a depressing bilious cast and the lights shone yellow green .  it was the kloro atmosphere  of course .   mullen felt a twinge of surprise and reluctant admiration .  the kloros obviously had some way of treating materials so that they were impervious to the oxidizing effect of chlorine .  even the map of earth on the wall  printed on glossy plastic backed paper  seemed fresh and untouched .  he approached  drawn by the familiar outlines of the continents   there was a flash of motion caught in the corner of his eyes .  as quickly as he could in his heavy suit  he turned  then screamed .  the kloro he had thought dead was rising to its feet .   its neck hung limp  an oozing mass of tissue mash  but its arms reached out blindly  and the tentacles about its chest vibrated rapidly like innumerable snakes  tongues .   it was blind  of course .  the destruction of its neck stalk had deprived it of all sensory equipment  and partial asphyxiation had disorganized it .  but the brain remained whole and safe in the abdomen .  it still lived .   mullen backed away .  he circled  trying clumsily and unsuccessfully to tiptoe  though he knew that what was left of the kloro was also deaf .  it blundered on its way  struck a wall  felt to the base and began sidling along it .   mullen cast about desperately for a weapon  found nothing .  there was the kloro s holster  but he dared not reach for it .  why hadn t he snatched it at the very first .  fool .   the door to the control room opened .  it made almost no noise .  mullen turned  quivering .   the other kloro entered  unharmed  entire .  it stood in the doorway for a moment  chest tendrils stiff and unmoving  its neck stalk stretched forward  its horrible eyes flickering first at him and then at its nearly dead comrade .   and then its hand moved quickly to its side .   mullen  without awareness  moved as quickly in pure reflex .  he stretched out the hose of the spare oxygen cylinder  which  since entering the control  room  he had replaced in its suit clamp  and cracked the valve .  he didn t bother reducing the pressure .  he let it gush out unchecked so that he nearly staggered under the backward push .   he could see the oxygen stream .  it was a pale puff  billowing out amid the chlorine green .  it caught the kloro with one hand on the weapon s holster .   the kloro threw its hands up .  the little beak on its head nodule opened alarmingly but noiselessly .  it staggered and fell  writhed for a moment  then lay still .  mullen approached and played the oxygen stream upon its body as though he were extinguishing a fire .  and then he raised his heavy foot and brought it down upon the center of the neck stalk and crushed it on the floor .   he turned to the first .  it was sprawled  rigid .   the whole room was pale with oxygen  enough to kill whole legions of kloros  and his cylinder was empty .   mullen stepped over the dead kloro  out of the control room and along the main corridor toward the prisoners  room .   reaction had set in .  he was whimpering in blind  incoherent fright .   stuart was tired .  false hands and all  he was at the controls of a ship once again .  two light cruisers of earth were on the way .  for better than twenty four hours he had handled the controls virtually alone .  he had discarded the chlorinating equipment  rerigged the old atmospherics  located the ship s position in space  tried to plot a course  and sent out carefully guarded signals which had worked .   so when the door of the control room opened  he was a little annoyed .  he was too tired to play conversational handball .  then he turned  and it was mullen stepping inside .   stuart said   for god s sake  get back into bed  mullen .    mullen said   i m tired of sleeping  even though i never thought i would be a while ago .     how do you feel .     i m stiff all over .  especially my side .   he grimaced and stared involuntarily around .    don t look for the kloros   stuart said .   we dumped the poor devils .   he shook his head .   i was sorry for them .  to themselves  they re the human beings  you know  and we re the aliens .  not that i d rather they d killed you  you understand .     i understand .    stuart turned a sidelong glance upon the little man who sat looking at the map of earth and went on   i owe you a particular and personal apology  mullen .  i didn t think much of you .     it was your privilege   said mullen in his dry voice  there was no feeling in it .    .   no  it wasn t .  it is no one s privilege to despise another .  it is only a hard won right after long experience .     .    have you been thinking about this .     yes  all day .  maybe i can t explain .  it s these hands .   he held them up before him  spread out .   it was hard knowing that other people had hands of their own .  i had to hate them for it .  i always had to do my best to investigate and belittle their motives  point up their deficiencies  expose their stupidities .  i had to do anything that would prove to myself that they weren t worth envying .    mullen moved restlessly .   this explanation is not necessary .     it is .  it is .   stuart felt his thoughts intently  strained to put them into words .   for years i ve abandoned hope of finding any decency in human beings .  then you climbed into the c chute .     you had better understand   said mullen   that i was motivated by practical and selfish considerations .  i will not have you present me to myself as a hero .     i wasn t intending to .  i know that you would do nothing without a reason .  it was what your action did to the rest of us .  it turned a collection of phonies and fools into decent people .  and not by magic either .  they were decent all along .  it was just that they needed something to live up to and you supplied it .  and i m one of them .  i ll have to live up to you  too .  for the rest of my life  probably .    mullen turned away uncomfortably .  his hand straightened his sleeves  which were not in the least twisted .  his finger rested on the map .   he said   i was born in richmond  virginia  you know .  here it is .  i ll be going there first .  where were you born .     toronto   said stuart .    that s right here .  not very far apart on the map  is it .    stuart said   would you tell me something .     if i can .     just why did you go out there .    mullen s precise mouth pursed .  he said  dryly   wouldn t my rather prosaic reason ruin the inspirational effect .     call it intellectual curiosity .  each of the rest of us had such obvious motives .  porter was scared to death of being interned  leblanc wanted to get back to his sweetheart  polyorketes wanted to kill kloros  and windham was a patriot according to his lights .  as for me  i thought of myself as a noble idealist  i m afraid .  yet in none of us was the motivation strong enough to get us into a spacesuit and out the c chute .  then what made you do it  you  of all people .     why the phrase   of all people  .     don t be offended  but you seem devoid of all emotion .     do i .   mullen s voice did not change .  it remained precise and soft  yet somehow a tightness had entered it .   that s only training  mr .  stuart  and  self discipline  not nature .  a small man can have no respectable emotions .  is there anything more ridiculous than a man like myself in a state of rage .  i m five feet and one half inch tall  and one hundred and two pounds in weight  if you care for exact figures .  i insist on the half inch and the two pounds .    can i be dignified .  proud .  draw myself to my full height without inducing laughter .  where can i meet a woman who will not dismiss me instantly with a giggle .  naturally  i ve had to learn to dispense with external display of emotion .    you talk about deformities .  no one would notice your hands or know they were different  if you weren t so eager to tell people all about it the instant you meet them .  do you think that the eight inches of height i do not have can be hidden .  that it is not the first and  in most cases  the only thing about me that a person will notice .    stuart was ashamed .  he had invaded a privacy he ought not have .  he said   i m sorry .     why .     i should not have forced you to speak of this .  i should have seen for myself that you that you     that i what .  tried to prove myself .  tried to show that while i might be small in body  i held within it a giant s heart .       would not have put it mockingly .     why not .  it s a foolish idea  and nothing like it is the reason i did what i did .  what would i have accomplished if that s what was in my mind .  will they take me to earth now and put me up before the television cameras  pitching them low  of course  to catch my face  or standing me on a chair  and pin medals on me .     they are quite likely to do exactly that .     and what good would it do me .  they would say   gee  and he s such a little guy .   and afterward  what .  shall i tell each man i meet   you know  i m the fellow they decorated for incredible valor last month .   how many medals  mr .  stuart  do you suppose it would take to put eight inches and sixty pounds on me .    stuart said   put that way  i see your point .    mullen was speaking a trifle more quickly now  a controlled heat had entered his words  warming them to just a tepid room temperature .   there were days when i thought i would show them  the mysterious  them  that includes all the world .  i was going to leave earth and carve out worlds for myself .  i would be a new and even smaller napoleon .  so i left earth and went to arcturus .  and what could i do on arcturus that i could not have done on earth .  nothing .  i balance books .  so i am past the vanity  mr .  stuart  of trying to stand on tiptoe .     then why did you do it .     i left earth when i was twenty eight and came to the arcturian system .  i ve been there ever since .  this trip was to be my first vacation  my first visit  back to earth in all that time .  i was going to stay on earth for six months .  the kloros instead captured us and would have kept us interned indefinitely .  but i couldn t i couldn  t let them stop me from traveling to earth .  no matter what the risk  i had to prevent their interference .  it wasn t love of woman  or fear  or hate  or idealism of any sort .  it was stronger than any of those .    he stopped  and stretched out a hand as though to caress the map on the wall .    mr .  stuart   mullen asked quietly   haven t you ever been homesick .     in a good cause    in the great court  which stands as a patch of untouched peace among the fifty busy square miles devoted to the towering buildings that are the pulse beat of the united worlds of the galaxy  stands a statue .   it stands where it can look at the stars at night .  there are other statues ringing the court  but this one stands in the center and alone .   it is not a very good statue .  the face is too noble and lacks the lines of living .  the brow is a shade too high  the nose a shade too symmetrical  the clothing a shade too carefully disposed .  the whole bearing is by far too saintly to be true .  one can suppose that the man in real life might have frowned at times  or hiccuped  but the statue seemed to insist that such imperfections were impossible .   all this  of course  is understandable overcompensation .  the man had no statues raised to him while alive  and succeeding generations  with the advantage of hindsight  felt guilty .   the name on the pedestal reads  richard sayama altmayer .   underneath it is a short phrase and  vertically arranged  three dates .  the phrase is   in a good cause  there are no failures .  the three dates are june           september          december           the years being counted in the usual manner of the period  that is  from the date of the first atomic explosion in      of the ancient era .   none of those dates represents either his birth or death .  they mark neither a date of marriage or of the accomplishment of some great deed or  indeed  of anything that the inhabitants of the united worlds can remem   copyright         by henry holt and company  inc .   ber with pleasure and pride .  rather  they are the final expression of the feeling of guilt .   quite simply and plainly  they are the three dates upon which richard sayama altmayer was sent to prison for his opinions .     lune           at the age of twenty two  certainly  dick altmayer was fully capable of feeling fury .  his hair was as yet dark brown and he had not grown the mustache which  in later years  would be so characteristic of him .  his nose was  of course  thin and high bridged  but the contours of his face were youthful .  it would only be later that the growing gauntness of his cheeks would convert that nose into the prominent kndmark that it now is in the minds of trillions of school children .   geoffrey stock was standing in the doorway  viewing the results of his friend s fury .  his round face and cold  steady eyes were there  but he had yet to put on the first of the military uniforms in which he was to spend the rest of his life .     he said   great galaxy .    altmayer looked up .   hello  jeff .     what s been happening  dick .  i thought your principles  pal  forbid destruction of any kind .  here s a book viewer that looks somewhat destroyed .   he picked up the pieces .   altmayer said   i was holding the viewer when my wave receiver came through with an official message .  you know which one  too .     i know .  it happened to me  too .  where is it .     on the floor .  i tore it off the spool as soon as it belched out at me .  wait  let s dump it down the atom chute .     hey  hold on .  you can t     why not .     because you won t accomplish anything .  you ll have to report .     and just why .     don t be an ass  dick .     this is a matter of principle  by space .     oh  nuts .  you can t fight the whole planet .       i don t intend to fight the whole planet  just the few who get us into wars .    stock shrugged .   that means the whole planet .  that guff of yours of leaders tricking poor innocent people into fighting is just so much space dust .  do you think that if a vote were taken the people wouldn t be overwhelmingly in favor of fighting this fight .     that means nothing  jeff .  the government has control of     the organs of propaganda .  yes  i know .  i ve listened to you often enough .  but why not report  anyway .    altmayer turned away .   stock said   in the first place  you might not pass the physical examination .     i d pass .  i ve been in space .     that doesn t mean anything .  if the doctors let you hop a liner  that only means you don t have a heart murmur or an aneurysm .  for military duty aboard ship in space you need much more than just that .  how do you know you qualify .     that s a side issue  jeff  and an insulting one .  it s not that i m afraid to fight .     do you think you can stop the war this way .     i wish i could   altrnayer s voice almost shook as he spoke .   it s this idea i have that all mankind should be a single unit .  there shouldn t be wars or space fleets armed only for destruction .  the galaxy stands ready to be opened to the united efforts of the human race .  instead  we have been factioned for nearly two thousand years  and we throw away all the galaxy .    stock laughed   we re doing all right .  there are more than eighty independent planetary systems .     and are we the only intelligences in the galaxy .     oh  the diaboli  your particular devils   and stock put his fists to his temples and extended the two forefingers  waggling them .    and yours  too  and everybody s .  they have a single government extending over more planets than all those occupied by our precious eighty independents .     sure  and their nearest planet is only fifteen hundred light years away from earth and they can t live on oxygen planets anyway .    stock got out of his friendly mood .  he said  curtly   look  i dropped by here to say that i was reporting for examination next week .  are you coming with me .     no .     you re really determined .     i m really determined .     you know you ll accomplish nothing .  there ll be no great flame ignited on earth .  it will be no case of millions of young men being excited by your example into a no war strike .  you will simply be put in jail .     well  then  jail it is .    and jail it was .  on june           of the atomic era  after a short trial in which richard sayama altmayer refused to present any defense  he was sentenced to jail for the term of three years or for the duration of the war  whichever should be longer .  he served a little over four years and two months  at which time the war ended in a definite though not shattering santannian defeat .  earth gained complete control of certain disputed asteroids  various commercial advantages  and a limitation of the santannian navy .   the combined human losses of the war were something over two thou   sand ships with  of course  most of their crews  and in addition  several millions of lives due to the bombardment of planetary surfaces from space .  the fleets of the two contending powers had been sufficiently strong to restrict this bombardment to the outposts of their respective systems  so that the planets of earth and santanni  themselves  were little affected .   the war conclusively established earth as the strongest single human military power .   geoffrey stock fought throughout the war  seeing action more than once and remaining whole in life and limb despite that .  at the end of the war he had the rank of major .  he took part in the first diplomatic mission sent out by earth to the worlds of the diaboli  and that was the first step in his expanding role in earth s military and political life .     september          they were the first diaboli ever to have appeared on the surface of earth itself .  the projection posters and the newscasts of the federalist party made that abundantly clear to any who were unaware of that .  over and over  they repeated the chronology of events .   it was toward the beginning of the century that human explorers first came across the diaboli .  they were intelligent and had discovered interstellar travel independently somewhat earlier than had the humans .  already the galactic volume of their dominions was greater than that which was human occupied .   regular diplomatic relationships between the diaboli and the major human powers had begun twenty years earlier  immediately after the war between santanni and earth .  at that time  outposts of diaboli power were already within twenty light years of the outermost human centers .  their missions went everywhere  drawing trade treaties  obtaining concessions on unoccupied asteroids .   and now they were on earth itself .  they were treated as equals and perhaps as more than equals by the rulers of the greatest center of human population in the galaxy .  the most damning statistic of all was the most loudly proclaimed by the federalists .  it was this  although the number of living diaboli was somewhat less than the total number of living humans  humanity had opened up not more than five new worlds to colonization in fifty years  while the diaboli had begun the occupation of nearly five hundred .    a hundred to one against us   cried the federalists   because they are one political organization and we are a hundred .   but relatively few on earth  and fewer in the galaxy as a whole  paid attention to the federalists and their demands for galactic union .   the crowds that lined the streets along which nearly daily the five diaboli of the mission traveled from their specially conditioned suite in the best  hotel of the city to the secretariat of defense were  by and large  not hostile .  most were merely curious  and more than a little revolted .   the diaboli were not pleasant creatures to look at .  they were larger and considerably more massive than earthmen .  they had four stubby legs set close together below and two flexibly fingered arms above .  their skin was wrinkled and naked and they wore no clothing .  their broad  scaly faces wore no expressions capable of being read by earthmen  and from flattened regions just above each large pupilled eye there sprang short horns .  it was these last that gave the creatures their names .  at first they had been called devils  and later the politer latin equivalent .   each wore a pair of cylinders on its back from which flexible tubes extended to the nostrils  there they clamped on tightly .  these were packed with soda lime which absorbed the  to them  poisonous carbon dioxide from the air they breathed .  their own metabolism revolved about the reduction of sulfur and sometimes those foremost among the humans in the crowd caught a foul whiff of the hydrogen sulfide exhaled by the diaboli .   the leader of the federalists was in the crowd .  he stood far back where he attracted no attention from the police who had roped off the avenues and who now maintained a watchful order on the little hoppers that could be maneuvered quickly through the thickest crowd .  the federalist leader was gaunt faced  with a thin and prominently bridged nose and straight  graying hair .   he turned away   i cannot bear to look at them .    his companion was more philosophic .  he said   no uglier in spirit  at least  than some of our handsome officials .  these creatures are at least true to their own .     you are sadly right .  are we entirely ready .     entirely .  there won t be one of them alive to return to his world .     good .  i will remain here to give the signal .    the diaboli were talking as well .  this fact could not be evident to any human  no matter how close .  to be sure  they could communicate by making ordinary sounds to one another but that was not their method of choice .  the skin between their homs could  by the actions of muscles which differed in their construction from any known to humans  vibrate rapidly .  the tiny waves which were transmitted in this manner to the air were too rapid to be heard by the human ear and too delicate to be detected by any but the most sensitive of human instrumentation .  at that time  in fact  humans remained unaware of this form of communication .   a vibration said   did you know that this is the planet of origin of the two legs .     no .   there was a chorus of such no s  and then one particular vibration said   do you get that from the two leg communications you have been studying  queer one .     because i study the communications .  more of our people should do so instead of insisting so firmly on the complete worthlessness of two leg culture .  for one thing  we are in a much better position to deal with the two legs if we know something about them .  their history is interesting in a horrible way .  i am glad i brought myself to view their spools .     and yet   came another vibration   from our previous contacts with two legs  one would be certain that they did not know their planet of origin .  certainly there is no veneration of this planet  earth  or any memorial rites connected with it .  are you sure the information is correct .     entirely so .  the lack of ritual  and the fact that this planet is by no means a shrine  is perfectly understandable in the light of two leg history .  the two legs on the other worlds would scarcely concede the honor .  it would somehow lower the independent dignity of their own worlds .     i don t quite understand .     neither do i  exactly  but after several days of reading i think i catch a glimmer .  it would seem that  originally  when interstellar travel was first discovered by the two legs  they lived under a single political unit .     naturally .     not for these two legs .  this was an unusual stage in their history and did not last .  after the colonies on the various worlds grew and came to reasonable maturity  their first interest was to break away from the mother world .  the first in the series of interstellar wars among these two legs began then .     horrible .  like cannibals .     yes  isn t it .  my digestion has been upset for days .  my cud is sour .  in any case  the various colonies gained independence  so that now we have the situation of which we are well aware .  all of the two leg kingdoms  republics  aristocracies  etc .   are simply tiny clots of worlds  each consisting of a dominant world and a few subsidiaries which  in turn  are forever seeking their independence or being shifted from one dominant to another .  this earth is the strongest among them and yet less than a dozen worlds owe it allegiance .     incredible  that these creatures should be so blind to their own interests .  do they not have a tradition of the single government that existed when they consisted of but one world .     as i said that was unusual for them .  the single government had existed only a few decades .  prior to that  this very planet itself was split into a number of subplanetary political units .     never heard anything like it .   for a while  the supersonics of the various creatures interfered with one another .    it s a fact .  it is simply the nature of the beast .    and with that  they were at the secretariat of defense .   the five diaboli stood side by side along the table .  they stood because their anatomy did not admit of anything that could correspond to  sitting .    on the other side of the table  five earthmen stood as well .  it would have been more convenient for the humans to sit but  understandably  there was no desire to make the handicap of smaller size any more pronounced than it already was .  the table was a rather wide one  the widest  in fact  that could be conveniently obtained .  this was out of respect for the human nose  for from the diaboli  slightly so as they breathed  much more so when they spoke  there came the gentle and continuous drift of hydrogen sulfide .  this was a difficulty rather unprecedented in diplomatic negotiations .   ordinarily the meetings did not last for more than half an hour  and at the end of this interval the diaboli ended their conversations without ceremony and turned to leave .  this time  however  the leave taking was interrupted .  a man entered  and the five human negotiators made way for him .  he was tall  taller than any of the other earthmen  and he wore a uniform with the ease of long usage .  his face was round and his eyes cold and steady .  his black hair was rather thin but as yet untouched by gray .  there was an irregular blotch of scar tissue running from the point of his jaw downward past the line of his high  leather brown collar .  it might have been the result of a hand energy ray  wielded by some forgotten human enemy in one of the five wars in which the man had been an active participant .    sirs   said the earthman who had been chief negotiator hitherto   may i introduce the secretary of defense .    the diaboli were somewhat shocked and  although their expressions were in repose and inscrutable  the sound plates on their foreheads vibrated actively .  their strict sense of hierarchy was disturbed .  the secretary was only a two leg  but by two leg standards  he outranked them .  they could not properly conduct official business with him .   the secretary was aware of their feelings but had no choice in the matter .  for at least ten minutes  their leaving must be delayed and no ordinary interruption could serve to hold back the diaboli .    sirs   he said   i must ask your indulgence to remain longer this time .    the central diabolus replied in the nearest approach to english any diabolus could manage .  actually  a diabolus might be said to have two mouths .  one was hinged at the outermost extremity of the jawbone and was used in eating .  in this capacity  the motion of the mouth was rarely seen by human beings  since the diaboli much preferred to eat in the company of their own kind  exclusively .  a narrower mouth opening  however  perhaps two inches in width  could be used in speaking .  it pursed itself open  revealing the gummy gap where a diabolus  missing incisors ought to have been .  it remained open during speech  the necessary consonantal blockings being performed by the palate and back of the tongue .  the result was hoarse and fuzzy  but understandable .   the diabolus said   you will pardon us  already we suffer .   and by his forehead  he twittered unheard   they mean to suffocate us in their vile atmosphere .  we must ask for larger poison absorbing cylinders .    the secretary of defense said   i am in sympathy with your feelings  and yet this may be my only opportunity to speak with you .  perhaps you would do us the honor to eat with us .    the earthman next the secretary could not forbear a quick and passing frown .  he scribbled rapidly on a piece of paper and passed it to the secretary  who glanced momentarily at it .   it read   no .  they eat sulfuretted hay .  stinks unbearably .   the secretary crumbled the note and let it drop .   the diabolus said   the honor is ours .  were we physically able to endure your strange atmosphere for so long a time  we would accept most gratefully .    and via forehead  he said with agitation   they cannot expect us to eat with them and watch them consume the corpses of dead animals .  my cud would never be sweet again .     we respect your reasons   said the secretary .   let us then transact our business now .  in the negotiations that have so far proceeded  we have been unable to obtain from your government  in the persons of you  their representatives  any clear indication as to what the boundaries of your sphere of influence are in your own minds .  we have presented several proposals in this matter .     as far as the territories of earth are concerned  mr .  secretary  a definition has been given .     but surely you must see that this is unsatisfactory .  the boundaries of earth and your lands are nowhere in contact .  so far  you have done nothing but state this fact .  while true  the mere statement is not satisfying .     we do not completely understand .  would you have us discuss the boundaries between ourselves and such independent human kingdoms as that of vega .     why  yes .     that cannot be done  sir .  surely  you realize that any relations between ourselves and the sovereign realm of vega cannot be possibly any concern of earth .  they can be discussed only with vega .     then you will negotiate a hundred times with the hundred human world systems .     it is necessary .  i would point out  however  that the necessity is imposed not by us but by the nature of your human organization .     then that limits our field of discussion drastically .   the secretary seemed abstracted .  he was listening  not exactly to the diaboli opposite  but  rather  it would seem  to something at a distance .   and now there was a faint commotion  barely heard from outside the secretariat .  the babble of distant voices  the brisk crackle of energy guns muted by distance to nearly nothingness  and the hurried click clacking of police hoppers .   the diaboli showed no indication of hearing  nor was this simply another  affectation of politeness .  if their capacity for receiving supersonic sound waves was far more delicate and acute than almost anything human ingenuity had ever invented  their reception for ordinary sound waves was rather dull .   the diabolus was saying   we beg leave to state our surprise .  we were of the opinion that all this was known to you .    a man in police uniform appeared in the doorway .  the secretary turned to him  and  with the briefest of nods  the policeman departed .   the secretary said suddenly and briskly   quite .  i merely wished to ascertain once again that this was the case .  i trust you will be ready to resume negotiations tomorrow .     certainly  sir .    one by one  slowly  with a dignity befitting the heirs of the universe  the diaboli left .   an earthman said   i m glad they refused to eat with us .     i knew they couldn t accept   said the secretary  thoughtfully .   they re vegetarian .  they sicken thoroughly at the very thought of eating meat .  i ve seen them eat  you know .  not many humans have .  they resemble our cattle in the business of eating .  they bolt their food and then stand solemnly about in circles  chewing their cuds in a great community of thought .  perhaps they intercommunicate by a method we are unaware of .  the huge lower jaw rotates horizontally in a slow  grinding process    the policeman had once more appeared in the doorway .   the secretary broke off  and called   you have them all .     yes  sir .     do you have altmayer .     yes  sir .     good .    the crowd had gathered again when the five diaboli emerged from the secretariat .  the schedule was strict .  at      p . m .  each day they left their suite and spent five minutes walking to the secretariat .  at       they emerged therefrom once again and returned to their suite  the way being kept clear by the police .  they marched stolidly  almost mechanically  along the broad avenue .   halfway in their trek there came the sounds of shouting men .  to most of the crowd  the words were not clear but there was the crackle of an energy gun and the pale blue fluorescence split the air overhead .  police wheeled  their own energy guns drawn  hoppers springing seven feet into the air  landing delicately in the midst of groups of people  touching none of them  jumping again almost instantly .  people scattered and their voices were joined to the general uproar .   through it all  the diaboli  either through defective hearing or excessive dignity  continued marching as mechanically as ever .   at the other end of the gathering  almost diametrically opposing the region of excitement  richard sayama altmayer stroked his nose in a moment of satisfaction .  the strict chronology of the diaboli had made a split second plan possible .  the first diversionary disturbance was only to attract the attention of the police .  it was now   and he fired a harmless sound pellet into the air .   instantly  from four directions  concussion pellets split the air .  from the roofs of buildings lining the way  snipers fired .   each of the diaboli  torn by the shells  shuddered and exploded as the pellets detonated within them .  one by one  they toppled .   and from nowhere  the police were at altmayer s side .  he stared at them with some surprise .   gently  for in twenty years he had lost his fury and learned to be gentle  he said   you come quickly  but even so you come too late .   he gestured in the direction of the shattered diaboli .   the crowd was in simple panic now .  additional squadrons of police  arriving in record time  could do nothing more than herd them off into harmless directions .   the policeman  who now held altmayer in a firm grip  taking the sound gun from him and inspecting him quickly for further weapons  was a captain by rank .  he said  stiffly   i think you ve made a mistake  mr .  altmayer .  you ll notice you ve drawn no blood .   and he  too  waved toward where the diaboli lay motionless .   altmayer turned  startled .  the creatures lay there on their sides  some in pieces  tattered skin shredding away  frames distorted and bent  but the police captain was correct .  there was no blood  no flesh .  altmayer s lips  pale and stiff  moved soundlessly .   the police captain interpreted the motion accurately enough .  he said   you are correct  sir  they are robots .    and from the great doors of the secretariat of defense the true diaboli emerged .  clubbing policemen cleared the way  but another way  so that they need not pass the sprawled travesties of plastic and aluminum which for three minutes had played the role of living creatures .   the police captain said   i ll ask you to come without trouble  mr .  altmayer .  the secretary of defense would like to see you .     i am coming  sir .   a stunned frustration was only now beginning to overwhelm him .   geoffrey stock and richard altmayer faced one another for the first time in almost a quarter of a century  there in the defense secretary s private office .  it was a rather straitlaced office  a desk  an armchair  and two additional chairs .  all were a dull brown in color  the chairs being topped by brown foamite which yielded to the body enough for comfort  not enough for luxury .  there was a micro viewer on the desk and a little cabinet big  enough to hold several dozen opto spools .  on the wall opposite the desk was a trimensional view of the old dauntless  the secretary s first command .   stock said   it is a little ridiculous meeting like this after so many years .  i find i am sorry .     sorry about what  jeff .   altmayer tried to force a smile   i am sorry about nothing but that you tricked me with those robots .     you were not difficult to trick   said stock   and it was an excellent opportunity to break your party .  i m sure it will be quite discredited after this .  the pacifist tries to force war  the apostle of gentleness tries assassination .     war against the true enemy   said altmayer sadly .   but you are right .  it is a sign of desperation that this was forced on me .    then   how did you know my plans .     you still overestimate humanity  dick .  in any conspiracy the weakest points are the people that compose it .  you had twenty five co conspirators .  didn t it occur to you that at least one of them might be an informer  or even an employee of mine .    a dull red burned slowly on altmayer s high cheekbones .   which one .   he said .    sorry .  we may have to use him again .    altmayer sat back in his chair wearily .   what have you gained .     what have you gained .  you are as impractical now as on that last day i saw you  the day you decided to go to jail rather than report for induction .  you haven t changed .    altmayer shook his head   the truth doesn t change .    stock said impatiently   if it is truth  why does it always fail .  your stay in jail accomplished nothing .  the war went on .  not one life was saved .  since then  you ve started a political party  and every cause it has backed has failed .  your conspiracy has failed .  you re nearly fifty  dick  and what have you accomplished .  nothing .    altmayer said   and you went to war  rose to command a ship  then to a place in the cabinet .  they say you will be the next coordinator .  you ve accomplished a great deal .  yet success and failure do not exist in themselves .  success in what .  success in working the ruin of humanity .  failure in what .  in saving it .  i wouldn t change places with you .  jeff  remember this .  in a good cause  there are no failures  there are only delayed successes .     even if you are executed for this day s work .     even if i am executed .  there will be someone else to carry on  and his success will be my success .     how do you envisage this success .  can you really see a union of worlds  a galactic federation .  do you want santanni running our affairs .  do you want a vegan telling you what to do .  do you want earth to decide its own destiny or to be at the mercy of any random combination of powers .     we would be at their mercy no more than they would be at ours .     except that we are the richest .  we would be plundered for the sake of the depressed worlds of the sirius sector .     and pay the plunder out of what we would save in the wars that would no longer occur .     do you have answers for all questions  dick .     in twenty years we have been asked all questions  jeff .     then answer this one .  how would you force this union of yours on unwilling humanity .     that is why i wanted to kill the diaboli .   for the first time  altmayer showed agitation .   it would mean war with them  but all humanity would unite against the common enemy .  our own political and ideological differences would fade in the face of that .     you really believe that .  even when the diaboli have never harmed us .  they cannot live on our worlds .  they must remain on their own worlds of sulfide atmosphere and oceans which are sodium sulfate solutions .     humanity knows better  jeff .  they are spreading from world to world like an atomic explosion .  they block space travel into regions where there are unoccupied oxygen worlds  the kind we could use .  they are planning for the future  making room for uncounted future generations of diaboli  while we are being restricted to one corner of the galaxy  and fighting ourselves to death .  in a thousand years we will be their slaves  in ten thousand we will be extinct .  oh  yes  they are the common enemy .  mankind knows that .  you will find that out sooner than you think  perhaps .    the secretary said   your party members speak a great deal of ancient greece of the preatomic age .  they tell us that the greeks were a marvelous people  the most culturally advanced of their time  perhaps of all times .  they set mankind on the road it has never yet left entirely .  they had only one flaw .  they could not unite .  they were conquered and eventually died out .  and we follow in their footsteps now  eh .     you have learned your lesson well  jeff .     but have you  dick .     what do you mean .     did the greeks have no common enemy against whom they could unite .    altmayer was silent .   stock said   the greeks fought persia  their great common enemy .  was it not a fact that a good proportion of the greek states fought on the persian side .    altmayer said finally   yes .  because they thought persian victory was inevitable and they wanted to be on the winning side .     human beings haven t changed  dick .  why do you suppose the diaboli are here .  what is it we are discussing .     i am not a member of the government .     no   said stock  savagely   but i am .  the vegan league has allied itself with the diaboli .     i don t believe you .  it can t be .     it can be and is .  the diaboli have agreed to supply them with five hundred ships at any time they happen to be at war with earth .  in return  vega abandons all claims to the nigellian star cluster .  so if you had really assassinated the diaboli  it would have been war  but with half of humanity probably fighting on the side of your so called common enemy .  we are trying to prevent that .    altmayer said slowly   i am ready for trial .  or am i to be executed without one .    stock said   you are still foolish .  if we shoot you  dick  we make a martyr .  if we keep you alive and shoot only your subordinates  you will be suspected of having turned state s evidence .  as a presumed traitor  you will be quite harmless in the future .    and so  on september  th        richard sayama altmayer  after the briefest of secret trials  was sentenced to five years in prison .  he served his full term .  the year he emerged from prison  geoffrey stock was elected coordinator of earth .     december           simon devoire was not at ease .  he was a little man  with sandy hair and a freckled  ruddy face .  he said   i m sorry i agreed to see you  altmayer .  it won t do you any good .  it might do me harm .    altmayer said   i am an old man .  i won t hurt you .   and he was indeed a very old man somehow .  the turn of the century found his years at two thirds of a century  but he was older than that  older inside and older outside .  his clothes were too big for him  as if he were shrinking away inside them .  only his nose had not aged  it was still the thin  aristocratic  high beaked altmayer nose .   devoire said   it s not you i m afraid of .    why not .  perhaps you think i betrayed the men of     .    no  of course not .  no man of sense believes that you did .  but the days of the federalists are over  altmayer .    altmayer tried to smile .  he felt a little hungry  he hadn t eaten that day  no time for food .  was the day of the federalists over .  it might seem so to others .  the movement had died on a wave of ridicule .  a conspiracy that fails  a  lost cause   is often romantic .  it is remembered and draws adherents for generations  if the loss is at least a dignified one .  but to shoot at living creatures and find the mark to be robots  to be outmaneuvered and outfoxed  to be made ridiculous that is deadly .  it is deadlier than treason  wrong  and sin .  not many had believed altmayer had bargained for his life by betraying his associates  but the universal laughter killed federalism as effectively as though they had .   but altmayer had remained stolidly stubborn under it all .  he said   the day of the federalists will never be over  while the human race lives .     words   said devoire impatiently .   they meant more to me when i was younger .  i am a little tired now .     simon  i need access to the subetheric system .    devoire s face hardened .  he said   and you thought of me .  i m sorry  altmayer  but i can t let you use my broadcasts for your own purposes .     you were a federalist once .     don t rely on that   said devoire .   that s in the past .  now i am  nothing .  i am a devoirist  i suppose .  i want to live .     even if it is under the feet of the diaboli .  do you want to live when they are willing  die when they are ready .     words .     do you approve of the all galactic conference .      devoire reddened past his usual pink level .  he gave the sudden impression of a man with too much blood for his body .  he said smolderingly   well  why not .  what does it matter how we go about establishing the federation of man .  if you re still a federalist  what have you to object to in a united humanity .     united under the diaboli .     what s the difference .  humanity can t unite by itself .  let us be driven to it  as long as the fact is accomplished .  i am sick of it all  altmayer  sick of all our stupid history .  i m tired of trying to be an idealist with nothing to be idealistic over .  human beings are human beings and that s the nasty part of it .  maybe we ve got to be whipped into line .  if so  i m perfectly willing to let the diaboli do the whipping .    altmayer said gently   you re very foolish  devoire .  it won t be a real union  you know that .  the diaboli called this conference so that they might act as umpires on all current interhuman disputes to their own advantage  and remain the supreme court of judgment over us hereafter .  you know they have no intention of establishing a real central human government .  it will only be a sort of interlocking directorate  each human government will conduct its own affairs as before and pull in various directions as before .  it is simply that we will grow accustomed to running to the diaboli with our little problems .     how do you know that will be the result .     do you seriously think any other result is possible .    devoire chewed at his lower lip   maybe not .     then see through a pane of glass  simon .  any true independence we now have will be lost .     a lot of good this independence has ever done us .   besides  what s the use .  we can t stop this thing .  coordinator stock is probably no keener on the conference than you are  but that doesn t help him .  if earth doesn t attend  the union will be formed without us  and then we  . will face war with  the rest of humanity and the diaboli .  and that goes for any other government that wants to back out .     what if all the governments back out .  wouldn t the conference break up completely .     have you ever known all the human governments to do anything together .  you never learn  altmayer .     there are new facts involved .     such as .  i know i am foolish for asking  but go ahead .    altmayer said   for twenty years most of the galaxy has been shut to human ships .  you know that .  none of us has the slightest notion of what goes on within the diaboli sphere of influence .  and yet some human colonies exist within that sphere .     so .     so occasionally  human beings escape into the small portion of the galaxy that remains human and free .  the government of earth receives reports  reports which they don t dare make public .  but not all officials of the government can stand the cowardice involved in such actions forever .  one of them has been to see me .  i can t tell you which one  of course  so i have documents  devoire  official  reliable  and true .    devoire shrugged   about what .   he turned the desk chronometer rather ostentatiously so that altmayer could see its gleaming metal face on which the red  glowing figures stood out sharply .  they read        and even as it was turned  the   faded and the new glow of a   appeared .   altmayer said   there is a planet called by its colonists chu hsi .  it did not have a large population  two million  perhaps .  fifteen years ago the diaboli occupied worlds on various sides of it  and in all those fifteen years  no human ship ever landed on the planet .  last year the diaboli themselves landed .  they brought with them huge freight ships filled with sodium sul fate and bacterial cultures that are native to their own worlds .     what .   you can t make me believe it .     try   said altmayer  ironically .   it is not difficult .  sodium sulfate will dissolve in the oceans of any world .  in a sulfate ocean  their bacteria will grow  multiply  and produce hydrogen sulfide in tremendous quantities which will fill the oceans and the atmosphere .  they can then introduce their plants and animals and eventually themselves .  another planet will be suitable for diaboli life and unsuitable for any human .  it would take time  surely  but the diaboli have time .  they are a united people and  .   .   .     now  look   devoire waved his hand in disgust   that just doesn t hold water .  the diaboli have more worlds than they know what to do with .     for their present purposes  yes  but the diaboli are creatures that look toward the future .  their birth rate is high and eventually they will fill the galaxy .  and how much better off they would be if they were the only intelligence in the universe .     but it s impossible on purely physical grounds .  do you know how many  millions of tons of sodium sulfate it would take to fill up the oceans to their requirements .     obviously a planetary supply .     well  then  do you suppose they would strip one of their own worlds to create a new one .  where is the gain .     simon  simon  there are millions of planets in the galaxy which through atmospheric conditions  temperature  or gravity are forever uninhabitable either to humans or to diaboli .  many of these are quite adequately rich in sulfur .    devoire considered   what about the human beings on the planet .     on chu hsi .  euthanasia except for the few who escaped in time .  painless i suppose .  the diaboli are not needlessly cruel  merely efficient .    altmayer waited .  devoire s fist clenched and unclenched .   altmayer said   publish this news .  spread it out on the interstellar subetheric web .  broadcast the documents to the reception centers on the various worlds .  you can do it  and when you do  the all galactic conference will fall apart .      i devoire s chair tilted forward .  he stood up .   where s your proof .   a  will you do it .        i want to see your proof .   i altmayer smiled   come with me .    they were waiting for him when he came back to the furnished room he was living in .  he didn t notice them at first .  he was completely unaware of the small vehicle that followed him at a slow pace and a prudent distance .  he walked with his head bent  calculating the length of time it would take for devoire to put the information through the reaches of space  how long it would take for the receiving stations on vega and santanni and centaurus to blast out the news  how long it would take to spread it over the entire galaxy .  and in this way he passed  unheeding  between the two plain clothes men who flanked the entrance of the rooming house .   it was only when he opened the door to his own room that he stopped and turned to leave but the plain clothes men were behind him now .  he made no attempt at violent escape .  he entered the room instead and sat down  feeling so old .  he thought feverishly  i need only hold them off an hour and ten minutes .   the man who occupied the darkness reached up and flicked the switch that allowed the wall lights to operate .  in the soft wall glow  the man s round face and balding gray fringed head were startlingly clear .   altmayer said gently   i am honored with a visit by the coordinator himself .    and stock said   we are old friends  you and i  dick .  we meet every once in a while .    altmayer did not answer .   stock said   you have certain government papers in your possession  dick .    altmayer said   if you think so  jeff  you ll have to find them .    stock rose wearily to his feet .   no heroics  dick .  let me tell you what those papers contained .  they were circumstantial reports of the sulfation of the planet  chu hsi .  isn t that true .    altmayer looked at the clock .   stock said   if you are pknning to delay us  to angle us as though we were fish  you will be disappointed .  we know where you ve been  we know devoire has the papers  we know exactly what he s planning to do with them .    altmayer stiffened .  the thin parchment of his cheeks trembled .  he said   how long have you known .     as long as you have  dick .  you are a very predictable man .  it is the very reason we decided to use you .  do you suppose the recorder would really come to see you as he did  without our knowledge .     i don t understand .    stock said   the government of earth  dick  is not anxious that the all galactic conference be continued .  however  we are not federalists  we know humanity for what it is .  what do you suppose would happen if the rest of the galaxy discovered that the diaboli were in the process of changing a salt oxygen world into a sulfate sulfide one .    no  don t answer .  you are dick altmayer and i m sure you d tell me that with one fiery burst of indignation  they d abandon the conference  join together in a loving and brotherly union  throw themselves at the diaboli  and overwhelm them .    stock paused such a long time that for a moment it might have seemed he would say no more .  then he continued in half a whisper   nonsense .  the other worlds would say that the government of earth for purposes of its own had initiated a fraud  had forged documents in a deliberate attempt to disrupt the conference .  the diaboli would deny everything  and most of the human worlds would find it to their interests to believe the denial .  they would concentrate on the iniquities of earth and forget about the iniquities of the diaboli .  so you see  we could sponsor no such expose .    altmayer felt drained  futile .   then you will stop devoire .  it is always that you are so sure of failure beforehand  that you believe the worst of your fellow man     wait .  i said nothing of stopping devoire .  i said only that the government could not sponsor such an expose and we will not .  but the expose will take place just the same  except that afterward we will arrest devoire and yourself and denounce the whole thing as vehemently as will the diaboli .  the whole affair would then be changed .  the government of earth will have dissociated itself from the claims .  it will then seem to the rest of the human government that for our own selfish purposes we are trying to hide  the actions of the diaboli  that we have  perhaps  a special understanding with them .  they will fear that special understanding and unite against us .  but then to be against us will mean that they are also against the diaboli .  they will insist on believing the expose to be the truth  the documents to be real and the conference will break up .     it will mean war again   said altmayer hopelessly   and not against the real enemy .  it will mean fighting among the humans and a victory all the greater for the diaboli when it is all over .     no war   said stock .   no government will attack earth with the diaboli on our side .  the other governments will merely draw away from us and grind a permanent anti diaboli bias into their propaganda .  later  if there should be war between ourselves and the diaboli  the other governments will at least remain neutral .    he looks very old  thought altmayer .  we are all old  dying men .  aloud  he said   why would you expect the diaboli to back earth .  you may fool the rest of mankind by pretending to attempt suppression of the facts concerning the planet chu hsi  but you won t fool the diaboli .  they won t for a moment believe earth to be sincere in its claim that it believes the documents to be forgeries .     ah  but they will .   geoffrey stock stood up   you see  the documents are forgeries .  the diaboli may be planning sulfation of planets in the future  but to our knowledge  they have not tried it yet .    on december           richard sayama altmayer entered prison for the third and last time .  there was no trial  no definite sentence  and scarcely a real imprisonment in the literal sense of the word .  his movements were confined and only a few officials were allowed to communicate with him  but otherwise his comforts were looked to assiduously .  he had no access to news  of course  so that he was not aware that in the second year of this third imprisonment of his  the war between earth and the diaboli opened with the surprise attack near sirius by an earth squadron upon certain ships of the diaboli navy .   in       geoffrey stock came to visit altmayer in his confinement .  altmayer rose in surprise to greet him .    you re looking well  dick   stock said .   he himself was not .  his complexion had grayed .  he still wore his naval captain s uniform  but his body stooped slightly within it .  he was to die within the year  a fact of which he was not completely unaware .  it did not bother him much .  he thought repeatedly  i have lived the years i ve had to live .   altmayer  who looked the older of the two  had yet more than nine years to live .  he said   an unexpected pleasure  jeff  but this time you can t have come to imprison me .  i m in prison already .     i ve come to set you free  if you would like .     for what purpose  jeff .  surely you have a purpose .  a clever way of using me .    stock s smile was merely a momentary twitch .  he said   a way of using you  truly  but this time you will approve .   .   .   .  we are at war .     with whom .   altmayer was startled .    with the diaboli .  we have been at war for six months .    altmayer brought his hands together  thin fingers interlacing nervously   i ve heard nothing of this .     i know .   the coordinator clasped his hands behind his back and was distantly surprised to find that they were trembling .  he said   it s been a long journey for the two of us  dick .  we ve had the same goal  you and i  no  let me speak .  i ve often wanted to explain my point of view to you  but you would never have understood .  you weren t the kind of man to understand  until i had the results for you .   i was twenty five when i first visited a diaboli world  dick .  i knew then it was either they or we .     i said so   whispered altmayer   from the first .     merely saying so was not enough .  you wanted to force the human governments to unite against them and that notion was politically unrealistic and completely impossible .  it wasn t even desirable .  humans are not diaboli .  among the diaboli individual consciousness is low  almost nonexistent .  ours is almost overpowering .  they have no such thing as politics  we have nothing else .  they can never disagree  can have nothing but a single government .  we can never agree  if we had a single island to live on  we would split it in three .    but our very disagreements are our strength .  your federalist party used to speak of ancient greece a great deal once .  do you remember .  but your people always missed the point .  to be sure  greece could never unite and was therefore ultimately conquered .  but even in her state of disunion  she defeated the gigantic persian empire .  why .    i would like to point out that the greek city states over centuries had fought with one another .  they were forced to specialize in things military to an extent far beyond the persians .  even the persians themselves realized that  and in the last century of their imperial existence  greek mercenaries formed the most valued parts of their armies .    the same might be said of the small nation states of preatomic europe  which in centuries of fighting had advanced their military arts to the point where they could overcome and hold for two hundred years the comparatively gigantic empires of asia .    so it is with us .  the diaboli  with vast extents of galactic space  have never fought a war .  their military machine is massive  but untried .  in fifty years  only such advances have been made by them as they have been able to copy from the various human navies .  humanity  on the other hand  has competed ferociously in warfare  each government has raced to keep ahead  of its neighbors in military science .  they ve had to .  it was our own disunion that made the terrible race for survival necessary  so that in the end almost any one of us was a match for all the diaboli  provided only that none of us would fight on their side in a general war .    it was toward the prevention of such a development that all of earth s diplomacy has been aimed .  until it was certain that in a war between earth and the diaboli  the rest of humanity would be at least neutral  there could be no war  and no union of human governments could be allowed  since the race for military perfection must continue .  once we were sure of neutrality  through the hoax that broke up the conference two years ago  we sought the war  and now we have it .    altmayer  through all this  might have been frozen .  it was a long time before he could say anything .   finally   what if the diaboli are victorious after all .    stock said   they aren t .  two weeks ago  the main fleets joined action and theirs was annihilated with practically no loss to ourselves  although we were greatly outnumbered .  we might have been fighting unarmed ships .  we had stronger weapons of greater range and more accurate sighting .  we had three times their effective speed since we had antiacceleration devices which they lacked .  since the battle a dozen of the other human governments have decided to join the winning side and have declared war on the diaboli .  yesterday the diaboli requested that negotiations for an armistice be opened .  the war is practically over  and henceforward the diaboli will be confined to their original planets with only such future expansions as we permit .    altmayer murmured incoherently .   stock said   and now union becomes necessary .  after the defeat of persia by the greek city states  they were ruined because of their continued wars among themselves  so that first macedon and then rome conquered them .  after europe colonized the americas  cut up africa  and conquered asia  a series of continued european wars led to european ruin .    disunion until conquest  union thereafter .  but now union is easy .  let one subdivision succeed by itself and the rest will clamor to become part of that success .  the ancient writer  toynbee  first pointed out this difference between what he called a  dominant minority  and a  creative minority .     we are a creative minority now .  in an almost spontaneous gesture  various human governments have suggested the formation of a united worlds organization .  over seventy governments are willing to attend the first sessions in order to draw up a charter of federation .  the others will join later  i am sure .  we would like you to be one of the delegates from earth  dick .    altmayer found his eyes flooding   i i don t understand your purpose .  is this all true .     it is all exactly as i say .  you were a voice in the wilderness  dick  crying  what if   for union .  your words will carry much weight .  what did you once say   in a good cause  there are no failures .       no .   said altmayer  with sudden energy .   it seems your cause was the good one .    stock s face was hard and devoid of emotion   you were always a misun derstander of human nature  dick .  when the united worlds is a reality and when generations of men and women look back to these days of war through their centuries of unbroken peace  they will have forgotten the purpose of my methods .  to them they will represent war and death .  your calls for union  your idealism  will be remembered forever .    he turned away and altmayer barely caught his last words   and when they build their statues  they will build none for me .    in the great court  which stands as a patch of untouched peace among the fifty busy square miles devoted to the towering buildings that are the pulse beat of the united worlds of the galaxy  stands a statue  .   .   .   norman and liwy were late  naturally  since catching a train is always a matter of last minute delays  so they had to take the only available seat in the coach .  it was the one toward the front  the one with nothing before it but the seat that faced wrong way  with its back hard against the front partition .  while norman heaved the suitcase onto the rack  liwy found herself chafing a little .   if a couple took the wrong way seat before them  they would be staring self consciously into each others  faces all the hours it would take to reach new york  or else  which was scarcely better  they would have to erect synthetic barriers of newspaper .  still  there was no use in taking a chance on there being another unoccupied double seat elsewhere in the train .   norman didn t seem to mind  and that was a little disappointing to liwy .  usually they held their moods in common .  that  norman claimed  was why he remained sure that he had married the right girl .   he would say   we fit each other  liwy  and that s the key fact .  when you re doing a jigsaw puzzle and one piece fits another  that s it .  there are no other possibilities  and of course there are no other girls .    and she would laugh and say   if you hadn t been on the streetcar that day  you would probably never have met me .  what would you have done then .     stayed a bachelor .  naturally .  besides  i would have met you through georgette another day .     it wouldn t have been the same .    copyright         by ziff davis publishing company .    sure it would .     no  it wouldn t .  besides  georgette would never have introduced me .  she was interested in you herself  and she s the type who knows better than to create a possible rival .     what nonsense .    livvy asked her favorite question   norman  what if you had been one minute later at the streetcar corner and had taken the next car .  what do you suppose would have happened .     and what if fish had wings and all of them flew to the top of the mountains .  what would we have to eat on fridays then .    but they had caught the streetcar  and fish didn  t have wings  so that now they had been married five years and ate fish on fridays .  and because they had been married five years  they were going to celebrate by spending a week in new york .   then she remembered the present problem .   i wish we could have found some other seat .    norman said   sure .  so do i .  but no one has taken it yet  so we ll have relative privacy as far as providence  anyway .    livvy was unconsoled  and felt herself justified when a plump little man walked down the central aisle of the coach .  now  where had he come from .  the train was halfway between boston and providence  and if he had had a seat  why hadn t he kept it .  she took out her vanity and considered her reflection .  she had a theory that if she ignored the little man  he would pass by .  so she concentrated on her light brown hair which  in the rush of catching the train  had become disarranged just a little  at her blue eyes  and at her little mouth with the plump lips which norman said looked like a permanent kiss .   not bad  she thought .   then she looked up  and the little man was in the seat opposite .  he caught her eye and grinned widely .  a series of lines curled about the edges of his smile .  he lifted his hat hastily and put it down beside him on top of the little black box he had been carrying .  a circle of white hair instantly sprang up stiffly about the large bald spot that made the center of his skull a desert .   she could not help smiling back a little  but then she caught sight of the black box again and the smile faded .  she yanked at norman s elbow .   norman looked up from his newspaper .  he had startlingly dark eyebrows that almost met above the bridge of his nose  giving him a formidable first appearance .  but they and the dark eyes beneath bent upon her now with only the usual look of pleased and somewhat amused affection .   he said   what s up .   he did not look at the plump little man opposite .   livvy did her best to indicate what she saw by a little unobtrusive gesture of her hand and head .  but the little man was watching and she felt a fool  since norman simply stared at her blankly .   finally she pulled him closer and whispered   don t you see what s printed on his box .    she looked again as she said it  and there was no mistake .  it was not very prominent  but the light caught it slantingly and it was a slightly more glistening area on a black background .  in flowing script it said   what if .    the little man was smiling again .  he nodded his head rapidly and pointed to the words and then to himself several times over .   norman said in an aside   must be his name .          liwy replied   oh  how could that be anybody s name .    norman put his paper aside .   i ll show you .   he leaned over and said   mr .  if .    the little man looked at him eagerly .    do you have the time  mr .  if .    the little man took out a large watch from his vest pocket and displayed the dial .    thank you  mr .  if   said norman .  and again in a whisper   see  liwy .    he would have returned to his paper  but the little man was opening his box and raising a finger periodically as he did so  to enforce their attention .  it was just a slab of frosted glass that he removed about six by nine inches in length and width and perhaps an inch thick .  it had beveled edges  rounded corners  and was completely featureless .  then he took out a little wire stand on which the glass slab fitted comfortably .  he rested the combination on his knees and looked proudly at them .   liwy said  with sudden excitement   heavens  norman  it s a picture of some sort .    norman bent close .  then he looked at the little man .   what s this .  a new kind of television .    the little man shook his head  and liwy said   no  norman  it s us .     what .     don t you see .  that s the streetcar we met on .  there you are in the back seat wearing that old fedora i threw away three years ago .  and that s georgette and myself getting on .  the fat lady s in the way .  now .  can t you see us .    he muttered   it s some sort of illusion .     but you see it too  don t you .  that s why he calls this  what if .   it will show us what if .  what if the streetcar hadn t swerved  .   .   .    she was sure of it .  she was very excited and very sure of it .  as she looked at the picture in the glass slab  the late afternoon sunshine grew dimmer and the inchoate chatter of the passengers around and behind them began fading .   how she remembered that day .  norman knew georgette and had been about to surrender his seat to her when the car swerved and threw liwy into his lap .  it was such a ridiculously corny situation  but it had worked .  she had been so embarrassed that he was forced first into gallantry and then  into conversation .  an introduction from georgette was not even necessary .  by the time they got off the streetcar  he knew where she worked .   she could still remember georgette glowering at her  sulkily forcing a smile when they themselves separated .  georgette said   norman seems to like you .    livvy replied   oh  don t be silly .  he was just being polite .  but he is nice looking  isn t he .    it was only six months after that that they married .   and now here was that same streetcar again  with norman and herself and georgette .  as she thought that  the smooth train noises  the rapid clack clack of the wheels  vanished completely .  instead  she was in the swaying confines of the streetcar .  she had just boarded it with georgette at the previous stop .   liwy shifted weight with the swaying of the streetcar  as did forty others  sitting and standing  all to the same monotonous and rather ridiculous rhythm .  she said   somebody s motioning at you  georgette .  do you know him .     at me .   georgette directed a deliberately casual glance over her shoulder .  her artificially long eyelashes flickered .  she said   i know him a little .  what do you suppose he wants .     let s find out   said livvy .  she felt pleased and a little wicked .   georgette had a well known habit of hoarding her male acquaintances  and it was rather fun to annoy her this way .  and besides  this one seemed quite  .   .   .  interesting .   she snaked past the line of standees  and georgette followed without enthusiasm .  it was just as livvy arrived opposite the young man s seat that the streetcar lurched heavily as it rounded a curve .  liwy snatched desperately in the direction of the straps .  her fingertips caught and she held on .  it was a long moment before she could breathe .  for some reason  it had seemed that there were no straps close enough to be reached .  somehow  she felt that by all the laws of nature she should have fallen .   the young man did not look at her .  he was smiling at georgette and rising from his seat .  he had astonishing eyebrows that gave him a rather competent and self confident appearance .  liwy decided that she definitely liked him .   georgette was saying   oh no  don t bother .  we re getting off in about two stops .    they did .  livvy said   i thought we were going to sach s .     we are .  there s just something i remember having to attend to here .  it won t take but a minute .     next stop  providence .   the loud speakers were blaring .  the train was slowing and the world of the past had shrunk itself into the glass slab once more .  the little man was still smiling at them .   liwy turned to norman .  she felt a little frightened .   were you through all that  too .    he said   what happened to the time .  we can t be reaching providence yet .   he looked at his watch .   i guess we are .   then  to liwy   you didn t fall that time .     then you did see it .   she frowned .   now  that s like georgette .  i m sure there was no reason to get off the streetcar except to prevent my meeting you .  how long had you known georgette before then  norman .     not very long .  just enough to be able to recognize her at sight and to feel that i ought to offer her my seat .    liwy curled her lip .   norman grinned   you can t be jealous of a might have been  kid .  besides  what difference would it have made .  i d have been sufficiently interested in you to work out a way of meeting you .    .     you didn t even look at me .     i hardly had the chance .     then how would you have met me .     some way .  i don t know how .  but you ll admit this is a rather foolish argument we re having .    they were leaving providence .  liwy felt a trouble in her mind .  the little man had been following their whispered conversation  with only the loss of his smile to show that he understood .  she said to him   can you show us more .    norman interrupted   wait now  liwy .  what are you going to try to do .    she said   i want to see our wedding day .  what it would have been if i had caught the strap .    norman was visibly annoyed .   now  that s not fair .  we might not have been married on the same day  you know .    but she said   can you show it to me  mr .  if .   and the little man nodded .   the slab of glass was coming alive again  glowing a little .  then the light collected and condensed into figures .  a tiny sound of organ music was in liwy s ears without there actually being sound .   norman said with relief   well  there i am .  that s our wedding .  are you satisfied .    the train sounds were disappearing again  and the last thing liwy heard was her own voice saying   yes  there you are .  but where am i .    liwy was well back in the pews .  for a while she had not expected to attend at all .  in the past months she had drifted further and further away from georgette  without quite knowing why .  she had heard of her engagement only through a mutual friend  and  of course  it was to norman .  she remembered very clearly that day  six months before  when she had first  seen him on the streetcar .  it was the time georgette had so quickly snatched her out of sight .  she had met him since on several occasions  but each time georgette was with him  standing between .   well  she had no cause for resentment  the man was certainly none of hers .  georgette  she thought  looked more beautiful than she really was .  and he was very handsome indeed .   she felt sad and rather empty  as though something had gone wrong  something that she could not quite outline in her mind .  georgette had moved up the aisle without seeming to see her  but earlier she had caught his eyes and smiled at him .  liwy thought he had smiled in return .   she heard the words distantly as they drifted back to her   i now pronounce you    the noise of the train was back .  a woman swayed down the aisle  herding a little boy back to their seats .  there were intermittent bursts of girlish laughter from a set of four teenage girls halfway down the coach .  a conductor hurried past on some mysterious errand .   liwy was frozenly aware of it all .   she sat there  staring straight ahead  while the trees outside blended into a fuzzy  furious green and the telephone poles galloped past .   she said   it was she you married .    he stared at her for a moment and then one side of his mouth quirked a little .  he said lightly   i didn t really  olivia .  you re still my wife  you know .  just think about it for a few minutes .    she turned to him .   yes  you married me because i fell in your lap .  if i hadn t  you would have married georgette .  if she hadn t wanted you  you would have married someone else .  you would have married anybody .  so much for your jigsaw puzzle pieces .    norman said very slowly   well i ll be darned .   he put both hands to his head and smoothed down the straight hair over his ears where it had a tendency to tuft up .  for the moment it gave him the appearance of trying to hold his head together .  he said   now  look here  liwy  you re making a silly fuss over a stupid magician s trick .  you can t blame me for something i haven t done .     you would have done it .     how do you know .     you ve seen it .     i ve seen a ridiculous piece of of hypnotism  i suppose .   his voice suddenly raised itself into anger .  he turned to the little man opposite .   off with you  mr .  if  or whatever your name is .  get out of here .  we don t want you .  get out before i throw your little trick out the window and you after it .    liwy yanked at his elbow .   stop it .  stop it .  you re in a crowded train .    the little man shrank back into the comer of the seat as far as he could  go and held his little black bag behind him .  norman looked at him  then at liwy  then at the elderly lady across the way who was regarding him with patent disapproval .   he turned pink and bit back a pungent remark .  they rode in frozen silence to and through new london .   fifteen minutes past new london  norman said   liwy .    she said nothing .  she was looking out the window but saw nothing but the glass .   he said again   liwy .  liwy .  answer me .    she said dully   what do you want .    he said   look  this is all nonsense .  i don t know how the fellow does it  but even granting it s legitimate  you re not being fair .  why stop where you did .  suppose i had married georgette  do you suppose you would have stayed single .  for all i know  you were already married at the time of my supposed wedding .  maybe that s why i married georgette .     i wasn t married .     how do you know .     i would have been able to tell .  i knew what my own thoughts were .     then you would have been married within the next year .    liwy grew angrier .  the fact that a sane remnant within her clamored at the unreason of her anger did not soothe her .  it irritated her further  instead .  she said   and if i did  it would be no business of yours  certainly .     of course it wouldn t .  but it would make the point that in the world of reality we can t be held responsible for the  what ifs .      liwy s nostrils flared .  she said nothing .   norman said   look .  you remember the big new year s celebration at winnie s place year before last .     i certainly do .  you spilled a keg of alcohol all over me .     that s beside the point  and besides  it was only a cocktail shaker s worth .  what i m trying to say is that winnie is just about your best friend and had been long before you married me .     what of it .     georgette was a good friend of hers too  wasn t she .     yes .     all right  then .  you and georgette would have gone to the party regardless of which one of you i had married .  i would have had nothing to do with it .  let him show us the party as it would have been if i had married georgette  and i ll bet you d be there with either your fiance or your husband .    liwy hesitated .  she felt honestly afraid of just that .   he said   are you afraid to take the chance .    and that  of course  decided her .  she turned on him furiously .   no  i m not .  and i hope i am married .  there s no reason i should pine for you .  what s more  i d like to see what happens when you spill the shaker all over  georgette .  she ll fill both your ears for you  and in public  too .  i know her .  maybe you ll see a certain difference in the jigsaw pieces then .   she faced forward and crossed her arms angrily and firmly across her chest .   norman looked across at the little man  but there was no need to say anything .  the glass slab was on his lap already .  the sun slanted in from the west  and the white foam of hair that topped his head was edged with pink .   norman said tensely   ready .    liwy nodded and let the noise of the train slide away again .   liwy stood  a little flushed with recent cold  in the doorway .  she had just removed her coat  with its sprinkling of snow  and her bare arms were still rebelling at the touch of open air .   she answered the shouts that greeted her with  happy new years  of her own  raising her voice to make herself heard over the squealing of the radio .  georgette s shrill tones were almost the first thing she heard upon entering  and now she steered toward her .  she hadn t seen georgette  or norman  in weeks .   georgette lifted an eyebrow  a mannerism she had lately cultivated  and said   isn t anyone with you  olivia .   her eyes swept the immediate surroundings and then returned to liwy .   liwy said indifferently   i think dick will be around later .  there was something or other he had to do first .   she felt as indifferent as she sounded .   georgette smiled tightly .   well  norman s here .  that ought to keep you from being lonely  dear .  at least  it s turned out that way before .    and as she said so  norman sauntered in from the kitchen .  he had a cocktail shaker in his hand  and the rattling of ice cubes castanetted his words .   line up  you rioting revelers  and get a mixture that will really revel your riots  why  liwy .    he walked toward her  grinning his welcome   where ve you been keeping yourself .  i haven t seen you in twenty years  seems like .  what s the matter .  doesn t dick want anyone else to see you .     fill my glass  norman   said georgette sharply .    right away   he said  not looking at her .   do you want one too  liwy .  i ll get you a glass .   he turned  and everything happened at once .   liwy cried   watch out .   she saw it coming  even had a vague feeling that all this had happened before  but it played itself out inexorably .  his heel caught the edge of the carpet  he lurched  tried to right himself  and lost the cocktail shaker .  it seemed to jump out of his hands  and a pint of ice cold liquor drenched liwy from shoulder to hem .   she stood there  gasping .  the noises muted about her  and for a few intolerable moments she made futile brushing gestures at her gown  while norman kept repeating   damnation .   in rising tones .   georgette said coolly   it s too bad  liwy .  just one of those things .  i imagine the dress can t be very expensive .    liwy turned and ran .  she was in the bedroom  which was at least empty and relatively quiet .  by the light of the fringe shaded lamp on the dresser  she poked among the coats on the bed  looking for her own .   norman had come in behind her .   look  liwy  don t pay any attention to what she said .  i m really devilishly sorry .  i ll pay     that s all right .  it wasn t your fault .   she blinked rapidly and didn t look at him .   i ll just go home and change .     are you coming back .    .    i don t know .  i don t think so .     look  liwy  .   .   .   his warm fingers were on her shoulders   liwy felt a queer tearing sensation deep inside her  as though she were ripping away from clinging cobwebs and    and the train noises were back .   something did go wrong with the time when she was in there in the slab .  it was deep twilight now .  the train lights were on .  but it didn t matter .  she seemed to be recovering from the wrench inside her .   norman was rubbing his eyes with thumb and forefinger .   what happened .    liwy said   it just ended .  suddenly .    norman said uneasily   you know  we ll be putting into new haven soon .   he looked at his watch and shook his head .   liwy said wonderingly   you spilled it on me .     well  so i did in real life .     but in real life i was your wife .  you ought to have spilled it on georgette this time .  isn t that queer .   but she was thinking of norman pursuing her  his hands on her shoulders .   .   .   .   she looked up at him and said with warm satisfaction   i wasn t married .     no  you weren t .  but was that dick reinhardt you were going around with .     yes .     you weren t planning to marry him  were you  liwy .     jealous  norman .    norman looked confused .   of that .  of a slab of glass .  of course not .     i don t think i would have married him .    norman said   you know  i wish it hadn t ended when it did .  there was something that was about to happen  i think .   he stopped  then added slowly   it was as though i would rather have done it to anybody else in the room .     even to georgette .     i wasn t giving two thoughts to georgette .  you don t believe me  i suppose .     maybe i do .   she looked up at him .   i ve been silly  norman .  let s  let s live our real life .  let s not play with all the things that just might have been .    but he caught her hands .   no  liwy .  one last time .  let s see what we would have been doing right now  liwy .  this very minute .  if i had married georgette .    liwy was a little frightened .   let s not  norman .   she was thinking of his eyes  smiling hungrily at her as he held the shaker  while georgette stood beside her  unregarded .  she didn t want to know what happened afterward .  she just wanted this life now  this good life .   new haven came and went .   norman said again   i want to try  liwy .    she said   if you want to  norman .   she decided fiercely that it wouldn t matter .  nothing would matter .  her hands reached out and encircled his arm .  she held it tightly  and while she held it she thought   nothing in the make believe can take him from me .    norman said to the little man   set  em up again .    in the yellow light the process seemed to be slower .  gently the frosted slab cleared  like clouds being torn apart and dispersed by an unfelt wind .   norman was saying   there s something wrong .  that s just the two of us  exactly as we are now .    he was right .  two little figures were sitting in a train on the seats which were farthest toward the front .  the field was enlarging now they were merging into it .  norman s voice was distant and fading .    it s the same train   he was saying .   the window in back is cracked just as    liwy was blindingly happy .  she said   i wish we were in new york .    he said   it will be less than an hour  darling .   then he said   i m going to kiss you .   he made a movement  as though he were about to begin .    not here .  oh  norman  people are looking .    norman drew back .  he said   we should have taken a taxi .     from boston to new york .     sure .  the privacy would have been worth it .    she laughed .   you re funny when you try to act ardent .     it isn t an act .   his voice was suddenly a little somber .   it s not just an hour  you know .  i feel as though i ve been waiting five years .     i do  too .     why couldn t i have met you first .  it was such a waste .     poor georgette   liwy sighed .   norman moved impatiently .   don t be sorry for her  liwy .  we never really made a go of it .  she was glad to get rid of me .     i know that .  that s why i say  poor georgette .   i m just sorry for her for not being able to appreciate what she had .     well  see to it that you do   he said .   see to it that you re immensely appreciative  infinitely appreciative or more than that  see that you re at least half as appreciative as i am of what i ve got .     or else you ll divorce me  too .     over my dead body   said norman .   liwy said   it s all so strange .  i keep thinking   what if you hadn t spilt the cocktails on me that time at the party .   you wouldn t have followed me out  you wouldn t have told me  i wouldn t have known .  it would have been so different  .   .   .  everything .     nonsense .  it would have been just the same .  it would have all happened another time .     i wonder   said liwy softly .   train noises merged into train noises .  city lights flickered outside  and the atmosphere of new york was about them .  the coach was astir with travelers dividing the baggage among themselves .   liwy was an island in the turmoil until norman shook her .   she looked at him and said   the jigsaw pieces fit after all .    he said   yes .    she put a hand on his .   but it wasn t good  just the same .  i was very wrong .  i thought that because we had each other  we should have all the possible each others .  but all the possibles are none of our business .  the real is enough .  do you know what i mean .    he nodded .   she said   there are millions of other what ifs .  i don t want to know what happened in any of them .  i ll never say  what if again .    norman said   relax  dear .  here s your coat .   and he reached for the suitcases .   liwy said with sudden sharpness   where s mr .  if .    norman turned slowly to the empty seat that faced them .  together they scanned the rest of the coach .    maybe   norman said   he went into the next coach .     but why .  besides  he wouldn t leave his hat .   and she bent to pick it up .   norman said   what hat .    and liwy stopped her fingers hovering over nothingness .  she said   it was here i almost touched it .   she straightened and said   oh  norman  what if    norman put a finger on her mouth .   darling  .   .   .    she said   i m sorry .  here  let me help you with the suitcases .    the train dived into the tunnel beneath park avenue  and the noise of the wheels rose to a roar .   sally  sally was coming down the lake road  so i waved to her and called her by name .  i always liked to see sally .  i liked all of them  you understand  but sally s the prettiest one of the lot .  there just isn t any question about it .   she moved a little faster when i waved to her .  nothing undignified .  she was never that .  she moved just enough faster to show that she was glad to see me  too .   i turned to the man standing beside me .   that s sally   i said .   he smiled at me and nodded .   mrs .  hester had brought him in .  she said   this is mr .  gellhorn  jake .  you remember he sent you the letter asking for an appointment .    that was just talk  really .  i have a million things to do around the farm  and one thing   just can t waste my time on is mail .  that s why i have mrs .  hester around .  she lives pretty close by  she s good at attending to foolishness without running to me about it  and most of all  she likes sally and the rest .  some people don t .    glad to see you  mr .  gellhorn   i said .    raymond f .  gellhorn   he said  and gave me his hand  which i shook and gave back .   he was a largish fellow  half a head taller than i and wider  too .  he was about half my age  thirtyish .  he had black hair  plastered down slick  with a part in the middle  and a thin mustache  very neatly trimmed .  his jawbones got big under his ears and made him look as if he had a slight case of  copyright        .  by ziff davis publishing company .   mumps .  on video he d be a natural to play the villain  so i assumed he was a nice fellow .  it goes to show that video can t be wrong all the time .    i m jacob folkers   i said .   what can i do for you .    he grinned .  it was a big  wide  white toothed grin .   you can tell me a little about your farm here  if you don t mind .    i heard sally coming up behind me and i put out my hand .  she slid right into it and the feel of the hard  glossy enamel of her fender was warm in my palm .    a nice automatobile   said gellhorn .   that s one way of putting it .  sally was a      convertible with a hennis carleton positronic motor and an armat chassis .  she had the cleanest  finest lines i ve ever seen on any model  bar none .  for five years  she d been my favorite  and i d put everything into her i could dream up .  in all that time  there d never been a human being behind her wheel .   not once .    sally   i said  patting her gently   meet mr .  gellhorn .    sally s cylinder purr keyed up a little .  i listened carefully for any knocking .  lately  i d been hearing motor knock in almost all the cars and changing the gasoline hadn t done a bit of good .  sally was as smooth as her paint job this time  however .    do you have names for all your cars .   asked gellhorn .   he sounded amused  and mrs .  hester doesn t like people to sound as though they were making fun of the farm .  she said  sharply   certainly .  the cars have real personalities  don t they  jake .  the seda ns are all males and the convertibles are females .    gellhorn was smiling again .   and do you keep them in separate garages  ma am .    mrs .  hester glared at him .   gellhorn said to me   and now i wonder if i can talk to you alone  mr .  folkers .     that depends   i said .   are you a reporter .     no  sir .  i m a sales agent .  any talk we have is not for publication .  i assure you i am interested in strict privacy .     let s walk down the road a bit .  there s a bench we can use .    we started down .  mrs .  hester walked away .  sally nudged along after us .   i said   you don t mind if sally comes along  do you .     not at all .  she can t repeat what we say  can she .   he laughed at his own joke  reached over and rubbed sally s grille .  i  sally raced her motor and gellhorn s hand drew away quickly  a    she s not used to strangers   i explained .     we sat down on the bench under the big oak tree where we could look across the small lake to the private speedway .  it was the warm part of the day and the cars were out in force  at least thirty of them .  even at this distance i could see that jeremiah was pulling his usual stunt of sneaking up  behind some staid older model  then putting on a jerk of speed and yowling past with deliberately squealing brakes .  two weeks before he had crowded old angus off the asphalt altogether  and i had turned off his motor for two days .   it didn t help though  i m afraid  and it looks as though there s nothing to be done about it .  jeremiah is a sports model to begin with and that kind is awfully hot headed .    well  mr .  gellhorn   i said .   could you tell me why you want the information .    but he was just looking around .  he said   this is an amazing place  mr .  folkers .     i wish you d call me jake .  everyone does .     all right  jake .  how many cars do you have here .     fifty one .  we get one or two new ones every year .  one year we got five .  we haven t lost one yet .  they re all in perfect running order .  we even have a     model mat o mot in working order .  one of the original automatics .  it was the first car here .    good old matthew .  he stayed in the garage most of the day now  but then he was the granddaddy of all positronic motored cars .  those were the days when blind war veterans  paraplegics and heads of state were the only ones who drove automatics .  but samson harridge was my boss and he was rich enough to be able to get one .  i was his chauffeur at the time .   the thought makes me feel old .  i can remember when there wasn t an automobile in the world with brains enough to find its own way home .  i chauffeured dead lumps of machines that needed a man s hand at their controls every minute .  every year machines like that used to kill tens of thousands of people .   the automatics fixed that .  a positronic brain can react much faster than a human one  of course  and it paid people to keep hands off the controls .  you got in  punched your destination and let it go its own way .   we take it for granted now  but i remember when the first laws came out forcing the old machines off the highways and limiting travel to automatics .  lord  what a fuss .  they called it everything from communism to fascism  but it emptied the highways and stopped the killing  and still more people get around more easily the new way .   of course  the automatics were ten to a hundred times as expensive as the hand driven ones  and there weren t many that could afford a private vehicle .  the industry specialized in turning out omni bus automatics .  you could always call a company and have one stop at your door in a matter of minutes and take you where you wanted to go .  usually  you had to drive with others who were going your way  but what s wrong with that .   samson harridge had a private car though  and i went to him the minute it arrived .  the car wasn t matthew to me then .  i didn t know it was going to  be the dean of the farm some day .  i only knew it was taking my job away and i hated it .   i said   you won t be needing me any more  mr .  harridge .    he said   what are you dithering about  jake .  you don t think i ll trust myself to a contraption like that  do you .  you stay right at the controls .    i said   but it works by itself  mr .  harridge .  it scans the road  reacts properly to obstacles  humans  and other cars  and remembers routes to travel .     so they say .  so they say .  just the same  you re sitting right behind the wheel in case anything goes wrong .    funny how you can get to like a car .  in no time i was calling it matthew and was spending all my time keeping it polished and humming .  a positronic brain stays in condition best when it s got control of its chassis at all times  which means it s worth keeping the gas tank filled so that the motor can turn over slowly day and night .  after a while  it got so i could tell by the sound of the motor how matthew felt .   in his own way  harridge grew fond of matthew  too .  he had no one else to like .  he d divorced or outlived three wives and outlived five children and three grandchildren .  so when he died  maybe it wasn t surprising that he had his estate converted into a farm for retired automobiles  with me in charge and matthew the first member of a distinguished line .   it s turned out to be my life .  i never got married .  you can t get married and still tend to automatics the way you should .   the newspapers thought it was funny  but after a while they stopped joking about it .  some things you can t joke about .  maybe you ve never been able to afford an automatic and maybe you never will  either  but take it from me  you get to love them .  they re hard working and affectionate .  it takes a man with no heart to mistreat one or to see one mistreated .   it got so that after a man had an automatic for a while  he would make provisions for having it left to the farm  if he didn t have an heir he could rely on to give it good care .   i explained that to gellhorn .   he said   fifty one cars .  that represents a lot of money .     fifty thousand minimum per automatic  original investment   i said .   they re worth a lot more now .  i ve done things for them .     it must take a lot of money to keep up the farm .     you re right there .  the farm s a non profit organization  which gives us a break on taxes and  of course  new automatics that come in usually have trust funds attached .  still  costs are always going up .  i have to keep the place landscaped  i keep laying down new asphalt and keeping the old in repair  there s gasoline  oil  repairs  and new gadgets .  it adds up .     and you ve spent a long time at it .     i sure have  mr .  gellhorn .  thirty three years .     you don t seem to be getting much out of it yourself .     i don t .  you surprise me  mr .  gellhorn .  i ve got sally and fifty others .  look at her .    i was grinning .  i couldn t help it .  sally was so clean  it almost hurt .  some insect must have died on her windshield or one speck of dust too many had landed  so she was going to work .  a little tube protruded and spurted tergosol over the glass .  it spread quickly over the silicone surface film and squeejees snapped into place instantly  passing over the windshield and forcing the .  water into the little channel that led it  dripping  down to the ground .  not a speck of water got onto her glistening apple green hood .  squeejee and detergent tube snapped back into place and disappeared .   gellhorn said   i never saw an automatic do that .     i guess not   i said .   i fixed that up specially on our cars .  they re clean .  they re always scrubbing their glass .  they like it .  i ve even got sally fixed up with wax jets .  she polishes herself every night till you can see your face in any part of her and shave by it .  if i can scrape up the money  i d be putting it on the rest of the girls .  convertibles are very vain .     i can tell you how to scrape up the money  if that interests you .     that always does .  how .     isn t it obvious  fake .  any of your cars is worth fifty thousand minimum  you said .  i ll bet most of them top six figures .     so .     ever think of selling a few .    i shook my head .   you don t realize it  i guess  mr .  gellhorn  but i can t sell any of these .  they belong to the farm  not to me .     the money would go to the farm .     the incorporation papers of the farm provide that the cars receive perpetual care .  they can t be sold .     what about the motors  then .     i don t understand you .    gellhorn shifted position and his voice got confidential .   look here  jake  let me explain the situation .  there s a big market for private automatics if they could only be made cheaply enough .  right .     that s no secret .     and ninety five per cent of the cost is the motor .  right .  now  i know where we can get a supply of bodies .  i also know where we can sell automatics at a good price twenty or thirty thousand for the cheaper models  maybe fifty or sixty for the better ones .  all i need are the motors .  you see the solution .     i don t  mr .  gellhorn .   i did  but i wanted him to spell it out .    it s right here .  you ve got fifty one of them .  you re an expert auto matobile mechanic  jake .  you must be .  you could unhook a motor and place it in another car so that no one would know the difference .     it wouldn t be exactly ethical .     you wouldn t be harming the cars .  you d be doing them a favor .  use your older cars .  use that old mat o mot .     well  now  wait a while  mr .  gellhorn .  the motors and bodies aren t two separate items .  they re a single unit .  those motors are used to their own bodies .  they wouldn t be happy in another car .     all right  that s a point .  that s a very good point  jake .  it would be like taking your mind and putting it in someone else s skull .  right .  you don t think you would like that .     i don t think i would .  no .     but what if i took your mind and put it into the body of a young athlete .  what about that  jake .  you re not a youngster anymore .  if you had the chance  wouldn t you enjoy being twenty again .  that s what i m offering some of your positronic motors .  they ll be put into new     bodies .  the latest construction .    i laughed .   that doesn t make much sense  mr .  gellhorn .  some of our cars may be old  but they re well cared for .  nobody drives them .  they re allowed their own way .  they re retired  mr .  gellhorn .  i wouldn t want a twenty year old body if it meant i had to dig ditches for the rest of my new life and never have enough to eat .   .   .   .  what do you think  sally .    sally s two doors opened and then shut with a cushioned slam .    what that .   said gellhorn .    that s the way sally laughs .    gellhorn forced a smile .  i guess he thought i was making a bad joke .  he said   talk sense  jake .  cars are made to be driven .  they re probably not happy if you don t drive them .    i said   sally hasn t been driven in five years .  she looks happy to me .     i wonder .    he got up and walked toward sally slowly .   hi  sally  how d you like a drive .    sally s motor revved up .  she backed away .    don t push her  mr .  gellhorn   i said .   she s liable to be a little skittish .    two sedans were about a hundred yards up the road .  they had stopped .  maybe  in their own way  they were watching .  i didn t bother about them .  i had my eyes on sally  and i kept them there .   gellhorn said   steady now  sally .   he lunged out and seized the door handle .  it didn t budge  of course .   he said   it opened a minute ago .    i said   automatic lock .  she s got a sense of privacy  sally has .    he let go  then said  slowly and deliberately   a car with a sense of privacy shouldn t go around with its top down .    he stepped back three or four paces  then quickly  so quickly i couldn t take a step to stop him  he ran forward and vaulted into the car .  he caught  sally completely by surprise  because as he came down  he shut off the ignition before she could lock it in place .   for the first time in five years  sally s motor was dead .   i think i yelled  but gellhorn had the switch on  manual  and locked that in place  too .  he kicked the motor into action .  sally was alive again but she had no freedom of action .   he started up the road .  the sedans were still there .  they turned and drifted away  not very quickly .    suppose it was all a puzzle to them .   one was giuseppe  from the milan factories  and the other was stephen .  they were always together .  they were both new at the farm  but they d been here long enough to know that our cars just didn t have drivers .   gellhorn went straight on  and when the sedans finally got it through their heads that sally wasn t going to slow down  that she couldn t slow down  it was too late for anything but desperate measures .   they broke for it  one to each side  and sally raced between them like a streak .  steve crashed through the lakeside fence and rolled to a halt on the grass and mud not six inches from the water s edge .  giuseppe bumped along the land side of the road to a shaken halt .   i had steve back on the highway and was trying to find out what harm  if any  the fence had done him  when gellhorn came back .   gellhorn opened sally s door and stepped out .  leaning back  he shut off the ignition a second time .    there   he said .   i think i did her a lot of good .    i held my temper .   why did you dash through the sedans .  there was no reason for that .     i kept expecting them to turn out .     they did .  one went through a fence .     i m sorry  jake   he said .   i thought they d move more quickly .  you know how it is .  i ve been in lots of buses  but i ve only been in a private automatic two or three times in my life  and this is the first time i ever drove one .  that just shows you  jake .  it got me  driving one  and i m pretty hard boiled .  i tell you  we don t have to go more than twenty per cent below list price to reach a good market  and it would be ninety per cent profit .     which we would split .     fifty fifty .  and i take all the risks  remember .     all right .  i listened to you .  now you listen to me .   i raised my voice because i was just too mad to be polite anymore .   when you turn off sally s motor  you hurt her .  how would you like to be kicked unconscious .  that s what you do to sally  when you turn her off .     you re exaggerating  jake .  the automatobuses get turned off every night .     sure  that s why i want none of my boys or girls in your fancy     bodies  where i won t know what treatment they ll get .  buses need major repairs in their positronic circuits every couple of years .  old matthew hasn t had his  circuits touched in twenty years .  what can you offer him compared with that .     well  you re excited now .  suppose you think over my proposition when you ve cooled down and get in touch with me .     i ve thought it over all i want to .  if i ever see you again  i ll call the police .    his mouth got hard and ugly .  he said   just a minute  old timer .    i said   just a minute  you .  this is private property and i m ordering you off .    he shrugged .   well  then  goodbye .    i said   mrs .  hester will see you off the property .  make that goodbye permanent .    but it wasn t permanent .  i saw him again two days later .  two and a half days  rather  because it was about noon when i saw him first and a little after midnight when i saw him again .   i sat up in bed when he turned the light on  blinking blindly till i made out what was happening .  once i could see  it didn t take much explaining .  in fact  it took none at all .  he had a gun in his right fist  the nasty little needle barrel just visible between two fingers .  i knew that all he had to do was to increase the pressure of his hand and i would be torn apart .    he said   put on your clothes  jake .    i didn t move .  i just watched him .   he said   look  jake  i know the situation .  i visited you two days ago  remember .  you have no guards on this place  no electrified fences  no warning signals .  nothing .    i said   i don t need any .  meanwhile there s nothing to stop you from leaving  mr .  gellhorn .  i would if i were you .  this place can be very dangerous .    he laughed a little .   it is  for anyone on the wrong side of a fist gun .     i see it   i said .   i know you ve got one .     then get a move on .  my men are waiting .     no  sir  mr .  gellhorn .  not unless you tell me what you want  and probably not then .     i made you a proposition day before yesterday .     the answer s still no .     there s more to the proposition now .  i ve come here with some men and an automatobus .  you have your chance to come with me and disconnect twenty five of the positronic motors .  i don t care which twenty five you choose .  we ll load them on the bus and take them away .  once they re disposed of  i ll see to it that you get your fair share of the money .     i have your word on that  i suppose .    he didn t act as if he thought i was being sarcastic .  he said   you have .    i said   no .     if you insist on saying no  we ll go about it in our own way .  i ll disconnect the motors myself  only i ll disconnect all fifty one .  every one of them .     it isn t easy to disconnect positronic motors  mr .  gellhom .  are you a robotics expert .  even if you are  you know  these motors have been modified by me .     i know that  jake .  and to be truthful  i m not an expert .  i may ruin quite a few motors trying to get them out .  that s why i ll have to work over all fifty one if you don t cooperate .  you see  i may only end up with twenty five when i m through .  the first few i ll tackle will probably suffer the most .  till i get the hang of it  you see .  and if i go it myself  i think i ll put sally first in line .    i said   i can t believe you re serious  mr .  gellhorn .    he said   i m serious  jake .   he let it all dribble in .   if you want to help  you can keep sally .  otherwise  she s liable to be hurt very badly .  sorry .    i said       come with you  but i ll give you one more warning .  you ll be in trouble  mr .  gellhorn .    he thought that was very funny .  he was laughing very quietly as we went down the stairs together .   there was an automatobus waiting outside the driveway to the garage apartments .  the shadows of three men waited beside it  and their flash beams went on as we approached .   gellhorn said in a low voice   i ve got the old fellow .  come on .  move the truck up the drive and let s get started .    one of the others leaned in and punched the proper instructions on the control panel .  we moved up the driveway with the bus following submissively .    it won t go inside the garage   i said .   the door won t take it .  we don t have buses here .  only private cars .     all right   said gellhorn .   pull it over onto the grass and keep it out of sight .    i could hear the thrumming of the cars when we were still ten yards from the garage .   usually they quieted down if i entered the garage .  this time they didn t .  i think they knew that strangers were about  and once the faces of gellhorn and the others were visible they got noisier .  each motor was a warm rumble  and each motor was knocking irregularly until the place rattled .   the lights went up automatically as we stepped inside .  gellhorn didn t seem bothered by the car noise  but the three men with him looked surprised and uncomfortable .  they had the look of the hired thug about them  a look that was not compounded of physical features so much as of a certain wariness of eye and hang dogness of face .  i knew the type and i wasn t worried .   it one of them said   damn it  they re burning gas .     i .   my cars always do   i replied stiffly .    not tonight   said gellhorn .   turn them off .     it s not that easy  mr .  gellhorn   i said .     get started .   he said .   i stood there .  he had his fist gun pointed at me steadily .  i said   i told you  mr .  gellhom  that my cars have been well treated while they ve been at the farm .  they re used to being treated that way  and they resent anything else .     you have one minute   he said .   lecture me some other time .     i m trying to explain something .  i m trying to explain that my cars can understand what i say to them .  a positronic motor will learn to do that with time and patience .  my cars have learned .  sally understood your proposition two days ago .  you ll remember she laughed when i asked her opinion .  she also knows what you did to her and so do the two sedans you scattered .  and the rest know what to do about trespassers in general .     look  you crazy old fool     all i have to say is   i raised my voice .   get them .    one of the men turned pasty and yelled  but his voice was drowned completely in the sound of fifty one horns turned loose at once .  they held their notes  and within the four walls of the garage the echoes rose to a wild  metallic call .  two cars rolled forward  not hurriedly  but with no possible mistake as to their target .  two cars fell in line behind the first two .  all the cars were stirring in their separate stalls .   the thugs stared  then backed .   i shouted   don t get up against a wall .    apparently  they had that instinctive thought themselves .  they rushed madly for the door of the garage .   at the door one of gellhorn s men turned  brought up a fist gun of his own .  the needle pellet tore a thin  blue flash toward the first car .  the car was giuseppe .   a thin line of paint peeled up giuseppe s hood  and the right half of his windshield crazed and splintered but did not break through .   the men were out the door  running  and two by two the cars crunched out after them into the night  their horns calling the charge .   i kept my hand on gellhorn s elbow  but i don t think he could have moved in any case .  his lips were trembling .   i said   that s why i don t need electrified fences or guards .  my property protects itself .    gellhorn s eyes swiveled back and forth in fascination as  pair by pair  they whizzed by .  he said   they re killers .     don t be silly .  they won t kill your men .     they re killers .     they ll just give your men a lesson .  my cars have been specially trained  for cross country pursuit for just such an occasion  i think what your men will get will be worse than an outright quick kill .  have you ever been chased by an automatobile .    gellhorn didn t answer .   i went on .    didn t want him to miss a thing .   they ll be shadows going no faster than your men  chasing them here  blocking them there  blaring at them  dashing at them  missing with a screech of brake and a thunder of motor .   they ll keep it up till your men drop  out of breath and half dead  waiting for the wheels to crunch over their breaking bones .  the cars won t do that .  they ll turn away .  you can bet  though  that your men will never return here in their lives .  not for all the money you or ten like you could give them .  listen    i tightened my hold on his elbow .  he strained to hear .   i said   don t you hear car doors slamming .    it was faint and distant  but unmistakable .   i said   they re laughing .  they re enjoying themselves .    his face crumpled with rage .  he lifted his hand .  he was still holding his fist gun .   i said   i wouldn t .  one automatocar is still with us .    i don t think he had noticed sally till then .  she had moved up so quietly .  though her right front fender nearly touched me  i couldn t hear her motor .  she might have been holding her breath .   gellhorn yelled .   i said   she won t touch you  as long as i m with you .  but if you kill me .   .   .   .  you know  sally doesn t like you .    gellhorn turned the gun in sally s direction .    her motor is shielded   i said   and before you could ever squeeze the gun a second time she would be on top of you .     all right  then   he yelled  and suddenly my arm was bent behind my back and twisted so i could hardly stand .  he held me between sally and himself  and his pressure didn t let up .   back out with me and don t try to break loose  old timer  or i ll tear your arm out of its socket .    i had to move .  sally nudged along with us  worried  uncertain what to do .  i tried to say something to her and couldn t .  i could only clench my teeth and moan .   gellhorn s automatobus was still standing outside the garage .  i was forced in .  gellhorn jumped in after me  locking the doors .   he said   all right  now .  we ll talk sense .    i was rubbing my arm  trying to get life back into it  and even as i did i was automatically and without any conscious effort studying the control board of the bus .   i said   this is a rebuilt job .     so .   he said caustically .   it s a sample of my work .  i picked up a dis   ifcfrded chassis  found a brain i could use and spliced me a private bus .  what    fit .        i tore at the repair panel  forcing it aside .   he said   what the hell .  get away from that .   the side of his palm came down numbingly on my left shoulder .   i struggled with him .   i don t want to do this bus any harm .  what kind of a person do you think i am .  i just want to take a look at some of the motor connections .    it didn t take much of a look .  i was boiling when i turned to him .  i said   you re a hound and a bastard .  you had no right installing this motor yourself .  why didn t you get a robotics man .    he said   do i look crazy .     even if it was a stolen motor  you had no right to treat it so .  i wouldn t treat a man the way you treated that motor .  solder  tape  and pinch ckmps .  it s brutal .     it works  doesn t it .     sure it works  but it must be hell for the bus .  you could live with migraine headaches and acute arthritis  but it wouldn t be much of a life .  this car is suffering .     shut up .   for a moment he glanced out the window at sally  who had rolled up as close to the bus as she could .  he made sure the doors and windows were locked .   he said   we re getting out of here now  before the other cars come back .  we ll stay away .     how will that help you .     your cars will run out of gas someday  won t they .  you haven t got them fixed up so they can tank up on their own  have you .  we ll come back and finish the job .     they ll be looking for me   i said .   mrs .  hester will call the police .    he was past reasoning with .  he just punched the bus in gear .  it lurched forward .  sally followed .   he giggled .   what can she do if you re here with me .    sally seemed to realize that  too .  she picked up speed  passed us and was gone .  gellhorn opened the window next to him and spat through the opening .   the bus lumbered on over the dark road  its motor rattling unevenly .  gellhorn dimmed the periphery light until the phosphorescent green stripe down the middle of the highway  sparkling in the moonlight  was all that kept us out of the trees .  there was virtually no traffic .  two cars passed ours  going the other way  and there was none at all on our side of the highway  either before or behind .   i heard the door slamming first .  quick and sharp in the silence  first on the right and then on the left gellhorn s hands quivered as he punched savagely for increased speed .  a beam of light shot out from among a scrub  of trees  blinding us  another beam plunged at us from behind the guard rails on the other side .  at a crossover  four hundred yards ahead  there was sque e e e e as a car darted across our path .    sally went for the rest   i said .   i think you re surrounded .     so what .  what can they do .    he hunched over the controls  peering through the windshield .    and don t you try anything  old timer   he muttered .   i couldn t .  i was bone weary  my left arm was on fire .  the motor sounds gathered and grew closer .  i could hear the motors missing in odd patterns  suddenly it seemed to me that my cars were speaking to one another .   a medley of horns came from behind .  i turned and gellhom looked quickly into the rear view mirror .  a dozen cars were following in both lanes .   gellhorn yelled and laughed madly .   i cried   stop .  stop the car .    because not a quarter of a mile ahead  plainly visible in the light beams of two sedans on the roadside was sally  her trim body plunked square across the road .  two cars shot into the opposite lane to our left  keeping perfect time with us and preventing gellhom from turning out .   but he had no intention of turning out .  he put his finger on the full speed ahead button and kept it there .   he said   there ll be no bluffing here .  this bus outweighs her five to one  old timer  and we ll just push her off the road like a dead kitten .    i knew he could .  the bus was on manual and his finger was on the button .  i knew he would .   i lowered the window  and stuck my head out .   sally   i screamed .   get out of the way .  sally .    it was drowned out in the agonized squeal of maltreated brakebands .  i felt myself thrown forward and heard gellhorn s breath puff out of his body .   i said   what happened .   it was a foolish question .  we had stopped .  that was what had happened .  sally and the bus were five feet apart .  with five times her weight tearing down on her  she had not budged .  the guts of her .   gellhorn yanked at the manual toggle switch .   it s got to   he kept muttering .   it s got to .    i said   not the way you hooked up the motor  expert .  any of the circuits could cross over .    he looked at me with a tearing anger and growled deep in his throat .  his hair was matted over his forehead .  he lifted his fist .    that s all the advice out of you there ll ever be  old timer .    and i knew the needle gun was about to fire .   i pressed back against the bus door  watching the fist come up  and when the door opened i went over backward and out  hitting the ground with a thud .  i heard the door slam closed again .   i got to my knees and looked up in time to see gellhorn struggle uselessly  with the closing window  then aim his fist gun quickly through the glass .  he never fired .  the bus got under way with a tremendous roar  and gellhorn lurched backward .   sally wasn t in the way any longer  and i watched the bus s rear lights flicker away down the highway .   i was exhausted .  i sat down right there  right on the highway  and put my head down in my crossed arms  trying to catch my breath .   i heard a car stop gently at my side .  when i looked up  it was sally .  slowly lovingly  you might say her front door opened .   no one had driven sally for five years except gellhorn  of course and i know how valuable such freedom was to a car .  i appreciated the gesture  but i said   thanks  sally  but i ll take one of the newer cars .    i got up and turned away  but skillfully and neatly as a pirouette  she wheeled before me again .  i couldn t hurt her feelings .  i got in .  her front seat had the fine  fresh scent of an automatobile that kept itself spotlessly clean .  i lay down across it  thankfully  and with even  silent  and rapid efficiency  my boys and girls brought me home .   mrs .  hester brought me the copy of the radio transcript the next evening with great excitement .    it s mr .  gellhorn   she said .   the man who came to see you .     what about him .    i dreaded her answer .    they found him dead   she said .   imagine that .  just lying dead in a ditch .      it might be a stranger altogether   i mumbled .    raymond j .  gellhorn   she said  sharply .   there can t be two  can there .  the description fits  too .  lord  what a way to die .  they found tire marks on his arms and body .  imagine .  i m glad it turned out to be a bus  otherwise they might have come poking around here .     did it happen near here .   i asked  anxiously .    no  .   .   .  near cooksville .  but  goodness  read about it yourself if you  what happened to giuseppe .    i welcomed the diversion .  giuseppe was waiting patiently for me to complete the repaint job .  his windshield had been replaced .   after she left  i snatched up the transcript .  there was no doubt about it .  the doctor reported he had been running and was in a state of totally spent exhaustion .  i wondered for how many miles the bus had played with him before the final lunge .  the transcript had no notion of anything like that  of course .   they had located the bus and identified it by the tire tracks .  the police had it and were trying to trace its ownership .   there was an editorial in the transcript about it .  it had been the first  traffic fatality in the state for that year and the paper warned strenuously against manual driving after night .   there was no mention of gellhorn s three thugs and for that  at least  i was grateful .  none of our cars had been seduced by the pleasure of the chase into killing .   that was all .  i let the paper drop .  gellhorn had been a criminal .  his treatment of the bus had been brutal .  there was no question in my mind he deserved death .  but still i felt a bit queasy over the manner of it .   a month has passed now and i can t get it out of my mind .   my cars talk to one another .  i have no doubt about it anymore .  it s as though they ve gained confidence  as though they re not bothering to keep it secret anymore .  their engines rattle and knock continuously .   and they don t talk among themselves only .  they talk to the cars and buses that come into the farm on business .  how long have they been doing that .   they must be understood  too .  gellhorn s bus understood them  for all it hadn t been on the grounds more than an hour .  i can close my eyes and bring back that dash along the highway  with our cars flanking the bus on either side  clacking their motors at it till it understood  stopped  let me out  and ran off with gellhorn .   did my cars tell him to kill gellhorn .  or was that his idea .   can cars have such ideas .  the motor designers say no .  but they mean under ordinary conditions .  have they foreseen everything .    cars get ill used  you know .   some of them enter the farm and observe .  they get told things .  they find out that cars exist whose motors are never stopped  whom no one ever drives  whose every need is supplied .   then maybe they go out and tell others .  maybe the word is spreading quickly .  maybe they re going to think that the farm way should be the way all over the world .  they don t understand .  you couldn t expect them to understand about legacies and the whims of rich men .   there are millions of automatobiles on earth  tens of millions .  if the thought gets rooted in them that they re slaves  that they should do something about it  .  .  .  if they begin to think the way gellhorn s bus did .   .   .   .   maybe it won t be till after my time .  and then they ll have to keep a few of us to take care of them  won t they .  they wouldn t kill us all .   and maybe they would .  maybe they wouldn t understand about how someone would have to care for them .  maybe they won t wait .   every morning i wake up and think  maybe today .   .   .   .   i don t get as much pleasure out of my cars as i used to .  lately  i notice that i m even beginning to avoid sally .   flies   flies .   said kendell casey  wearily .  he swung his arm .  the fly circled  returned and nestled on casey s shirt collar .   from somewhere there sounded the buzzing of a second fly .   dr .  john polen covered the slight uneasiness of his chin by moving his cigarette quickly to his lips .   he said   i didn t expect to meet you  casey .  or you  winthrop .  or ought i call you reverend winthrop .     ought i call you professor polen .   said winthrop  carefully striking the proper vein of rich toned friendship .   they were trying to snuggle into the cast off shell of twenty years back  each of them .  squirming and cramming and not fitting .   damn  thought polen fretfully  why do people attend college reunions .   casey s hot blue eyes were still filled with the aimless anger of the college sophomore who has discovered intellect  frustration  and the tag ends of cynical philosophy all at once .   casey .  bitter man of the campus .   he hadn t outgrown that .  twenty years later and it was casey  bitter ex man of the campus .  polen could see that in the way his finger tips moved aimlessly and in the manner of his spare body .   as for winthrop .  well  twenty years older  softer  rounder .  skin pinker  eyes milder .  yet no nearer the quiet certainty he would never find .  it was all there in the quick smile he never entirely abandoned  as though he feared  copyright         by fantasy house  inc .   there would be nothing to take its place  that its absence would turn his face into a smooth and featureless flesh .   polen was tired of reading the aimless flickering of a muscle s end  tired of usurping the place of his machines  tired of the too much they told him .   could they read him as he read them .  could the small restlessness of his own eyes broadcast the fact that he was damp with the disgust that had bred mustily within him .   damn  thought polen  why didn t i stay away .   they stood there  all three  waiting for one another to say something  to flick something from across the gap and bring it  quivering  into the present .   polen tried it .  he said   are you still working in chemistry  casey .     in my own way  yes   said casey  gruffly .   i m not the scientist you re considered to be .  i do research on insecticides for e .  j .  link at chatham .    winthrop said   are you really .  you said you would work on insecticides .  remember  polen .  and with all that  the flies dare still be after you  casey .    casey said   can t get rid of them .  i m the best proving ground in the labs .  no compound we ve made keeps them away when i m around .  someone once said it was my odor .  i attract them .    polen remembered the someone who had said that .   winthrop said   or else    polen felt it coming .  he tensed .    or else   said winthrop   it s the curse  you know .   his smile intensified to show that he was joking  that he forgave past grudges .   damn  thought polen  they haven t even changed the words .  and the past came back .    flies   said casey  swinging his arm  and slapping .   ever see such a thing .  why don t they light on you two .    johnny polen laughed at him .  he laughed often then .   it s something in your body odor  casey .  you could be a boon to science .  find out the nature of the odorous chemical  concentrate it  mix it with ddt  and you ve got the best fly killer in the world .     a fine situation .  what do i smell like .  a lady fly in heat .  it s a shame they have to pick on me when the whole damned world s a dung heap .    winthrop frowned and said with a faint flavor of rhetoric   beauty is not the only thing  casey  in the eye of the beholder .    casey did not deign a direct response .  he said to polen   you know what winthrop told me yesterday .  he said those damned flies were the curse of beelzebub .     i was joking   said winthrop .    why beelzebub .   asked polen .    it amounts to a pun   said winthrop .   the ancient hebrews used it as  one of their many terms of derision for alien gods .  it comes from ba al  meaning lord and zevuv  meaning fly .  the lord of flies .    casey said   come on  winthrop  don t say you don t believe in beelzebub .       t  i believe in the existence of evil   said winthrop  stiffly .    i mean beelzebub .  alive .  horns .  hooves .  a sort of competition deity .      not at all .   winthrop grew stiffer .   evil is a short term affair .  in the end it must lose    polen changed the subject with a jar .  he said   i ll be doing graduate work for venner  by the way .  i talked with him day before yesterday  and he ll take me on .     no .  that s wonderful .   winthrop glowed and leaped to the subject change instantly .  he held out a hand with which to pump polen s .  he was always conscientiously eager to rejoice in another s good fortune .  casey often pointed that out .   casey said   cybernetics venner .  well  if you can stand him  i suppose he can stand you .    winthrop went on .   what did he think of your idea .  did you tell him your idea .     what idea .   demanded casey .   polen had avoided telling casey so far .  but now venner had considered it and had passed it with a cool   interesting .   how could casey s dry laughter hurt it now .   polen said   it s nothing much .  essentially  it s just a notion that emotion is the common bond of life  rather than reason or intellect .  it s practically a truism  i suppose .  you can t tell what a baby thinks or even    it thinks  but it s perfectly obvious that it can be angry  frightened or contented even when a week old .  see .    same with animals .  you can tell in a second if a dog is happy or if a cat is afraid .  the point is that their emotions are the same as those we would have under the same circumstances .     so .   said casey .   where does it get you .     i don t know yet .  right now  all i can say is that emotions are universals .  now suppose we could properly analyze all the actions of men and certain familiar animals and equate them with the visible emotion .  we might find a tight relationship .  emotion a might always involve motion b .  then we could apply it to animals whose emotions we couldn t guess at by common sense alone .  like snakes  or lobsters .     or flies   said casey  as he slapped viciously at another and flicked its remains off his wrist in furious triumph .   he went on .   go ahead  johnny .  i ll contribute the flies and you study them .  we ll establish a science of flychology and labor to make them happy  by removing their neuroses .  after all  we want the greatest good of the greatest number  don t we .  and there are more flies than men .    oh  well   said polen .   casey said   say  polen  did you ever follow up that weird idea of yours .  i mean  we all know you re a shining cybernetic light  but   haven t been reading your papers .  with so many ways of wasting time  something has to be neglected  you know .     what idea .   asked polen  woodenly .    come on .  you know .  emotions of animals and all that sort of guff .  boy  those were the days .  i used to know madmen .  now i only come across idiots .    winthrop said   that s right  polen .  i remember it very well .  your first year in graduate school you were working on dogs and rabbits .  i believe you even tried some of casey s flies .    polen said   it came to nothing in itself .  it gave rise to certain new principles of computing  however  so it wasn t a total loss .    why did they talk about it .   emotions .  what right had anyone to meddle with emotions .  words were invented to conceal emotions .  it was the dreadfulness of raw emotion that had made language a basic necessity .   polen knew .  his machines had by passed the screen of verbalization and dragged the unconscious into the sunlight .  the boy and the girl  the son and the mother .  for that matter  the cat and the mouse or the snake and the bird .  the data rattled together in its universality and it had all poured into and through polen until he could no longer bear the touch of life .   in the last few years he had so painstakingly schooled his thoughts in other directions .  now these two came  dabbling in his mind  stirring up its mud .   casey batted abstractedly across the tip of his nose to dislodge a fly .   too bad   he said .   i used to think you could get some fascinating things out of  say  rats .  well  maybe not fascinating  but then not as boring as the stuff you would get out of our somewhat human beings .  i used to think    polen remembered what he used to think .   casey said   damn this dot .  the flies feed on it  i think .  you know  i m going to do graduate work in chemistry and then get a job on insecticides .  so help me .  i ll personally get something that will kill the vermin .    they were in casey s room  and it had a somewhat keroseny odor from the recently applied insecticide .   polen shrugged and said   a folded newspaper will always kill .    casey detected a non existent sneer and said instantly   how would you summarize your first year s work  polen .  i mean aside from the true summary any scientist could state if he dared  by which i mean   nothing .       .     nothing   said polen .   there s your summary .     go on   said casey .   you use more dogs than the physiologists do and i bet the dogs mind the physiological experiments less .  i would .     oh  leave him alone   said winthrop .   you sound like a piano with    keys eternally out of order .  you re a bore .    you couldn t say that to casey .   he said  with sudden liveliness  looking carefully away from winthrop   i ll tell you what you ll probably find in animals  if you look closely enough .  religion .     what the dickens .   said winthrop  outraged .   that s a foolish remark .    casey smiled .   now  now  winthrop .  dickens is just a euphemism for devil and you don t want to be swearing .     don t teach me morals .  and don t be blasphemous .     what s blasphemous about it .  why shouldn t a flea consider the dog as something to be worshipped .  it s the source of warmth  food  and all that s good for a flea .     i don t want to discuss it .     why not .  do you good .  you could even say that to an ant  an anteater is a higher order of creation .  he would be too big for them to comprehend  too mighty to dream of resisting .  he would move among them like an unseen  inexplicable whirlwind  visiting them with destruction and death .  but that wouldn t spoil things for the ants .  they would reason that destruction was simply their just punishment for evil .  and the anteater wouldn t even know he was a deity .  or care .    winthrop had gone white .  he said   i know you re saying this only to annoy me and i am sorry to see you risking your soul for a moment s amusement .  let me tell you this   his voice trembled a little   and let me say it very seriously .  the flies that torment you are your punishment in this life .  beelzebub  like all the forces of evil  may think he does evil  but it s only the ultimate good after all .  the curse of beelzebub is on you for your good .  perhaps it will succeed in getting you to change your way of life before it s too late .    he ran from the room .   casey watched him go .  he said  kughing   i told you winthrop believed in beelzebub .  it s funny the respectable names you can give to superstition .   his laughter died a little short of its natural end .   there were two flies in the room  buzzing through the vapors toward him .   polen rose and left in heavy depression .  one year had taught him little  but it was already too much  and his laughter was thinning .  only his machines could analyze the emotions of animals properly  but he was already guessing too deeply concerning the emotions of men .   he did not like to witness wild murder yearnings where others could see only a few words of unimportant quarrel .   casey said  suddenly   say  come to think of it  you did try some of my flies  the way winthrop says .  how about that .     did i .  after twenty years  i scarcely remember   murmured polen .   winthrop said   you must .  we were in your laboratory and you complained that casey s flies followed him even there .  he suggested you analyze them and you did .  you recorded their motions and buzzings and wing wiping for half an hour or more .  you played with a dozen different flies .    polen shrugged .    oh  well   said casey .   it doesn t matter .  it was good seeing you  old man .   the hearty hand shake  the thump on the shoulder  the broad grin  to polen it all translated into sick disgust on casey s part that polen was a  success  after all .   polen said   let me hear from you sometimes .    the words were dull thumps .  they meant nothing .  casey knew that .  polen knew that .  everyone knew that .  but words were meant to hide emotion and when they failed  humanity loyally maintained the pretense .   winthrop s grasp of the hand was gentler .  he said   this brought back old times  polen .  if you re ever in cincinnati  why don t you stop in at the meeting house .  you ll always be welcome .    to polen  it all breathed of the man s relief at polen s obvious depression .  science  too  it seemed  was not the answer  and winthrop s basic and ineradicable insecurity felt pleased at the company .    i will   said polen .  it was the usual polite way of saying  i won t .   he watched them thread separately to other groups .   winthrop would never know .  polen was sure of that .  he wondered if casey knew .  it would be the supreme joke if casey did not .   he had run casey s flies  of course  not that once alone  but many times .  always the same answer .  always the same unpublishable answer .   with a cold shiver he could not quite control  polen was suddenly conscious of a single fly loose in the room  veering aimlessly for a moment  then beating strongly and reverently in the direction casey had taken a moment before .   could casey not know .  could it be the essence of the primal punishment that he never leam he was beelzebub .   casey .  lord of the flies .    nobody here but    you see  it wasn t our fault .  we had no idea anything was wrong until i called cliff anderson and spoke to him when he wasn t there .  what s more  i wouldn t have known he wasn t there  if it wasn t that he walked in while i was talking to him .   no  no  no  no   i never seem to be able to tell this straight .  i get too excited .   look  i might as well begin at the beginning .  i m bill billings  my friend is cliff anderson .  i m an electrical engineer  he s a mathematician  and we re on the faculty of midwestern institute of technology .  now you know who we are .   ever since we got out of uniform  cliff and i have been working on calculating machines .  you know what they are .  norbert wiener popularized them in his book  cybernetics .  if you ve seen pictures of them  you know that they re great big things .  they take up a whole wall and they re very complicated  also expensive .   but cliff and i had ideas .  you see  what makes a thinking machine so big and expensive is that it has to be full of relays and vacuum tubes just so that microscopic electric currents can be controlled and made to flicker on and off  here and there .  now the really important things are those little electric currents  so   i once said to cliff   why can t we control the currents without all the salad dressing .    cliff said   why not  indeed   and started working on the mathematics .   copyright         by ballantine books  inc .   how we got where we did in two years is no matter .  it s what we got after we finished that made the trouble .  it turned out that we ended with something about this high and maybe so wide and just about this deep   no  no .  i forget that you can t see me .  i ll give you the figures .  it was about three feet high  six feet long  and two feet deep .  got that .  it took two men to carry it but it could be carried and that was the point .  and still  mind you  it could do anything the wall size calculators could .  not as fast  maybe  but we were still working .   we had big ideas about that thing  the very biggest .  we could put it on ships or airplanes .  after a while  if we could make it small enough  an automobile could carry one .   we were especially interested in the automobile angle .  suppose you had a little thinking machine on the dashboard  hooked to the engine and battery and equipped with photoelectric eyes .  it could choose an ideal course  avoid cars  stop at red lights  pick the optimum speed for the terrain .  everybody could sit in the back seat and automobile accidents would vanish .   all of it was fun .  there was so much excitement to it  so many thrills every time we worked out another consolidation  that i could still cry when i think of the time i picked up the telephone to call our lab and tumbled everything into the discard .   i was at mary ann s house that evening  or have i told you about mary ann yet .  no .  i guess i haven t .   mary ann was the girl who would have been my fiancee but for two ifs .  one  if she were willing  and two  if i had the nerve to ask her .  she has red hair and crams something like two tons of energy into about     pounds of body which fills out very nicely from the ground to five and a half feet up .  i was dying to ask her  you understand  but each time i d see her coming into sight  setting a match to my heart with every movement  i d just break down .   it s not that i m not good looking .  people tell me i m adequate .  i ve got all my hair  i m nearly six feet tall  i can even dance .  it s just that i ve nothing to offer .  i don t have to tell you what college teachers make .  with inflation and taxes  it amounts to just about nothing .  of course  if we got the basic patents rolled up on our little thinking machine  things would be different .  but i couldn t ask her to wait for that  either .  maybe  after it was all set anyway  i just stood there  wishing  that evening  as she came into the living room .  my arm was groping blindly for the phone .   mary ann said   i m all ready  bill .  let s go .    i said   just a minute .  i want to ring up cliff .    she frowned a little   can t it wait .     i was supposed to call him two hours ago   i explained .   it only took two minutes .  i rang the lab .  cliff was putting in an evening of work and so he answered .  i asked something  then he said something  i  asked some more and he explained .  the details don t matter  but as i said  he s the mathematician of the combination .  when i build the circuits and put things together in what look like impossible ways  he s the guy who shuffles the symbols and tells me whether they re really impossible .  then  just as i finished and hung up  there was a ring at the door .   for a minute  i thought mary ann had another caller and got sort of stiff backed as i watched her go to the door .  i was scribbling down some of what cliff had just told me while i watched .  but then she opened the door and it was only cliff anderson after all .   he said   i thought i d find you here  hello  mary ann .  say  weren t you going to ring me at six .  you re as reliable as a cardboard chair .   cliff is short and plump and always willing to start a fight  but i know him and pay no attention .   i said   things turned up and it slipped my mind .  but i just called  so what s the difference .     called .  me .  when .    i started to point to the telephone and gagged .  right then  the bottom fell out of things .  exactly five seconds before the doorbell had sounded i had been on the phone talking to cliff in the lab  and the lab was six miles away from mary ann s house .   i said   i just spoke to you .    i wasn t getting across .  cliff just said   to me .   again .   i was pointing to the phone with both hands now   on the phone .  i called the lab .  on this phone here .  mary ann heard me .  mary ann  wasn t i just talking to    mary ann said   i don t know whom you were talking to .   well  shall we go .   that s mary ann .  she s a stickler for honesty .   i sat down .  i tried to be very quiet and clear .  i said   cliff  i dialed the lab s phone number  you answered the phone  i asked you if you had the details worked out  you said  yes  and gave them to me .  here they are .  i wrote them down .  is this correct or not .    i handed him the paper on which i had written the equations .   cliff looked at them .  he said   they re correct .  but where could you have gotten them .  you didn t work them out yourself  did you .     i just told you .  you gave them to me over the phone .    cliff shook his head   bill  i haven t been in the lab since seven fifteen .  there s nobody there .     i spoke to somebody  i tell you .    mary ann was fiddling with her gloves .   we re getting late   she said .   i waved my hands at her to wait a bit  and said to cliff   look  are you sure     there s nobody there  unless you want to count junior .   junior was what we called our pint sized mechanical brain .   we stood there  looking at one another .  mary ann s toe was still hittir  the floor like a time bomb waiting to explode .     then cliff laughed .  he said   i m thinking of a cartoon i saw  somewhere .  it shows a robot answering the phone and saying   honest  boss  there s nobody here but us complicated thinking machines .      i didn t think that was funny .  i said   let s go to the lab .    mary ann said   hey .  we won t make the show .    i said   look  mary ann  this is very important .  it s just going to take a minute .  come along with us and we ll go straight to the show from there .    she said   the show starts   and then she stopped talking  because i grabbed her wrist and we left .   that just shows how excited i was .  ordinarily  i wouldn t ever have dreamed of shoving her around .  i mean  mary ann is quite the lady .  it s just that i had so many things on my mind .  i don t even really remember grabbing her wrist  come to think of it .  it s just that the next thing i knew  i was in the auto and so was cliff and so was she  and she was rubbing her wrist and muttering under her breath about big gorillas .   i said   did i hurt you  mary ann .    she said   no  of course not .  i have my arm yanked out of its socket every day  just for fun .   then she kicked me in the shin .   she only does things like that because she has red hair .  actually  she has a very gentle nature  but she tries very hard to live up to the redhead mythology .  i see right through that  of course  but i humor her  poor kid .   we were at the laboratory in twenty minutes .   the institute is empty at night .  it s emptier than a building would ordinarily be .  you see  it s designed to have crowds of students rushing through the corridors and when they aren t there  it s unnaturally lonely .  or maybe it was just that i was afraid to see what might be sitting in our laboratory upstairs .  either way  footsteps were uncomfortably loud and the self service elevator was downright dingy .   i said to mary ann   this won t take long .   but she just sniffed and looked beautiful .   she can t help looking beautiful .   cliff had the key to the laboratory and i looked over his shoulder when he opened the door .  there was nothing to see .  junior was there  sure  but he looked just as he had when i saw him last .  the dials in front registered nothing and except for that  there was just a large box  with a cable running back into the wall socket .   cliff and i walked up on either side of junior .  i think we were planning to grab it if it made a sudden move .  but then we stopped because junior just wasn t doing anything .  mary ann was looking at it  too .  in fact  she ran her middle finger along its top and then looked at the finger tip and twiddled it against her thumb to get rid of the dust .     i said   mary ann  don t you go near it .  stay at the other end of the room .   if .  she said   it s just as dirty there .    she d never been in our lab before  and of course she didn t realize that a laboratory wasn t the same thing as a baby s bedroom  if you know what i mean .  the janitor comes in twice a day and all he does is empty the waste baskets .  about once a week  he comes in with a dirty mop  makes mud on the floor  and shoves it around a little .   cliff said   the telephone isn t where i left it .    .  .  i said   how do you know .               because i left it there .   he pointed .   and now it s here .    if he were right  the telephone had moved closer to junior .  i swallowed and said   maybe you don t remember right .   i tried to laugh without sounding very natural and said   where s the screw driver .     what are you going to do .     just take a look inside .  for laughs .    mary ann said   you ll get yourself all dirty .   so i put on my lab coat .  she s a very thoughtful girl  mary ann .   i got to work with a screw driver .  of course  once junior was really perfected  we were going to have models manufactured in welded  one piece cases .  we were even thinking of molded plastic in colors  for home use .  in the lab model  though  we held it together with screws so that we could take it apart and put it together as often as we wanted to .   only the screws weren t coming out .  i grunted and yanked and said   some joker was putting his weight on these when he screwed these things in .    cliff said   you re the only one who ever touches the thing .    he was right  too  but that didn t make it any easier .  i stood up and passed the back of my hand over my forehead .  i held out the screw driver to him   want to try .    he did  and didn t get any further than i did .  he said   that s funny .    i said   what s funny .    t he said   i had a screw turning just now .  it moved about an eighth of an inch and then the screw driver slipped .     what s funny about that .    cliff backed away and put down the screw driver with two fingers .   what s funny is that i saw the screw move back an eighth of an inch and tighten up again .    mary ann was fidgeting again .  she said   why don t your scientific minds think of a blowtorch  if you re so anxious .   there was a blowtorch on one of the benches and she was pointing to it .   well  ordinarily  i wouldn t think any more of using a blowtorch on junior than on myself .  but i was thinking something and cliff was thinking some   thing and we were both thinking the same thing .  junior didn  t want to be opened up .   cliff said   what do you think  bill .    and   said   i don t know  cliff .    mary ann said   well  hurry up  lunkhead  we ll miss the show .    so i picked up the blowtorch and adjusted the gauge on the oxygen cylinder .  it was going to be like stabbing a friend .   but mary ann stopped the proceedings by saying   well  how stupid can men be .  these screws are loose .  you must have been turning the screw driver the wrong way .    now there isn t much chance of turning a screw driver the wrong way .  just the same  i don t like to contradict mary ann  so i just said   mary ann  don t stay too close to junior .  why don t you wait by the door .    but she just said   well  look .   and there was a screw in her hand and an empty hole in the front of junior s case .  she had removed it by hand .   cliff said   holy smoke .    they were turning  all dozen screws .  they were doing it by themselves  like little worms crawling out of their holes  turning round and round  then dropping out .  i scrabbled them up and only one was left .  it hung on for a while  the front panel sagging from it  till i reached out .  then the last screw dropped and the panel fell gently into my arms .  i put it to one side .   cliff said   it did that on purpose .  it heard us mention the blowtorch and gave up .   his face is usually pink  but it was white then .   i was feeling a little queer myself .  i said   what s it trying to hide .     i don t know .    we bent before its open insides and for a while we just looked .  i could hear mary ann s toe begin to tap the floor again .  i looked at my wrist watch and i had to admit to myself we didn t have much time .  in fact  we didn t have any time left .   and then i said   it s got a diaphragm .    cliff said   where .   and bent closer .   i pointed .   and a loud speaker .     you didn t put them in .     of course i didn t put them in .  i ought to know what i put in .  if i put it in  i d remember .     then how did it get in .    we were squatting and arguing .  i said   it made them itself  i suppose .  maybe it grows them .  look at that .    i pointed again .  inside the box at two different places  were coils of something that looked like thin garden hose  except that they were of metal .  they spiraled tightly so that they lay flat .  at the end of each coil  the metal divided into five or six thin filaments that were in little sub spirals .    you didn t put those in either .     no  i didn t put those in either .     what are they .    he knew what they were and i knew what they were .  something had to reach out to get materials for junior to make parts for itself  something had to snake out for the telephone .  i picked up the front panel and looked at it again .  there were two circular bits of metal cut out and hinged so that they could swing forward and leave a hole for something to come through .   i poked a finger through one and held it up for cliff to see  and said   i didn t put this in either .    mary ann was looking over my shoulder now  and without warning she reached out .  i was wiping my fingers with a paper towel to get off the dust and grease and didn t have time to stop her .  i should have known mary ann  though  she s always so anxious to help .   anyway  she reached in to touch one of the well  we might as well say it  tentacles .  i don t know if she actually touched them or not .  later on she claimed she hadn t .  but anyway  what happened then was that she let out a little yell and suddenly sat down and began rubbing her arm .    the same one   she whimpered .   first you  and then that .    i helped her up .   it must have been a loose connection  mary ann .  i m sorry  but i told you    cliff said   nuts .  that was no loose connection .  junior s just protecting itself .    i had thought the same thing  myself .  i had thought lots of things .  junior was a new kind of machine .  even the mathematics that controlled it were different from anything anybody had worked with before .  maybe it had something no machine previously had ever had .  maybe it felt a desire to stay alive and grow .  maybe it would have a desire to make more machines until there were millions of them all over the earth  fighting with human beings for control .   i opened my mouth and cliff must have known what i was going to say  because he yelled   no .  no  don t say it .    but i couldn t stop myself .  it just came out and i said   well  look  let s disconnect junior what s the matter .    cliff said bitterly   because he s listening to what we say  you jackass .  he heard about the blowtorch  didn t he .  i was going to sneak up behind it  but now it will probably electrocute me if i try .    mary ann was still brushing at the back of her dress and saying how dirty the floor was  even though i kept telling her i had nothing to do with that .  i mean  it s the janitor that makes the mud .   anyway  she said   why don t you put on rubber gloves and yank the cord out .    i could see cliff was trying to think of reasons why that wouldn t work .  he didn t think of any  so he put on the rubber gloves and walked towards junior .   i yelled   watch out .    it was a stupid thing to say .  he had to watch out  he had no choice .  one of the tentacles moved and there was no doubt what they were now .  it whirled out and drew a line between cliff and the power cable .  it remained there  vibrating a little with its six finger tendrils splayed out .  tubes inside junior were beginning to glow .  cliff didn t try to go past that tentacle .  he backed away and after a while  it spiraled inward again .  he took off his rubber gloves .    bill   he said   we re not going to get anywhere .  that s a smarter gadget than we dreamed we could make .  it was smart enough to use my voice as a model when it built its diaphragm .  it may become smart enough to learn how to   he looked over his shoulder  and whispered   how to generate its own power and become self contained .    bill  we ve got to stop it  or someday someone will telephone the planet earth and get the answer   honest  boss  there s nobody here anywhere but us complicated thinking machines .       let s get in the police   i said .   we ll explain .  a grenade  or something    cliff shook his head   we can t have anyone else find out .  they ll build other juniors and it looks like we don t have enough answers for that kind of a project after all .     then what do we do .     i don t know .    i felt a sharp blow on my chest .  i looked down and it was mary ann  getting ready to spit fire .  she said   look  lunkhead  if we ve got a date  we ve got one  and if we haven t  we haven t .  make up your mind .    i said   now  mary ann    she said   answer me .  i never heard such a ridiculous thing .  here i get dressed to go to a play  and you take me to a dirty laboratory with a foolish machine and spend the rest of the evening twiddling dials .     mary ann  i m not    she wasn t listening  she was talking .  i wish i could remember what she said after that .  or maybe i don t  maybe it s just as well i can t remember  since none of it was very complimentary .  every once in a while i would manage a  but  mary ann   and each time it would get sucked under and swallowed up .   actually  as i said  she s a very gentle creature and it s only when she gets excited that she s ever talkative or unreasonable .  of course  with red hair  she feels she ought to get excited rather often .  that s my theory  anyway .  she just feels she has to live up to her red hair .   anyway  the next thing i do remember clearly is mary ann finishing with a stamp on my right foot and then turning to leave .  i ran after her  trying once again   but  mary ann    then cliff yelled at us .  generally  he doesn t pay any attention to us  but  this time he was shouting   why don t you ask her to marry you  you lunkhead .    mary ann stopped .  she was in the doorway by then but she didn t turn around .  i stopped too  and felt the words get thick and clogged up in my throat .  i couldn t even manage a  but  mary ann    cliff was yelling in the background .  i heard him as though he were a mile away .  he was shouting   i got it .  i got it .   over and over again .   then mary ann turned and she looked so beautiful  did i tell you that she s got green eyes with a touch of blue in them .  anyway she looked so beautiful that all the words in my throat jammed together very tightly and came out in that funny sound you make when you swallow .   she said   were you going to say something  bill .    well  cliff had put it in my head .  my voice was hoarse and i said   will you marry me  mary ann .    the minute i said it  i wished i hadn t  because i thought she would never speak to me again .  then two minutes after that i was glad i had  because she threw her arms around me and reached up to kiss me .  it was a while before i was quite clear what was happening  and then i began to kiss back .  this went on for quite a long time  until cliff s banging on my shoulder managed to attract my attention .   i turned and said  snappishly   what the devil do you want .   it was a little ungrateful .  after all  he had started this .   he said   look .    in his hand  he held the main lead that had connected junior to the power supply .   i had forgotten about junior  but now it came back .  i said   he s disconnected  then .     cold .     how did you do it .    he said   junior was so busy watching you and mary ann fight that i managed to sneak up on it .  mary ann put on one good show .    i didn t like that remark because mary ann is a very dignified and self contained sort of girl and doesn t put on  shows .   however  i had too much in hand to take issue with him .   i said to mary ann   i don t have much to offer  mary ann  just a school teacher s salary .  now that we ve dismantled junior  there isn t even any chance of    mary ann said   i don t care  bill .  i just gave up on you  you lunkheaded darling .  i ve tried practically everything     you ve been kicking my shins and stamping on my toes .     i d run out of everything else .  i was desperate .    the logic wasn t quite clear  but i didn t answer because i remembered about the show .  i looked at my watch and said   look  mary ann  if we hurry we can still make the second act .    she said   who wants to see the show .      so i kissed her some more  and we never did get to see the show at all .   there s only one thing that bothers me now .  mary ann and i are married  and we re perfectly happy .  i just had a promotion  i m an associate professor now .  cliff keeps working away at plans for building a controllable junior and he s making progress .   none of that s it .   you see    talked to cliff the next evening  to tell him mary ann and i were going to marry and to thank him for giving me the idea .  and after staring at me for a minute  he swore he hadn t said it  he hadn t shouted for me to propose marriage .   of course  there was something else in the room with cliff s voice .   i keep worrying mary ann will find out .  she s the gentlest girl i know  but she has got red hair .  she can t help trying to live up to that  or have i said that already .   anyway  what will she say if she ever finds out that i didn t have the sense to propose till a machine told me to .   it s such  a beautiful day  on april           the field modulator brake valve in the door belonging to mrs .  richard hanshaw depolarized for reasons unknown .  as a result  mrs .  hanshaw s day was completely upset and her son  richard  jr .   first developed his strange neurosis .   it was not the type of thing you would find listed as a neurosis in the usual textbooks and certainly young richard behaved  in most respects  just as a well brought up twelve year old in prosperous circumstances ought to behave .   and yet from april    on  richard hanshaw  jr .   could only with regret ever persuade himself to go through a door .   of all this  on april     mrs .  hanshaw had no premonition .  she woke in the morning  an ordinary morning  as her mekkano slithered gently into her room  with a cup of coffee on a small tray .   mrs .  hanshaw was planning a visit to new york in the afternoon and she had several things to do first that could not quite be trusted to a mekkano  so after one or two sips  she stepped out of bed .   the mekkano backed away  moving silently along the diamagnetic field that kept its oblong body half an inch above the floor  and moved back to the kitchen  where its simple computer was quite adequate to set the proper controls on the various kitchen appliances in order that an appropriate breakfast might be prepared .   mrs .  hanshaw  having bestowed the usual sentimental glance upon the  copyright         by ballantine books  inc .   cubograph of her dead husband  passed through the stages of her morning ritual with a certain contentment .  she could hear her son across the hall clattering through his  but she knew she need not interfere with him .  the mekkano was well adjusted to see to it  as a matter of course  that he was showered  that he had on a change of clothing  and that he would eat a nourishing breakfast .  the tergo shower she had had installed the year before made the morning wash and dry so quick and pleasant that  really  she felt certain dickie would wash even without supervision .   on a morning like this  when she was busy  it would certainly not be necessary for her to do more than deposit a casual peck on the boy s cheek before he left .  she heard the soft chime the mekkano sounded to indicate approaching school time and she floated down the force lift to the lower floor  her hair style for the day only sketchily designed  as yet  in order to perform that motherly duty .   she found richard standing at the door  with his text reels and pocket projector dangling by their strap and a frown on his face .    say  mom   he said  looking up   i dialed the school s co ords but nothing happens .    she said  almost automatically   nonsense  dickie .  i never heard of such a thing .     well  you try .    mrs .  hanshaw tried a number of times .  strange  the school door was always set for general reception .  she tried other co ordinates .  her friends  doors might not be set for reception  but there would be a signal at least  and then she could explain .   but nothing happened at all .  the door remained an inactive gray barrier despite all her manipulations .  it was obvious that the door was out of order  and only five months after its annual fall inspection by the company .   she was quite angry about it .   it would happen on a day when she had so much planned .  she thought petulantly of the fact that a month earlier she had decided against installing a subsidiary door on the ground that it was an unnecessary expense .  how was she to know that doors were getting to be so shoddy .   she stepped to the visiphone while the anger still burned in her and said to richard   you just go down the road  dickie  and use the williamsons  door .    ironically  in view of later developments  richard balked .   aw  gee  mom  i ll get dirty .  can t i stay home till the door is fixed .    and  as ironically  mrs .  hanshaw insisted .  with her finger on the combination board of the phone  she said   you won t get dirty if you put flexies on your shoes  and don t forget to brush yourself well before you go into their house .     but  golly     no back talk  dickie .  you ve got to be in school .  just let me see you walk out of here .  and quickly  or you ll be late .    the mekkano  an advanced model and very responsive  was already standing before richard with flexies in one appendage .   richard pulled the transparent plastic shields over his shoes and moved down the hall with visible reluctance .   i don t even know how to work this thing  mom .     you just push that button   mrs .  hanshaw called .   the red button .  where it says  for emergency use .   and don t dawdle .  do you want the mekkano to go along with you .     gosh  no   he called back  morosely   what do you think i am .  a baby .  gosh .   his muttering was cut off by a slam .   with flying fingers  mrs .  hanshaw punched the appropriate combination on the phone board and thought of the things she intended saying to the company about this .   joe bloom  a reasonable young man  who had gone through technology school with added training in force field mechanics  was at the hanshaw residence in less than half an hour .  he was really quite competent  though mrs .  hanshaw regarded his youth with deep suspicion .   she opened the movable house panel when he first signaled and her sight of him was as he stood there  brushing at himself vigorously to remove the dust of the open air .  he took off his flexies and dropped them where he stood .  mrs .  hanshaw closed the house panel against the flash of raw sunlight that had entered .  she found herself irrationally hoping that the step by step trip from the public door had been an unpleasant one .  or perhaps that the public door itself had been out of order and the youth had had to lug his tools even farther than the necessary two hundred yards .  she wanted the company  or its representative at least  to suffer a bit .  it would teach them what broken doors meant .   but he seemed cheerful and unperturbed as he said   good morning  ma am .  i came to see about your door .     i m glad someone did   said mrs .  hanshaw  ungraciously .   my day is quite ruined .     sorry  ma am .  what seems to be the trouble .     it just won t work .  nothing at all happens when you adjust co ords   said mrs .  hanshaw .   there was no warning at all .  i had to send my son out to the neighbors through that that thing .    she pointed to the entrance through which the repair man had come .   he smiled and spoke out of the conscious wisdom of his own specialized training in doors .   that s a door  too  ma am .  you don t give that kind a capital letter when you write it .  it s a hand door  sort of .  it used to be the only kind once .     well  at least it works .  my boy s had to go out in the dirt and germs .     it s not bad outside today  ma am   he said  with the connoisseur like air  of one whose profession forced him into the open nearly every day .   sometimes it is real unpleasant .  but   guess you want i should fix this here door  ma am  so i ll get on with it .    he sat down on the floor  opened the large tool case he had brought in with him and in half a minute  by use of a point demagnetizer  he had the control panel removed and a set of intricate vitals exposed .   he whistled to himself as he placed the fine electrodes of the field analyzer on numerous points  studying the shifting needles on the dials .  mrs .  hanshaw watched him  arms folded .   finally  he said   well  here s something   and with a deft twist  he disengaged the brake valve .   he tapped it with a fingernail and said   this here brake valve is depolarized  ma am .  there s your whole trouble .   he ran his finger along the little pigeonholes in his tool case and lifted out a duplicate of the object he had taken from the door mechanism .   these things just go all of a sudden .  can t predict it .    he put the control panel back and stood up .   it ll work now  ma am .    he punched a reference combination  blanked it  then punched another .  each time  the dull gray of the door gave way to a deep  velvety blackness .  he said   will you sign here  ma am .  and put down your charge number  too  please .  thank you  ma am .    he punched a new combination  that of his home factory  and with a polite touch of finger to forehead  he stepped through the door .  as his body entered the blackness  it cut off sharply .  less and less of him was visible and the tip of his tool case was the last thing that showed .  a second after he had passed through completely  the door turned back to dull gray .   half an hour later  when mrs .  hanshaw had finally completed her interrupted preparations and was fuming over the misfortune of the morning  the phone buzzed annoyingly and her real troubles began .   miss elizabeth robbins was distressed .  little dick hanshaw had always been a good pupil .  she hated to report him like this .  and yet  she told herself  his actions were certainly queer .  and she would talk to his mother  not to the principal .   she slipped out to the phone during the morning study period  leaving a student in charge .  she made her connection and found herself staring at mrs .  hanshaw s handsome and somewhat formidable head .   miss robbins quailed  but it was too late to turn back .  she said  diffidently   mrs .  hanshaw  i m miss robbins .   she ended on a rising note .   mrs .  hanshaw looked blank  then said   richard s teacher .   that  too  ended on a rising note .    that s right .  i called you  mrs .  hanshaw   miss robbins plunged right into it   to tell you that dick was quite late to school this morning .     he was .  but that couldn t be .  i saw him leave .    miss robbins looked astonished .  she said   you mean you saw him use the door .    mrs .  hanshaw said quickly   well  no .  our door was temporarily out of order .  i sent him to a neighbor and he used that door .     are you sure .     of course i m sure .  i wouldn t lie to you .     no  no  mrs .  hanshaw .  i wasn t implying that at all .  i meant are you sure he found the way to the neighbor .  he might have got lost .     ridiculous .  we have the proper maps  and i m sure richard knows the location of every house in district a   .   then  with the quiet pride of one who knows what is her due  she added   not that he ever needs to know  of course .  the co ords are all that are necessary at any time .    miss robbins  who came from a family that had always had to economize rigidly on the use of its doors  the price of power being what it was  and who had therefore run errands on foot until quite an advanced age  resented the pride .  she said  quite clearly   well  i m afraid  mrs .  hanshaw  that dick did not use the neighbor s door .  he was over an hour late to school and the condition of his flexies made it quite obvious that he tramped crosscountry .  they were muddy .     muddy .   mrs .  hanshaw repeated the emphasis on the word .   what did he say .  what was his excuse .    miss robbins couldn t help but feel a little glad at the discomfiture of the other woman .  she said   he wouldn t talk about it .  frankly  mrs .  hanshaw  he seems ill .  that s why i called you .  perhaps you might want to have a doctor look at him .     is he running a temperature .   the mother s voice went shrill .    oh  no .  i don t mean physically ill .  it s just his attitude and the look in his eyes .   she hesitated  then said with every attempt at delicacy   i thought perhaps a routine checkup with a psychic probe    she didn t finish .  mrs .  hanshaw  in a chilled voice and with what was as close to a snort as her breeding would permit  said   are you implying that richard is neurotic .     oh  no  mrs .  hanshaw  but     it certainly sounded so .  the idea .  he has always been perfectly healthy .  i ll take this up with him when he gets home .  i m sure there s a perfectly normal explanation which he ll give to me .    the connection broke abruptly  and miss robbins felt hurt and uncommonly foolish .  after all she had only tried to help  to fulfill what she considered an obligation to her students .   she hurried back to the classroom with a glance at the metal face of the wall clock .  the study period was drawing to an end .  english composition next .   but her mind wasn t completely on english composition .  automatically  she called the students to have them read selections from their literary  creations .  and occasionally she punched one of those selections on tape and ran it through the small vocalizer to show the students how english should be read .   the vocalizer s mechanical voice  as always  dripped perfection  but  again as always  lacked character .  sometimes  she wondered if it was wise to try to train the students into a speech that was divorced from individuality and geared only to a mass average accent and intonation .   today  however  she had no thought for that .  it was richard hanshaw she watched .  he sat quietly in his seat  quite obviously indifferent to his surroundings .  he was lost deep in himself and just not the same boy he had been .  it was obvious to her that he had had some unusual experience that morning and  really  she was right to call his mother  although perhaps she ought not to have made the remark about the probe .  still it was quite the thing these days .  all sorts of people get probed .  there wasn t any disgrace attached to it .  or there shouldn t be  anyway .   she called on richard  finally .  she had to call twice  before he responded and rose to his feet .   the general subject assigned had been   if you had your choice of traveling on some ancient vehicle  which would you choose  and why .   miss robbins tried to use the topic every semester .  it was a good one because it carried a sense of history with it .  it forced the youngster to think about the manner of living of people in past ages .   she listened while richard hanshaw read in a low voice .    if i had my choice of ancient vehicles   he said  pronouncing the  h  in vehicles   i would choose the stratoliner .  it travels slow like all vehicles but it is clean .  because it travels in the stratosphere  it must be all enclosed so that you are not likely to catch disease .  you can see the stars if it is night time almost as good as in a planetarium .  if you look down you can see the earth like a map or maybe see clouds   he went on for several hundred more words .   she said brightly when he had finished reading   it s pronounced vee ick ulls  richard .  no  h .   accent on the first syllable .  and you don t say  travels slow  or  see good .   what do you say  class .    there was a small chorus of responses and she went on   that s right .  now what is the difference between an adjective and an adverb .  who can tell me .    and so it went .  lunch passed .  some pupils stayed to eat  some went home .  richard stayed .  miss robbins noted that  as usually he didn t .   the afternoon passed  too  and then there was the final bell and the usual upsurging hum as twenty five boys and girls rattled their belongings together and took their leisurely place in line .   miss robbins clapped her hands together   quickly  children .  come  zelda  take your place .     i dropped my tape punch  miss robbins   shrilled the girl  defensively .    well  pick it up  pick it up .  now children  be brisk  be brisk .    she pushed the button that slid a section of the wall into a recess and revealed the gray blankness of a large door .  it was not the usual door that the occasional student used in going home for lunch  but an advanced model that was one of the prides of this well to do private school .   in addition to its double width  it possessed a large and impressively gear filled  automatic serial finder  which was capable of adjusting the door for a number of different co ordinates at automatic intervals .   at the beginning of the semester  miss robbins always had to spend an afternoon with the mechanic  adjusting the device for the co ordinates of the homes of the new class .  but then  thank goodness  it rarely needed attention for the remainder of the term .   the class lined up alphabetically  first girls  then boys .  the door went velvety black and hester adams waved her hand and stepped through .   by y y    the  bye  was cut off in the middle  as it almost always was .   the door went gray  then black again  and theresa cantrocchi went through .  gray  black  zelda charlowicz .  gray  black  patricia coombs .  gray  black  sara may evans .   the line grew smaller as the door swallowed them one by one  depositing each in her home .  of course  an occasional mother forgot to leave the house door on special reception at the appropriate time and then the school door remained gray .  automatically  after a minute long wait  the door went on to the next combination in line and the pupil in question had to wait till it was all over  after which a phone call to the forgetful parent would set things right .  this was always bad for the pupils involved  especially the sensitive ones who took seriously the implication that they were little thought of at home .  miss robbins always tried to impress this on visiting parents  but it happened at least once every semester just the same .   the girls were all through now .  john abramowitz stepped through and then edwin byrne   of course  another trouble  and a more frequent one was the boy or girl who got into line out of place .  they would do it despite the teacher s sharpest watch  particularly at the beginning of the term when the proper order was less familiar to them .   when that happened  children would be popping into the wrong houses by the half dozen and would have to be sent back .  it always meant a mixup that took minutes to straighten out and parents were invariably irate .   miss robbins was suddenly aware that the line had stopped .  she spoke sharply to the boy at the head of the line .    step through  samuel .  what are you waiting for .    samuel jones raised a complacent countenance and said   it s not my combination  miss robbins .     well  whose is it .   she looked impatiently down the line of five remaining boys .  who was out of place .    it s dick hanshaw s  miss robbins .     where is he .    another boy answered  with the rather repulsive tone of self righteousness all children automatically assume in reporting the deviations of their friends to elders in authority   he went through the fire door  miss robbins .     what .    the schoolroom door had passed on to another combination and samuel jones passed through .  one by one  the rest followed .   miss robbins was alone in the classroom .  she stepped to the fire door .  it was a small affair  manually operated  and hidden behind a bend in the wall so that it would not break up the uniform structure of the room .   she opened it a crack .  it was there as a means of escape from the building in case of fire  a device which was enforced by an anachronistic law that did not take into account the modern methods of automatic fire fighting that all public buildings used .  there was nothing outside  but the outside the sunlight was harsh and a dusty wind was blowing .   miss robbins closed the door .  she was glad she had called mrs .  hanshaw .  she had done her duty .  more than ever  it was obvious that something was wrong with richard .  she suppressed the impulse to phone again .   mrs .  hanshaw did not go to new york that day .  she remained home in a mixture of anxiety and an irrational anger  the latter directed against the impudent miss robbins .   some fifteen minutes before school s end  her anxiety drove her to the door .  last year she had had it equipped with an automatic device which activated it to the school s co ordinates at five of three and kept it so  barring manual adjustment  until richard arrived .   her eyes were fixed on the door s dismal gray  why couldn t an inactive force field be any other color  something more lively and cheerful .   and waited .  her hands felt cold as she squeezed them together .   the door turned black at the precise second but nothing happened .  the minutes passed and richard was late .  then quite late .  then very late .   it was a quarter of four and she was distracted .  normally  she would have phoned the school  but she couldn t  she couldn t .  not after that teacher had deliberately cast doubts on richard s mental well being .  how could she .       mrs .  hanshaw moved about restlessly  lighting a cigarette with fumbling fingers  then smudging it out .  could it be something quite normal .  could richard be staying after school for some reason .  surely he would have told her in advance .  a gleam of light struck her  he knew she was planning to go to new york and might not be back till late in the evening   no  he would surely have told her .  why fool herself .   her pride was breaking .  she would have to call the school  or even  she  closed her eyes and teardrops squeezed through between the lashes  the police .   and when she opened her eyes  richard stood before her  eyes on the ground and his whole bearing that of someone waiting for a blow to fall .    hello  mom .    mrs .  hanshaw s anxiety transmuted itself instantly  in a manner known only to mothers  into anger .   where have you been  richard .    and then  before she could go further into the refrain concerning careless  unthinking sons and broken hearted mothers  she took note of his appearance in greater detail  and gasped in utter horror .   she said   you ve been in the open .    her son looked down at his dusty shoes  minus flexies   at the dirt marks that streaked his lower arms and at the small  but definite tear in his shirt .  he said   gosh  mom  i just thought i d   and he faded out .   she said   was there anything wrong with the school door .     no  mom .     do you realize i ve been worried sick about you .   she waited vainly for an answer .   well  i ll talk to you afterward  young man .  first  you re taking a bath  and every stitch of your clothing is being thrown out .  mekkano .    but the mekkano had already reacted properly to the phrase  taking a bath  and was off to the bathroom in its silent glide .    you take your shoes off right here   said mrs .  hanshaw   then march after mekkano .    richard did as he was told with a resignation that placed him beyond futile protest .   mrs .  hanshaw picked up the soiled shoes between thumb and forefinger and dropped them down the disposal chute which hummed in faint dismay at the unexpected load .  she dusted her hands carefully on a tissue which she allowed to float down the chute after the shoes .   she did not join richard at dinner but let him eat in the worse than lack of company of the mekkano .  this  she thought  would be an active sign of her displeasure and would do more than any amount of scolding or punishment to make him realize that he had done wrong .  richard  she frequently told herself  was a sensitive boy .   but she went up to see him at bedtime .   she smiled at him and spoke softly .  she thought that would be the best way .  after all  he had been punished already .   she said   what happened today  dickie boy .   she had called him that when he was a baby and just the sound of the name softened her nearly to tears .   but he only looked away and his voice was stubborn and cold .   i just don t like to go through those dam doors  mom .     but why ever not .    he shuffled his hands over the filmy sheet  fresh  clean  antiseptic and  of course  disposable after each use  and said   i just don t like them .     but then how do you expect to go to school  dickie .     i ll get up early   he mumbled .    but there s nothing wrong with doors .     don t like  em .   he never once looked up at her .   she said  despairingly   oh  well  you have a good sleep and tomorrow morning you ll feel much better .    she kissed him and left the room  automatically passing her hand through the photo cell beam and in that manner dimming the room lights .   but she had trouble sleeping herself that night .  why should dickie dislike doors so suddenly .  they had never bothered him before .  to be sure  the door had broken down in the morning but that should make him appreciate them all the more .   dickie was behaving so unreasonably .   unreasonably .  that reminded her of miss robbins and her diagnosis and mrs .  hanshaw s soft jaw set in the darkness and privacy of her bedroom .  nonsense .  the boy was upset and a night s sleep was all the therapy he needed .   but the next morning when she arose  her son was not in the house .  the mekkano could not speak but it could answer questions with gestures of its appendages equivalent to a yes or no  and it did not take mrs .  hanshaw more than half a minute to ascertain that the boy had arisen thirty minutes earlier than usual  skimped his shower  and darted out of the house .   but not by way of the door .   out the other way through the door .  small  d .    mrs .  hanshaw s visiphone signaled genteelly at      p . m .  that day .  mrs .  hanshaw guessed the caller and having activated the receiver  saw that she had guessed correctly .  a quick glance in the mirror to see that she was properly calm after a day of abstracted concern and worry and then she keyed in her own transmission .    yes  miss robbins   she said coldly .   richard s teacher was a bit breathless .  she said   mrs .  hanshaw  richard has deliberately left through the fire door although i told him to use the regular door .  i do not know where he went .   mrs .  hanshaw said  carefully   he left to come home .   miss robbins looked dismayed .   do you approve of this .   pale faced  mrs .  hanshaw set about putting the teacher in her place .   i don t think it is up to you to criticize .  if my son does not choose to use the door  it is his affair and mine .  i don t think there is any school ruling that would force him to use the door  is there .   her bearing quite plainly intimated that if there were she would see to it that it was changed .   miss robbins flushed and had time for one quick remark before contact was broken .  she said   i d have him probed .  i really would .    mrs .  hanshaw remained standing before the quartzinium plate  staring blindly at its blank face .  her sense of family placed her for a few moments quite firmly on richard s side .  why did he have to use the door if he chose not to .  and then she settled down to wait and pride battled the gnawing anxiety that something after all was wrong with richard .   he came home with a look of defiance on his face  but his mother  with a strenuous effort at self control  met him as though nothing were out of the ordinary .   for weeks  she followed that policy .  it s nothing  she told herself .  it s a vagary .  he ll grow out of it .   it grew into an almost normal state of affairs .  then  too  every once in a while  perhaps three days in a row  she would come down to breakfast to find richard waiting sullenly at the door  then using it when school time came .  she always refrained from commenting on the matter .   always  when he did that  and especially when he followed it up by arriving home via the door  her heart grew warm and she thought   well  it s over .   but always with the passing of one day  two or three  he would return like an addict to his drug and drift silently out by the door small  d  before she woke .   and each time she thought despairingly of psychiatrists and probes  and each time the vision of miss robbins  low bred satisfaction at  possibly  learning of it  stopped her  although she was scarcely aware that that was the true motive .   meanwhile  she lived with it and made the best of it .  the mekkano was instructed to wait at the door small  d  with a tergo kit and a change of clothing .  richard washed and changed without resistance .  his underthings  socks and flexies were disposable in any case  and mrs .  hanshaw bore uncomplainingly the expense of daily disposal of shirts .  trousers she finally allowed to go a week before disposal on condition of rigorous nightly cleansing .   one day she suggested that richard accompany her on a trip to new york .  it was more a vague desire to keep him in sight than part of any purposeful plan .  he did not object .  he was even happy .  he stepped right through the door  unconcerned .  he didn t hesitate .  he even lacked the look of resentment he wore on those mornings he used the door to go to school .   mrs .  hanshaw rejoiced .  this could be a way of weaning him back into door usage  and she racked her ingenuity for excuses to make trips with richard .  she even raised her power bill to quite unheard of heights by suggesting  and going through with  a trip to canton for the day in order to witness a chinese festival .   that was on a sunday  and the next morning richard marched directly to  the hole in the wall he always used .  mrs .  hanshaw  having wakened particularly early  witnessed that .  for once  badgered past endurance  she called after him plaintively   why not the door  dickie .    he said  briefly   it s all right for canton   and stepped out of the house .   so that plan ended in failure .  and then  one day  richard came home soaking wet .  the mekkano hovered above him uncertainly and mrs .  hanshaw  just returned from a four hour visit with her sister in iowa  cried   richard hanshaw .    he said  hang dog fashion   it started raining .  all of a sudden  it started raining .    for a moment  the word didn t register with her .  her own school days and her studies of geography were twenty years in the past .  and then she remembered and caught the vision of water pouring recklessly and endlessly down from the sky a mad cascade of water with no tap to turn off  no button to push  no contact to break .   she said   and you stayed out in it .    he said   well  gee  mom  i came home fast as i could .  i didn t know it was going to rain .    mrs .  hanshaw had nothing to say .  she was appalled and the sensation filled her too full for words to find a place .   two days later  richard found himself with a running nose  and a dry  scratchy throat .  mrs .  hanshaw had to admit that the vims of disease had found a lodging in her house  as though it were a miserable hovel of the iron age .   it was over that that her stubbornness and pride broke and she admitted to herself that  after all  richard had to have psychiatric help .   mrs .  hanshaw chose a psychiatrist with care .  her first impulse was to find one at a distance .  for a whik  she considered stepping directly into the san francisco medical center and choosing one at random .   and then it occurred to her that by doing that she would become merely an anonymous consultant .  she would have no way of obtaining any greater consideration for herself than would be forthcoming to any public door user of the city slums .  now if she remained in her own community  her word would carry weight   she consulted the district map .  it was one of that excellent series prepared by doors  inc .   and distributed free of charge to their clients .  mrs .  hanshaw couldn t quite suppress that little thrill of civic pride as she unfolded the map .  it wasn t a fine print directory of door co ordinates only .  it was an actual map  with each house carefully located .   and why not .  district a   was a name of moment in the world  a badge of aristocracy .  it was the first community on the planet to have been established on a completely doored basis .  the first  the largest  the wealthiest  the best known .  it needed no factories  no stores .  it didn t even need roads .   each house was a little secluded castle  the door of which had entry anywhere the world over where other doors existed .   carefully  she followed down the keyed listing of the five thousand families of district a   .  she knew it included several psychiatrists .  the learned professions were well represented in a   .   doctor hamilton sloane was the second name she arrived at and her finger lingered upon the map .  his office was scarcely two miles from the hanshaw residence .  she liked his name .  the fact that he lived in a   was evidence of worth .  and he was a neighbor  practically a neighbor .  he would understand that it was a matter of urgency and confidential .   firmly  she put in a call to his office to make an appointment .   doctor hamilton sloane was a comparatively young man  not quite forty .  he was of good family and he had indeed heard of mrs .  hanshaw .   he listened to her quietly and then said   and this all began with the door breakdown .     that s right  doctor .     does he show any fear of the doors .     of course not .  what an idea .   she was plainly startled .    it s possible  mrs .  hanshaw  it s possible .  after all  when you stop to think of how a door works it is rather a frightening thing  really .  you step into a door  and for an instant your atoms are converted into field energies  transmitted to another part of space and reconverted into matter .  for that instant you re not alive .     i m sure no one thinks of such things .     but your son may .  he witnessed the breakdown of the door .  he may be saying to himself   what if the door breaks down just as i m half way through .      but that s nonsense .  he still uses the door .  he s even been to canton with me  canton  china .  and as i told you  he uses it for school about once or twice a week .     freely .  cheerfully .     well   said mrs .  hanshaw  reluctantly   he does seem a bit put out by it .  but really  doctor  there isn t much use talking about it  is there .  if you would do a quick probe  see where the trouble was   and she finished on a bright note   why  that would be all .  i m sure it s quite a minor thing .    dr .  sloane signed .  he detested the word  probe  and there was scarcely any word he heard oftener .    mrs .  hanshaw   he said patiently   there is no such thing as a quick probe .  now i know the mag strips are full of it and it s a rage in some circles  but it s much overrated .     are you serious .     quite .  the probe is very complicated and the theory is that it traces mental circuits .  you see  the cells of the brains are interconnected in a large  variety of ways .   some of those interconnected paths are more used than others .  they represent habits of thought  both conscious and unconscious .  theory has it that these paths in any given brain can be used to diagnose mental ills early and with certainty .     well  then .     but subjection to the probe is quite a fearful thing  especially to a child .  it s a traumatic experience .  it takes over an hour .  and even then  the results must be sent to the central psychoanalytical bureau for analysis  and that could take weeks .  and on top of all that  mrs .  hanshaw  there are many psychiatrists who think the theory of probe analyses to be most uncertain .    mrs .  hanshaw compressed her lips .   you mean nothing can be done .    dr .  sloane smiled .   not at all .  there were psychiatrists for centuries before there were probes .  i suggest that you let me talk to the boy .     talk to him .  is that all .     i ll come to you for background information when necessary  but the essential thing  i think  is to talk to the boy .     really  dr .  sloane  i doubt if he ll discuss the matter with you .  he won t talk to me about it and i m his mother .     that often happens   the psychiatrist assured her .   a child will sometimes talk more readily to a stranger .  in any case  i cannot take the case otherwise .    mrs .  hanshaw rose  not at all pleased .   when can you come  doctor .     what about this coming saturday .  the boy won t be in school .  will you be busy .     we will be ready .    she made a dignified exit .  dr .  sloane accompanied her through the small reception room to his office door and waited while she punched the coordinates of her house .  he watched her pass through .  she became a half woman  a quarter woman  an isolated elbow and foot  a nothing .   it was frightening .   did a door ever break down during passage  leaving half a body here and half there .  he had never heard of such a case  but he imagined it could happen .   he returned to his desk and looked up the time of his next appointment .  it was obvious to him that mrs .  hanshaw was annoyed and disappointed at not having arranged for a psychic probe treatment .   why  for god s sake .  why should a thing like the probe  an obvious piece of quackery in his own opinion  get such a hold on the general public .  it must be part of this general trend toward machines .  anything man can do  machines can do better .  machines .  more machines .  machines for anything and everything .  o temporal o mores .   oh  hell .   his resentment of the probe was beginning to bother him .  was it a fear  of technological unemployment  a basic insecurity on his part  a mecha nophobia  if that was the word  he made a mental note to discuss this with his own analyst .   dr .  sloane had to feel his way .  the boy wasn t a patient who had come to him  more or less anxious to talk  more or less anxious to be helped .   under the circumstances it would have been best to keep his first meeting with richard short and noncommittal .  it would have been sufficient merely to establish himself as something less than a total stranger .  the next time he would be someone richard had seen before .  the time after he would be an acquaintance  and after that a friend of the family .   unfortunately  mrs .  hanshaw was not likely to accept a long drawn out process .  she would go searching for a probe and  of course  she would find it .   and harm the boy .  he was certain of that .   it was for that reason he felt he must sacrifice a little of the proper caution and risk a small crisis .   an uncomfortable ten minutes had passed when he decided he must try .  mrs .  hanshaw was smiling in a rather rigid way  eyeing him narrowly  as though she expected verbal magic from him .  richard wriggled in his seat  unresponsive to dr .  sloane s tentative comments  overcome with boredom and unable not to show it .   dr .  sloane said  with casual suddenness   would you like to take a walk with me  richard .    the boy s eyes widened and he stopped wriggling .  he looked directly at dr .  sloane .   a walk  sir .     i mean  outside .     do you go outside .     sometimes .  when i feel like it .    richard was on his feet  holding down a squirming eagerness .   i didn t think anyone did .     i do .  and i like company .    the boy sat down  uncertainly .   mom .     mrs .  hanshaw had stiffened in her seat  her compressed lips radiating horror  but she managed to say   why certainly  dickie .  but watch yourself .    and she managed a quick and baleful glare at dr .  sloane .   in one respect  dr .  sloane had lied .  he did not go outside  sometimes .   he hadn t been in the open since early college days .  true  he had been athletically inclined  still was to some extent  but in his time the indoor ultra violet chambers  swimming pools and tennis courts had flourished .  for those with the price  they were much more satisfactory than the outdoor equivalents  open to the elements as they were  could possibly be .  there was no occasion to go outside .   so there was a crawling sensation about his skin when he felt wind touch it  and he put down his flexied shoes on bare grass with a gingerly movement .    hey  look at that .   richard was quite different now  laughing  his reserve broken down .   dr .  sloane had time only to catch a flash of blue that ended in a tree .  leaves rustled and he lost it .    what was it .     a bird   said richard .   a blue kind of bird .    dr .  sloane looked about him in amazement .  the hanshaw residence was on a rise of ground  and he could see for miles .  the area was only lightly wooded and between clumps of trees  grass gleamed brightly in the sunlight .   colors set in deeper green made red and yellow patterns .  they were flowers .  from the books he had viewed in the course of his lifetime and from the old video shows  he had learned enough so that all this had an eerie sort of familiarity .   and yet the grass was so trim  the flowers so patterned .  dimly  he realized he had been expecting something wilder .  he said   who takes care of all this .    richard shrugged .   i dunno .  maybe the mekkanos do it .     mekkanos .     there s loads of them around .  sometimes they got a sort of atomic knife they hold near the ground .  it cuts the grass .  and they re always fooling around with the flowers and things .  there s one of them over there .    it was a small object  half a mile away .  its metal skin cast back highlights as it moved slowly over the gleaming meadow  engaged in some sort of activity that dr .  sloane could not identify .   dr .  sloane was astonished .  here it was a perverse sort of estheticism  a kind of conspicuous consumption    what s that .   he asked suddenly .   richard looked .  he said   that s a house .  belongs to the froehlichs .  coordinates  a            .  that little pointy building over there is the public door .    dr .  sloane was staring at the house .  was that what it looked like from the outside .  somehow he had imagined something much more cubic  and taller .    come along   shouted richard  running ahead .   dr .  sloane followed more sedately .   do you know all the houses about here .     just about .     where is a             .   it was his own house  of course .   richard looked about .   let s see .  oh  sure  i know where it is you see that water there .     water .   dr .  sloane made out a line of silver curving across the green .    sure .  real water .  just sort of running over rocks and things .  it keeps  running all the time .  you can get across it if you step on the rocks .  it s called a river .    more like a creek  thought dr .  sloane .  he had studied geography  of course  but what passed for the subject these days was really economic and cultural geography .  physical geography was almost an extinct science except among specialists .  still  he knew what rivers and creeks were  in a theoretical sort of way .   richard was still talking .   well  just past the river  over that hill with the big clump of trees and down the other side a way is a             .  it s a light green house with a white roof .     it is .   dr .  sloane was genuinely astonished .  he hadn t known it was green .   some small animal disturbed the grass in its anxiety to avoid the oncoming feet .  richard looked after it and shrugged .   you can t catch them .  i tried .    a butterfly flitted past  a wavering bit of yellow .  dr .  sloane s eyes followed it .   there was a low hum that lay over the fields  interspersed with an occasional harsh  calling sound  a rattle  a twittering  a chatter that rose  then fell .  as his ear accustomed itself to listening  dr .  sloane heard a thousand sounds  and none were man made .   a shadow fell upon the scene  advancing toward him  covering him .  it was suddenly cooler and he looked upward  startled .   richard said   it s just a cloud .  it ll go away in a minute looka these flowers .  they re the kind that smell .    they were several hundred yards from the hanshaw residence .  the cloud passed and the sun shone once more .  dr .  sloane looked back and was appalled at the distance they had covered .  if they moved out of sight of the house and if richard ran off  would he be able to find his way back .   he pushed the thought away impatiently and looked out toward the line of water  nearer now  and past it to where his own house must be .  he thought wonderingly  light green .   he said   you must be quite an explorer .    richard said  with a shy pride   when i go to school and come back  i always try to use a different route and see new things .     but you don t go outside every morning  do you .  sometimes you use the doors  i imagine .     oh  sure .     why is that  richard .   somehow  dr .  sloane felt there might be significance in that point .   but richard quashed him .  with his eyebrows up and a look of astonishment on his face  he said   well  gosh  some mornings it rains and i have to use the door .  i hate that  but what can you do .  about two weeks ago  i got  caught in the rain and i   he looked about him automatically  and his voice sank to a whisper   caught a cold  and wasn t mom upset  though .    dr .  sloane sighed .   shall we go back now .    there was a quick disappointment on richard s face .   aw  what for .     you remind me that your mother must be waiting for us .     i guess so .   the boy turned reluctantly .   they walked slowly back .  richard was saying  chattily   i wrote a composition at school once about how if i could go on some ancient vehicle   he pronounced it with exaggerated care   i d go in a stratoliner and look at stars and clouds and things .  oh  boy  i was sure nuts .     you d pick something else now .     you bet .  i d go in an aut m bile  real slow .  then i d see everything there was .    mrs .  hanshaw seemed troubled  uncertain .   you don t think it s abnormal  then  doctor .     unusual  perhaps  but not abnormal .  he likes the outside .     but how can he .  it s so dirty  so unpleasant .     that s a matter of individual taste .  a hundred years ago our ancestors were all outside most of the time .  even today  i dare say there are a million africans who have never seen a door .     but richard s always been taught to behave himself the way a decent person in district a   is supposed to behave   said mrs .  hanshaw  fiercely .   not like an african or or an ancestor .     that may be part of the trouble  mrs .  hanshaw .  he feels this urge to go outside and yet he feels it to be wrong .  he s ashamed to talk about it to you or to his teacher .  it forces him into sullen retreat and it could eventually be dangerous .     then how can we persuade him to stop .    dr .  sloane said   don t try .  channel the activity instead .  the day your door broke down  he was forced outside  found he liked it  and that set a pattern .  he used the trip to school and back as an excuse to repeat that first exciting experience .  now suppose you agree to let him out of the house for two hours on saturdays and sundays .  suppose he gets it through his head that after all he can go outside without necessarily having to go anywhere in the process .  don t you think he ll be willing to use the door to go to school and back thereafter .  and don t you think that will stop the trouble he s now having with his teacher and probably with his fellow pupils .     but then will matters remain so .  must they .  won t he ever be normal again .    dr .  sloane rose to his feet .   mrs .  hanshaw  he s as normal as need be right now .  right now  he s tasting the joys of the forbidden .  if you cooperate with him  show that you don t disapprove  it will lose some of its attraction right there .  then  as he grows older  he will become more aware  of the expectations and demands of society .  he will learn to conform .  after all  there is a little of the rebel in all of us  but it generally dies down as we grow old and tired .  unless  that is  it is unreasonably suppressed and allowed to build up pressure .  don t do that .  richard will be all right .    he walked to the door .   mrs .  hanshaw said   and you don t think a probe will be necessary  doctor .    he turned and said vehemently   no  definitely not .  there is nothing about the boy that requires it .  understand .  nothing .    his fingers hesitated an inch from the combination board and the expression on his face grew lowering .    what s the matter  dr .  sloane .   asked mrs .  hanshaw .   but he didn t hear her because he was thinking of the door and the psychic probe and all the rising  choking tide of machinery .  there is a little of the rebel in all of us  he thought .   so he said in a soft voice  as his hand fell away from the board and his feet turned away from the door   you know  it s such a beautiful day that i think i ll walk .    strikebreaker  elvis blei rubbed his plump hands and said   self containment is the word .   he smiled uneasily as he helped steven lamorak of earth to a light .  there was uneasiness all over his smooth face with its small wide set eyes .   lamorak puffed smoke appreciatively and crossed his lanky legs .   his hair was powdered with gray and he had a large and powerful jawbone .   home grown .   he asked  staring critically at the cigarette .  he tried to hide his own disturbance at the other s tension .    quite   said blei .    i wonder   said lamorak   that you have room on your small world for such luxuries .     lamorak thought of his first view of elsevere from the spaceship visiplate .  it was a jagged  airless planetoid  some hundred miles in diameter  just a dust gray rough hewn rock  glimmering dully in the light of its sun              miles distant .  it was the only object more than a mile in diameter that circled that sun  and now men had burrowed into that miniature world and constructed a society in it .  and he himself  as a sociologist  had come to study the world and see how humanity had made itself fit into that queerry specialized niche .    blei s polite fixed smile expanded a hair .  he said   we are not a small world  dr .  lamorak  you judge us by two dimensional standards .  the surface area of elsevere is only three quarters that of the state of new york  but that s irrelevant .  remember  we can occupy  if we wish  the entire interior of elsevere .  a sphere of    miles radius has a volume of well over  copyright         by columbia publications  inc .   original title   male strikebreaker .     half a million cubic miles .  if all of elsevere were occupied by levels    feet apart  the total surface area within the planetoid would be            square miles  and that is equal to the total land area of earth .  and none of these square miles  doctor  would be unproductive .    lamorak said   good lord   and stared blankly for a moment .   yes  of course you re right .  strange i never thought of it that way .  but then  elsevere is the only thoroughly exploited planetoid world in the galaxy  the rest of us simply can t get away from thinking of two dimensional surfaces  as you pointed out .  well  i m more than ever glad that your council has been so cooperative as to give me a free hand in this investigation of mine .    blei nodded convulsively at that .   lamorak frowned slightly and thought  he acts for all the world as though he wished i had not come .  something s wrong .   blei said   of course  you understand that we are actually much smaller than we could be  only minor portions of elsevere have as yet been hollowed out and occupied .  nor are we particularly anxious to expand  except very slowly .  to a certain extent we are limited by the capacity of our pseudogravity engines and solar energy converters .     i understand .  but tell me  councillor blei as a matter of personal curiosity  and not because it is of prime importance to my project could i view some of your farming and herding levels first .  i am fascinated by the thought of fields of wheat and herds of cattle inside a planetoid .     you ll find the cattle small by your standards  doctor  and we don t have much wheat .  we grow yeast to a much greater extent .  but there will be some wheat to show you .  some cotton and tobacco  too .  even fruit trees .     wonderful .  as you say  self containment .  you recirculate everything  i imagine .    lamorak s sharp eyes did not miss the fact that this last remark twinged blei .  the elseverian s eyes narrowed to slits that hid his expression .   he said   we must recirculate  yes .  air  water  food  minerals everything that is used up must be restored to its original state  waste products are reconverted to raw materials .  all that is needed is energy  and we have enough of that .  we don t manage with one hundred percent efficiency  of course  there is a certain seepage .  we import a small amount of water each year  and if our needs grow  we may have to import some coal and oxygen .    lamorak said   when can we start our tour  councillor blei .    blei s smile lost some of its negligible warmth .   as soon as we can  doctor .  there are some routine matters that must be arranged .    lamorak nodded  and having finished his cigarette  stubbed it out .   routine matters .  there was none of this hesitancy during the preliminary correspondence .  elsevere had seemed proud that its unique planetoid existence had attracted the attention of the galaxy .   he said   i realize i would be a disturbing influence in  a tightly knit  society   and watched grimly as blei leaped at the explanation and made it his own .    yes   said blei   we feel marked off from the rest of the galaxy .  we have our own customs .  each individual elseverian fits into a comfortable niche .  the appearance of a stranger without fixed caste is unsettling .     the caste system does involve a certain inflexibility .     granted   said blei quickly   but there is also a certain self assurance .  we have firm rules of intermarriage and rigid inheritance of occupation .  each man  woman and child knows his place  accepts it  and is accepted in it  we have virtually no neurosis or mental illness .     and are there no misfits .   asked lamorak .   blei shaped his mouth as though to say no  then clamped it suddenly shut  biting the word into silence  a frown deepened on his forehead .  he said  at length   i will arrange for the tour  doctor .  meanwhile  i imagine you would welcome a chance to freshen up and to sleep .    they rose together and left the room  blei politely motioning the earthman to precede him out the door .   lamorak felt oppressed by the vague feeling of crisis that had pervaded his discussion with blei .   the newspaper reinforced that feeling .  he read it carefully before getting into bed  with what was at first merely a clinical interest .  it was an eight page tabloid of synthetic paper .  cue quarter of its items consisted of  personals   births  marriages  deaths  record quotas  expanding habitable volume  not area .  three dimensions .   .  the remainder included scholarly essays  educational material  and fiction .  of news  in the sense to which lamorak was accustomed  there was virtually nothing .   one item only could be so considered and that was chilling in its incompleteness .   it said  under a small headline  demands unchanged  there has been no change in his attitude of yesterday .  the chief councillor  after a second interview  announced that his demands remain completely unreasonable and cannot be met under any circumstances .   then  in parentheses  and in different type  there was the statement  the editors of this paper agree that elsevere cannot and will not jump to his whistle  come what may .   lamorak read it over three times .  ms attitude .  ms demands .  ms whistle .   whose .   he slept uneasily  that night .   he had no time for newspapers in the days that followed  but spasmodically  the matter returned to his thoughts .   blei  who remained his guide and companion for most of the tour  grew ever more withdrawn .   on the third day  quite artificially clock set in an earthlike twenty four  hour pattern   blei stopped at one point  and said   now this level is devoted entirely to chemical industries .  that section is not important    but he turned away a shade too rapidly  and lamorak seized his arm .   what are the products of that section .     fertilizers .  certain organics   said blei stiffly .   lamorak held him back  looking for what sight blei might be evading .  his gaze swept over the close by horizons of lined rock and the buildings squeezed and layered between the levels .   lamorak said   isn t that a private residence there .    blei did not look in the indicated direction .   lamorak said   i think that s the largest one i ve seen yet .  why is it here on a factory level .   that alone made it noteworthy .  he had already seen that the levels on elsevere were divided rigidly among the residential  the agricultural and the industrial .   he looked back and called   councillor blei .    the councillor was walking away and lamorak pursued him with hasty steps .   is there something wrong  sir .    blei muttered   i am rude  i know .  i am sorry .  there are matters that prey on my mind   he kept up his rapid pace .    concerning his demands .    blei came to a full halt .   what do you know about that .     no more than i ve said .  i read that much in the newspaper .    blei muttered something to himself .   lamorak said   ragusnik .  what s that .    blei sighed heavily .   i suppose you ought to be told .  it s humiliating  deeply embarrassing .  the council thought that matters would certainly be arranged shortly and that your visit need not be interfered with  that you need not know or be concerned .  but it is almost a week now .  i don t know what will happen and  appearances notwithstanding  it might be best for you to leave .  no reason for an outworlder to risk death .    the earthman smiled incredulously .   risk death .  in this little world  so peaceful and busy .  i can t believe it .    the elseverian councillor said   i can explain .  i think it best i should .   he turned his head away .   as i told you  everything on elsevere must recirculate .  you understand that .     yes .     that includes uh  human wastes .     i assumed so   said lamorak .    water is reclaimed from it by distillation and absorption .  what remains is converted into fertilizer for yeast use  some of it is used as a source of fine organics and other by products .  these factories you see are devoted to this .     well .   lamorak had experienced a certain difficulty in the drinking of water when he first landed on elsevere  because he had been realistic enough to know what it must be reclaimed from  but he had conquered the  feeling easily enough .  even on earth  water was reclaimed by natural processes from all sorts of unpalatable substances .   blei  with increasing difficulty  said   igor ragusnik is the man who is in charge of the industrial processes immediately involving the wastes .  the position has been in his family since elsevere was first colonized .  one of the original settlers was mikhail ragusnik and he he     was in charge of waste reclamation .     yes .  now that residence you singled out is the ragusnik residence  it is the best and most elaborate on the planetoid .  ragusnik gets many privileges the rest of us do not have  but  after all   passion entered the councillor s voice with great suddenness   we cannot speak to him .     what .     he demands full social equality .  he wants his children to mingle with ours  and our wives to visit  oh .   it was a groan of utter disgust .   lamorak thought of the newspaper item that could not even bring itself to mention ragusnik s name in print  or to say anything specific about his demands .  he said     take it he s an outcast because of his job .     naturally .  human wastes and   words failed blei .  after a pause  he said more quietly   as an earthman    suppose you don t understand .     as a sociologist  i think i do .   lamorak thought of the untouchables in ancient india  the ones who handled corpses .  he thought of the position of swineherds in ancient judea .   he went on   i gather elsevere will not give in to those demands .     never   said blei  energetically .   never .     and so .     ragusnik has threatened to cease operations .     go on strike  in other words .     yes .     would that be serious .     we have enough food and water to last quite a while  reclamation is not essential in that sense .  but the wastes would accumulate  they would infect the planetoid .  after generations of careful disease control  we have low natural resistance to germ diseases .  once an epidemic started and one would we would drop by the hundred .     is ragusnik aware of this .     yes  of course .     do you think he is likely to go through with his threat  then .     he is mad .  he has already stopped working  there has been no waste reclamation since the day before you landed .   blei s bulbous nose sniffed at the air as though it already caught the whiff of excrement .   lamorak sniffed mechanically at that  but smelled nothing .   blei said   so you see why it might be wise for you to leave .  we are humiliated  of course  to have to suggest it .    but lamorak said   wait  not just yet .  good lord  this is a matter of great interest to me professionally .  may i speak to the ragusnik .     on no account   said blei  alarmed .    but i would like to understand the situation .  the sociological conditions here are unique and not to be duplicated elsewhere .  in the name of science     how do you mean  speak .  would image reception do .     yes .     i will ask the council   muttered blei .   they sat about lamorak uneasily  their austere and dignified expressions badly marred with anxiety .  blei  seated in the midst of them  studiously avoided the earthman s eyes .   the chief councillor  gray haired  his face harshly wrinkled  his neck scrawny  said in a soft voice   if in any way you can persuade him  sir  out of your own convictions  we will welcome that .  in no case  however  are you to imply that we will  in any way  yield .    a gauzy curtain fell between the council and lamorak .  he could make out the individual councillors still  but now he turned sharply toward the receiver before him .  it glowed to life .   a head appeared in it  in natural color and with great realism .  a strong dark head  with massive chin faintly stubbkd  and thick  red lips set into a firm horizontal line .   the image said  suspiciously   who are you .    lamorak said   my name is steven lamorak  i am an earthman .     an outworlder .     that s right .  i am visiting elsevere .  you are ragusnik .     igor ragusnik  at your service   said the image  mockingly .   except that there is no service and will be none until my family and i are treated like human beings .    lamorak said   do you realize the danger that elsevere is in .  the possibility of epidemic disease .     in twenty four hours  the situation can be made normal  if they allow me humanity .  the situation is theirs to correct .     you sound like an educated man  ragusnik .     so .     i am told you re denied of no material comforts .  you are housed and clothed and fed better than anyone on elsevere .  your children are the best educated .     granted .  but all by servo mechanism .  and motherless girl babies are sent us to care for until they grow to be our wives .  and they die young for loneliness .  why .   there was sudden passion in his voice .   why must we live in isolation as if we were all monsters  unfit for human beings to be  near .  aren t weliuman beings like others  with the same needs and desires and reelings .  don t we perform an honorable and useful function  .    there was a rustling of sighs from behind lamorak .  ragusnik heard it  and raised his voice .   i see you of the council behind there .  answer me  isn t it an honorable and useful function .  it is your waste made into food for you .  is the man who purifies corruption worse than the man who produces it .  listen  councillors  i will not give in .  let all of elsevere die of disease  including myself and my son  if necessary but i will not give in .  my family will be better dead of disease  than living as now .    lamorak interrupted .   you ve led this life since birth  haven t you .     and if i have .     surely you re used to it .     never .  resigned  perhaps .  my father was resigned  and i was resigned for a while  but i have watched my son  my only son  with no other little boy to play with .  my brother and i had each other  but my son will never have anyone  and i am no longer resigned .  i am through with elsevere and through with talking .    the receiver went dead .   the chief councillor s face had paled to an aged yellow .  he and blei were the only ones of the group left with lamorak .  the chief councillor said   the man is deranged  i do not know how to force him .    he had a glass of wine at his side  as he lifted it to his lips  he spilled a few drops that stained his white trousers with purple splotches .   lamorak said   are his demands so unreasonable .  why can t he be accepted into society .    there was momentary rage in blei s eyes .   a dealer in excrement .   then he shrugged .   you are from earth .    incongruously  lamorak thought of another unacceptable  one of the numerous classic creations of the medieval cartoonist  al capp .  the variously named  inside man at the skonk works .    he said   does ragusnik really deal with excrement .  i mean  is there physical contact .  surely  it is all handled by automatic machinery .     of course   said the chief councillor .    then exactly what is ragusnik s function .     he manually adjusts the various controls that assure the proper functioning of the machinery .  he shifts units to allow repairs to be made  he alters functional rates with the time of day  he varies end production with demand .   he added sadly   if we had the space to make the machinery ten times as complex  all this could be done automatically  but that would be such needless waste .     but even so   insisted lamorak   all ragusnik does he does simply by pressing buttons or closing contacts or things like that .     yes .     f .   then his work is no different from any elseverian s .   blei said  stiffly   you don t understand .    and for that you will risk the death of your children .    we have no other choice   said blei .  there was enough agony in his  voice to assure lamorak that the situation was torture for him  but that he  had no other choice indeed .   lamorak shrugged in disgust .   then break the strike .  force him .    how .   said the chief councillor .   who would touch him or go near  him .  and if we kill him by blasting from a distance  how will that help us .    lamorak said  thoughtfully   would you know how to run his machinery .    the chief councillor came to his feet .   i .   he howled .    i don t mean you   cried lamorak at once .   i used the pronoun in its indefinite sense .  could someone learn how to handle ragusnik s machinery .    slowly  the passion drained out of the chief councillor .   it is in the handbooks  i am certain though i assure you i have never concerned myself with it .     then couldn t someone leam the procedure and substitute for ragusnik until the man gives in .    blei said   who would agree to do such a thing .  not i  under any circumstances .    lamorak thought fleetingty of earthly taboos that might be almost as strong .  he thought of cannibalism  incest  a pious man cursing god .  he said   but you must have made provision for vacancy in the ragusnik job .  suppose he died .     then his son would automatically succeed to his job  or his nearest other relative   said blei .    what if he had no adult relatives .  what if all his family died at once .     that has never happened  it will never happen .    the chief councillor added   if there were danger of it  we might  perhaps  place a baby or two with the ragusniks and have it raised to the profession .     ah .  and how would you choose that baby .     from among children of mothers who died in childbirth  as we choose the future ragusnik bride .     then choose a substitute ragusnik now  by lot   said lamorak .   the chief councillor said   nof impossible .  how can you suggest that .  if we select a baby  that baby is brought up to the life  it knows no other .  at this point  it would be necessary to choose an adult and subject him to ragusnik hood .  no  dr .  lamorak  we are neither monsters nor abandoned brutes .    no use  thought lamorak helplessly .  no use  unless  he couldn t bring himself to face that unless just yet .   that night  lamorak slept scarcely at all .  ragusnik asked for only the basic elements of humanity .  but opposing that were thirty thousand el severians who faced death .   the welfare of thirty thousand on one side  the just demands of one family on the other .  could one say that thirty thousand who would support such injustice deserved to die .  injustice by what standards .  earth s .  el severe s .  and who was lamorak that he should judge .   and ragusnik .  he was willing to let thirty thousand die  including men and women who merely accepted a situation they had been taught to accept and could not change if they wished to .  and children who had nothing at all to do with it .   thirty thousand on one side  a single family on the other .   lamorak made his decision in something that was almost despair  in the morning he called the chief councillor .   he said   sir  if you can find a substitute  ragusnik will see that he has lost all chance to force a decision in his favor and will return to work .     there can be no substitute   sighed the chief councillor   i have explained that .     no substitute among the elseverians  but i am not an elseverian  it doesn t matter to me .    will substitute .    they were excited  much more excited than lamorak himself .  a dozen times they asked him if he was serious .   lamorak had not shaved  and he felt sick   certainly  i m serious .  and any time ragusnik acts like this  you can always import a substitute .  no other world has the taboo and there will always be plenty of temporary substitutes available if you pay enough .     he was betraying a brutally exploited man  and he knew it .  but he told himself desperately  except for ostracism  he s very well treated .  very well .    they gave him the handbooks and he spent six hours  reading and rereading .  there was no use asking questions .  none of the elseverians knew anything about the job  except for what was in the handbook  and all seemed uncomfortable if the details were as much as mentioned .    maintain zero reading of galvanometer a   at all times during red signal of the lunge howler   read lamorak .   now what s a lunge howler .     there will be a sign   muttered blei  and the elseverians looked at each other hang dog and bent their heads to stare at their finger ends .   they left him long before he reached the small rooms that were the central headquarters of generations of working ragusniks  serving their  world .  he had specific instructions concerning which turnings to take and what level to reach  but they hung back and let him proceed alone .   he went through the rooms painstakingly  identifying the instruments and controls  following the schematic diagrams in the handbook .   there s a lunge howler  he thought  with gloomy satisfaction .  the sign did indeed say so .  it had a semi circular face bitten into holes that were obviously designed to glow in separate colors .  why a  howler  then .   he didn t know .   somewhere  thought lamorak  somewhere wastes are accumulating  pushing against gears and exits  pipelines and stills  waiting to be handled in half a hundred ways .  now they just accumulate .   not without a tremor  he pulled the first switch as indicated by the handbook in its directions for  initiation .   a gentle murmur of life made itself felt through the floors and walls .  he turned a knob and lights went on .   at each step  he consulted the handbook  though he knew it by heart  and with each step  the rooms brightened and the dial indicators sprang into motion and a humming grew louder .   somewhere deep in the factories  the accumulated wastes were being drawn into the proper channels .   a high pitched signal sounded and startled lamorak out of his painful concentration .  it was the communications signal and lamorak fumbled his receiver into action .   ragusnik s head showed  startled  then slowly  the incredulity and outright shock faded from his eyes .   that s how it is  then .     i m not an elseverian  ragusnik  i don t mind doing this .     but what business is it of yours .  why do you interfere .     i m on your side  ragusnik  but i must do this .     why  if you re on my side .  do they treat people on your world as they treat me here .     not any longer .  but even if you are right  there are thirty thousand people on elsevere to be considered .     they would have given in  you ve ruined my only chance .     they would not have given in .  and in a way  you ve won  they know now that you re dissatisfied .  until now  they never dreamed a ragusnik could be unhappy  that he could make trouble .     what if they know .  now all they need do is hire an outworlder anytime .    lamorak shook his head violently .  he had thought this through in these last bitter hours .   the fact that they know means that the elseverians will begin to think about you  some will begin to wonder if it s right to treat a human so .  and if outworlders are hired  they ll spread the word that this goes on upon elsevere and galactic public opinion will be in your favor .     and .     things will improve .  in your son s time  things will be much better .     in my son s time   said ragusnik  his cheeks sagging .   i might have had it now .  well  i lose .  i ll go back to the job .    lamorak felt an overwhelming relief .   if you ll come here now  sir  you may have your job and i ll consider it an honor to shake your hand .    ragusnik s head snapped up and filled with a gloomy pride .   you call me  sir  and offer to shake my hand .  go about your business  earthman  and leave me to my work  for i would not shake yours .    lamorak returned the way he had come  relieved that the crisis was over  and profoundly depressed  too .   he stopped in surprise when he found a section of corridor cordoned off  so he could not pass .  he looked about for alternate routes  then startled at a magnified voice above his head .   dr .  lamorak do you hear me .  this is councillor blei .    lamorak looked up .  the voice came over some sort of public address system  but he saw no sign of an outlet .   he called out   is anything wrong .  can you hear me .     i hear you .    instinctively  lamorak was shouting .   is anything wrong .  there seems to be a block here .  are there complications with ragusnik .     ragusnik has gone to work   came blei s voice .   the crisis is over  and you must make ready to leave .     leave .     leave elsevere  a ship is being made ready for you now .     but wait a bit .   lamorak was confused by this sudden leap of events .   i haven t completed my gathering of data .    blei s voice said   this cannot be helped .  you will be directed to the ship and your belongings will be sent after you by servo mechanisms .  we trust  we trust    something was becoming clear to lamorak .   you trust what .     we trust you will make no attempt to see or speak directly to any elseverian .  and of course we hope you will avoid embarrassment by not attempting to return to elsevere at any time in the future .  a colleague of yours would be welcome if further data concerning us is needed .     i understand   said lamorak  tonelessly .  obviously  he had himself become a ragusnik .  he had handled the controls that in turn had handled the wastes  he was ostracized .  he was a corpse handler  a swineherd  an inside man at the skonk works .   he said   good bye .    blei s voice said   before we direct you  dr .  lamorak  .  on behalf of the council of elsevere  i thank you for your help in this crisis .     you re welcome   said lamorak  bitterly .   insert knob a in hole b  dave woodbury and john hansen  grotesque in their spacesuits  supervised anxiously as the large crate swung slowly out and away from the freight ship and into the airlock .  with nearly a year of their hitch on space station a  behind them  they were understandably weary of filtration units that clanked  hydroponic tubs that leaked  air generators that hummed constantly and stopped occasionally .    nothing works   woodbury would say mournfully   because everything is hand assembled by ourselves .     following directions   hansen would add   composed by an idiot .    there were undoubtedly grounds for complaint there .  the most expensive thing about a spaceship was the room allowed for freight so all equipment had to be sent across space disassembled and nested .  all equipment had to be assembled at the station itself with clumsy hands  inadequate tools and with blurred and ambiguous direction sheets for guidance .   painstakingly woodbury had written complaints to which hansen had added appropriate adjectives  and formal requests for relief of the situation had made their way back to earth .   and earth had responded .  a special robot had been designed  with a positronic brain crammed with the knowledge of how to assemble properly any disassembled machine in existence .   that robot was in the crate being unloaded now and woodbury was trembling as the airlock closed behind it .   copyright         by fantasy house  inc .    first   he said   it overhauls the food assembler and adjusts the steak attachment knob so we can get it rare instead of burnt .    they entered the station and attacked the crate with dainty touches of the demoleculizer rods in order to make sure that not a precious metal atom of their special assembly robot was damaged .   the crate fell open .   and there within it were five hundred separate pieces and one blurred and ambiguous direction sheet for assemblage .   the up to date sorcerer  it always puzzled me that nicholas nitely  although a justice of the peace  was a bachelor .  the atmosphere of his profession  so to speak  seemed so conducive to matrimony that surely he could scarcely avoid the gentle bond of wedlock .   when i said as much over a gin and tonic at the club recently  he said   ah  but i had a narrow escape some time ago   and he sighed .    oh  really .     a fair young girl  sweet  intelligent  pure yet desperately ardent  and withal most alluring to the physical senses for even such an old fogy as myself .    i said   how did you come to let her go .     ihad no choice .   he smiled gently at me and his smooth  ruddy complexion  his smooth gray hair  his smooth blue eyes  all combined to give him an expression of near saintliness .  he said   you see  it was really the fault of her fiance     ah  she was engaged to someone else .      and of professor wellington johns  who was  although an endocrinolo gist  by way of being an up to date sorcerer .  in fact  it was just that   he sighed  sipped at his drink  and turned on me the bland and cheerful face of one who is about to change the subject  i said firmly   now  then  nitely  old man  you cannot leave it so .  i want to know about your beautiful girl the flesh that got away .    he winced at the pun  one  i must admit  of my more abominable efforts   copyright         by mercury press  inc .   and settled down by ordering his glass refilled .   you understand   he said   i learned some of the details later on .    professor wellington johns had a large and prominent nose  two sincere eyes and a distinct talent for making clothes appear too krge for him .  he said   my dear children  love is a matter of chemistry .    his dear children  who were really students of his  and not his children at all  were named alexander dexter and alice sanger .  they looked perfectly full of chemicals as they sat there holding hands .  together  their age amounted to perhaps     evenly split between them  and alexander said  fairly inevitably   vive la chemie .    professor johns smiled reprovingly .   or rather endocrinology .  hormones  after all  affect our emotions and it is not surprising that one should  specifically  stimulate that feeling we call love .     but that s so unromantic   murmured alice .   i m sure i don t need any .   she looked up at alexander with a yearning glance .    my dear   said the professor   your blood stream was crawling with it at that moment you  as the saying is  fell in love .  its secretion had been stimulated by  for a moment he considered his words carefully  being a highly moral man  by some environmental factor involving your young man  and once the hormonal action had taken place  inertia carried you on .  i could duplicate the effect easily .     why  professor   said alice  with gentle affection .   it would be delightful to have you try   and she squeezed alexander s hand shyly .    i do not mean   said the professor  coughing to hide his embarrassment   that i would personally attempt to reproduce or  rather  to duplicate  the conditions that created the natural secretion of the hormone .  i mean  instead  that i could inject the hormone itself by hypodermic or even by oral ingestion  since it is a steroid hormone .  i have  you see   and here he removed his glasses and polished them proudly   isolated and purified the hormone .    alexander sat erect .   professor .  and you have said nothing .     i must know more about it first .     do you mean to say   said alice  her lovely brown eyes shimmering with delight   that you can make people fed the wonderful delight and heaven surpassing tenderness of true love by means of a  .  .  .  a pill .    the professor said   i can indeed duplicate the emotion to which you refer in those rather cloying terms .     then why don t you .    alexander raised a protesting hand .   now  darling  your ardor leads you astray .  our own happiness and forthcoming nuptials make you forget certain facts of life .  if a married person were  by mistake  to accept this hormone    professor johns said  with a trace of hauteur   let me explain right now  that my hormone  or my amatogenic principle  as i call it    for he  in common with many practical scientists  enjoyed a proper scorn for the rarefied niceties of classical philology  .    call it a love philtre  professor   said alice  with a melting sigh .    my amatogenic cortical principle   said professor johns  sternly   has no effect on married individuals .  the hormone cannot work if inhibited by other factors  and being married is certainly a factor that inhibits love .     why  so i have heard   said alexander  gravely   but i intend to disprove that callous belief in the case of my own alice .     alexander   said alice .   my love .    the professor said   i mean that marriage inhibits extramarital love .    alexander said   why  it has come to my ears that sometimes it does not .    alice said  shocked   alexander .     only in rare instances  my dear  among those who have not gone to college .    the professor said   marriage may not inhibit a certain paltry sexual attraction  or tendencies toward minor trifling  but true love  as miss sanger expressed the emotion  is something which cannot blossom when the memory of a stern wife and various unattractive children hobbles the subconscious .     do you mean to say   said alexander   that if you were to feed your love philtre beg pardon  your amatogenic principle to a number of people indiscriminately  only the unmarried individuals would be affected .     that is right  i have experimented on certain animals which  though not going through the conscious marriage rite  do form monogamous attachments .  those with the attachments already formed are not affected .     then  professor  i have a perfectly splendid idea .  tomorrow night is the night of the senior dance here at college .  there will be at least fifty couples present  mostly unmarried .  put your philtre in the punch .     what .  are you mad .    but alice had caught fire .   why  it s a heavenly idea  professor .  to think that all my friends will feel as i feel .  professor  you would be an angel from heaven .   but oh  alexander  do you suppose the feelings might be a trifle uncontrolled .  some of our college chums are a little wild and if  in the heat of discovery of love  they should  well  kiss    professor johns said  indignantly   my dear miss sanger .  you must not allow your imagination to become overheated .  my hormone induces only those feelings which lead to marriage and not to the expression of anything that might be considered indecorous .     i m sorry   murmured alice  in confusion .   i should remember  professor  that you are the most highly moral man i know excepting always dear alexander and that no scientific discovery of yours could possibly lead to immorality .    she looked so woebegone that the professor forgave her at once .    then you ll do it  professor .   urged alexander .   after all  assuming there will be a sudden urge for mass marriage afterward  i can take care of that by having nicholas nitely  an old and valued friend of the family  present on some pretext .  he is a justice of the peace and can easily arrange for such things as licenses and so on .     i could scarcely agree   said the professor  obviously weakening   to perform an experiment without the consent of those experimented upon .  it would be unethical .     but you would be bringing only joy to them .  you would be contributing to the moral atmosphere of the college .  for surely  in the absence of overwhelming pressure toward marriage  it sometimes happens even in college that the pressure of continuous propinquity breeds a certain danger of  of     yes  there is that   said the professor .   well  i shall try a dilute solution .  after all  the results may advance scientific knowledge tremendously and  as you say  it will also advance morality .    alexander said   and  of course  alice and i will drink the punch  too .    alice said   oh  alexander  surely such love as ours needs no artificial aid .     but it would not be artificial  my soul s own .  according to the professor  your love began as a result of just such a hormonal effect  induced  i admit  by more customary methods .    alice blushed rosily .   but then  my only love  why the need for the repetition .     to place us beyond all vicissitudes of fate  my cherished one .     surely  my adored  you don t doubt my love .     no  my heart s charmer  but     but .  is it that you do not trust me  alexander .     of course i trust you  alice  but     but .  again but .   alice rose  furious .   if you cannot trust me  sir  perhaps i had better leave   and she did leave indeed  while the two men stared after her  stunned .   professor johns said   i am afraid my hormone has  quite indirectly  been the occasion of spoiling a marriage rather than of causing one .    alexander swallowed miserably  but his pride upheld him .   she will come back   he said  hollowly .   a love such as ours is not so easily broken .    the senior dance was  of course  the event of the year .  the young men shone and the young ladies glittered .  the music lilted and the dancing feet touched the ground only at intervals .  joy was unrestrained .   or  rather  it was unrestrained in most cases .  alexander dexter stood in one corner  eyes hard  expression icily bleak .  straight and handsome he might be  but no young woman approached him .  he was known to belong  fcp alice sanger  and under such circumstances  no college girl would dream of  poaching .  yet where was alice .    she had not come with alexander and alexander s pride prevented him from searching for her .  from under grim eyelids  he could only watch the circulating couples cautiously .   professor johns  in formal clothes that did not fit although made to measure  approached him .  he said   i will add my hormone to the punch shortly before the midnight toast .  is mr .  nitely still here .     i saw him a moment ago .  in his capacity as chaperon he was busily engaged in making certain that the proper distance between dancing couples was maintained .  four fingers  i believe  at the point of closest approach .  mr .  nitely was most diligently making the necessary measurements .     very good .  oh  i had neglected to ask  is the punch alcoholic .  alcohol would affect the workings of the amatogenic principle adversely .    alexander  despite his sore heart  found spirit to deny the unintended slur upon his class .   alcoholic  professor .  this punch is made along those principles firmly adhered to by all young college students .  it contains only the purest of fruit juices  refined sugar  and a certain quantity of lemon peel  enough to stimulate but not inebriate .     good   said the professor .   now i have added to the hormone a sedative designed to put our experimental subjects to sleep for a short time while the hormone works .  once they awaken  the first individual each sees that is  of course  of the opposite sex will inspire that individual with a pure and noble ardor that can end only in marriage .    then  since it was nearly midnight  he made his way through the happy couples  all dancing at four fingers  distance  to the punch bowl .   alexander  depressed nearly to tears  stepped out to the balcony .  in doing so  he just missed alice  who entered the ballroom from the balcony by another door .    midnight   called out a happy voice .   toast .  toast .  toast to the life ahead of us .    they crowded about the punch bowl  the little glasses were passed round .    to the life ahead of us   they cried out and  with all the enthusiasm of young college students  downed the fiery mixture of pure fruit juices  sugar  and lemon peel  with of course the professor s sedated amatogenic principle .   as the fumes rose to their brains  they slowly crumpled to the floor .   alice stood there alone  still holding her drink  eyes wet with unshed tears .   oh  alexander  alexander  though you doubt  yet are you my only love .  you wish me to drink and i shall drink .   then she  too  sank gracefully downward .   nicholas nitely had gone in search of alexander  for whom his warm heart was concerned .  he had seen him arrive without alice and he could  only assume that a lovers  quarrel had taken place .  nor did he feel any dismay at leaving the party to its own devices .  these were not wild youngsters  but college boys and girls of good family and gentle upbringing .  they could be trusted to the full to observe the four finger limit  as he well knew .   he found alexander on the balcony  staring moodily out at a star riddled sky .    alexander  my boy .   he put his hand on the young man s shoulder .   this is not like you .  to give way so to depression .  chut  my young friend  chut .    alexander s head bowed at the sound of the good old man s voice .   it is unmanly  i know  but i yearn for alice .  i have been cruel to her and i am justly treated now .  and yet  mr .  nitely  if you could but know   he placed his clenched fist on his chest  next his heart .  he could say no more .   nitely said  sorrowfully   do you think because i am unmarried that i am unacquainted with the softer emotions .  be undeceived .  time was when i  too  knew love and heartbreak .  but do not do as i did once and allow pride to prevent your reunion .  seek her out  my boy  seek her out and apologize .  do not allow yourself to become a solitary old bachelor such as i myself .   but  tush  i am puling .    alexander s back had straightened .   i will be guided by you  mr .  nitely .  i will seek her out .     then go on in .  for shortly before i came out  i believe i saw her there .    alexander s heart leaped .   perhaps she searches for me even now .  i will go  but  no .  go you first  mr .  nitely  while i stay behind to recover myself .  i would not have her see me a prey to womanish tears .     of course  my boy .    nitely stopped at the door into the ballroom in astonishment .  had a universal catastrophe struck all low .  fifty couples were lying on the floor  some neaped together most indecorously .   but before he could make up his mind to see if the nearest were dead  to sound the fire alarm  to call the police  to anything  they were rousing and struggling to their feet .   only one still remained .  a lonely girl in white  one arm outstretched gracefully beneath her fair head .  it was alice sanger and nitely hastened to her  oblivious to the rising clamor about him .   he sank to his knees .   miss sanger .  my dear miss sanger .  are you hurt .    she opened her beautiful eyes slowly  and said   mr .  nitely .  i never realized you were such a vision of loveliness .     i .   nitely started back with horror  but she had now risen to her feet and there was light in her eyes such as nitely had not seen in a maiden s eyes for thirty years and then only weakly .   she said   mr .  nitely  surely you will not leave me .     no  no   said nitely  confused .   if you need me  i shall stay .     i need you .  i need you with all my heart and soul .  i need you as a thirsty flower needs the morning dew .  i need you as thisbe of old needed pyra mus .    nitely  still backing away  looked about hastily  to see if anyone could be hearing this unusual declaration  but no one seemed to be paying any attention .  as nearly as he could make out  the air was filled with other declarations of similar sort  some being even more forceful and direct .   his back was up against a wall  and alice approached him so closely as to break the four finger rule to smithereens .  she broke  in fact  the no finger rule  and at the resulting mutual pressure  a certain indefinable something seemed to thud away within nitely .    miss sanger .  please .     miss sanger .  am i miss sanger to you .   exclaimed alice  passionately .   mr .  nitely .  nichoks .  make me your alice  your own .  marry me .  marry me .    all around there was the cry of  marry me .  marry me .   and young men and women crowded around nitely  for they knew well that he was a justice of the peace .  they cried out   marry us  mr .  nitely .  marry us .    he could only cry in return   i must get you all licenses .    they parted to let him leave on that errand of mercy .  only alice followed him .   nitely met alexander at the door of the balcony and turned him back toward the open and fresh air .  professor johns came at that moment to join them all .   nitely said   alexander .  professor johns .  the most extraordinary thing has occurred     yes   said the professor  his mild face beaming with joy .   the experiment has been a success .  the principle is far more effective on the human being  in fact  than on any of my experimental animals .   noting nitely s confusion  he explained what had occurred in brief sentences .   nitely listened and muttered   strange  strange .  there is a certain elusive familiarity about this .   he pressed his forehead with the knuckles of both hands  but it did not help .   alexander approached alice gently  yearning to clasp her to his strong bosom  yet knowing that no gently nurtured girl could consent to such an expression of emotion from one who had not yet been forgiven .   he said   alice  my lost love  if in your heart you could find    but she shrank from him  avoiding his arms though they were outstretched only in supplication .  she said   alexander  i drank the punch .  it was your wish .     you needn t have .  i was wrong  wrong .     but i did  and oh  alexander  i can never be yours .     never be mine .  but what does this mean .    and alice  seizing nitely s arm  clutched it avidly .   my soul is intertwined indissolubly with that of mr .  nitely  of nicholas  i mean .  my passion for him that is  my passion for marriage with him cannot be withstood .  it racks my being .     you are false .   cried alexander  unbelieving .    you are cruel to say  false     said alice  sobbing .   i cannot help it .     no  indeed   said professor johns  who had been listening to this in the greatest consternation  after having made his expknation to nitely .   she could scarcely help it .  it is simply an endocrinological manifestation .     indeed that is so   said nitely  who was struggling with endocrinological manifestations of his own .   there  there  my my dear .   he patted alice s head in a most fatherly way and when she held her enticing face up toward his  swooningly  he considered whether it might not be a fatherly thing  nay  even a neighborly thing to press those lips with his own  in pure fashion .   but alexander  out of his heart s despair  cried   you are false  false false as cressid   and rushed from the room .   and nitely would have gone after him  but that alice had seized him about the neck and bestowed upon his slowly melting lips a kiss that was not daughterly in the least .   it was not even neighborly .   they arrived at nitely s small bachelor cottage with its chaste sign of justice of the peace in old english letters  its air of melancholy peace  its neat serenity  its small stove on which the small kettle was quickly placed by nitely s left hand  his right arm being firmly in the clutch of alice  who  with a shrewdness beyond her years  chose that as one sure method of rendering impossible a sudden bolt through the door on his part  .   nitely s study could be seen through the open door of the dining room  its walls lined with gentle books of scholarship and joy .   again nitely s hand  his left hand  went to his brow .   my dear   he said to alice   it is amazing the way if you would release your hold the merest trifle  my child  so that circulation might be restored the way in which i persist in imagining that all this has taken place before .     surely never before  my dear nicholas   said alice  bending her fair head upon his shoulder  and smiling at him with a shy tenderness that made her beauty as bewitching as moonlight upon still waters   could there have been so wonderful a modem day magician as our wise professor johns  so up to date a sorcerer .     so up to date a   nitely had started so violently as to lift the fair alice a full inch from the floor .   why  surely that must be it .  dickens take me  if that s not it .    for on rare occasions  and under the stress of overpowering emotions  nitely used strong language .     nicholas .  what is it .  you frighten me  my cherubic one .    but nitely walked rapidly into his study  and she was forced to run with him .  his face was white  his lips firm  as he reached for a volume from the shelves and reverently blew the dust from it .    ah   he said with contrition   how i have neglected the innocent joys of my younger days .  my child  in view of this continuing incapacity of my right arm  would you be so kind as to turn the pages until i tell you to stop .    together they managed  in such a tableau of preconnubial bliss as is rarely seen  he holding the book with his left hand  she turning the pages slowly with her right .    i am right .   nitely said with sudden force .   professor johns  my dear fellow  do come here .  this is the most amazing coincidence a frightening example of the mysterious unfelt power that must sport with us on occasion for some hidden purpose .    professor johns  who had prepared his own tea and was sipping it patiently  as befitted a discreet gentleman of intellectual habit in the presence of two ardent lovers who had suddenly retired to the next room  called out   surely you do not wish my presence .     but i do  sir .  i would fain consult one of your scientific attainments .     but you are in a position    alice screamed  faintly   professor .     a thousand pardons  my dear   said professor johns  entering .   my cobwebby old mind is filled with ridiculous fancies .  it is long since i   and he pulled mightily at his tea  which he had made strong  and was himself again at once .    professor   said nitely .   this dear child referred to you as an up to date sorcerer and that turned my mind instantly to gilbert and sullivan s the sorcerer .     what   asked professor johns  mildly   are gilbert and sullivan .    nitely cast a devout glance upward  as though with the intention of gauging the direction of the inevitable thunderbolt and dodging .  he said in a hoarse whisper   sir william schwenck gilbert and sir arthur sullivan wrote  respectively  the words and music of the greatest musical comedies the world has ever seen .  one of these is entitled the sorcerer .  in it  too  a philtre was used  a highly moral one which did not affect married people  but which did manage to deflect the young heroine away from her handsome young lover and into the arms of an elderly man .     and   asked professor johns   were matters allowed to remain so .     well  no .   really  my dear  the movements of your fingers in the region of the nape of my neck  while giving rise to undeniably pleasurable sensations  do rather distract me .   there is a reunion of the young lovers  professor .     ah   said professor johns .   then in view of the close resemblance of the fictional plot to real life  perhaps the solution in the play will help point the  way to the reunion of alice and alexander .  at least  i presume you do not wish to go through life with one arm permanently useless .    alice said   i have no wish to be reunited .  i want only my own nicholas .     there is something   said nitely   to be said for that refreshing point of view  but tush youth must be served .  there is a solution in the play  professor johns  and it is for that reason that i most particularly wanted to talk to you .   he smiled with a gentle benevolence .   in the play  the effects of the potion were completely neutralized by the actions of the gentleman who administered the potion in the first place  the gentleman  in other words  analogous to yourself .     and those actions were .     suicide .  simply that .  in some manner unexplained by the authors  the effect of this suicide was to break the sp    but by now professor johns had recovered his equilibrium and said in the most sepulchrally forceful tone that could be imagined   my dear sir  may i state instantly that  despite my affection for the young persons involved in this sad dilemma  i cannot under any circumstances consent to self immolation .  such a procedure might be extremely efficacious in connection with love potions of ordinary vintage  but my amatogenic principle  i assure you  would be completely unaffected by my death .    nitely sighed .   i feared that .  as a matter of fact  between ourselves  it was a very poor ending for the play  perhaps the poorest in the canon   and he looked up briefly in mute apology to the spirit of william s .  gilbert .   it was pulled out of a hat .  it had not been properly foreshadowed earlier in the play .  it punished an individual who did not deserve the punishment .  in short  it was  alas  completely unworthy of gilbert s powerful genius .    professor johns said   perhaps it was not gilbert .  perhaps some bungler had interfered and botched the job .     there is no record of that .    but professor johns  his scientific mind keenly aroused by an unsolved puzzle  said at once   we can test this .  let us study the mind of this this gilbert .  he wrote other plays  did he .     fourteen  in collaboration with sullivan .     were there endings that resolved analogous situations in ways which were more appropriate .    nitely nodded .   one  certainly .  there was ruddigore .     who was he .     ruddigore is a place .  the main character is revealed as the true bad baronet of ruddigore and is  of course  under a curse .     to be sure   muttered professor johns  who realized that such an eventuality frequently befell bad baronets and was even inclined to think it served them right .   nitely said   the curse compelled him to commit one crime or more each  day .  were one day to pass without a crime  he would inevitably die in agonizing torture .     how horrible   murmured the soft hearted alice .    naturally   said nitely   no one can think up a crime each day  so our hero was forced to use his ingenuity to circumvent the curse .     how .     he reasoned thus  if he deliberately refused to commit a crime  he was courting death by his own act .  in other words  he was attempting suicide  and attempting suicide is  of course  a crime and so he fulfills the conditions of the curse .     i see .  i see   said professor johns .   gilbert obviously believes in solving matters by carrying them forward to their logical conclusions .   he closed his eyes  and his noble brow clearly bulged with the numerous intense thought waves it contained .   he opened them .   nitely  old chap  when was the sorcerer first produced .     in eighteen hundred and seventy seven .     then that is it  my dear fellow .  in eighteen seventy seven  we were faced with the victorian age .  the institution of marriage was not to be made sport of on the stage .  it could not be made a comic matter for the sake of the plot .  marriage was holy  spiritual  a sacrament     enough   said nitely   of this apostrophe .  what is in your mind .     marriage .  marry the girl  nitely .  have all your couples marry  and that at once .  i m sure that was gilbert s original intention .     but that   said nitely  who was strangely attracted by the notion   is precisely what we are trying to avoid .     i am not   said alice  stoutly  though she was not stout  but  on the contrary  enchantingly lithe and slender  .   professor johns said   don t you see .  once each couple is married  the amatogenic principle which does not affect married people loses its power over them .  those who would have been in love without the aid of the principle remain in love  those who would not are no longer in love and consequently apply for an annulment .     good heavens   said nitely .   how admirably simple .  of course .  gilbert must have intended that until a shocked producer or theater manager a bungler  as you say forced the change .     and did it work .   i asked .   after all  you said quite distinctly that the professor had said its effect on married couples was only to inhibit extramarital re     it worked   said nitely  ignoring my comment .  a tear trembled on his eyelid  but whether it was induced by memories or by the fact that he was on his fourth gin and tonic  i could not tell .    it worked   he said .   alice and i were married  and our marriage was  almost instantly annulled by mutual consent on the grounds of the use of undue pressure .  and yet  because of the incessant chaperoning to which we were subjected  the incidence of undue pressure between ourselves was  unfortunately  virtually nil .   he sighed again .   at any rate  alice and alexander were married soon after and she is now  i understand  as a result of various concomitant events  expecting a child .    he withdrew his eyes from the deep recesses of what was left of his drink and gasped with sudden alarm .   dear me .  she again .    i looked up  startled .  a vision in pastel blue was in the doorway .  imagine  if you will  a charming face made for kissing  a lovely body made for loving .   she called   nicholas .  wait .     is that alice .   i asked .    no  no .  this is someone else entirely  a completely different story .   but i must not remain here .    he rose and  with an agility remarkable in one so advanced in years and weight  made his way through a window .  the feminine vision of desirability  with an agility only slightly less remarkable  followed .   i shook my head in pity and sympathy .  obviously  the poor man was continually plagued by these wondrous things of beauty who  for one reason oj another  were enamored of him .  at the thought of this horrible fate  i downed my own drink at a gulp and considered the odd fact that no such difficulties had ever troubled me .   and at that thought  strange to tell  i ordered another drink savagely  and a scatological exclamation rose  unbidden  to my lips .   unto the fourth generation  at ten of noon  sam marten hitched his way out of the taxicab  trying as usual to open the door with one hand  hold his briefcase in another and reach for his wallet with a third .  having only two hands  he found it a difficult job and  again as usual  he thudded his knee against the cab door and found himself still groping uselessly for his wallet when his feet touched pavement .   the traffic of madison avenue inched past .  a red truck slowed its crawl reluctantly  then moved on with a rasp as the light changed .  white script on its side informed an unresponsive world that its ownership was that of f .  lewkowitz and sons  wholesale clothiers .   levkowich  thought marten with brief inconsequence  and finally fished out his wallet .  he cast an eye on the meter as he clamped his briefcase under his arm .  dollar sixty five  make that twenty cents more as a tip  two singles gone would leave him only one for emergencies  better break a fiver .    okay   he said   take out one eighty five  bud .     thanks   said the cabbie with mechanical insincerity and made the change .   marten crammed three singles into his wallet  put it away  lifted his briefcase and breasted the human currents on the sidewalk to reach the glass doors of the building .   levkovich .  he thought sharply  and stopped .  a passerby glanced off his elbow .    sorry   muttered marten  and made for the door again .     copyright         by mercury press  inc .   levkovich .  that wasn t what the sign on the truck had said .  the name had read lewkowitz  lookoh itz .  why did he think levkovich .  even with his college german in the near past changing the w s to v s  where did he get the   ich  from .   levkovich .  he shrugged the whole matter away roughly .  give it a chance and it would haunt him like a hit parade tinkle .   concentrate on business .  he was here for a luncheon appointment with this man  naylor .  he was here to turn a contract into an account and begin  at twenty three  the smooth business rise which  as he planned it  would marry him to elizabeth in two years and make him a paterfamilias in the suburbs in ten .   he entered the lobby with grim firmness and headed for the banks of elevators  his eye catching at the white lettered directory as he passed .   it was a silly habit of his to want to catch suite numbers as he passed  without slowing  or  heaven forbid  coming to a full halt .  with no break in his progress  he told himself  he could maintain the impression of belonging  of knowing his way around  and that was important to a man whose job involved dealing with other human beings .   kulin etts was what he wanted  and the word amused him .  a firm specializing in the production of minor kitchen gadgets  striving manfully for a name that was significant  feminine  and coy  all at once   his eyes snagged at the m s and moved upward as he walked .  mandel  lusk  lippert publishing company  two full floors   lafkowitz  kulin etts .  there it was      .  tenth floor .  ok .   and then  after all  he came to a dead halt  turned in reluctant fascination  returned to the directory  and stared at it as though he were an out of towner .   lafkowitz .   what kind of spelling was that .   it was clear enough .  lafkowitz  henry   .       .  with an a .  that was no good .  that was useless .   useless .  why useless .  he gave his head one violent shake as though to clear it of mist .  damn it  what did he care how it was spelled .  he turned away  frowning and angry  and hastened to an elevator door  which closed just before he reached it  leaving him flustered .   another door opened and he stepped in briskly .  he tucked his briefcase under his arm and tried to look bright alive junior executive in its finest sense .  he had to make an impression on alex naylor  with whom so far he had communicated only by telephone .  if he was going to brood about lewkowitzes and lafkowitzes   the elevator slid noiselessly to a halt at seven .  a youth in shirt sleeves stepped off  balancing what looked like a desk drawer in which were three j containers of coffee and three sandwiches .   then  just as the doors began closing  frosted glass with black lettering s  loomed before marten s eyes .  it read      henry j .  lefkowitz importer and was pinched off by the inexorable coming together of the elevator doors .   marten leaned forward in excitement .  it was his impulse to say  take me back down to   .   but there were others in the car .  and after all  he had no reason .   yet there was a tingle of excitement within him .  the directory had been wrong .  it wasn t a  it was e .  some fool of a non spelling menial with a packet of small letters to go on the board and only one hind foot to do it with .   lefkowitz .  still not right  though .  s again  he shook his head .  twice .  not right for what .   the elevator stopped at ten and marten got off .   alex naylor of kulin etts turned out to be a bluff  middle aged man with a shock of white hair  a ruddy complexion  and a broad smile .  his palms were dry and rough  and he shook hands with a considerable pressure  putting his left hand on marten s shoulder in an earnest display of friendliness .   he said   be with you in two minutes .  how about eating right here in the building .  excellent restaurant  and they ve got a boy who makes a good martini .  that sound all right .     fine .  fine .   marten pumped up enthusiasm from a somehow clogged reservoir .   it was nearer ten minutes than two  and marten waited with the usual uneasiness of a man in a strange office .  he stared at the upholstery on the chairs and at the little cubby hole within which a young and bored switchboard operator sat .  he gazed at the pictures on the wall and even made a half hearted attempt to glance through a trade journal on the table next to him .   what he did not do was think of lev   he did not think of it .   the restaurant was good  or it would have been good if marten had been perfectly at ease .  fortunately  he was freed of the necessity of carrying the burden of the conversation .  naylor talked rapidly and loudly  glanced over the menu with a practiced eye  recommended the eggs benedict  and commented on the weather and the miserable traffic situation .   on occasion  marten tried to snap out of it  to lose that edge of fuzzed absence of mind .  but each time the restlessness would return .  something was wrong .  the name was wrong .  it stood in the way of what he had to do .   with main force  he tried to break through the madness .  in sudden verbal clatter  he led the conversation into the subject of wiring .  it was reckless of him .  there was no proper foundation  the transition was too abrupt .   but the lunch had been a good one  the dessert was on its way  and naylor responded nicely .   he admitted dissatisfaction with existing arrangements .  yes  he had been looking into marten s firm and  actually  it seemed to him that  yes  there was a chance  a good chance  he thought  that   a hand came down on naylor s shoulder as a man passed behind his chair .   how s the boy  alex .    naylor looked up  grin ready made and flashing .   hey  lefk  how s business .     can t complain .  see you at the   he faded into the distance .   marten wasn t listening .  he felt his knees trembling  as he half rose .   who was that man .   he asked  intensely .  it sounded more peremptory than he intended .    who .  lefk .  jerry lefkovitz .  you know him .   naylor stared with cool surprise at his lunch companion .    no .  how do you spell his name .     l e f k o v i t z  i think .  why .     with a v .     an f .   .   .   .  oh  there s a v in it  too .   most of the good nature had left naylor s face .   marten drove on .   there s a lefkowitz in the building .  with a w .  you know  lef cow itz .     oh .     room     .  this is not the same one .     jerry doesn t work in this building .  he s got a place across the street .  i don t know this other one .  this is a big building  you know .  i don t keep tabs on everyone in it .  what is all this  anyway .    marten shook his head and sat back .  he didn t know what all this was  anyway .  or at least  if he did  it was nothing he dared explain .  could he say  i m being haunted by all manner of lefkowitzes today .   he said   we were talking about wiring .    naylor said   yes .  well  as i said  i ve been considering your company .  i ve got to talk it over with the production boys  you understand .  i ll let you know .     sure   said marten  infinitely depressed .  naylor wouldn t let him know .  the whole thing was shot .   and yet  through and beyond his depression  there was still that restlessness .   the hell with naylor .  all marten wanted was to break this up and get on with it .   get on with what .  but the question was only a whisper .  whatever did the questioning inside him was ebbing away  dying down  .   .   .    the lunch frayed to an ending .  if they had greeted each other like long separated friends at last reunited  they parted like strangers   marten felt only relief .   he left with pulses thudding  threading through the tables  out of the haunted building  onto the haunted street .   haunted .  madison avenue at      p . m .  in an early fall afternoon with the sun shining brightly and ten thousand men and women be hiving its long straight stretch .   but marten felt the haunting .  he tucked his briefcase under his arm and headed desperately northward .  a last sigh of the normal within him warned him he had a three o clock appointment on   th street .  never mind .  he headed uptown .  northward .   at   th street  he crossed madison and walked west  came abruptly to a halt and looked upward .   there was a sign on the window  three stories up .  he could make it out clearly  a .  s .  lefkowich  certified accountant .   it had an f and an ow  but it was the first   ich  ending he had seen .  the first one .  he was getting closer .  he turned north again on fifth avenue  hurrying through the unreal streets of an unreal city  panting with the chase of something  while the crowds about him began to fade .   a sign in a ground floor window  m .  r .  lefkowicz  m . d .   a small gold leaf semi circle of letters in a candy store window  jacob levkow .    half a name  he thought savagely .  why is he disturbing me with half a name .    the streets were empty now except for the varying clan of lefkowitz  levkowitz  lefkowicz to stand out in the vacuum .   he was dimly aware of the park ahead  standing out in painted motionless green .  he turned west .  a piece of newspaper fluttered at the corner of his eyes  the only movement in a dead world .  he veered  stooped  and picked it up  without slackening his pace .   it was in yiddish  a torn half page .   he couldn t read it .  he couldn t make out the blurred hebrew letters  and could not have read it if they were clear .  but one word was clear .  it stood out in dark letters in the center of the page  each letter clear in its every serif .  and it said lefkovitsch  he knew  and as he said it to himself  he placed its accent on the second syllable  lef kuh vich .   he let the paper flutter away and entered the empty park .   the trees were still and the leaves hung in odd  suspended attitudes .  the sunlight was a dead weight upon him and gave no warmth .   he was running  but his feet kicked up no dust and a tuft of grass on which he placed his weight did not bend .   and there on a bench was an old man  the only man in the desolate park .  he wore a dark felt cap  with a visor shading his eyes .  from underneath it  tufts of gray hair protruded his grizzled beard reached the uppermost but   ton of his rougb jacket .  his old trousers were patched  and a strip of burlap was wrapped about each worn and shapeless shoe .   marten stopped .  it was difficult to breathe .  he could only say one word and he used it to ask his question   levkovich .    he stood there  while the old man rose slowly to his feet  brown old eyes peering close .    marten   he sighed .   samuel marten .  you have come .   the words sounded with an effect of double exposure  for under the english  marten heard the faint sigh of a foreign tongue .  under the  samuel  was the unheard shadow of a  schmu el .    the old man s rough  veined hands reached out  then withdrew as though he were afraid to touch .   i have been looking but there are so many people in this wilderness of a city that is to come .  so many martins and martines and mortons and mertons .  i stopped at last when i found greenery  but for a moment only i would not commit the sin of losing faith .  and then you came .     it is i   said marten  and knew it was .   and you are phinehas levkovich .  why are we here .     i am phinehas ben jehudah  assigned the name levkovich by the ukase of the tsar that ordered family names for all .  and we are here   the old man said  softly   because i prayed .  when i was already old  leah  my only daughter  the child of my old age  left for america with her husband  left the knouts of the old for the hope of the new .  and my sons died  and sarah  the wife of my bosom  was long dead and i was alone .  and the time came when i  too  must die .  but i had not seen leah since her leaving for the far country and word had come but rarely .  my soul yearned that i might see sons bom unto her  sons of my seed  sons in whom my soul might yet live and not die .    his voice was steady and the soundless shadow of sound beneath his words was the stately roll of an ancient language .    and i was answered and two hours were given me that i might see the first son of my line to be born in a new land and in a new time .  my daughter s daughter s daughter s son  have i found you  then  amidst the splendor of this city .     but why the search .  why not have brought us together at once .     because there is pleasure in the hope of the seeking  my son   said the old man  radiantly   and in the delight of the finding .  i was given two hours in which i might seek  two hours in which i might find  .   .   .  and behold  thou art here  and i have found that which i had not looked to see in life .   his voice was old  caressing .   is it well with thee  my son .     it is well  my father  now that i have found thee   said marten  and dropped to his knees .   give me thy blessing  my father  that it may be well with me all the days of my life  and with the maid whom i am to take to wife and the little ones yet to be bom of my seed and thine .    iflp he felt the old hand resting lightly on his head and there was only the  soundless whisper .   marten rose .  the old man s eyes gazed into his yearningly .  were they losing focus .    i go to my fathers now in peace  my son   said the old man  and marten was alone in the empty park .   there was an instant of renewing motion  of the sun taking up its interrupted task  of the wind reviving  and even with that first instant of sensation  all slipped back   at ten of noon  sam marten hitched his way out of the taxicab  and found himself groping uselessly for his wallet while traffic inched on .   a red truck slowed  then moved on .  a white script on its side announced  f .  lewkowitz and sons  wholesale clothiers .   marten didn t see it .  yet somehow he knew that all would be well with him .  somehow  as never before  he knew .   .  .  .   what is this thing called love .    but these are two species   said captain garm  peering closely at the creatures that had been brought up from the planet below .  his optic organs adjusted focus to maximum sharpness  bulging outwards as they did so .  the color patch above them gleamed in quick flashes .   botax felt warmly comfortable to be following color changes once again  after months in a spy cell on the planet  trying to make sense out of the modulated sound waves emitted by the natives .  communication by flash was almost like being home in the far off perseus arm of the galaxy .   not two species   he said   but two forms of one species .     nonsense  they look quite different .  vaguely perse like  thank the entity  and not as disgusting in appearance as so many out forms are .  reasonable shape  recognizable limbs .  but no color patch .  can they speak .     yes  captain garm   botax indulged in a discreetly disapproving prismatic interlude .   the details are in my report .  these creatures form sound waves by way of throat and mouth  something like complicated coughing .  i have learned to do it myself .   he was quietly proud .   it is very difficult .     it must be stomach turning .  well  that accounts for their flat  unexten sible eyes .  not to speak by color makes eyes largely useless .  meanwhile  how can you insist these are a single species .  the one on the left is smaller and has longer tendrils  or whatever it is  and seems differently proportioned .  it bulges where this other does not .  are they alive .     alive but not at the moment conscious  captain .  they have been psycho treated to repress fright in order that they might be studied easily .    copyright         by ziff davis publishing company .   original title   playboy and the slime god .      but are they worth study .  we are behind our schedule and have at least five worlds of greater moment than this one to check and explore .  maintaining a time stasis unit is expensive and i would like to return them and go on    but botax s moist spindly body was fairly vibrating with anxiety .  his tubular tongue flicked out and curved up and over his flat nose  while his eyes sucked inward .  his splayed three fingered hand made a gesture of negation as his speech went almost entirely into the deep red .    entity save us  captain  for no world is of greater moment to us than this one .  we may be facing a supreme crisis .  these creatures could be the most dangerous life forms in the galaxy  captain  just because there are two forms .     i don t follow you .     captain  it has been my job to study this planet  and it has been most difficult  for it is unique .  it is so unique that i can scarcely comprehend its facets .  for instance  almost all life on the planet consists of species in two forms .  there are no words to describe it  no concepts even .  i can only speak of them as first form and second form .  if i may use their sounds  the little one is called  female   and the big one  here   male   so the creatures themselves are aware of the difference .    garm winced   what a disgusting means of communication .     and  captain  in order to bring forth young  the two forms must cooperate .    the captain  who had bent forward to examine the specimens closely with an expression compounded of interest and revulsion  straightened at once .   cooperate .  what nonsense is this .  there is no more fundamental attribute of life than that each living creature bring forth its young in innermost communication with itself .  what else makes life worth living .     the one form does bring forth life but the other form must cooperate .     how .     that has been difficult to determine .  it is something very private and in my search through the available forms of literature i could find no exact and explicit description .  but i have been able to make reasonable deductions .    garm shook his head .   ridiculous .  budding is the holiest  most private function in the world .  on tens of thousands of worlds it is the same .  as the great photo bard  levuline  said   in budding time  in budding time  in sweet  delightful budding time  when       captain  you don t understand .  this cooperation between forms brings about somehow  and i am not certain exactly how  a mixture and recombination of genes .  it is a device by which in every generation  new combinations of characteristics are brought into existence .  variations are multiplied  mutated genes hastened into expression almost at once where under the usual budding system  millennia might pass first .     are you trying to tell me that the genes from one individual can be  combined with those of another .  do you know how completely ridiculous that is in the light of all the principles of cellular physiology .     it must be so   said botax nervously under the other s pop eyed glare .   evolution is hastened .  this planet is a riot of species .  there are supposed to be a million and a quarter different species of creatures .     a dozen and a quarter more likely .  don t accept too completely what you read in the native literature .     i ve seen dozens of radically different species myself in just a small area .  i tell you  captain  give these creatures a short space of time and they will mutate into intellects powerful enough to overtake us and rule the galaxy .     prove that this cooperation you speak of exists  investigator  and i shall consider your contentions .  if you cannot  i shall dismiss all your fancies as ridiculous and we will move on .     i can prove it .   botax s color flashes turned intensely yellow green .   the creatures of this world are unique in another way .  they foresee advances they have not yet made  probably as a consequence of their belief in rapid change which  after all  they constantly witness .  they therefore indulge in a type of literature involving the space travel they have never developed .  i have translated their term for the literature as  science fiction .   now i have dealt in my readings almost exclusively with science fiction  for there i thought  in their dreams and fancies  they would expose themselves and their danger to us .  and it was from that science fiction that i deduced the method of their inter form cooperation .     how did you do that .     there is a periodical on this world which sometimes publishes science fiction which is  however  devoted almost entirely to the various aspects of the cooperation .  it does not speak entirely freely  which is annoying  but persists in merely hinting .  its name as nearly as i can put it into flashes is  recreationlad .   the creature in charge  i deduce  is interested in nothing but inter form cooperation and searches for it everywhere with a systematic and scientific intensity that has roused my awe .  he has found instances of cooperation described in science fiction and i let material in his periodical guide me .  from the stories he instanced i have learned how to bring it about .    and captain  i beg of you  when the cooperation is accomplished and the young are brought forth before your eyes  give orders not to leave an atom of this world in existence .     well   said captain garm  wearily   bring them into full consciousness and do what you must do quickly .    marge skidmore was suddenly completely aware of her surroundings .  she remembered very clearly the elevated station at the beginning of twilight .  it had been almost empty  one man standing near her  another at the other  end of the platform .  the approaching train had just made itself known as a faint rumble in the distance .   there had then come the flash  a sense of turning inside out  the half seen vision of a spindly creature  dripping mucus  a rushing upward  and now    oh  god   she said  shuddering .   it s stid here .  and there s another one  too .    she felt a sick revulsion  but no fear .  she was almost proud of herself for feeling no fear .  the man next to her  standing quietly as she herself was  but still wearing a battered fedora  was the one that had been near her on the platform .    they got you  too .   she asked .   who else .    charlie grimwow  feeling flabby and paunchy  tried to lift his hand to remove his hat and smooth the thin hair that broke up but did not entirely cover the skin of his scalp and found that it moved only with difficulty against a rubbery but hardening resistance .  he let his hand drop and looked morosely at the thin faced woman facing him .  she was in her middle thirties  he decided  and her hair was nice and her dress fit well  but at the moment  he just wanted to be somewhere else and it did him no good at all that he had company  even female company .   he said   i don t know  lady .  i was just standing on the station platform .     me  too .     and then i see a flash .  didn t hear nothing .  now here i am .  must be little men from mars or venus or one of them places .    marge nodded vigorously   that s what i figure .  a flying saucer .  you scared .     no .  that s funny  you know .  i think maybe i m going nuts or i would be scared .     funny thing .  i ain t scared  either .  oh  god  here comes one of them now .  if he touches me  i m going to scream .  look at those wiggly hands .  and that wrinkled skin  all slimy  makes me nauseous .    botax approached gingerly and said  in a voice at once rasping and screechy  this being the closest he could come to imitating the native timbre   creatures .  we will not hurt you .  but we must ask you if you would do us the favor of cooperating .     hey  it talks .   said charlie .   what do you mean  cooperate .     both of you .  with each other   said botax .     oh .   he looked at marge .   you know what he means  lady .     ain t got no idea whatsoever   she answered loftily .   botax said   what i mean   and he used the short term he had once heard employed as a synonym for the process .   marge turned red and said   what .   in the loudest scream she could manage .  both botax and captain garm put their hands over their mid regions to cover the auditory patches that trembled painfully with the decibels .   marge went on rapidly  and nearly incoherently .   of all things .  i m a married woman  you .  if my ed was here  you d hear from him .  and you  wise guy   she twisted toward charlie against rubbery resistance   whoever you are  if you think     lady  lady   said charlie in uncomfortable desperation .   it ain t my idea .  i mean  far be it from me  you know  to turn down some lady  you know  but me  i m married  too .  i got three kids .  listen    captain garm said   what s happening  investigator botax .  these  cacophonous sounds are awful .   f i   well   botax flashed a short purple patch of embarrassment .   this forms a complicated ritual .  they are supposed to be reluctant at first .  it f heightens the subsequent result .  after that initial stage  the skins must be   removed .     they have to be skinned .     not really skinned .  those are artificial skins that can be removed painlessly  and must be .  particularly in the smaller form .     all right  then .  tell it to remove the skins .  really  botax  i don t find this pleasant .     i don t think i had better tell the smaller form to remove the skins .  i think we had better follow the ritual closely .  i have here sections of those space travel tales which the man from the  recreationlad  periodical spoke highly of .  in those tales the skins are removed forcibly .  here is a description of an accident  for instance  which played havoc with the girl s dress  ripping it nearly off her slim body .  for a second  he felt the warm firmness of her half bared bosom against his cheek   it goes on that way .  you see  the ripping  the forcible removal  acts as a stimulus .     bosom .   said the captain .   i don t recognize the flash .     i invented that to cover the meaning .  it refers to the bulges on the upper dorsal region of the smaller form .     i see .  well  tell the larger one to rip the skins off the smaller one .  what a dismal thing this is .    botax turned to charlie .   sir   he said   rip the girl s dress nearly off her slim body  will you .  i will release you for the purpose .    marge s eyes widened and she twisted toward charlie in instant outrage .   don t you dare do that  you .  don t you dast touch me  you sex maniac .     me .   said charlie plaintively .   it ain t my idea .  you think i go around ripping dresses .  listen   he turned to botax   i got a wife and three kids .  she finds out i go around ripping dresses  i get clobbered .  you know what my wife does when i just look at some dame .  listen     is he still reluctant .   said the captain  impatiently .    apparently   said botax .   the strange surroundings  you know  may be extending that stage of the cooperation .  since i know this is unpleasant for you  i will perform this stage of the ritual myself .  it is frequently written in  the space travel tales that an outer world species performs the task .  for instance  here   and he riffled through his notes finding the one he wanted   they describe a very awful such species .  the creatures on the planet have foolish notions  you understand .  it never occurs to them to imagine handsome individuals such as ourselves  with a fine mucous cover .     go on .  go on .  don t take all day   said the captain .    yes  captain .  it says here that the extraterrestrial  came forward to where the girl stood .  shrieking hysterically  she was cradled in the monster s embrace .  talons ripped blindly at her body  tearing the kirtle away in rags .   you see  the native creature is shrieking with stimulation as her skins are removed .     then go ahead  botax  remove it .  but please  allow no shrieking .  i m trembling all over with the sound waves .    botax said politely to marge   if you don t mind    one spatulate finger made as though to hook on to the neck of the dress .   marge wiggled desperately .   don t touch .  don t touch .  you ll get slime on it .  listen  this dress cost     .    at ohrbach s .  stay away  you monster .  look at those eyes on him .   she was panting in her desperate efforts to dodge the groping  extraterrestrial hand .   a slimy  bug eyed monster  that s what he is .  listen  i ll take it off myself .  just don t touch it with slime  for god s sake .    she fumbled at the zipper  and said in a hot aside to charlie   don t you dast look .    charlie closed his eyes and shrugged in resignation .   she stepped out of the dress .   all right .  you satisfied .    captain garm s fingers twitched with unhappiness .   is that the bosom .  why does the other creature keep its head turned away .     reluctance .  reluctance   said botax .   besides  the bosom is still covered .  other skins must be removed .  when bared  the bosom is a very strong stimulus .  it is constantly described as ivory globes  or white spheres  or otherwise after that fashion .  i have here drawings  visual picturizations  that come from the outer covers of the space travel magazines .  if you will inspect them  you will see that upon every one of them  a creature is present with a bosom more or less exposed .    the captain looked thoughtfully from the illustrations to marge and back .   what is ivory .     that is another made up flash of my own .  it represents the tusky material of one of the large sub intelligent creatures on the planet .     ah   and captain garm went into a pastel green of satisfaction .   that explains it .  this small creature is one of a warrior sect and those are tusks with which to smash the enemy .     no  no .  they are quite soft  i understand .   botax s small brown hand flicked outward in the general direction of the objects under discussion and marge screamed and shrank away .    then what other purpose do they have .     i think   said botax with considerable hesitation   that they are used to feed the young .     the young eat them .   asked the captain with every evidence of deep distress .    not exactly .  the objects produce a fluid which the young consume .     consume a fluid from a living body .  yech h h .   the captain covered his head with all three of his arms  calling the central supernumerary into use for the purpose  slipping it out of its sheath so rapidly as almost to knock botax over .    a three armed  slimy  bug eyed monster   said marge .    yeah   said charlie .    all right you  just watch those eyes .  keep them to yourself .     listen  lady .  i m trying not to look .    botax approached again .   madam  would you remove the rest .    marge drew herself up as well as she could against the pinioning field .   never .     i ll remove it  if you wish .     don t touch .  for god s sake  don t touch .  look at the slime on him  will you .  all right  i ll take it off .   she was muttering under her breath and looking hotly in charlie s direction as she did so .    nothing is happening   said the captain  in deep dissatisfaction   and this seems an imperfect specimen .    botax felt the slur on his own efficiency .   i brought you two perfect specimens .  what s wrong with the creature .     the bosom does not consist of globes or spheres .  i know what globes or spheres are and in these pictures you have shown me  they are so depicted .  those are large globes .  on this creature  though  what we have are nothing but small flaps of dry tissue .  and they re discolored  too  partly .     nonsense   said botax .   you must allow room for natural variation .  i will put it to the creature herself .    he turned to marge   madam  is your bosom imperfect .    marge s eyes opened wide and she struggled vainly for moments without doing anything more than gasp loudly .   really   she finally managed .   maybe i m no gina lollobrigida or anita ekberg  but i m perfectly all right  thank you .  oh boy  if my ed were only here .   she turned to charlie .   listen  you  you tell this bug eyed slimy thing here  there ain t nothing wrong with my development .     lady   said charlie  softly .   i ain t looking  remember .     oh  sure  you ain t looking .  you been peeking enough  so you might as well just open your crummy eyes and stick up for a lady  if you re the least bit of a gentleman  which you probably ain t .     well   said charlie  looking sideways at marge  who seized the opportu   nity to inhak and throw her shoulders back   i don t like to get mixed up in a kind of delicate matter like this  but you re all right i guess .     you guess .  you hind or something .  i was once runner up for miss brooklyn  in case you don t happen to know  and where i missed out was on waist line  not on    charlie said   all right  all right .  they re fine .  honest .   he nodded vigorously in botax s direction .   they re okay .  i ain t that much of an expert  you understand  but they re okay by me .    marge relaxed .   botax felt relieved .  he turned to garm .   the bigger form expresses interest  captain .  the stimulus is working .  now for the final step .     and what is that .     there is no flash for it  captain .  essentially  it consists of placing the speaking and eating apparatus of one against the equivalent apparatus of the other .  i have made up a flash for the process  thus  kiss .     will nausea never cease .   groaned the captain .    it is the climax .  in all the tales  after the skins are removed by force  they clasp each other with limbs and indulge madly in burning kisses  to translate as nearly as possible the phrase most frequently used .  here is one example  just one  taken at random   he held the girl  his mouth avid on her lips .      maybe one creature was devouring the other   said the captain .    not at all   said botax impatiently .   those were burning kisses .     how do you mean  burning .  combustion takes place .     i don t think literally so .  i imagine it is a way of expressing the fact that the temperature goes up .  the higher the temperature  i suppose  the more successful the production of young .  now that the big form is properly stimulated  he need only place his mouth against hers to produce young .  the young will not be produced without that step .  it is the cooperation i have been speaking of .     that s all .  just this   the captain s hands made motions of coming together  but he could not bear to put the thought into flash form .    that s all   said botax .   in none of the tales  not even in  recrea tionlad   have i found a description of any further physical activity in connection with young bearing .  sometimes after the kissing  they write a line of symbols like little stars  but i suppose that merely means more kissing  one kiss for each star  when they wish to produce a multitude of young .     just one  please  right now .     certainly  captain .    botax said with grave distinctness   sir  would you kiss the lady .   charlie said   listen  i can t move .      will free you  of course .    the lady might not like it .    marge glowered .   you bet your damn boots  i won t like it .  you just stay away .     i would like to  lady  but what do they do if i don t .  look  i don t want to get them mad .  we can just you know make like a little peck .    she hesitated  seeing the justice of the caution .   all right .  no funny stuff  though .  i ain t in the habit of standing around like this in front of every tom  dick and harry  you know .     i know that  lady .  it was none of my doing .  you got to admit that .    marge muttered angrily   regular slimy monsters .  must think they re some kind of gods or something  the way they order people around .  slime gods is what they are .    charlie approached her .   if it s okay now  lady .   he made a vague motion as though to tip his hat .  then he put his hands awkwardly on her bare shoulders and leaned over in a gingerly pucker .   marge s head stiffened so that lines appeared in her neck .  their lips met .   captain garm flashed fretfully .   i sense no rise in temperature .   his heat detecting tendril had risen to full extension at the top of his head and remained quivering there .    i don t either   said botax  rather at a loss   but we re doing it just as the space travel stories tell us to .  i think his limbs should be more extended  ah  like that .  see  it s working .    almost absently  charlie s arm had slid around marge s soft  nude torso .  for a moment  marge seemed to yield against him and then she suddenly writhed hard against the pinioning field that still held her with fair firmness .    let go .   the words were muffled against the pressure of charlie s lips .  she bit suddenly  and charlie leaped away with a wild cry  holding his lower lip  then looking at his fingers for blood .    what s the idea  lady .   he demanded plaintively .   she said   we agreed just a peck  is all .  what were you starting there .  you some kind of playboy or something .  what am i surrounded with here .  playboy and the slime gods .    captain garm flashed rapid alternations of blue and yellow .   is it done .  how long do we wait now .     it seems to me it must happen at once .  throughout all the universe  when you have to bud  you bud  you know .  there s no waiting .     yes .  after thinking of the foul habits you have been describing  i don t think i ll ever bud again .  please get this over with .     just a moment  captain .    but the moments passed and the captain s flashes turned slowly to a brooding orange  while botax s nearly dimmed out altogether .   botax finally asked hesitantly   pardon me  madam  but when will you bud .     when will i what .     bear young .     i ve got a kid .     i mean bear young now .     i should say not .  i ain t ready for another kid yet .     what .  what .   demanded the captain .   what s she saying .     it seems   said botax   she does not intend to have young at the moment .    the captain s color patch blazed brightly .   do you know what i think  investigator .  i think you have a sick  perverted mind .  nothing s happening to these creatures .  there is no cooperation between them  and no young to be borne .  i think they re two different species and that you re playing some kind of foolish game with me .     but  captain   said botax .    don t but captain me   said garm .   i ve had enough .  you ve upset me  turned my stomach  nauseated me  disgusted me with the whole notion of budding and wasted my time .  you re just looking for headlines and personal glory and i ll see to it that you don t get them .  get rid of these creatures now .  give that one its skins back and put them back where you found them .  i ought to take the expense of maintaining time stasis all this time out of your salary .     but  captain     back  i say .  put them back in the same place and at the same instant of time .  i want this planet untouched  and i ll see to it that it stays untouched .   he cast one more furious glance at botax .   one species  two forms  bosoms  kisses  cooperation  bah  you are a fool  investigator  a dolt as well and  most of all  a sick  sick  sick creature .    there was no arguing .  botax  limbs trembling  set about returning the creatures .   they stood there at the elevated station  looking around wildly .  it was twilight over them  and the approaching train was just making itself known as a faint rumble in the distance .   marge said  hesitantly   mister  did it really happen .    charlie nodded .   i remember it .    marge said   we can t tell anybody .     sure not .  they d say we was nuts .  know what i mean .     uh huh .  well   she edged away .   charlie said   listen .  i m sorry you was embarrassed .  it was none of my doing .     that s all right .  i know .   marge s eyes considered the wooden platform at her feet .  the sound of the train was louder .    i mean  you know  lady  you wasn t really bad .  in fact  you looked good  but i was kind of embarrassed to say that .    suddenly  she smiled .   it s all right .     you want maybe to have a cup of coffee with me just to relax you .  my wife  she s not really expecting me for a while .     oh .  well  ed s out of town for the weekend so i got only an empty apartment to go home to .  my little boy is visiting at my mother s .   she explained .    come on  then .  we been kind of introduced .     i l  say .   she laughed .   the train pulled in  but they turned away  walking down the narrow stairway to the street .   they had a couple of cocktails actually  and then charlie couldn t let her go home in the dark alone  so he saw her to her door .  marge was bound to invite him in for a few moments  naturally .   meanwhile  back in the spaceship  the crushed botax was making a final effort to prove his case .  while garm prepared the ship for departure botax hastily set up the tight beam visiscreen for a last look at his specimens .  he focused in on charlie and marge in her apartment .  his tendril stiffened and he began flashing in a coruscating rainbow of colors .   captain garm .  captain .  look what they re doing now .   but at that very instant the ship winked out of time stasis .   the machine that won the war  the celebration had a long way to go and even in the silent depths of multivac s underground chambers  it hung in the air .   if nothing else  there was the mere fact of isolation and silence .  for the first time in a decade  technicians were not scurrying about the vitals of the giant computer  the soft lights did not wink out their erratic patterns  the flow of information in and out had halted .   it would not be halted long  of course  for the needs of peace would be pressing .  yet now  for a day  perhaps for a week  even multivac might celebrate the great time  and rest .   lamar swift took off the military cap he was wearing and looked down the long and empty main corridor of the enormous computer .  he sat down rather wearily in one of the technician s swing stools  and his uniform  in which he had never been comfortable  took on a heavy and wrinkled appearance .   he said   i ll miss it all after a grisly fashion .  it s hard to remember when we weren t at war with deneb  and it seems against nature now to be at peace and to look at the stars without anxiety .    the two men with the executive director of the solar federation were both younger than swift .  neither was as gray .  neither looked quite as tired .   john henderson  thin lipped and finding it hard to control the relief he felt in the midst of triumph  said   they re destroyed .  they re destroyed .  it s what i keep saying to myself over and over and i still can t believe it .  we all talked so much  over so many years  about the menace hanging over  copyright         by mercuiy press  inc .   earth and all its worlds  over every human being  and all the time it was true  every word of it .  and now we re alive and it s the denebians who are shattered and destroyed .  they ll be no menace now  ever again .     thanks to multivac   said swift  with a quiet glance at the imperturbable jablonsky  who through all the war had been chief interpreter of science s oracle .   right  max .    jablonsky shrugged .  automatically  he reached for a cigarette and decided against it .  he alone  of all the thousands who had lived in the tunnels within multivac  had been allowed to smoke  but toward the end he had made definite efforts to avoid making use of the privilege .   he said   well  that s what they say .   his broad thumb moved in the direction of his right shoulder  aiming upward .    jealous  max .     because they re shouting for multivac .  because multivac is the big hero of mankind in this war .   jablonsky s craggy face took on an air of suitable contempt .   what s that to me .  let multivac be the machine that won the war  if it pleases them .    henderson looked at the other two out of the corners of his eyes .  in this short interlude that the three had instinctively sought out in the one peaceful corner of a metropolis gone mad  in this entr acte between the dangers of war and the difficulties of peace  when  for one moment  they might all find surcease  he was conscious only of his weight of guilt .   suddenly  it was as though that weight were too great to be borne longer .  it had to be thrown off  along with the war  now .   henderson said   multivac had nothing to do with victory .  it s just a machine .     a big one   said swift .    then just a big machine .  no better than the data fed it .   for a moment  he stopped  suddenly unnerved at what he was saying .   jablonsky looked at him  his thick fingers once again fumbling for a cigarette and once again drawing back .   you should know .  you supplied the data .  or is it just that you re taking the credit .     wo   said henderson  angrily .   there is no credit .  what do you know of the data multivac had to use  predigested from a hundred subsidiary computers here on earth  on the moon  on mars  even on titan .  with titan always delayed and always that feeling that its figures would introduce an unexpected bias .     it would drive anyone mad   said swift  with gentle sympathy .   henderson shook his head .   it wasn t just that .  i admit that eight years ago when i replaced lepont as chief programmer  i was nervous .  but there was an exhilaration about things in those days .  the war was still long range  an adventure without real danger .  we hadn t reached the point where manned vessels had had to take over and where interstellar warps could  swallow up a planet clean  if aimed correctly .  but then  when the real difficulties began    angrily he could finally permit anger he said   you know nothing about it .     well   said swift .   tell us .  the war is over .  we ve won .     yes .   henderson nodded his head .  he had to remember that .  earth had won so all had been for the best .   well  the data became meaningless .     meaningless .  you mean that literally .   said jablonsky .    literally .  what would you expect .  the trouble with you two was that you weren t out in the thick of it .  you never left multivac  max  and you  mr .  director  never left the mansion except on state visits where you saw exactly what they wanted you to see .     i was not as unaware of that   said swift   as you may have thought .     do you know   said henderson   to what extent data concerning our production capacity  our resource potential  our trained manpower everything of importance to the war effort  in fact had become unreliable and untrustworthy during the last half of the war .  group leaders  both civilian and military  were intent on projecting their own improved image  so to speak  so they obscured the bad and magnified the good .  whatever the machines might do  the men who programmed them and interpreted the results had their own skins to think of and competitors to stab .  there was no way of stopping that .  i tried  and failed .     of course   said swift  in quiet consolation .   i can see that you would .    this time jablonsky decided to light his cigarette .   yet i presume you provided multivac with data in your programming .  you said nothing to us about unreliability .     how could i tell you .  and if i did  how could you afford to believe me .   demanded henderson  savagely .   our entire war effort was geared to multivac .  it was the one great weapon on our side  for the denebians had nothing like it .  what else kept up morale in the face of doom but the assurance that multivac would always predict and circumvent any denebian move  and would always direct and prevent the circumvention of our moves .  great space  after our spy warp was blasted out of hyperspace we lacked any reliable denebian data to feed multivac and we didn t dare make that public .     true enough   said swift .    well  then   said henderson   if i told you the data was unreliable  what could you have done but replace me and refuse to believe me .  i couldn t allow that .     what did you do .   said jablonsky .    .  since the war is won  i d tell you what i did .  i corrected the data .     how .   asked swift .    intuition  i presume .  i juggled them till they looked right .  at first  i hardly dared  i changed a bit here and there to correct what were obvious  impossibilities .  when the sky didn t collapse about us  i got braver .  toward the end  i scarcely cared .  i just wrote out the necessary data as it was needed .  i even had the multivac annex prepare data for me according to a private programming pattern i had devised for the purpose .     random figures .   said jablonsky .    not at all .  i introduced a number of necessary biases .    fablonsky smiled  quite unexpectedly  his dark eyes sparkling behind the crinkling of the lower lids .   three times a report was brought me about unauthorized uses of the annex  and i let it go each time .  if it had mattered  i would have followed it up and spotted you  john  and found out what you were doing .  but  of course  nothing about multivac mattered in those days  so you got away with it .     what do you mean  nothing mattered .   asked henderson  suspiciously .    nothing did .  i suppose if i had told you this at the time  it would have spared you your agony  but then if you had told me what you were doing  it would have spared me mine .  what made you think multivac was in working order  whatever the data you supplied it .     not in working order .   said swift .    not really .  not reliably .  after all  where were my technicians in the last years of the war .  i ll tell you  they were feeding computers on a thousand different space devices .  they were gone .  i had to make do with kids i couldn t trust and veterans who were out of date .  besides  do you think i could trust the solid state components coming out of cryogenics in the last years .  cryogenics wasn t any better placed as far as personnel was concerned than i was .  to me  it didn t matter whether the data being supplied multivac were reliable or not .  the results weren t reliable .  that much i knew .     what did you do .   asked henderson .    i did what you did  john .  i introduced the bugger factor .  i adjusted matters in accordance with intuition and that s how the machine won the war .    swift leaned back in the chair and stretched his legs out before him .   such revelations .  it turns out then that the material handed me to guide me in my decision making capacity was a man made interpretation of man made data .  isn t that right .     it looks so   said jablonsky .    then i perceive i was correct in not placing too much reliance upon it   said swift .    you didn t .   jablonsky  despite what he had just said  managed to look professionally insulted .    i m afraid i didn t .  multivac might seem to say  strike here  not there  do this  not that  wait  don t act .  but i could never be certain that what multivac seemed to say  it really did say  or what it really said  it really meant .  i could never be certain .     but the final report was always plain enough  sir   said jablonsky .    to those who did not have to make the decision  perhaps .  not to me .  the horror of the responsibility of such decisions was unbearable and not even multivac was sufficient to remove the weight .  but the point is i was justified in doubting and there is tremendous relief in that .    caught up in the conspiracy of mutual confession  jablonsky put titles aside   what was it you did then  lamar .  after all  you did make decisions .  how .     well  it s time to be getting back perhaps but i ll tell you first .  why not .  i did make use of a computer  max  but an older one than multivac  much older .    he groped in his own pocket for cigarettes  and brought out a package along with a scattering of small change  old fashioned coins dating to the first years before the metal shortage had brought into being a credit system tied to a computer complex .   swift smiled rather sheepishly .   i still need these to make money seem substantial to me .  an old man finds it hard to abandon the habits of youth .   he put a cigarette between his lips and dropped the coins one by one back into his pocket .   he held the last coin between his fingers  staring absently at it .   multivac is not the first computer  friends  nor the best known  nor the one that can most efficiently lift the load of decision from the shoulders of the executive .  a machine did win the war  john  at least a very simple computing device did  one that i used every time i had a particularly hard decision to make .    with a faint smile of reminiscence  he flipped the coin he held .  it glinted in the air as it spun and came down in swift s outstretched palm .  his hand closed over it and brought it down on the back of his left hand .  his right hand remained in place  hiding the coin .    heads or tails  gentlemen .   said swift .   my son  the physicist  her hair was light apple green in color  very subdued  very old fashioned .  you could see she had a delicate hand with the dye  the way they did thirty years ago  before the streaks and stipples came into fashion .   she had a sweet smile on her face  too  and a calm look that made something serene out of elderliness .   and  by comparison  it made something shrieking out of the confusion that enfolded her in the huge government building .   a girl passed her at a half run  stopped and turned toward her with a blank stare of astonishment .   how did you get in .    the woman smiled .   i m looking for my son  the physicist .     your son  the     he s a communications engineer  really .  senior physicist gerard cremona .     dr .  cremona .  well  he s  where s your pass .     here it is .  i m his mother .     well  mrs .  cremona  i don t know .  i ve got to  his office is down there .  you just ask someone .   she passed on  running .   mrs .  cremona shook her head slowly .  something had happened  she supposed .  she hoped gerard was all right .   she heard voices much farther down the corridor and smiled happily .  she could tell gerard s .   she walked into the room and said   hello  gerard .    gerard was a big man  with a lot of hair still and the gray just beginning  copyright         by hoffman electronics corporation .   to show because he didn t use dye .  he said he was too busy .  she was very proud of him and the way he looked .   right now  he was talking volubly to a man in army uniform .  she couldn t tell the rank  but she knew gerard could handle him .   gerard looked up and said   what do you  mother .  what are you doing here .     i was coming to visit you today .     is today thursday .  oh lord  i forgot .  sit down  mother  i can t talk now .  any seat .  any seat .  look  general .    general reiner looked over his shoulder and one hand slapped against the other in the region of the small of his back .   your mother .     yes .     should she be here .     right now  no  but i ll vouch for her .  she can t even read a thermometer so nothing of this will mean anything to her .  now look  general .  they re on pluto .  you see .  they are .  the radio signals can t be of natural origin so they must originate from human beings  from our men .  you ll have to accept that .  of all the expeditions we ve sent out beyond the planetoid belt  one turns out to have made it .  and they ve reached pluto .     yes  i understand what you re saying  but isn t it impossible just the same .  the men who are on pluto now were launched four years ago with equipment that could not have kept them alive more than a year .  that is my understanding .  they were aimed at ganymede and seem to have gone eight times the proper distance .     exactly .  and we ve got to know how and why .  they may just have  had help .     what kind .  how .    cremona clenched his jaws for a moment as though praying inwardly .   general   he said   i m putting myself out on a limb but it is just barely possible non humans are involved .  extra terrestrials .  we ve got to find out .  we don t know how long contact can be maintained .     you mean   the general s grave face twitched into an almost smile   they may have escaped from custody and they may be recaptured again at any time .     maybe .  maybe .  the whole future of the human race may depend on our knowing exactly what we re up against .  knowing it now .     all right .  what is it you want .     we re going to need army s multivac computer at once .  rip out every problem it s working on and start programing our general semantic problem .  every communications engineer you have must be pulled off anything he s on and placed into coordination with our own .     but why .  i fail to see the connection .    a gentle voice interrupted .   general  would you like a piece of fruit .  i brought some oranges .    cremona said   mother .  please .  later .  general  the point is a simple one .  at the present moment pluto is just under four billion miles away .  it takes six hours for radio waves  traveling at the speed of light  to reach from here to there .  if we say something  we must wait twelve hours for an answer .  if they say something and we miss it and say  what  and they repeat bang  goes a day .     there s no way to speed it up .   said the general .    of course not .  it s the fundamental law of communications .  no information can be transmitted at more than the speed of light .  it will take months to carry on the same conversation with pluto that would take hours between the two of us right now .     yes  i see that .  and you really think extra terrestrials are involved .     i do .  to be honest  not everyone here agrees with me .  still  we re straining every nerve  every fiber  to devise some method of concentrating communication .  we must get in as many bits per second as possible and pray we get what we need before we lose contact .  and there s where i need multivac and your men .  there must be some communications strategy we can use that will reduce the number of signals we need send out .  even an increase of ten percent in efficiency can mean perhaps a week of time saved .    the gentle voice interrupted again .   good grief  gerard  are you trying to get some talking done .     mother .  please .     but you re going about it the wrong way .  really .     mother .   there was a hysterical edge to cremona s voice .    well  all right  but if you re going to say something and then wait twelve hours for an answer  you re silly .  you shouldn t .    the general snorted .   dr .  cremona  shall we consult     just one moment  general   said cremona .   what are you getting at  mother .     while you re waiting for an answer   said mrs .  cremona  earnestly   just keep on transmitting and tell them to do the same .  you talk all the time and they talk all the time .  you have someone listening all the time and they do  too .  if either one of you says anything that needs an answer  you can slip one in at your end  but chances are  you ll get all you need without asking .    both men stared at her .   cremona whispered   of course .  continuous conversation .  just twelve hours out of phase  that s all .  god  we ve got to get going .    he strode out of the room  virtually dragging the general with him  then strode back in .    mother   he said   if you ll excuse me  this will take a few hours  i think .  i ll send in some girls to talk to you .  or take a nap  if you d rather .     i ll be all right  gerard   said mrs .  cremona .    only  how did you think of this  mother .  what made you suggest this .     but  gerard  all women know it .  any two women on the video phone  or on the stratowire  or just face to face know that the whole secret to spreading the news is  no matter what  to just keep talking .    cremona tried to smile .  then  his lower lip trembling  he turned and left .   mrs .  cremona looked fondly after him .  such a fine man  her son  the physicist .  big as he was and important as he was  he still knew that a boy should always listen to his mother .   eyes do more than see  after hundreds of billions of years  he suddenly thought of himself as ames .  not the wavelength combination which  through all the universe was now the equivalent of ames but the sound itself .  a faint memory came back of the sound waves he no longer heard and no longer could hear .   the new project was sharpening his memory for so many more of the old  old  eons old things .  he flattened the energy vortex that made up the total of his individuality and its lines of force stretched beyond the stars .   brock s answering signal came .   surely  ames thought  he could tell brock .  surely he could tell somebody .   brock s shifting energy pattern communed   aren t you coming  ames .     of course .     will you take part in the contest .     yes .   ames s lines of force pulsed erratically .   most certainly .  i have thought of a whole new art form .  something really unusual .     what a waste of effort .  how can you think a new variation can be thought of after two hundred billion years .  there can be nothing new .    for a moment brock shifted out of phase and out of communion  so that ames had to hurry to adjust his lines of force .  he caught the drift of other thoughts as he did so  the view of the powdered galaxies against the velvet of nothingness  and the lines of force pulsing in endless multitudes of energy life  lying between the galaxies .   ames said   please absorb my thoughts  brock .  don t close out .  i ve thought of manipulating matter .  imagine .  a symphony of matter .  why  copyright         by mercury press  inc .   bother with energy .  of course  there s nothing new in energy  how can there be .  doesn t that show we must deal with matter .     matter .    ames interpreted brock s energy vibrations as those of disgust .   he said   why not .  we were once matter ourselves back back  oh  a trillion years ago anyway .  why not build up objects in a matter medium  or abstract forms or listen  brock why not build up an imitation of ourselves in matter  ourselves as we used to be .    brock said   i don t remember how that was .  no one does .     i do   said ames with energy   i ve been thinking of nothing else and i am beginning to remember .  brock  let me show you .  tell me if i m right .  tell me .     no .  this is silly .  it s repulsive .     let me try  brock .  we ve been friends  we ve pulsed energy together from the beginning from the moment we became what we are .  brock  please .     then  quickly .    ames had not felt such a tremor along his own lines of force in well  in how long .  if he tried it now for brock and it worked  he could dare manipulate matter before the assembled energy beings who had so drearily waited over the eons for something new .   the matter was thin out there between the galaxies  but ames gathered it  scraping it together over the cubic light years  choosing the atoms  achieving a clayey consistency and forcing matter into an ovoid form that spread out below .    don t you remember  brock .   he asked softly .   wasn t it something like this .    brock s vortex trembled in phase .   don t make me remember .  i don t remember .     that was the head .  they called it the head .  i remember it so clearly  i want to say it .  i mean with sound .   he waited  then said   look  do you remember that .    on the upper front of the ovoid appeared head .    what is that .   asked brock .    that s the word for head .  the symbols that meant the word in sound .  tell me you remember  brock .     there was something   said brock hesitantly   something in the middle .   a vertical bulge formed .   ames said   yes .  nose  that s it .   and nose appeared upon it .   and those are eyes on either side   left eye right eye .   ames regarded what he had formed  his lines of force pulsing slowly .  was he sure he liked this .    mouth   he said  in small quiverings   and chin and adam s apple  and  the collarbones .  how the words come back to me .   they appeared on the form .   brock said   i haven t thought of them for hundreds of billions of years .  why have you reminded me .  why .    ames was momentarily lost in his thoughts   something else .  organs to hear with  something for the sound waves .  ears .  where do they go .  i don t remember where to put them .    brock cried out   leave it alone .  ears and all else .  don t remember .    ames said  uncertainly   what is wrong with remembering .     because the outside wasn t rough and cold like that but smooth and warm .  because the eyes were tender and alive and the lips of the mouth trembled and were soft on mine .   brock s lines of force beat and wavered  beat and wavered .   ames said   i m sorry .  i m sorry .     you re reminding me that once i was a woman and knew love  that eyes do more than see and i have none to do it for me .    with violence  she added matter to the rough hewn head and said   then let them do it  and turned and fled .   and ames saw and remembered  too  that once he had been a man .  the force of his vortex split the head in two and he fled back across the galaxies on the energy track of brock back to the endless doom of life .   and the eyes of the shattered head of matter still glistened with the moisture that brock had placed there to represent tears .  the head of matter did that which the energy beings could do no longer and it wept for all humanity  and for the fragile beauty of the bodies they had once given up  a trillion years ago .   segregationist  the surgeon looked up without expression .   is he ready .     ready is a relative term   said the med eng .   we re ready .  he s restless .     they always are .   .   .   .  well  it s a serious operation .     serious or not  he should be thankful .  he s been chosen for it over an enormous number of possibles and frankly  i don t think  .   .   .     don t say it   said the surgeon .   the decision is not ours to make .     we accept it .  but do we have to agree .     yes   said the surgeon  crisply .   we agree .  completely and wholeheartedly .  the operation is entirely too intricate to approach with mental reservations .  this man has proven his worth in a number of ways and his profile is suitable for the board of mortality .     all right   said the med eng  unmollified .   the surgeon said   i ll see him right in here  i think .  it is small enough and personal enough to be comforting .     it won t help .  he s nervous  and he s made up his mind .     has he indeed .     yes .  he wants metal  they always do .    the surgeon s face did not change expression .  he stared at his hands .   sometimes one can talk them out of it .     why bother .   said the med eng  indifferently .   if he wants metal  let it be metal .     you don t care .     why should i .   the med eng said it almost brutally .   either way it s a  copyright         by isaac asimov .   medical engineering problem and i m a medical engineer .  either way  i can handle it .  why should i go beyond that .    the surgeon said stolidly   to me  it is a matter of the fitness of things .     fitness .  you can t use that as an argument .  what does the patient care about the fitness of things .     i care .     you care in a minority .  the trend is against you .  you have no chance .     i have to try .   the surgeon waved the med eng into silence with a quick wave of his hand no impatience to it  merely quickness .  he had already informed the nurse and he had already been signaled concerning her approach .  he pressed a small button and the double door pulled swiftly apart .  the patient moved inward in his motorchair  the nurse stepping briskly along beside him .    you may go  nurse   said the surgeon   but wait outside .  i will be calling you .   he nodded to the med eng  who left with the nurse  and the door closed behind them .   the man in the chair looked over his shoulder and watched them go .  his neck was scrawny and there were fine wrinkles about his eyes .  he was freshly shaven and the fingers of his hands  as they gripped the arms of the chair tightly  showed manicured nails .  he was a high priority patient and he was being taken care of .   .  .  .  but there was a look of settled peevishness on his face .   he said   will we be starting today .    the surgeon nodded .   this afternoon  senator .     i understand it will take weeks .     not for the operation itself  senator .  but there are a number of subsidiary points to be taken care of .  there are some circulatory renovations that must be carried through  and hormonal adjustments .  these are tricky things .     are they dangerous .   then  as though feeling the need for establishing a friendly relationship  but patently against his will  he added    .   .   .  doctor .    the surgeon paid no attention to the nuances of expression .  he said  flatly   everything is dangerous .  we take our time in order that it be less dangerous .  it is the time required  the skill of many individuals united  the equipment  that makes such operations available to so few  .  .  .     i know that   said the patient  restlessly .   i refuse to feel guilty about that .  or are you implying improper pressure .     not at all  senator .  the decisions of the board have never been questioned .  i mention the difficulty and intricacy of the operation merely to explain my desire to have it conducted in the best fashion possible .     well  do so  then .  that is my desire  also .     then i must ask you to make a decision .  it is possible to supply you with either of two types of cyber hearts  metal or  .   .   .     plastic .   said the patient  irritably .   isn t that the alternative you were going to offer  doctor .  cheap plastic .  i don t want that .  i ve made my choice .  i want the metal .     but  .   .   .     see here .  i ve been told the choice rests with me .  isn t that so .    the surgeon nodded .   where two alternate procedures are of equal value from a medical standpoint  the choice rests with the patient .  in actual practice  the choice rests with the patient even when the alternate procedures are not of equal value  as in this case .    the patient s eyes narrowed .   are you trying to tell me the plastic heart is superior .     it depends on the patient .  in my opinion  in your individual case  it is .  and we prefer not to use the term  plastic .  it is a fibrous cyber heart .     it s plastic as far as i am concerned .     senator   said the surgeon  infinitely patient   the material is not plastic in the ordinary sense of the word .  it is a polymeric material true  but one that is far more complex than ordinary plastic .  it is a complex protein like fibre designed to imitate  as closely as possible  the natural structure of the human heart you now have within your chest .     exactly  and the human heart i now have within my chest is worn out although i am not yet sixty years old .  i don t want another one like it  thank you .  i want something better .     we all want something better for you  senator .  the fibrous cyber heart will be better .  it has a potential life of centuries .  it is absolutely non aller genie  .  .  .     isn t that so for the metallic heart  too .     yes  it is   said the surgeon .   the metallic cyber is of titanium alloy that  .   .   .     and it doesn t wear out .  and it is stronger than plastic .  or fibre or whatever you want to call it .     the metal is physically stronger  yes  but mechanical strength is not a point at issue .  its mechanical strength does you no particular good since the heart is well protected .  anything capable of reaching the heart will kill you for other reasons even if the heart stands up under manhandling .    the patient shrugged .   if i ever break a rib  i ll have that replaced by titanium  also .  replacing bones is easy .  anyone can have that done anytime .  i ll be as metallic as i want to be  doctor .     that is your right  if you so choose .  however  it is only fair to tell you that although no metallic cyber heart has ever broken down mechanically  a number have broken down electronically .     what does that mean .     it means that every cyber heart contains a pacemaker as part of its structure .  in the case of the metallic variety  this is an electronic device that keeps the cyber in rhythm .  it means an entire battery of miniaturized equip   ment must be included to alter the heart s rhythm to suit an individual s emotional and physical state .  occasionally something goes wrong there and people have died before that wrong could be corrected .     i never heard of such a thing .     i assure you it happens .     are you telling me it happens often .     not at all .  it happens very rarely .     well  then  i ll take my chance .  what about the plastic heart .  doesn t that contain a pacemaker .     of course it does  senator .  but the chemical structure of a fibrous cyber heart is quite close to that of human tissue .  it can respond to the ionic and hormonal controls of the body itself .  the total complex that need be inserted is far simpler than in the case of the metal cyber .     but doesn t the plastic heart ever pop out of hormonal control .     none has ever yet done so .     because you haven t been working with them long enough .  isn t that so .    the surgeon hesitated .   it is true that the fibrous cybers have not been used nearly as long as the metallic .     there you are .  what is it anyway  doctor .  are you afraid i m making myself into a robot  .   .   .  into a metallo  as they call them since citizenship went through .     there is nothing wrong with a metallo as a metallo .  as you say  they are citizens .  but you re not a metallo .  you re a human being .  why not stay a human being .     because i want the best and that s a metallic heart .  you see to that .    the surgeon nodded .   very well .  you will be asked to sign the necessary permissions and you will then be fitted with a metal heart .     and you ll be the surgeon in charge .  they tell me you re the best .     i will do what i can to make the changeover an easy one .    the door opened and the chair moved the patient out to the waiting nurse .   the med eng came in  looking over his shoulder at the receding patient until the doors had closed again .   he turned to the surgeon .   well  i can t tell what happened just by looking at you .  what was his decision .    the surgeon bent over his desk  punching out the final items for his records .   what you predicted .  he insists on the metallic cyber heart .     after all  they are better .     not significantly .  they ve been around longer  no more than that .  it s this mania that s been plaguing humanity ever since metallos have become citizens .  men have this odd desire to make metallos out of themselves .   f  they yearn for the physical strength and endurance one associates with them .     it isn t one sided  doc .  you don t work with metallos but i do  so i know .  the last two who came in for repairs have asked for fibrous elements .     did they get them .     in one case  it was just a matter of supplying tendons  it didn t make much difference there  metal or fibre .  the other wanted a blood system or its equivalent .  i told him i couldn t  not without a complete rebuilding of the structure of his body in fibrous material .   .  .  .  i suppose it will come to that some day .  metallos that aren t really metallos at all  but a kind of flesh and blood .     you don t mind that thought .     why not .  and metallized human beings  too .  we have two varieties of intelligence on earth now and why bother with two .  let them approach each other and eventually we won t be able to tell the difference .  why should we want to .  we d have the best of both worlds  the advantages of man combined with those of robot .     you d get a hybrid   said the surgeon  with something that approached fierceness .   you d get something that is not both  but neither .  isn t it logical to suppose an individual would be too proud of his structure and identity to want to dilute it with something alien .  would he want mongrelization .     that s segregationist talk .     then let it be that .   the surgeon said with calm emphasis   i believe in being what one is .  i wouldn t change a bit of my own structure for any reason .  if some of it absolutely required replacement  i would have that replacement as close to the original in nature as could possibly be managed .  i am myself  well pleased to be myself  and would not be anything else .    he had finished now and had to prepare for the operation .  he placed his strong hands into the heating oven and let them reach the dull red hot glow that would sterilize them completely .  for all his impassioned words  his voice had never risen  and on his burnished metal face there was  as always  no sign of expression .   i just make them up  see .   oh  dr .  a .     oh  dr .  a .     there is something  don t go  way   that i d like to hear you say .   though i d rather die  than try  to pry   the fact  you ll find   is that my mind  has evolved the jackpot question for today .   i intend no cheap derision   so please answer with decision   and  discarding all your petty cautious fears   tell the secret of your vision .   how on earth  do you give birth  to those crazy and impossible ideas .   is it indigestion  and a question  of the nightmare that results .   of your eyeballs whirling   copyright         by fantasy house  inc .   twirling   fingers curling  and unfurling   while your blood beats maddened chimes  as it keeps impassioned times  with your thick  uneven pulse .   is it that  you think  or liquor  that brings on the wildness quicker .   for a teeny  weeny  dry martini  may be just your private genie   or perhaps those tom and ferries  you will find the very  berries  for inducing  and unloosing  that weird gimmick or that kicker   or an awful  combination  of unlawful  stimulation   marijuana plus tequila   that will give you just that feel o   things a clicking  and unsticking  as you start your cerebration  to the crazy syncopation  of a brain a tocking ticking .   surely something  dr .  a .   makes you fey and quite outrt .  since i read you with devotion  won t you give me just a notion of that shrewdly pepped up potion out of which emerge your plots .  that wild secret bubbly mixture that has made you such a fixture in most favored s . f .  spots   now  dr .  a .   don t go away   oh  dr .  a .    oh  dr .  a .     rejection slips  a learned  dear asimov  all mental laws prove orthodoxy has its flaws .  consider that eclectic clause in kant s philosophy that gnaws with ceaseless anti logic jaws at all outworn and useless saws that stick in modern mutant craws .  so here s your tale  with faint applause  .  the words above show ample cause .   b gruff  dear ike  i was prepared   and  boy  i really cared  to swallow almost anything you wrote .   but  ike  you re just plain shot   your writing s gone to pot  there s nothing left but hack and mental bloat .   take back this piece of junk   it smelled  it reeked  it stunk  just glancing through it once was deadly rough .   but ike  boy  by and by   copyright         by isaac asiniov .   just try another try .  i need some yams and  kid  i love your stuff .   c kindly  dear isaac  friend of mine   i thought your tale was fine .   just frightful   ly delightful  and with merits all a shine .   it meant a quite full  night  full   friend  of tension  then relief  and attended  with full measure  of the pleasure  of suspended  disbelief .   it is triteful   scarcely rightful   almost spiteful  to declare  that some tiny faults are there .   nothing much   perhaps a touch   and over such  you shouldn t pine .   so let me say  without delay   my pal  my friend   your story s end  has left me gay  and joyfully composed .   p .  s .   oh  yes   i must confess   with some distress   your story is regretfully enclosed .   about the author  isaac asimov was born in the soviet union to his great surprise .  he moved quickly to correct the situation .  when his parents emigrated to the united states  isaac  three years old at the time  stowed away in their baggage .  he has been an american citizen since the age of eight .   brought up in brooklyn  and educated in its public schools  he eventually found his way to columbia university and  over the protests of the school administration  managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry  up to and including a ph . d .  he then infiltrated boston university and climbed the academic ladder  ignoring all cries of outrage  until he found himself professor of biochemistry .   meanwhile  at the age of nine  he found the love of his life  in the inanimate sense  when he discovered his first science fiction magazine .  by the time he was eleven  he began to write stories  and at eighteen  he actually worked up the nerve to submit one .  it was rejected .  after four long months of tribulation and suffering  he sold his first story and  thereafter  he never looked back .   in       when he was twenty one years old  he wrote the classic short story  nightfall  and his future was assured .  shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories  and shortly after that he had begun his foundation series .   what was left except quantity .  at the present time  he has published over     books  distributed through every major division of the dewey system of library classification  and shows no signs of slowing up .  he remains as youthful  as lively  and as lovable as ever  and grows more handsome with each year .  you can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious .   he is married to janet jeppson  psychiatrist and writer  has two children by a previous marriage  and lives in new york city .
