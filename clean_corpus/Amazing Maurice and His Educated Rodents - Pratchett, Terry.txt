the amazing maurice and his educated rodents   terry pratchett      contents   chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter    chapter     chapter     chapter     author s note  foot notes      chapter     one day  when he was naug hty  mr bunnsy looked over the hedge into farmer fred s field and it was full of green lettuces .  mr bunnsy  however  was not full of lettuces .  this did not seem fair .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure      rats .   they chased the do gs and bit the cats  they   but there was more to it than that .  as the amazing maurice said  it was just a story about people and rats .  and the difficult part of it was deciding who the people were  and who were the rats .   but malicia grim said it was a story about stories .   it began part of it began on the mail coach that came over the mountains from the distant cities of the plain .   this was the part of the journey that the driver didn t like .  the way wound through forests and around mountains on crumbling roads .  there were deep shadows between the trees .  sometimes he thought things were following the coach  keeping just out of sight .  it gave him the willies .   and on this journey  the really big willie was that he could hear voices .  he was sure of it .  they were coming from behind him  from the top of the coach  and there was nothing there but the big oilcloth mail sacks and the young man s luggage .  there was certainly nothing big enough for a person to hide inside .  but occasionally he was sure he heard squeaky voices  whispering .   there was only one passenger at this point .  he was a fair haired young man  sitting all by himself inside the rocking coach  reading a book .  he was reading slowly  and aloud  moving his finger over the words .    ubberwald   he read out .    that s  uberwald    said a small  squeaky but very clear voice .   the dots make it a sort of long  ooo  sound .  but you re doing well .     ooooooberwald .     there s such a thing as too much pronunciation  kid   said another voice  which sounded half asleep .   but you know the best thing about uberwald .  it s a long  long way from sto lat .  it s a long way from pseudopolis .  it s a long way from anywhere where the commander of the watch says he ll have us boiled alive if he ever sees us again .  and it s not very modern .  bad roads .  lots of mountains in the way .  people don t move about much up here .  so news doesn t travel very fast  see .  and they don t have policemen .  kid  we can make a fortune here .     maurice .   said the boy  carefully .    yes  kid .     you don t think what we re doing is  you know    dishonest  do you .    there was a pause before the voice said   how do you mean  dishonest .     well    we take their money  maurice .   the coach rocked and bounced over a pot hole .    all right   said the unseen maurice   but what you ve got to ask yourself is  who do we take the money from  actually .     well    it s generally the mayor or the city council or someone like that .     right .  and that means it s    what .  i ve told you this bit before .     er       it is gov ern ment money  kid   said maurice patiently .   say it .  gov ern ment money .     gov ern ment money   said the boy obediently .    right .  and what do governments do with money .     er  they       they pay soldiers   said maurice .   they have wars .  in fact  we ve prob ly stopped a lot of wars by taking the money and putting it where it can t do any harm .  they d put up stachoos to us  if they thought about it .     some of those towns looked pretty poor  maurice   said the kid doubtfully .    hey  just the kind of places that don t need wars  then .     dangerous beans says it s     the boy concentrated  and his lips moved before he said the word  as if he was trying out the pronunciation to himself       it s un eth ickle .     that s right  maurice   said the squeaky voice .   dangerous beans says we shouldn t live by trickery .     listen  peaches  trickery is what humans are all about   said the voice of maurice .   they re so keen on tricking one another all the time that they elect governments to do it for them .  we give them value for money .  they get a horrible plague of rats  they pay a rat piper  the rats all follow the kid out of town  hoppity skip  end of plague  everyone s happy that no one s widdling in the flour any more  the government gets re elected by a grateful population  general celebration all round .  money well spent  in my opinion .     but there s only a plague because we make them think there is   said the voice of peaches .    well  my dear  another thing all those little governments spend their money on is rat catchers  see .  i don t know why i bother with the lot of you  i really don t .     yes  but we    they realized that the coach had stopped .  outside  in the rain  there was the jingle of harness .  then the coach rocked a little  and there was the sound of running feet .   a voice from out of the darkness said   are there any wizards in there .    the occupants looked at one another in puzzlement .    no .   said the kid  the kind of  no  that means  why are you asking .     how about any witches .   said the voice .    no  no witches   said the kid .    right .  are there any heavily armed trolls employed by the mail coach company in there .     i doubt it   said maurice .   there was a moment s pause  filled with the sound of the rain .    ok  how about werewolves .   said the voice eventually .    what do they look like .   asked the kid .    ah  well  they look perfectly normal right up to the point where they grow all  like  hair and teeth and giant paws and leap through the window at you   said the voice .  the speaker sounded as though he was working through a list .    we ve all got hair and teeth   said the kid .    so you are werewolves  then .     no .     fine  fine .   there was another pause filled with rain .   ok  vampires   said the voice .   it s a wet night  you wouldn t want to be flying in weather like this .  any vampires in there .     no .   said the kid .   we re all perfectly harmless .     oh boy   muttered maurice  and crawled under the seat .    that s a relief   said the voice .   you can t be too careful these days .  there s a lot of funny people about .   a crossbow was pushed through the window  and the voice said   your money and your life .  it s a two for one deal  see .     the money s in the case on the roof   said maurice s voice  from floor level .   the highwayman looked around the dark interior of the coach .   who said that .   he asked .    er  me   said the boy .    i didn t see your lips move  kid .     the money is on the roof .  in the case .  but if i was you i wouldn t     hah  i just  spect you wouldn t   said the highwayman .  his masked face disappeared from the window .   the boy picked up the pipe that was lying on the seat beside him .  it was the type still known as a penny whistle  although no one could remember when they d ever cost only a penny .    play  robbery with violence   kid   said maurice  quietly .    couldn t we just give him money .   said the voice of peaches .  it was a little voice .    money is for people to give us   said maurice  sternly .   above them  they heard the scrape of the case on the roof of the coach as the highwayman dragged it down .   the boy obediently picked up the flute and played a few notes .  now there were a number of sounds .  there was a creak  a thud  a sort of scuffling noise and then a very short scream .   when there was silence  maurice climbed back onto the seat and poked his head out of the coach  into the dark and rainy night .   good man   he said .   sensible .  the more you struggle  the harder they bite .  prob ly not broken skin yet .  good .  come forward a bit so i can see you .  but carefully  eh .  we don t want anyone to panic  do we .    the highwayman reappeared in the light of the coach lamps .  he was walking very slowly and carefully  his legs spread wide apart .  and he was quietly whimpering .    ah  there you are   said maurice  cheerfully .   went straight up your trouser legs  did they .  typical rat trick .  just nod   cos we don t want to set  em off .  no tellin  where it might end .    the highwayman nodded very slowly .  then his eyes narrowed .   you re a cat .   he mumbled .  then his eyes crossed and he gasped .    did i say talk .   said maurice .   i don t think i said talk  did i .  did the coachman run away or did you kill him .   the man s face went blank .   ah  quick learner  i like that in a highwayman   said maurice .   you can answer that question .     ran away   said the highwayman hoarsely .   maurice stuck his head back inside the coach .   whadja think .   he said .   coach  four horses  probably some valuables in the mail bags    could be  oh  a thousand dollars or more .  the kid could drive it .  worth a try .     that s stealing  maurice   said peaches .  she was sitting on the seat beside the kid .  she was a rat .    not stealing as such   said maurice .   more    findin  .  the driver s run away  so it s like    salvage .  hey  that s right  we could turn it in for the reward .  that s much better .  legal  too .  shall we .     people would ask too many questions   said peaches .    if we just leave it  someone yawlp will steal it   wailed maurice .   some thief will take it away .  much better if we take it  eh .  we re not thieves .     we will leave it  maurice   said peaches .    in that case  let s steal the highwayman s horse   said maurice  as if the night wouldn t be properly finished unless they stole something .   stealing from a thief isn t stealing   cos it cancels out .     we can t stay here all night   said the kid to peaches .   he s got a point .     that s right .   said the highwayman urgently .   you can t stay here all night .     that s right   said a chorus of voices from his trousers   we can t stay here all night .    maurice sighed  and stuck his head out of the window again .   o k   he said .   this is what we re going to do .  you re going to stand very still looking straight in front of you  and you won t try any tricks because if you do i ve only got to say the word     don t say the word .   said the highwayman even more urgently .    right   said maurice   and we ll take your horse as a punishment and you can have the coach because that d be stealing and only thieves are allowed to steal .  fair enough .     anything you say .   said the highwayman  then he thought about this and added hurriedly   but please don t say anything .   he kept staring straight ahead .  he saw the boy and the cat get out of the coach .  he heard various sounds behind him as they took his horse .  and he thought about his sword .  all right  he was going to get a whole mail coach out of this deal  but there was such a thing as professional pride .    all right   said the voice of the cat after a while .   we re all going to leave now  and you ve got to promise not to move until we re gone .  promise .     you have my word as a thief   said the highwayman  slowly lowering a hand to his sword .    right .  we certainly trust you   said the voice of the cat .   the man felt his trousers lighten as the rats poured out and scampered away  and he heard the jingle of harness .  he waited a moment  then spun around  drew his sword and ran forward .   slightly forward  in any case .  he wouldn t have hit the ground so hard if someone hadn t tied his bootlaces together .   they said he was amazing .  the amazing maurice  they said .  he d never meant to be amazing .  it had just happened .   he d realized something was odd that day  just after lunch  when he d looked into a reflection in a puddle and thought that s me .  he d never been aware of himself before .  of course  it was hard to remember how he d thought before he became amazing .  it seemed to him that his mind had been just a kind of soup .   and then there had been the rats  who lived under the rubbish heap in one corner of his territory .  he d realized there was something educated about the rats when he jumped on one and it d said   can we talk about this .    and part of his amazing new brain had told him you couldn t eat someone who could talk .  at least  not until you d heard what they d got to say .   the rat had been peaches .  she wasn t like other rats .  nor were dangerous beans  donut enter  darktan  hamnpork  big savings  toxie and all the rest of them .  but  then  maurice wasn t like other cats any more .   other cats were  suddenly  stupid .  maurice started to hang around with the rats  instead .  they were someone to talk to .  he got on fine so long as he remembered not to eat anyone they knew .   the rats spent a lot of time worrying about why they were suddenly so clever .  maurice considered that this was a waste of time .  stuff happened .  but the rats went on and on about whether it was something on the rubbish heap that they d eaten  and even maurice could see that wouldn t explain how he d got changed  because he d never eaten rubbish .  and he certainly wouldn t eat any rubbish off that heap  seeing as where it came from     he considered that the rats were  quite frankly  dumb .  clever  ok  but dumb .  maurice had lived on the streets for four years and barely had any ears left and scars all over his nose  and he was smart .  he swaggered so much when he walked that if he didn t slow down he flipped himself over .  when he fluffed out his tail people had to step around it .  he reckoned you had to be smart to live for four years on these streets  especially with all the dog gangs and freelance furriers .  one wrong move and you were lunch and a pair of gloves .  yes  you had to be smart .   you also had to be rich .  this took some explaining to the rats  but maurice had roamed the city and learned how things worked and money  he said  was the key to everything .   and then one day he d seen the stupid looking kid playing the flute with his cap in front of him for pennies  he d had an idea .  an amazing idea .  it just turned up  bang  all at once .  rats  flute  stupid looking kid     and he d said   hey  stupid looking kid .  how would you like to make your fortu nah  kid  i m down here      dawn was breaking when the highwayman s horse came out of the forests  over a pass  and was reined to a halt in a convenient wood .   the river valley stretched out below  with a town hunched up against the cliffs .   maurice clambered out of the saddle bag  and stretched .  the stupid looking kid helped the rats out of the other bag .  they d spent the journey hunched up on the money  although they were too polite to say that this was because no one wanted to sleep in the same bag as a cat .    what s the name of the town  kid .   maurice said  sitting on a rock and looking down at the town .  behind them  the rats were counting the money again  stacking it in piles beside its leather bag .  they did this every day .  even though he had no pockets  there was something about maurice that made everyone want to check their change as often as possible .      s called bad blintz   said the kid  referring to the guide book .    ahem    should we be going there  if it s bad .   said peaches  looking up from the counting .    hah  it s not called bad because it s bad   said maurice .   that s foreign language for bath  see .     so it s really called bath blintz .   said donut enter .    nah  nah  they call it bath because     the amazing maurice hesitated  but only for a moment   because they got a bath  see .  very backward place  this .  not many baths around .  but they ve got one  and they re very proud of it  so they want everyone to know .  you prob ly have to buy tickets even to have a look at it .     is that true  maurice .   said dangerous beans .  he asked the question quite politely  but it was clear that what he was really saying was  i don t think that is true  maurice .    ah  yes    dangerous beans .  dangerous beans was difficult to deal with .  really  he shouldn t be .  back in the old days  maurice thought  he wouldn t even have eaten a rat so small and pale and generally ill looking .  he stared down at the little albino rat  with his snow white fur and pinky eyes .  dangerous beans did not stare back  because he was too short sighted .  of course  being nearly blind was not too much of a drawback to a species that spent most of its time in the darkness and had a sense of smell that was  as far as maurice could understand it  almost as good as sight and sound and speech all put together .  for example  the rat always turned to face maurice and looked directly at him when he spoke .  it was uncanny .  maurice had known a blind cat that walked into doors a lot  but dangerous beans never did that .   dangerous beans wasn t the head rat .  that was hamnpork s job .  hamnpork was big and fierce and a bit scabby  and he didn t much like having a new fangled brain and he certainly didn t like talking to a cat .  he d been quite old when the rats had changed  as they called it  and he said he was too old to change .  he left talking to maurice to dangerous beans  who d been born just after the change .  and that little rat was clever .  incredibly clever .  too clever .  maurice needed all his tricks when he was dealing with dangerous beans .    it s amazing  the stuff i know   said maurice  blinking slowly at him .   anyway  it s a nice looking town .  looks rich to me .  now  what we ll do is     ahem      maurice hated that sound .  if there was a sound worse than dangerous beans asking one of his odd little questions  it was peaches clearing her throat .  it meant she was going to say something  very quietly  which was going to upset him .    yes .   he said sharply .    do we really need to keep on doing this .   she said .    well  of course  no   said maurice .   i don t have to be here at all .  i m a cat  right .  a cat with my talents .  hah .  i could ve got myself a really cushy job with a conjurer .  or a ventrilosqwist  maybe .  there s no end to the things i could be doing  right   cos people like cats .  but  owing to being incredibly  you know  stupid and kind hearted  i decided to help a bunch of rodents who are  and let s be frank here  not exactly number one favourites with humans .  now some of you   and here he cast a yellow eye towards dangerous beans   have some idea of going to some island somewhere and starting up a kind of rat civilization of your very own  which i think is very  you know  admirable  but for that you need    what did i tell you that you need .     money  maurice   said dangerous beans   but     money .  that s right   cos what can you get with money .   he looked around at the rats .   begins with a b   he prompted .    boats  maurice  but     and then there s all the tools you ll need  and food  of course     there s coconuts   said the stupid looking kid  who was polishing his flute .    oh  did someone speak .   said maurice .   what do you know about it  kid .     you get coconuts   said the kid .   on desert islands .  a man selling them told me .     how .   said maurice .  he wasn t too sure about coconuts .    i don t know .  you just get them .     oh  i suppose they just grow on trees  do they .   said maurice sarcastically .   sheesh  i just don t know what you lot would do without    anyone .   he glared at the group .   begins with an m .     you  maurice   said dangerous beans .   but  you see  what we think is  really     yes .   said maurice    ahem   said peaches .  maurice groaned .   what dangerous beans means   said the female rat   is that all this stealing grains and cheese and gnawing holes in walls is  well     she looked up into maurice s yellow eyes .   is not morally right .     but it s what rats do .   said maurice .    but we feel we shouldn t   said dangerous beans .   we should be making our own way in the world .     oh dear oh dear oh dear   said maurice  shaking his head .   ho for the island  eh .  the kingdom of the rats .  not that i m laughing at your dream   he added hastily .   everyone needs their little dreams .   maurice truly that  too .  if you knew what it was that people really  really wanted  you very nearly controlled them .   sometimes he wondered what the stupid looking kid wanted .  nothing  as far as maurice could tell  but to be allowed to play his flute and be left alone .  but    well  it was like that thing with the coconuts .  every so often the kid would come out with something that suggested he d been listening all along .  people like that are hard to steer .   but cats are good at steering people .  a miaow here  a purr there  a little gentle pressure with a claw    and maurice had never had to think about it before .  cats didn t have to think .  they just had to know what they wanted .  humans had to do the thinking .  that s what they were for .   maurice thought about the good old days before his brain had started whizzing like a firework .  he d turn up at the door of the university kitchens and look sweet  and then the cooks would try to work out what he wanted .  it was amazing .  they d say things like  does oo want a bowl of milk  den .  does oo want a biscuit .  does oo want dese nice scraps  den .   and all maurice would have to do was wait patiently until they got to a sound he recognized  like  turkey legs  or  minced lamb  .   but he was sure he d never eaten anything magical .  there was no such thing as enchanted chicken giblets  was there .   it was the rats who d eaten the magical stuff .  the dump they called  home  and also called  lunch  was round the back of the university  and it was a university for wizards  after all .  the old maurice hadn t paid much attention to people who weren t holding bowls  but he was aware that the big men in pointy hats made strange things happen .   and now he knew what happened to the stuff they used  too .  it got tossed over the wall when they d finished with it .  all the old worn out spell books and the stubs of the dribbly candles and the remains of the green bubbly stuff in the cauldrons all ended up on the big dump  along with the tin cans and old boxes and the kitchen waste .  oh  the wizards had put up signs saying  dangerous  and  toxic   but the rats hadn t been able to read in those days and they liked dribbly candle ends .   maurice had never eaten anything off the dump .  a good motto in life  he d reckoned  was  don t eat anything that glows .   but he d become intelligent  too  at about the same time as the rats .  it was a mystery .   since then he d done what cats always did .  he steered people .  now some of the rats counted as people too  of course .  but people were people  even if they had four legs and had called themselves names like dangerous beans  which is the kind of name you give yourself if you learn to read before you understand what all the words actually mean  and read the notices and the labels off the old rusty cans and give yourself names you like the sound of .   the trouble with thinking was that  once you started  you went on doing it .  and as far as maurice was concerned  the rats were thinking a good deal too much .  dangerous beans was bad enough  but he was so busy thinking stupid thoughts about how rats could actually build their own country somewhere that maurice could deal with him .  it was peaches who was the worst .  maurice s usual trick of just talking fast until people got confused didn t work on her at all .    ahem   she began again   we think that this should be the last time .    maurice stared .  the other rats backed away slightly  but peaches just stared back .    this must be the very last time we do the silly  plague of rats  trick   said peaches .   and that s final .     and what does hamnpork think about this .   said maurice .  he turned to the head rat  who had been watching them .  it was always a good idea appealing to hamnpork when peaches was giving trouble  because he didn t like her very much .    what d you mean  think .   said hamnpork .    i    sir  i think we should stop doing this trick   said peaches  dipping her head nervously .    oh  you think too  do you .   said hamnpork .   everyone s thinking these days .  i think there s a good deal too much of this thinking  that s what i think .  we never thought about thinking when i was a lad .  we d never get anything done if we thought first .    he gave maurice a glare  too .  hamnpork didn t like maurice .  he didn t like most things that had happened since the change .  in fact maurice wondered how long hamnpork was going to last as leader .  he didn t like thinking .  he belonged to the days when a rat leader just had to be big and stroppy .  the world was moving far too fast for him now  which made him angry .   he wasn t so much leading now as being pushed .    i    dangerous beans  sir  believes that we should be thinking of settling down  sir   said peaches .   maurice scowled .  hamnpork wouldn t listen to peaches  and she knew it  but dangerous beans was the nearest thing the rats had to a wizard and even big rats listened to him .    i thought we were going to get on a boat and find an island somewhere   said hamnpork .   very ratty places  boats   he added  approvingly .  then he went on  with a slightly nervous and slightly annoyed look at dangerous beans   and people tell me that we need this money stuff because now we can do all this thinking we ve got to be eff    efit       ethical  sir   said dangerous beans .    which sounds unratty to me .  not that my opinion counts for anything  it seems   said hamnpork .    we ve got enough money  sir   said peaches .   we ve already got a lot of money .  we have got a lot of money  haven t we  maurice .   it wasn t a question  it was a kind of accusation .    well  when you say a lot   maurice began .    and in fact we ve got more money than we thought   said peaches  still in the same tone of voice .  it was very polite  but it just kept going and it asked all the wrong questions .  a wrong question for maurice was one that he didn t want anyone to ask .  peaches gave her little cough again .   the reason i say we ve got more money  maurice  is that you said what were called  gold coins  were shiny like the moon and  silver coins  were shiny like the sun  and you d keep all the silver coins .  in fact  maurice  that s the wrong way around .  it s the silver coins that are shiny like the moon .    maurice thought a rude word in cat language  which has a great many of them .  what was the point of education  he thought  if people went out afterwards and used it .    so we think  sir   said dangerous beans to hamnpork   that after this one last time we should share out the money and go our separate ways .  besides  it s getting dangerous to keep repeating the same trick .  we should stop before it s too late .  there s a river here .  we should be able to get to the sea .     an island with no humans or krllrrt cats would be a good place   said hamnpork .   maurice didn t let his smile fade  even though he knew what krllrrt meant .    and we wouldn t want to keep maurice from his wonderful new job with the conjurer   said peaches .   maurice s eyes narrowed .  for a moment he came close to breaking his iron rule of not eating anyone that could talk .   what about you  kid .   he said  looking up at the stupid looking kid .    i don t mind   said the kid .    don t mind what .   said maurice .    don t mind anything  really   said the kid .   just so long as no one stops me playing .     but you ve got to think of the future .   said maurice .    i am   said the kid .   i want to go on playing my music in the future .  it doesn t cost anything to play .  but maybe the rats are right .  we ve had a couple of narrow squeaks  maurice .    maurice gave the kid a sharp look to see if he was making a joke  but the kid had never done that kind of thing before .  he gave up .  well  not exactly gave up .  maurice hadn t got where he was by giving up on problems .  he just put them to one side .  after all  something always turned up .   ok  fine   he said .   we ll do it one more time and split the money three ways .  fine .  not a problem .  but if this is going to be the last time  let s make it one to remember  eh .   he grinned .   the rats  being rats  were not keen on seeing a grinning cat  but they understood that a difficult decision had been made .  they breathed tiny sighs of relief .    are you happy with that  kid .   said maurice .    i can go on playing my flute afterwards .   said the kid .    absolutely .     ok   said the kid .   the money  shiny like the sun and shiny like the moon  was solemnly put back in its bag .  the rats dragged the bag under the bushes and buried it .  no one could bury money like rats  and it didn t pay to take too much into towns .   then there was the horse .  it was a valuable horse  and maurice was very  very sorry to turn it loose .  but  as peaches pointed out  it was a highwayman s horse  with a very ornate saddle and bridle .  trying to sell it here could be dangerous .  people would talk .  it might attract the attention of the government .  this was no time to have the watch on their tails .   maurice walked to the edge of the rock and looked down at the town  which was waking up under the sunrise .   let s make this the big one  then  eh .   he said  as rats came back .   i want to see maximum squeaking and making faces at people and widdling on stuff  ok .     we think that widdling on stuff is not really   dangerous beans began  but  ahem   said peaches  and so dangerous beans went on   oh  i suppose  if it s the last time       i ve widdled on everything since i was out of the nest   said hamnpork .   now they tell me it s not right .  if that s what thinking means  i m glad i don t do any .     let s leave  em amazed   said maurice .   rats .  they think they ve seen rats in that town .  after they ve seen us  they ll be making up storiesl       chapter     mr bunnsy had a lot of friends in furry bottom .  but what mr bunnsy was friendly with more than anything else was food .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    this was the plan  .   and it was a good plan .  even the rats  even peaches  had to admit that it had worked .   everyone knew about plagues of rats .  there were famous stories about the rat pipers  who made their living going from town to town getting rid of plagues of rats .  of course there weren t just rat plagues sometimes there were plagues of accordion players  bricks tied up with string  or fish but it was the rats everyone knew about .   and that  really  was it .  you didn t need many rats for a plague  not if they knew their business .  one rat  popping up here and there  squeaking loudly  taking a bath in the fresh cream and widdling in the flour  could be a plague all by himself .   after a few days of this  it was amazing how glad people were to see the stupid looking kid with his magical rat pipe .  and they were amazed when rats poured out of every hole to follow him out of the town .  they were so amazed that they didn t bother much about the fact that there were only a few hundred rats .   they d have been really amazed if they d ever found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere in the bushes out of town  and solemnly counted out the money .   bad blintz was waking up when maurice entered with the kid .  no one bothered them  although maurice got a lot of interest .  this did not worry him .  he knew he was interesting .  cats walked as if they owned the place anyway  and the world was full of stupid looking kids and people weren t rushing to see another one .   it looked as though today was a market day  but there weren t many stalls and they were mostly selling  well  junk .  old pans  pots  used shoes    the kind of things people have to sell when they re short of money .   maurice had seen plenty of markets  on their journeys through other towns  and he knew how they should go .    there should be fat women selling chickens   he said .   and people selling sweets for the kids  and ribbons .  tumblers and clowns .  even weasel jugglers  if you re lucky .     there s nothing like that .  there s hardly anything to buy  by the look of it   said the kid .   i thought you said this was a rich town  maurice .     well  it looked rich   said maurice .   all those big fields in the valley  all those boats on the river    you d think the streets d be paved with gold .    the kid looked up .   funny thing   he said .    what .     the people look poor   he said .   it s the buildings that look rich .    and they did .  maurice wasn t an expert on architecture but the wooden buildings had been carefully carved and painted .  he noticed something else  too .  there was nothing careful about the sign that had been nailed up on the nearest wall .   it said   rats wanted dead .      pence per tail .   apply to  the rat catchers  c o the rathaus  the kid was staring at it .    they must really want to get rid of their rats here   said maurice  cheerfully .    no one has ever offered a reward of half a dollar a tail .   said the kid .    i told you this would be the big one   said maurice .   we ll be sitting on a pile of gold before the week s out .     what s a rat house .   said the kid  doubtfully .   it can t be a house for rats  can it .  and why is everyone staring at you .     i m a handsome looking cat   said maurice .  even so  it was a little surprising .  people were nudging one another and pointing at him .   you d think they d never seen a cat before   he muttered  staring at the big building across the street .  it was a big  square building  surrounded by people  and the sign said  rathaus .   rathouse s just the local word for    like the council house  the town hall   he said .   it s nothing to do with rats  amusing though it may be .     you really know a lot of words  maurice   said the kid  admiringly .    i amaze myself  sometimes   said maurice .   a queue of people were standing in front of one huge open door .  other people  who had presumably done whatever it was the queue was queuing to do  were emerging from another doorway in ones and twos .  they were all carrying loaves of bread .    shall we queue up too .   said the kid .    i shouldn t think so   said maurice  carefully .    why not .     see those men on the door .  they look like watchmen .  they ve got big truncheons .  and everyone s showing them a bit of paper as they go past .  i don t like the look of that   said maurice .   that looks like government to me .     we haven t done anything wrong   said the kid .   not here  anyway .     you never know  with governments .  just sit still here  kid .  i ll take a look .    people did look at maurice when he stalked into the building  but it seemed that in a town beset by rats a cat was quite popular .  a man did try to pick him up  but lost interest when maurice turned and clawed the back of his hand .   the queue wound into a big hall and passed in front of a long trestle table .  there  each person showed their piece of paper to two women in front of a big tray of bread  and were given some bread .  then they moved on to a man with a vat of sausages  and got considerably less sausage .   watching over all this  and occasionally saying something to the food servers  was the mayor .  maurice recognized him instantly because he had a gold chain around his neck .  he had run across a lot of mayors since working with the rats .  this one was different from the rest .  he was smaller  far more worried  and had a bald spot that he d tried to cover with three strands of hair .  he was a lot thinner than other mayors maurice had seen  too .  he didn t look as if he d been bought by the ton .   so    food is scarce  maurice thought .  they re having to ration it out .  looks like they ll be  needing a piper any day now .  lucky for us we arrived just in time     he walked out again  but this time a bit faster  because he realized that someone was playing a pipe .  it was  as he feared  the kid .  he d put his cap on the ground in front of him  and had even accumulated a few coins .  the queue had bent round so that people could hear him  and one or two small children were actually dancing .   maurice was only an expert on cat singing  which of standing two inches in front of other cats and screaming at them until they give in .  human music always sounded thin and watery to him .  but people tapped their feet when they heard the kid play .  they smiled for a while .   maurice waited until the kid had finished the tune .  while the queue was clapping  he sidled up behind the kid  brushed up against him and hissed   well done  fish for brains .  we re supposed to be inconspicuousl come on  let s go .  oh  grab the money  too .    he led the way across the square until he stopped so suddenly that the kid almost trod on him .    whoops  here comes some more government   he said .   and we know what these are  don t we     .    the kid did .  they were rat catchers  two of them .  even here  they wore the long dusty coats and battered black top hats of their profession .  they each carried a pole over one shoulder  from which dangled a variety of traps .   from the other shoulder hung a big bag  the kind you really wouldn t want to look inside .  and each man had a terrier on a string .  they were skinny  argumentative dogs  and growled at maurice when they were dragged past .   the queue cheered as the men approached  and clapped when they both reached into their bags and held up a couple of handfuls of what looked  to maurice  like black string .    two hundred today .   shouted one of the rat catchers .   one of the terriers lunged at maurice  tugging frantically on its string .  the cat didn t move .  probably only the stupid looking kid heard him say  in a low voice   heel  fleabag .  bad dog .    the terrier s face screwed up in the horribly worried expression of a dog trying to have two thoughts at the same time .  it knew cats shouldn t talk  and this cat had just talked .  it was a terrible problem .  it sat down awkwardly and whined .   maurice washed himself .  it was a deadly insult .   the rat catcher  annoyed at such a cowardly performance from his dog  jerked it away .   and dropped a few of the black strings .    rat tails .   said the kid .   they really must have a problem here .     a bigger one than you think   said maurice  staring at the bunch of tails .   just pick those up when no one s looking  will you .    the kid waited until people weren t looking towards them  and reached down .  just as his fingers touched the tangle of tails a large  shiny black boot trod heavily on it .    now  you don t want to go touching them  young sir   said a voice above him .   you can get plague  you know  from rats .  it makes your legs explode .   it was one of the rat catchers .  he gave the kid a big grin  but it was not a humorous one .  it smelled of beer .    that s right  young sir  and then your brains come down your nose   said the other rat catcher  coming up behind the kid .   you wouldn t dare use your hanky  young sir  if you got the plague .     my associate has as usual put his finger right on it  young sir   said the first rat catcher  breathing more beer into the kid s face .    which is more than you d be able to do  young sir   said rat catcher     because when you get the plague  your fingers go all     your legs haven t exploded   said the kid .  maurice groaned .  it was never a good idea to be rude to a smell of beer .  but the rat catchers were at the stage where  against all the odds  they thought they were funny .    ah  well said  young sir  but that s because lesson one at the guild of rat catchers  school is not letting your legs explode   said rat catcher   .    which is a good thing  cos the second lesson is upstairs   said rat catcher   .   oh  i am a one  aren t i  young sir .    the other rat catcher picked up the bundle of black strings  and his smile faded as he stared at the kid .   ain t seen you before  kid   he said   and my advice to you is  keep your nose clean and don t say nothing to nobody about anything .  not a word .  understand .    the kid opened his mouth  and then shut it hurriedly .  the rat catcher grinned his awful grin again .    ah .  you catch on quick  young sir   he said .   perhaps we ll see you around  eh .     i bet you d like to be a rat catcher when you grow up  eh  young sir   said rat catcher    patting the kid too heavily on the back .   the kid nodded .  it seemed the best thing to do .  rat catcher   leaned down until his red  pock marked nose was an inch away from the kid s face .    if you grow up  young sir   he said .   the rat catchers walked away  dragging their dogs with them .  one of the terriers kept looking back at maurice .    very unusual rat catchers they have hereabouts   said the cat .    i haven t seen rat catchers like them before   said the kid .   they looked nasty .  like they enjoyed it .     i haven t seen rat catchers who ve been so busy but still have nice clean boots   said maurice .    yes  they did  didn t they     said the kid .    but even that s not as odd as the rats round here   said maurice  in the same quiet voice  as though he was adding up money .    what s odd about the rats .   said the kid .    some of them have very strange tails   said maurice .   the kid looked around the square .  the queue for bread was still quite long  and it made him nervous .  but so did the steam .  little bursts of it puffed up from gratings and manhole covers all over the place  as if the whole town had been built on a kettle .  also  he had the distinct feeling that someone was watching him .    i think we ought to find the rats and move on   he said .    no  this smells like a town with opportunities   said maurice .   something s going on  and when something s going on  that means someone s getting rich  and when someone s getting rich  i don t see why that shouldn t be m us .     yes  but we don t want those people killing dangerous beans and the rest of them .     they won t get caught   said maurice .   those men wouldn t win any prizes for thinking .  even hamnpork could run rings round  em  i d say .  and dangerous beans has got brains coming out of his ears .     i hope not .     nah  nah   said maurice  who generally told people what they wanted to hear   i mean our rats can out think most humans  ok .  remember back in scrote when sardines got in that kettle and blew a raspberry at the old woman when she lifted the lid .  hah  even ordinary rats can out think humans .  humans think that just because they re bigger  they re better hold on  i ll shut up  someone s watching us      a man carrying a basket had stopped on his way out of the rathaus and was staring at maurice with a good deal of interest .  then he looked up at the kid and said   good ratter  is he .  i ll bet he is  a big cat like that .  is he yours  boy .     say yes   maurice whispered .    sort of  yes   said the kid .  he picked maurice up .    i ll give you five dollars for him   said the man .    ask for ten   maurice hissed .    he s not for sale   said the kid .    idiot .   maurice purred .    seven dollars  then   said the man .   look  i ll tell you what i ll do    four whole loaves of bread  how about that .     that s silly .  a loaf of bread shouldn t cost more n twenty pence   said the kid .   the man gave him a strange look .   new here  are you .  got plenty of money  have you .     enough   said the kid .    you think so .  it won t do you much good  anyway .  look  four loaves of bread and a bun  i can t say fairer than that .  i can get a terrier for ten loaves and they re mad for rats    no .  well  when you re hungry you ll give it away for half a slice of bread and scrape        and think you ve done well  believe me .    he strode off .  maurice wriggled out of the kid s arms  and landed lightly on the cobbles .   honestly  if only i was good at ventrilosqwism we could make a fortune   he grumbled .    ventrilosqwism .   said the kid  watching the man s retreating back .    it s where you open and shut your mouth and i do the talking   said maurice .   why didn t you sell me .  i could ve been back in ten minutes .  i heard of a man who made a fortune selling homing pigeons  and he only had the one .     don t you think there s something wrong with a town where people d pay more than a dollar for a loaf of bread .   said the kid .   and pay half a dollar just for a rat tail .     just so long as they ve got enough money left to pay the piper   said maurice .   bit of luck there already being a plague of rats here  eh .  quick  pat me on the head  there s a girl watching us .    the kid looked up .  there was a girl watching them .  people were passing up and down the street  and some of them walked between the kid and the girl  but she stood stock still and just stared at him .  and at maurice .  she had the same nail you to the wall look that he associated with peaches .  she looked like the kind of person who asked questions .  and her hair was too red and her nose was too long .  and she wore a long black dress with black lace fringing .  no good comes of that sort of thing .   she marched across the street and confronted the kid .   you re new  aren t you .  come here looking for work  have you .  probably sacked from your last job  i expect .  probably because you fell asleep  and things got spoiled .  that was probably what it was .  or you ran away because your master beat you with a big stick  although   she added  as another idea struck her   you probably deserved it because of being lazy .  and then you probably stole the cat  knowing how much people would pay for a cat here .  and you must have gone mad with hunger because you were talking to the cat and everyone knows that cats can t talk .     can t say a single word   said maurice .    and probably you re a mysterious boy who   the girl stopped and gave maurice a puzzled look .  he arched his back and said  prppt   which is cat language for  biscuits .    did that cat just say something .   she demanded .    i thought that everyone knew that cats can t talk   said the kid .    ah  but maybe you were apprenticed to a wizard   said the girl .   yes  that sounds about right .  that ll do for now .  you were an apprentice to a wizard  but you fell asleep and let the cauldron of bubbling green stuff boil over and he threatened to turn you into a  a  a     gerbil   said maurice  helpfully .     a gerbil  and you stole his magical cat because you hated it so much and what s a gerbil .  did that cat just say  gerbil  .     don t look at me .   said the kid .   i m just standing here .     all right  and then you brought the cat here because you know there s a terrible famine and that s why you were going to sell it and that man would have given you ten dollars  you know  if you d held out for it .     ten dollars is too much money even for a good ratter   said the kid .    ratter .  he wasn t interested in catching rats .   said the red haired girl .   everyone s hungry here .  there s at least two meals on that cat .     what .  you eat cats here .   said maurice  his tail fluffing like a brush .   the girl leaned down to maurice with a dreadful grin  just like the one that peaches always wore when she d won an argument with him  and prodded him on the nose with a finger .   got you .   she said .   you fell for a very simple trick .  i think you two had better come with me  don t you .  or i ll scream .  and people listen to me when i m screaming .        chapter      never go into the dark wood  my friend   said ratty rupert .   there are bad things in there     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    far below maurice s paws  the rats were creeping through the undertown of bad blintz .  old towns are like that .  people build down as well as up .  cellars butt against other cellars  and some of the cellars get forgotten except by creatures that want to stay out of sight .   in the thick  warm  damp darkness a voice said   all right  who s got the matches .     me  dangerous beans .  feedsfour .     well done  young rat .  and who has the candle .     me  sir .         i m bitesize .     good .  put it down and peaches will light it .    there was a lot of scuffling in the darkness .  not all the rats had got used to the idea of making fire  and some were getting out of the way .   there was a scratching noise  and then the match flared .  holding the match with both front paws  peaches lit the candle stub .  the flame swelled for a moment and settled down to a steady glow .    can you really see it .   said hamnpork .    yes  sir   said dangerous beans .   i am not completely blind .  i can tell the difference between light and dark .     y know   said hamnpork  watching the flame suspiciously   i don t like it at all  even so .  darkness was good enough for our parents .  it ll end in trouble .  besides  setting fire to a candle is a waste of perfectly good food .     we have to be able to control the fire  sir   said dangerous beans calmly .   with the flame we make a statement to the darkness .  we say  we are separate .  we say  we are not just rats .  we say  we are the clan .     hrumph   said hamnpork  which was his usual response when he didn t understand what had just been said .  just lately he d been hrumphing a lot .    i ve heard the younger rats are saying that the shadows frighten them   said peaches .    why .   said hamnpork .   they re not frightened of complete darkness  are they .  darkness is ratty .  being in the dark is what a rat is all about .     it s odd   said peaches   but we didn t know the shadows were there until we had the light .    one of the younger rats timorously raised a paw .   um    and even when the light has gone out  we know the shadows are still around   it said .   dangerous beans turned towards the young rat .   you re  .   he said .    delicious   said the younger rat .    well  delicious   said dangerous beans  in a kindly voice   being afraid of shadows is all part of us becoming more intelligent  i think .  your mind is working out that there s a you  and there s also everything outside you .  so now you re not just frightened of things that you can see and hear and smell  but also of things that you can    sort of    see inside your head .  learning to face the shadows outside helps us to fight the shadows inside .  and you can control all the darkness .  it s a big step forward .  well done .    delicious looked slightly proud  but mostly nervous .    i don t see the point  myself   said hamnpork .   we used to do all right on the dump .  i was never scared of anything .     we were prey to every stray cat and hungry dog  sir   said dangerous beans .    oh  well  if we re going to talk about cats   growled hamnpork .    i think we can trust maurice  sir   said dangerous beans .   perhaps not when it comes to money  i admit .  but he is very good at not eating people who talk  you know .  he checks  every time .     you can trust a cat to be a cat   said hamnpork .   talking or not .     yes  sir .  but we are different  and so is he .  i believe he is a decent cat at heart .     ahem .  that remains to be seen   said peaches .   but now we are here  let s get organized .    hamnpork growled .   who are you to say  let s get organized  .   he said sharply .   are you the leader  young female who refuses to rllk with me .  no .  i am the leader .  it s my job to say  let s get organized  .     yes  sir   said peaches  crouching low .   how would you like us to be organized  sir .    hamnpork stared at her .  he looked at the waiting rats  with their packs and bundles  and then around at the ancient cellar  and then back to the still crouching peaches .   just    get organized   he muttered .   don t bother me with details .  i am the leader .   and he stalked off into the shadows .   when he d gone  peaches and dangerous beans looked around the cellar  which was filled with trembling shadows created by the candlelight .  a trickle of water ran down one crusted wall .  here and there stones had fallen out  leaving inviting holes .  earth covered the floor  and there were no human footprints in it .    an ideal base   said dangerous beans .   it smells secret and safe .  a perfect place for rats .     right   said a voice .   and you know what s worrying me about that .    the rat called darktan stepped into the candlelight  and hitched up one of his belts of tools .  a lot of the watching rats suddenly paid attention .  people listened to hamnpork because he was the leader  but they listened to darktan because he was often telling you things that you really  really needed to know if you wanted to go on living .  he was big  and lean  and tough  and spent most of his time taking traps apart to see how they worked .    what is worrying you  darktan .   asked dangerous beans .    there aren t any rats here .  except us .  rat tunnels  yes .  but we ve seen no rats .  no rats at all .  a town like this should be full of them .     oh  they re probably scared of us   said peaches .   darktan tapped the side of his scarred muzzle .   maybe   he said .   but things don t smell right .  thinking is a great invention  but we were given noses and it pays to listen to them .  be extra careful .   he turned to the assembled rats and raised his voice .   ok  people .  you know the drill .   he shouted .   in front of me  in your platoons  now .    it didn t take long for the rats to form three groups .  they d had plenty of practice .    very nice   said darktan  as the last few shuffled into position .   right .  this is tricky territory  troops  so we re going to be careful      darktan was unusual among the rats because he wore things .   when the rats had discovered books   and the whole idea of books was still a difficult one for most of the older ones   they found  in the bookshop they invaded every night  the book .   this book was amazing .   even before peaches and donut enter had learned how to read human words  they d been amazed by the pictures .   there were animals in there wearing clothes .  there was a rabbit who walked on its hind legs and wore a blue suit .  there was a rat in a hat  and he wore a sword and a big red waistcoat  complete with a watch on a chain .  even the snake had a collar and tie .  and all of them talked and none of them ate any of the others and   and this was the unbelievable part   they all talked to humans  who treated them like  well  smaller humans .  there were no traps  no poisons .  admittedly  according to peaches  who was painstakingly working her way through the book  and sometimes read out parts  oily the snake was a bit of a rascal  but nothing truly bad happened .  even when the rabbit got lost in the dark wood he just had a bit of a scare .   yes  mr bunnsy has an adventure was the cause of much discussion amongst the changelings .  what was it for .  was it  as dangerous beans believed  a vision of some bright future .  had it been made by humans .  the shop had been for humans  true  but surely even humans wouldn t make a book about ratty rupert the rat  who wore a hat  and poison rats under the floorboards at the same time .  would they .  how mad would anything have to be to think like that .   some of the younger rats had suggested that perhaps clothes were more important than everyone thought .  they d tried wearing waistcoats  but it had been very difficult to bite out the pattern  they couldn t make the buttons work and  frankly  the things got caught on every splinter and were very hard to run in .  hats just fell off .   darktan just thought that humans were mad  as well as bad .  but the pictures in the book had given him an idea .  what he wore was not so much a waistcoat as a network of wide belts  easy to wriggle in and out of .  on them he d sewn pockets   and that had been a good idea  like giving yourself extra paws   to hold all the things he needed  like metal rods and bits of wire .  some of the rest of the squad had taken up the idea  too .  you never knew what you were going to need next  on the trap disposal squad .  it was a tough  ratty life .   the rods and wires jangled as darktan walked up and down in front of his teams .  he stopped in front of one large group of younger rats .   all right  number three platoon  you re on widdling duty   he said .   go and have a good drink .     oooh  we re always on widdling   a rat complained .   darktan pounced on it and faced it nose to nose  until it backed away .   that s  cos you re good at it  my lad .  your mother raised you to be a widdler  so off you go and do what comes naturally .  nothing puts humans off like seeing that rats have been there before  if you catch my meaning .  and if you get the opportunity  do some gnawing as well .  and run around under the floorboards and squeak .  and remember  no one is to move in until they get the all clear from the trap squad .  to the water  now  at the double .  hup .  hup .  hup .  one two  one two  one two .    the platoon headed off  at speed .   darktan turned to number two platoon .  they were some of the older rats  scarred and bitten and ragged  some of them with stubs of tails or no tails at all  some of them missing a paw or an ear or an eye .  in fact although there were about twenty of them  they had between them only enough bits to make up about seventeen complete rats .   but because they were old they were cunning  because a rat who isn t cunning and shifty and suspicious doesn t become an old rat .  they d all been grown up when the intelligence came .  they were more set in their old ways .  hamnpork always said he liked them that way .  they still had a lot of basic rattiness  the kind of raw cunning that would get you out of the traps that over excited intelligence got you into .  they thought with their noses .  and you didn t have to tell them where to widdle .    all right  people  you know the drill   said darktan .   i want to see lots of cheeky stuff .  stealing the food out of cats  bowls  pies from under the cooks  noses       false teeth from out of old men s mouths   said a small rat  who seemed to be dancing on the spot while he stood there .  his feet moved all the time  tippity tapping on the cellar floor .  he wore a hat  too  a battered  home made thing out of straw .  he was the only rat who could make a hat work  by wedging his ears through it .  he said to get ahead  you had to get a hat .    that was a fluke  sardines .  i bet you can t do it again   said darktan  grinning .   and don t keep on telling the kids how you went for a swim in someone s bathtub .  yeah  i know you did  but i don t want to lose anyone who can t scramble out of a slippery tub .  anyway    if i don t hear ladies screaming and running out of their kitchens within ten minutes i ll know you re not the rats i think you are .  well .  why are you all standing around .  get on with it .  and    sardines .     yes  boss .     easy on the tap dancing this time  all right .     i just got these dancing feet  boss .     and do you have to keep wearing that stupid hat .   darktan continued  grinning again .    yes  boss .   sardines was one of the older rats  but most of the time you wouldn t know it .  he danced and joked and never got into fights .  he d lived in a theatre and once ate a whole box of greasepaint .  it seemed to have got into his blood .    and no going on ahead of the trap squad .   said darktan .   sardines grinned .   aw  boss  can t i have any fun .   he danced after the rest of them  towards the holes in the walls .   darktan moved on  to number one platoon .  it was the smallest .  you had to be a certain kind of rat to last a long time in the trap disposal squad .  you had to be slow  and patient  and thorough .  you had to have a good memory .  you had to be careful .  you could join the squad if you were fast and slapdash and hasty .  you just didn t last very long .   he looked them up and down  and smiled .  he was proud of these rats .   ok  people  you know it all by now   he said .   you don t need a long lecture from me .  just remember that this is a new town so we don t know what we re going to find .  there re bound to be plenty of new types of traps  but we learn fast  don t we .  poisons  too .  they might be using stuff we ve never run across before  so be careful .  never rush  never run .  we don t want to be like the first mouse  eh .     no  darktan   the rats chorused dutifully .    i said  what mouse don t we want to be like .   darktan demanded .    we don t want to be like the first mouse .   shouted the rats .    right .  what mouse do we want to be like .     the second mouse  darktan .   said the rats  who d had this lesson dinned into them many times .    right .  and why do we want to be like the second mouse .     because the second mouse gets the cheese  darktan .     good .   said darktan .   inbrine will take squad two    bestbefore .  you re promoted  you take squad three  and i hope you re as good as old farmhouse was right up until the time she forgot how to disengage the trip catch on a snippet and poison ratsnapper number   .  over confidence is our enemy .  so if you see anything suspicious  any little trays you don t recognize  anything with wires and springs and stuff  you mark it and send a runner to me yes .    a young rat was holding up its paw .    yes .  what s your name    miss .     er    nourishing  sir   said the rat .   er    can i ask a question  sir .     are you new in this platoon  nourishing .   said darktan .    yes  sir .  transferred out of the light widdlers  sir .     ah  they thought you d be good at trap disposal  did they .    nourishing looked uneasy  but there was no going back now .   er    not really  sir .  they said i couldn t be any worse than i am at widdling  sir .    there was general laughter from the ranks .    how can a rat not be good at that .   said darktan .    it s just so    so    so embarrassing  sir   said nourishing .   darktan sighed to himself .  all this new thinking was producing some strange things .  he personally approved of the idea of the right place  but some of the ideas the kids were coming up with were    odd .    all right   he said .   what was your question  nourishing .     er    you said the second mouse gets the cheese  sir .     that s right .  that s the squad motto  nourishing .  remember it .  it is your friend .     yes  sir .  i will  sir .  but    doesn t the first mouse get something  sir .    darktan stared at the young rat .  he was slightly impressed that she stared back  instead of cringing .   i can see you re going to be a valuable addition to the squad  nourishing   he said .  he raised his voice .   squad .  what does the first mouse get .    the roar of voices made dust fall down from the ceiling .   the trap .     and don t you forget it   said darktan .   take  em out  specialoffer .  i ll be with you in a minute .    a younger rat stepped forward  and faced the squads .   let s go  rats .  hut  hut  hut      the trap squads trotted away .  darktan walked over to dangerous beans .    that s got us started   he said .   if we can t get the humans looking for a good rat catcher by tomorrow  we don t know our business .     we need to stay longer than that   said peaches .   some of the ladies are going to have their babies .     i said we don t know it s safe here yet   said darktan .    do you want to be the one to tell big savings .   said peaches  sweetly .  big savings was the old head female  widely agreed to have a bite like a pick axe and muscles like rock .  she also had a short temper with males .  even hamnpork kept out of her way when she was in a bad mood .    nature has to take its course  obviously   said darktan  quickly .   but we haven t explored .  there must be other rats here .     oh  the keekees all keep out of the way of us   said peaches .   that was true  darktan had to agree .  ordinary rats did keep out of the way of the changelings .  oh  there was some trouble sometimes  but the changelings were big and healthy and could think their way through a fight .  dangerous beans was unhappy about this but  as hamnpork said  it was either us or them and when you got right down to it  it was a rat eat rat world      i m going to go and join my squad   said darktan  still unnerved at the thought of confronting big savings .  he moved closer .   what s up with hamnpork .     he s    thinking about things   said peaches .    thinking   said darktan  blankly .   oh .  right .  well  i ve got traps to see to .  smell you later .     what is the matter with hamnpork .   said dangerous beans  when he and peaches were alone again .    he s getting old   said peaches .   he needs to rest a lot .  and i think he s worried that darktan or one of the others is going to challenge him .     will they  do you think .     darktan s more wrapped up in breaking traps and testing poisons .  there s more interesting things to do now than bite one another .     or do rllk  from what i hear   said dangerous beans .   peaches looked down  demurely .  if rats could blush  she would have done .  it was amazing how pink eyes that could hardly see you could look straight through you at the same time .   the ladies are a lot more choosy   she said .   they want to find fathers who can think .     good   said dangerous beans .   we must be careful .  we don t need to breed like rats .  we don t have to rely on numbers .  we are the changelings .    peaches watched him anxiously .  when dangerous beans was thinking  he seemed to be staring into a world only he could see .   what is it this time .   she asked .    i have been thinking that we shouldn t kill other rats .  no rat should kill another rat .     even keekees .   she queried .    they are rats too .    peaches shrugged .   well  we ve tried talking to them and that didn t work .  anyway  they mostly stay away these days .    dangerous beans was still staring at the unseen world .   even so   he said quietly   i should like you to write it down .    peaches sighed  but went off anyway to one of the packs the rats had carried in and pulled out her bag .  it was no more than a roll of cloth with a handle made from a scrap of string  but it was big enough to hold a few matches  some pieces of pencil lead  a tiny sliver of a broken knife blade for sharpening the leads  and a grubby piece of paper .  all the important things .   she was also the official carrier of mr bunnsy .   carrier  wasn t quite correct  dragger  was mostly more accurate .  but dangerous beans always liked to know where it was and seemed to think better when it was around  and it gave him some comfort  and that was good enough for peaches .   she smoothed out the paper on an ancient brick  picked up a piece of lead and looked down the list .   the first thought had been  in the clan is strength .   this had been quite a hard one to translate  but she had made an effort .  most rats couldn t read human .  it was just too hard to make the lines and squiggles turn into any sense .  so peaches had worked very hard on making a language that rats could read .   she d tried to draw a big rat made up of little rats     the writing had led to trouble with hamnpork .  new ideas needed a running jump to get into the old rat s head .  dangerous beans had explained in his strange calm voice that writing things down would mean that a rat s knowledge would go on existing even when the rat had died .  he said that all the rats could learn the knowledge of hamnpork .  hamnpork had said  not likely .  it d had taken him years to learn some of the tricks he d learned .  why should he give it all away .  that d mean any young rat would know as much as him .   dangerous beans had said  we co operate  or we die .     that had become the next thought .   co operate  had been difficult  but even keekees would sometimes lead a blind or wounded comrade  and that was certainly cooperation .  the thick line  where she d pressed heavily  had to mean  no  .  the trap sign could mean die  or  bad  or  avoid  .   the last thought on the paper was  not to widdle where you eat .  that one was quite simple .     she grasped the piece of lead in both paws and carefully drew  no rat to kill another rat .     she sat back .  yes    not bad    trap  was a good sign for death  and she d added the dead rat to make it all more serious .    but supposing you have to .   she said  still staring at the drawings .    then you have to   said dangerous beans .   but you shouldn t .    peaches shook her head sadly .  she supported dangerous beans because there was    well  something about him .  he wasn t big or fast and he was almost blind and quite weak and sometimes he forgot to eat because he came up with thoughts that nobody at least  nobody who was a rat had thought before .  most of them had annoyed hamnpork no end  like the time when dangerous beans had said   what is a rat .   and hamnpork had replied  teeth .  claws .  tail .  run .  hide .  eat .  that s what a rat is .    dangerous beans had said   but now we can also say  what is a rat .    he said .   and that means we re more than that .     we re rats   hamnpork had argued .   we run around and squeak and steal and make more rats .  that s what we re made for .     who by .   dangerous beans had said  and that had led to another argument about the big rat deep under the ground theory .   but even hamnpork followed dangerous beans  and so did rats like darktan and donut enter  and they listened when he talked .   peaches listened when they talked .   we were given noses   darktan had told the squads .  who had given them noses .  the thoughts of dangerous beans worked their ways into other people s heads without them noticing .   he came up with new ways of thinking .  he came up with new words .  he came up with ways of understanding the things that were happening to them .  big rats  rats with scars  listened to the little rat because the change had led them into dark territory and he seemed to be the only one with an idea of where they were going .   she left him sitting by the candle and went and looked for hamnpork .  he was sitting by a wall .  like most of the old rats he always stuck close to walls  and kept away from open spaces and too much light .   he seemed to be shaking .    are you all right .   she said .   the shaking stopped .   fine  fine  nothing wrong with me .   snapped hamnpork .   just a few twinges  nothing permanent .     only i noticed you didn t go out with any of the squads   said peaches .    there s nothing wrong with me .   shouted the old rat .    we ve still got some potatoes in the baggage     i don t want any food  .  there is nothing wrong with me .        which meant that there was .  it was the reason he didn t want to share all the things he knew .  what he knew was all he had left .  peaches knew what rats traditionally did to leaders who were too old .  she d watched hamnpork s face when darktan younger  stronger darktan had been talking to his squads  and knew that hamnpork was thinking about it  too .  oh  he was fine when people were watching him  but lately he d been resting more  and skulking in corners .   old rats were driven out  to lurk around by themselves and go rotten and funny in the head .  soon there would be another leader .   peaches wished she could make him understand one of the thoughts of dangerous beans  but the old rat didn t much like talking to females .  he d grown up thinking females weren t for talking to .   the thought was     it meant  we are the changelings .  we are not like other rats .       chapter     the important thing about adventures  thought mr bunnsy  was that they shouldn t be so long as to make you miss mealtimes .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    the kid and the girl and maurice were in a large kitchen .  the kid could tell it was a kitchen because of the huge black iron range in the chimney breast and the pans hanging on the walls and the long scarred table .  what it didn t seem to have was what a kitchen traditionally had  which was food .   the girl went to a metal box in the corner and fumbled round her neck for a string which  it turned out  held a large key .   you can t trust anybody   she said .   and the rats steal a hundred times what they eat  the devils .     i don t think they do   said the kid .   ten times  at most .     you know all about rats all of a sudden .   said the girl  unlocking the metal case .    not all of a sudden  i learned it when ow .  that really hurt .     sorry about that   said maurice .   i accidentally scratched you  did i .   he tried to make a face which said don t be a complete twerp  ok .  which is quite hard to do with a cat s head .   the girl gave him a suspicious look  and then turned back to the metal box .   there s some milk that s not gone hard yet and a couple of fish heads   she said  peering inside .    sounds good to me   said maurice .    what about your human .     him .  he ll eat any old scraps .     there s bread and sausage   said the girl  taking a can from the metal cupboard .   we re all very suspicious about the sausages .  there s a tiny bit of cheese  too  but it s rather ancestral .     i don t think we should eat your food if it s so short   said the kid .   we have got money .     oh  my father says it d reflect very badly on the town if we weren t hospitable .  he s the mayor  you know .     he s the government .   said the kid .   the girl stared at him .   i suppose so   she said .   funny way of putting it .  the town council makes the laws  really .  he just runs the place and argues with everyone .  and he says we shouldn t have any more rations than other people  to show solidarity in these difficult times .  it was bad enough that tourists stopped visiting our hot baths  but the rats have made it a lot worse .   she took a couple of saucers from the big kitchen dresser .   my father says that if we re all sensible there will be enough to go around   she went on .   which i think is very commendable .  i entirely agree .  but i think that once you ve shown solidarity  you should be allowed just a little extra .  in fact  i think we get a bit less than everyone else .  can you imagine .  anyway    so you really are a magical cat  then .   she finished  pouring the milk into a saucer .  it oozed rather than gushed  but maurice was a street cat and would drink milk so rotten that it would try to crawl away .    oh  yes  that s right  magical   he said  with a yellow white ring around his mouth .  for two fish heads he d be anything for anybody .    probably belonged to a witch  i expect  with a name like griselda or one of those names   said the girl  putting the fish heads on another saucer .    yeah  right  griselda  right   said maurice  not raising his head .    who lived in a gingerbread cottage in the forest  probably .     yeah  right   said maurice .  and then  because he wouldn t be maurice if he couldn t be a bit inventive  he added   only it was a crispbread cottage   cos she was slimming .  very healthy witch  griselda .    the girl looked puzzled for a moment .   that s not how it should go   she said .    sorry  i tell a lie  it was gingerbread really   said maurice quickly .  someone giving you food was always correct .    and she had big warts  i m sure .     miss   said maurice  trying to look sincere  some of those warts had so much personality they used to have friends of their own .  er    what s your name  miss .     promise not to laugh .     all right .   after all  there might be more fish heads .    it s    malicia .     oh .     are you laughing .   she said  in a threatening voice .    no   said maurice  mystified .   why should i .     you don t think it s a funny name .    maurice thought about the names he knew hamnpork  dangerous beans  darktan  sardines     sounds like an ordinary kind of name to me   he said .   malicia gave him another suspicious look  but turned her attention to the kid  who was sitting with the usual happy  faraway smile he wore when he didn t have anything else to do .   and have you got a name .   she said .   you re not the third and youngest son of a king  are you .  if your name starts  prince  that s a definite clue .    the kid said   i think it s keith .     you never said you had a name .   said maurice .    no one ever asked before   said the kid .    keith is not a promising name start   said malicia .   it doesn t hint of mystery .  it just hints of keith .  are you sure it s your real name .     it s just the one they gave me .     ah  that s more like it .  a slight hint of mystery   said malicia  suddenly looking interested .   just enough to up suspense .  you were stolen away at birth  i expect .  you probably are the rightful king of some country  but they found someone who looked like you and did a swap .  in that case  you ll have a magic sword  only it won t look magic  you see  until it s time for you to manifest your destiny .  you were probably found on a doorstep .     i was  yes   said keith .    see .  i m always right .    maurice was always on the lookout for what people wanted .  and what malicia wanted  he felt  was a gag .  but he d never heard the stupid looking kid talk about himself before .    what were you doing on a doorstep .   he said .    i don t know .  gurgling  i expect   said keith .    you never said   said maurice  accusingly .    is it important .   said keith .    there was a magic sword or a crown in the basket with you  probably .  and you ve got a mysterious tattoo or a strange shaped birthmark  too   said malicia .    i don t think so .  no one ever mentioned them   said keith .   there was just me and a blanket .  and a note .     a note .  but that s important .     it said     pints and a strawberry yoghurt    said keith .    ah .  not helpful  then   said malicia .   why nineteen pints of milk .     it was the guild of musicians   said keith .   quite a large place .  i don t know about the strawberry yoghurt .     abandoned orphan is good   said malicia .   after all  a prince can only grow up to be a king but a mysterious orphan could be anybody .  were you beaten and starved and locked in a cellar .     i don t think so   said keith  giving her a funny look .   everyone at the guild was very kind .  they were mostly nice people .  they taught me a lot .     we ve got guilds here   said malicia .   they teach boys to be carpenters and stonemasons and things like that .     the guild taught me music   said keith .   i m a musician .  i m good at it  too .  i ve been earning my own living since i was six .     aha .  mysterious orphan  strange talent  distressed upbringing    it s all shaping up   said malicia .   the strawberry yoghurt is probably not important .  would your life have been different if it had been banana flavoured .  who can say .  what kinds of music do you play .     kinds .  there aren t any kinds .  there s just music   said keith .   there s always music  if you listen .    malicia looked at maurice .   is he always like this .   she demanded .    this is the most i ve ever heard him say   said the cat .    i expect you re very keen to know all about me   said malicia .   i expect you re just too polite to ask .     gosh  yes   said maurice .    well  you probably won t be surprised to know that i ve got two dreadful step sisters   said malicia .   and i have to do all the chores .     gosh  really   said maurice  wondering if there were any more fish heads and  if there were any more fish heads  whether they were worth all this .    well  most of the chores   said malicia  as if revealing an unfortunate fact .   some of them  definitely .  i have to clean up my own room  you know .  and it s extremely untidy .     gosh  really .     and it s very nearly the smallest bedroom .  there re practically no cupboards and i m running out of bookshelf space .     gosh  really .     and people are incredibly cruel to me .  you will note that we re here in a kitchen .  and i m the mayor s daughter .  should the daughter of a mayor be expected to wash up at least once a week .  i think not .     gosh  really .     and will you just look at these torn and bedraggled clothes i have to wear .    maurice looked .  he wasn t good on clothes .  fur was enough for him .  as far as he could tell  malicia s dress was pretty much like any other dress .  it seemed to be all there .  there weren t any holes  except where the arms and head poked through .    here  just here   said malicia  pointing to a place on the hem which  to maurice  looked no different from the rest of the dress .   i had to sew that back myself  you know .     gosh  re   maurice stopped .  from here he could see the bare shelves .  more importantly  he could see sardines abseiling down from a crack in the ancient ceiling .  he had a knapsack on his back .    and on top of this i m the one who has to queue for the bread and sausages every day   malicia continued  but maurice was listening even less than he had been before .   it had to be sardines  he thought .  idiot .  he always goes ahead of the trap squad .  of all the kitchens in all the town he could turn up in  he s turned up in this one .  any minute she s going to turn round and scream .   sardines would probably treat it as applause  too .  he lived life as if it was a performance .  other rats just ran around squeaking and messing up things  and that was quite good enough to convince humans there was a plague .  but  oh  no  sardines always had to go further .  sardines and his yowoorll song and dance act .     and the rats take everything   malicia was saying .   what they don t take  they spoil .  it s been terrible .  the council have been buying in food from other towns  but no one has very much to spare .  we have to buy corn and stuff from the traders that sail up the river .  that s why bread is so expensive .     expensive  eh .   said maurice .    we ve tried traps and dogs and cats and poison and still the rats keep coming   said the girl .   they ve learned to be really sneaky  too .  they hardly ever end up in our traps any more .  huh .  i only ever got   p for one tail .  what s the good of the rat catchers offering us   p a tail if the rats are so cunning .  the rat catchers have to use all kinds of tricks to get them  they say .   behind her  sardines looked carefully around the room and then signalled to the rats in the ceiling to pull the rope up .    don t you think this would be a good time to go away .   said maurice .    why are you making faces like that .   said malicia  staring at him .    oh    well  you know that kind of cat that grins all time .  heard of that .  well  i m the kind that makes  you know  weird faces   said maurice desperately .   and sometimes i just burst out and say things get away get away  see  i did it again .  it is an affliction .  i probably need counselling oh no don t do that this is not the time to do that whoops  there i go again      sardines had pulled his straw hat out of his knapsack .  he was holding a small walking stick .   it was a good routine  even maurice had to admit .  some towns had advertised for a rat piper the very first time he d done it .  people could tolerate rats in the cream  and rats in the roof  and rats in the teapot  but they drew the line at tap dancing .  if you saw tap dancing rats  you were in big trouble .  maurice had reckoned that if only the rats could play an accordion as well they could do two towns a day .   he d stared for too long .  malicia turned and her mouth opened in shock and horror as sardines went into his routine .  the cat saw her hand reach out for a pan that was on the table .  she threw it  very accurately .   but sardines was a good pot dodger .  the rats were used to having things thrown at them .  he was already running when the pan was halfway across the room  and then he leapt onto the chair and then he jumped onto the floor and then he dodged behind the dresser and then there was a sharp  final  metallic    snap .    hah .   said malicia  and maurice and keith stared at the dresser .   that s one rat less  at any rate .  i really hate them       it was sardines   said keith .    no  it was definitely a rat   said malicia .   sardines hardly ever invade a kitchen .  i expect you re thinking about the plague of lobsters over in     he just called himself sardines because he saw the name on a rusty old tin and thought it sounded stylish   said maurice .  he wondered if he dared look behind the dresser .    he was a good rat   said keith .   he used to steal books for me when they were teaching me to read .     excuse me  are you mad .   said malicia .   it was a rat .  the only good rat is a dead rat .     hello .   said a little voice .  it came from behind the dresser .    it can t be alive .  it s a huge trap .   said malicia .   it s got teeth .     anyone there .  only the stick is bending     said the voice .   the dresser was massive  the wood so old that time had turned it black and it had become as solid and heavy as stone .    that s not a rat talking  is it .   said malicia .   please tell me rats can t talk .     in fact it s bending quite a bit now   said the voice  which was slightly muffled .   maurice squinted into the space behind the dresser .   i can see him   he said .   he wedged the stick in the jaws as they closed .  wotcha  sardines  how re you doing .     fine  boss   said sardines  in the gloom .   if it wasn t for this trap i d say everything was perfect .  did i mention the stick is bending .     yes  you said .     it s bent some more since then  boss .    keith grabbed one end of the dresser and grunted as he tried to move it .   it s like a rock .   he said .    it s full of crockery   said malicia  now quite bewildered .   but rats don t really talk  do they .     get out of the way .   shouted keith .  he grabbed the back edge of the dresser with both hands  and braced one foot against the wall  and heaved .   slowly  like a mighty forest tree  the dresser pitched forward .  the crockery started to fall out as it tipped  plate slipping off plate like one glorious chaotic deal from a very expensive pack of cards .  even so  some of them survived the fall onto the floor  and so did some of the cups and saucers as the cupboard opened and added to the fun  but that didn t make any difference because then the huge  heavy woodwork thundered down on top of them .   one miraculously whole plate rolled past keith  spinning round and round and getting lower on the floor with the groiyuoiyoiyooooinnnnggg sound you always get in these distressing circumstances .   keith reached down to the trap and grabbed sardines .  as he pulled the rat up the stick gave way and the trap snapped shut .  a bit of the stick spun away through the air .    are you all right .   keith asked .    well  boss  all i can say is it s a good job rats don t wear underwear    thanks  boss   said sardines .  he was quite plump for a rat  but when his feet were dancing he could float across the floor like a balloon .   there was the sound of a tapping foot .   malicia  with arms folded and an expression like a thunderstorm  looked at sardines  and then at maurice  and then at the stupid looking keith  and then at the wreckage on the floor .    er    sorry about the mess   said keith .   but he was    she waved this away .   ok   she said  as if she d been thinking deeply .   it goes like this  i think .  the rat is a magical rat .  i bet he s not the only one .  something happened to him  or them  and now they re really quite intelligent  despite the tap dancing .  and    they re friends with the cat .  so    why would rats and a cat be friends .  and it goes    there s some kind of an arrangement  right .  i know .  don t tell me  don t tell me       huh .   said keith .    i shouldn t think anyone ever has to tell you anything   said maurice .        it s something to do with plagues of rats  right .  all those towns we ve heard about    well  you heard about them too  and so you got together with thingy here     keith   said keith .        yes    and so you go from town to town pretending to be a plague of rats  and thingy     keith .         yes    pretends to be a rat piper and you all follow him out .  right .  it s all a big swindle  yes .    sardines looked up at maurice .   she s got us bang to rights  boss   he said .    so now you ve got to give me a good reason why i don t call the watch out on you   said malicia triumphantly .   i don t have to  maurice thought  because you won t .  gosh  humans are so easy .  he rubbed up against malicia s legs and gave her a smirk .   if you do  you ll never find out how the story ends   he said .    ah  it ll end with you going to prison   said malicia  but maurice saw her staring at the stupid looking keith and at sardines .  sardines still had his little straw hat on .  when it comes to attracting attention  that sort of thing counts for a lot .   when he saw her frowning at him sardines hastily removed his straw hat and held it in front of him  by the brim .   there s something i d like to find out  boss   he said   if we re finding out things .    malicia raised an eyebrow .   well .   she said .   and don t call me boss .     i d like to find out why there s no rats in this city  guv   said sardines .  he tap danced a few steps  nervously .  malicia could glare better than a cat .    what do you mean  no rats .   she said .   there s a plague of rats .  and you re a rat  anyway .     there s rat runs all over the place and there s a few dead rats but we haven t found a living rat anywhere  guv .    malicia leaned down .   but you are a rat   she said .    yes  guv .  but we only arrived this morning .   sardines grinned nervously as malicia gave him another long stare .    would you like some cheese .   she said .   i m afraid it s only mousetrap .     i don t think so  thank you very much all the same   said sardines  very carefully and politely .    it s no use  i think it really is time to tell the truth   said keith .    nonononononono   said maurice  who hated that kind of thing .   it s all because     you were right  miss   said keith  wearily .   we go from town to town with a bunch of rats and fool people into giving us money to leave .  that s what we do .  i m sorry we ve been doing it .  this was going to be the last time .  i m very sorry .  you shared your food with us and you haven t got much  either .  we ought to be ashamed .    it seemed to maurice  while he was watching malicia make up her mind  that her mind worked in a different way to other people s minds .  she understood all the hard things without even thinking .  magical rats .  yeah  yeah .  talking cats .  been there  done that  bought the singlet .  it was the simple things that were hard .   her lips were moving .  she was  maurice realized  making up a story out of it .    so     she said   you come along with your trained rats     we prefer  educated rodents   guv   said sardines .     all right  your educated rodents  and you move into a city  and    what happens to the rats that are there already .    sardines looked helplessly at maurice .  maurice nodded at him to keep on .  they were all going to be in big trouble if malicia didn t make up a story she liked .    they keep out of our way  boss  i mean guv   said sardines .    can they talk too .     no  guv .     i think the clan think of them as a bit like monkeys   said keith .    i was talking to sardines   said malicia .    sorry   said keith .    and there re no other rats here at all .   malicia went on .    no  guv .  a few old skeletons and some piles of poisons and lots of traps  boss .  but no rats  boss .     but the rat catchers nail up a load of rat tails every day .     i speak as i find  boss .  guv .  no rats  boss .  guv .  no other rats anywhere we ve been  boss guv .     have you ever looked at the rat tails  miss .   said maurice .    what do you mean .   said malicia .    they re fake   said maurice .   some of them  anyway .  they re just old leather bootlaces .  i saw some in the street .     they weren t real tails .   said keith .    i m a cat .  you think i don t know what rats  tails look like .     surely people would notice .   said malicia .    yeah .   said maurice .   do you know what an aglet is .     aglet .  aglet .  what s an aglet got to do with anything .   snapped malicia .    it s those little metal bits on the end of shoelaces   said maurice .    how come a cat knows a word like that .   said the girl .    everyone s got to know something   said maurice .   have you ever looked closely at the rat tails .     of course not .  you can get the plague from rats .   said malicia .    that s right  your legs explode   said maurice  grinning .   that s why you didn t see the aglets .  your leg exploded lately  sardines .     not today  boss   said sardines .   mind you  it s not even lunchtime yet .    malicia looked pleased .   ah ha   she said  and it seemed to maurice that the  ha  had a very nasty edge to it .    so    you re not going to tell the watch about us .   he ventured  hopefully .    what  that i ve been talking to a rat and a cat .   said malicia .   of course not .  they ll tell my father i ve been telling stories and i ll get locked out of my room again .     you get locked out of your room as a punishment .   said maurice .    yes .  it means i can t get at my books .  i m rather a special person  as you may have guessed   said malicia  proudly .   haven t you heard of the sisters grim .  agoniza and eviscera grim .  they were my grandmother and my great aunt .  they wrote    fairy tales .    ah  so we re temporarily out of trouble here  thought maurice .  best to keep her talking .   i m not a big reader  as cats go   he said .   so what were these  then .  stories about little people with wings going tinkle tinkle .     no   said malicia .   they were not big on tinkling little people .  they wrote    real fairy tales .  ones with lots of blood and bones and bats and rats in .  i ve inherited the story telling talent   she added .    i kind of thought you had   said maurice .    and if there s no rats under the town but the ratcatchers are nailing up bootlaces  i smell a rat   said malicia .    sorry   said sardines   i think that was me .  i m a bit nervous    there were sounds from upstairs .    quick  go out across the back yard .   malicia commanded .   get up into the hayloft over the stables .  i ll bring you some food .  i know exactly how this sort of thing goes .        chapter     ratty rupert was the bravest rat that ever was .  everyone in furry bottom said so .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    darktan was in a tunnel several streets away  hanging from four bits of string attached to his harness .  they were tied onto a stick which had been balanced like a seesaw on the back of a very fat rat  two other rats were sitting on the other end  and several other rats were steering it .   darktan was hanging just above the teeth of the big steel trap that completely filled the tunnel .   he squeaked the signal to stop .  the stick vibrated a little under his weight .   i m right over the cheese   he said .   smells like lancre blue vein  extra tasty .  not touched .  pretty old  too .  move me in about two paws .           the stick bounced up and down as he was pushed forward .    careful  sir   said one of the younger rats who crowded the tunnel behind the trap disposal squad .   darktan grunted  and looked down at the teeth  an inch away from his nose .  he pulled a short piece of wood out of one of his belts  a tiny sliver of mirror had been glued to one end of it .    you lot move the candle this way a bit   he commanded .   that s right .  that s right .  let s see  now     he pushed the mirror past the teeth and turned it gently .   ah  just as i thought    it s a prattle and johnson little snapper  sure enough .  one of the old mk .  threes  but with the extra safety catch .  that s come a long way .  ok .  we know about these  don t we .  cheese for tea  lads .    there was nervous laughter from the watchers  but a voice said   oh  they re easy       who said that .   said darktan sharply .   there was silence .  darktan craned his head back .  the young rats had carefully moved aside  leaving one looking very  very alone .    ah  nourishing   said darktan  turning back to the trap s trigger mechanism .   easy  is it .  glad to hear it .  you can show us how it s done  then .     er  when i said easy     nourishing began .   i mean  inbrine showed me on the practice trap and he said     no need to be modest   said darktan  a gleam in his eye .   it s all ready .  i ll just watch  shall i .  you can get into the harness and do it  can you .      but  but  but  i couldn t see too well when he showed us  now i come to think about it  and  and  and     i ll tell you what   said darktan   i ll work on the trap  shall i .    nourishing looked very relieved .    and you can tell me exactly what to do   darktan added .    er     nourishing began .  now she looked like a rat prepared to rejoin the widdling squad really quickly .    jolly good   said darktan .  he carefully put his mirror away and pulled a length of metal out of his harness .  he prodded the trap carefully .  nourishing shuddered at the sound of metal on metal .   now  where was i    oh  yes  here s a bar and a little spring and a catch .  what shall i do now  miss nourishing .     er  er  er   nourishing stuttered .    things are creaking here  miss nourishing   said darktan  from the depths of the trap .    er  er  you wedge the thingy       which one is the thingy  miss nourishing .  take your time  whoops  this bit of metal is wobbling but don t let me hurry you in any way       you wedge the  er  the thingy  er  the thingy    er     nourishing s eyes rolled wildly .    maybe it s this big snap argh argh argh      nourishing fainted .   darktan slipped out of the harness and dropped onto the trap .   all fixed   he said .   i ve clipped it firm  it won t off now .  you boys can drag it out of the way .   he walked back to the squad and dropped a lump of hairy cheese onto nourishing s quivering stomach .   it s very important in the trap business to be definite  you see .  you re definite or you re dead .  the second mouse gets the cheese .   darktan sniffed .   well  no human coming here would have any difficulty thinking there s rats around now      the other trainees laughed in the nervous  tittering way of people who ve seen someone else attract the teacher s attention and are glad it isn t them .   darktan unrolled a scrap of paper .  he was a rat of action  and the idea that the world could be pinned down in little signs worried him a bit .  but he could see how useful it was .  when he drew pictures of a tunnel layout the paper remembered .  it didn t get confused by new smells .  other rats  if they knew how to read  could see in their heads what the writer had seen .   he d invented maps .  it was a drawing of the world .    amazing stuff  this new technology   he said .   so    there s poison marked here  two tunnels back .  did you see to it  inbrine .     buried and widdled on   said inbrine  his deputy .   it was the grey no .    poison  too .     good rat   said darktan .   that s nasty eating .     there were dead keekees all round it .     i ll bet there were .  no antidote for that stuff .     we found trays of no .    and no .    too   said inbrine .   lots of them .     you can survive no .    poison if you re sensible   said darktan .   remember that  all of you .  and if you ever eat no .    poison  we ve got some stuff that ll sort you out .  i mean  you ll live in the end  but there ll be a day or two when you d wish you were dead     there s lots of poison  darktan   said inbrine  nervously .   more than i ve ever seen before .  rat bones all over the place .     important safety tip there  then   said darktan  setting off along a new tunnel .   don t eat a dead rat unless you know what they died of .  otherwise you ll die of it  too .     dangerous beans says he thinks we shouldn t eat rats at all   said inbrine .    yeah  well  maybe   said darktan   but out in the tunnels you have to be practical .  never let good food go to waste .  and someone wake up nourishing .     a lot of poison   said inbrine  as the squad moved on .   they must really hate rats here .    darktan didn t answer .  he could see the rats were already getting nervous .  there was a smell of fear in the rat runs .  they d never come across so much poison before .  darktan didn t usually worry about anything  and hated to feel the worry starting  deep in his bones  a small rat  out of breath  scurried up the tunnel and crouched in front of him .    kidney  sir  no .    heavy widdlers   it burst out .   we ve found a trap  sir .  not like the usual sort .  fresh walked right into it .  please come .    there was a lot of straw in the loft over the stables  and the heat of the horses coming up from below made it quite snug .   keith was lying on his back  staring at the ceiling and to himself .  maurice was watching his lunch  which was twitching its nose .   right up until the time he pounced  maurice looked like a sleek killing machine .  it all went wrong just before he jumped .  his rear rose  it waggled faster and faster from side to side  his tail slashed at the air like a snake  and then he dived forward  claws out    squeak .     ok  here s the deal   said maurice to the shivering ball in his claws .   you just have to say something .  anything .   let me go   maybe  or even  help .   squeak does not cut the mustard .  it s just a noise .  just ask  and i ll let you go .  no one can say i m not highly moral in that respect .     squeak .   screamed the mouse .    fair enough   said maurice  and killed it instantly .  he carried it back to the corner  where keith was now sitting in the straw and finishing a pickled beef sandwich .    it couldn t talk   said maurice  hurriedly .    i didn t ask you   said keith .    i mean  i gave it a chance   said maurice .   you heard me  right .  it only had to say it didn t want to be eaten .     good .     it s all right for you  i mean  it s not as though you have to speak to sandwiches   said maurice  as if he was still bothered about something .    i wouldn t know what to say to them   said keith .    and i d like to point out that i didn t play with it  either   said maurice .   one swipe with the ol  paw and it was  goodbye  that s all she wrote  except that obviously the mouse didn t write anything  not being intelligent in any way .     i believe you   said keith .    it never felt a thing   maurice went on .   there was a scream  from somewhere in a nearby street  and then the sound of crockery breaking .  there had been quite a lot of that in the last half hour .    sounds like the lads are still at work   said maurice  carrying the dead mouse behind a pile of hay .   nothing gets a good scream like sardines dancing across the table .    the stable doors opened .  a man came in  harnessed two of the horses  and led them out .  shortly afterwards  there was the sound of a coach leaving the yard .   a few seconds later  there were three loud knocks from below .  they were repeated .  and then they were repeated again .  finally  malicia s voice said   are you two up there or not .    keith crawled out of the hay and looked down .   yes   he said .    didn t you hear the secret knock .   said malicia  staring up at him in annoyance .    it didn t sound like a secret knock   said maurice  his mouth full .    is that maurice s voice .   said malicia suspiciously .    yes   said keith .   you ll have to excuse him  he s eating someone .    maurice swallowed quickly .   it s not someone .   he hissed .   it s not someone unless it can talk .  otherwise it s just food .     it is a secret knock .   malicia snapped .   i know about these things .  and you re supposed to give the secret knock in return .     but if it s just someone knocking on the door in  you know  general high spirits  and we knock back  what are they going to think is up here .   said maurice .   an extremely heavy beetle .    malicia went uncharacteristically silent for a moment .  then she said   good point  good point .  i know  i ll shout  it s me  malicia .   and then give the secret knock  and that way you ll know it s me and you can give the secret knock back .  ok .     why don t we just say  hello  we re up here  .  said keith innocently .   malicia sighed .   don t you have any sense of drama .  look  my father s gone off to the rathaus to see the other council members .  he said the crockery was the last straw .     the crockery .   said maurice .   you told him about sardines .     i had to say i d been frightened by a huge rat and tried to climb up the dresser to escape   said malicia .    you lied .     i just told a story   said malicia  calmly .   it was a good one  too .  it was much more true than the truth would sound .  a tap dancing rat .  anyway  he wasn t really interested because there s been a lot of complaints today .  your tame rats are really upsetting people .  i am gloating .     they re not our rats  they re their rats   said keith .    and they always work fast   said maurice proudly .   they don t mess about when it comes to    messing about .     one town we were in last month  the council advertised for a rat piper the very next morning   said keith .   that was sardines  big day .     my father shouted a lot and sent for blunkett and spears  too   said malicia .   they re the rat catchers .  and you know what that means  don t you .    maurice and keith looked at one another .   let s pretend we don t   said maurice .    it means we can break into their shed and solve the mystery of the bootlace tails .   said malicia .  she gave maurice a critical look .   of course  it would be more    satisfying if we were four children and a dog  which is the right number for an adventure  but we ll make do with what we ve got .     hey  we just steal from governments .   said maurice .    er  only governments who aren t people s fathers  obviously   said keith .    so .   said malicia  giving keith an odd look .    that s not the same as being criminals .   said maurice .    ah  but when we ve got the evidence  we can take it to the council and then it won t be criminal at all because we will be saving the day   said malicia  with weary patience .   of course  it may be that the council and the watch are in league with the rat catchers  so we shouldn t trust anyone .  really  haven t you people ever read a book .  it ll be dark soon  and i ll come over and pick you up and we can shimmy the nodger .     can we .   said keith .    yes .  with a hairpin   said malicia .   i know it s possible  because i ve read about it hundreds of times .     what kind of nodger is it .   said maurice .    a big one   said malicia .   that makes it easier  of course .   she turned round abruptly and ran out of the stables .    maurice .   said keith .    yes .   said the cat .    what is a nodger and how do you shimmy it .     i don t know .  a lock  maybe .     but you said     yes  but i was just trying to keep her talking in case she turned violent   said maurice .   she s gone in the head  if you ask me .  she s one of those people like    actors .  you know .  acting all the time .  not living in the real world at all .  like it s all a big story .  dangerous beans is a bit like that .  highly dangerous person  in my opinion .     he s a very kind and thoughtful rat .     ah  yes  but the trouble is  see  that he thinks everyone else is like him .  people like that are bad news  kid .  and our lady friend  she thinks life works like a fairytale .     well  that s harmless  isn t it .   said keith .    yeah  but in fairy tales  when someone dies    it s just a word .    the no .    heavy widdlers squad were taking a rest  and they d run out of ammunition in any case .  no one felt like going past the trap to the trickle of water that dripped down the wall .  and no one liked looking at what was in the trap .    poor old fresh   said a rat .   he was a good rat .     should ve paid attention to where he was going  though   said another rat .    thought he knew it all   said yet another rat .   a decent rat  though  if a bit smelly .     so let s get him out of the trap  shall we .   said the first rat .   doesn t seem right  leaving him in there like that .     yes .  especially since we re hungry .    one of the rats said   dangerous beans says we shouldn t eat rat at all .    another rat said   no  it s only if you don t know what they died of   cos they might have died of poison .    another rat said   and we know what he died of .  he died of squashing .  you can t catch squashing .    they all looked at the late fresh .    what do you think happens to you  after you re dead .   said a rat  slowly .    you get eaten .  or you go all dried up  or mouldy .     what  all of you .     well  people usually leave the feet .    the rat who d asked the question said   but what about the bit inside .    and the rat who d mentioned the feet said   oh  the squishy green wobbly bit .  no  you ought to leave that  too .  tastes awful .     no  i meant the bit inside you that s you .  where does that go .     sorry  you ve lost me there .     well    you know  like    dreams .    the rats nodded .  they knew about dreams .  dreams had come as a big shock when they started to happen .    well  then  in the dreams  when you re being chased by dogs or flying or whatever    who is it that s doing that .  it s not your body   cos that s asleep .  so it must be an invisible part that lives inside you  yes .  and being dead is like being asleep  isn t it .     not exactly like asleep   said a rat  uncertainly  glancing at the fairly flat thing formerly known as fresh .   i mean  you don t get all blood and bits sticking out .  and you wake up .     so   said the rat who d raised the whole question about the invisible part   when you wake up  where does the dreaming part go .  when you die  where does that bit that s inside you go .     what  the green wobbly bit .     no .  the bit that s behind your eyes .     you mean the pinky grey bit .     no  not that .  the invisible bit .     how would i know .  i ve never seen an invisible bit .    all the rats stared down at fresh .    i don t like this kind of talk   said one of them .   it reminds me of the shadows in the candlelight .    another one said   did you hear about the bone rat .  it comes and gets you when you re dead  they say .     they say  they say   muttered a rat .   they say there s a big rat underground who made everything  they say .  so it made humans  too .  must be really keen on us  to go and make humans too .  huh .     how do i know .  maybe they were made by a big human .     oh  now you re just being silly   said the doubting rat  who was called tomato .    all right  all right  but you ve got to admit that everything couldn t have just  well  turned up  could it .  there s got to be a reason .  and dangerous beans says there s things we should do  cos they re right  well  who works out what s right .  where does  right  and  wrong  come from .  they say  if you ve been a good rat  maybe the big rat has got this tunnel full of good eating that the bone rat will take you to    but fresh is still here .  and i ain t seen a bony rat .     ah  but they say you only see it if it s coming for you .     oh .  oh .   said another rat  nervous to the point of mad sarcasm .   so how did they see it  eh .  tell me that .  life s bad enough as it is without having to worry about invisible things you can t see .     all right  all right  what s been happening .    the rats turned  suddenly incredibly pleased to see darktan scurry up the tunnel .   darktan pushed past .  he d brought nourishing with him .  it was never too soon  he said  for a member of the squad to find out what happened to people who got things wrong .   i see   he said  looking at the trap .  he shook his head sadly .   what do i tell everyone .     not to use tunnels that haven t been marked clear  sir   said tomato .   but fresh  well  he s not a    he never was a good listener .  and he was keen to get on with it  sir .    darktan examined the trap  and tried to keep his face fixed in an expression of confident purpose .  it was hard to do it  though .  he d never seen a trap like it .  it looked a really nasty one  a squeezer rather than a chopper .  it had been put where a rat hurrying to the water would be bound to trip it .    he s not going to do any more listening now  that s for certain   he said .   the face looks familiar .  apart from the bulging eyes and the tongue hanging out  that is .     er  you talked to fresh in the muster this morning  sir   said a rat .   told him he was raised to be a widdler and to get on with it  sir .    darktan s expression remained blank .  then he said   we ve got to go .  we re finding a lot of traps all over .  we ll work our way back to you .  no one is to go any further along that tunnel  understood .  everyone say  yes  darktan  .     yes  darktan   the rats chorused .    and one of you stand guard   said darktan .   there could be more traps up that way .     what shall we do with fresh  sir .   said tomato .    don t eat the green wobbly bit   said darktan  and hurried off .   traps .  he thought .  there were too many of them .  and too much poison .  even the experienced members of the squad were getting nervous now .  he didn t like to come across unknown things .  you found out what unknown things were when they killed you .   the rats were spreading out under the town  and it was like no other town they d found .  the whole place was a rat trap .  they hadn t found a single living keekee .  not one .  that wasn t normal .  everywhere had rats .  where you got humans  you got rats .   and on top of everything else the young rats were spending too much time worrying about    things .  things you couldn t see or smell .  shadow things .  darktan shook his head .  there was no room in the tunnels for that sort of thinking .  life was real  life was practical  and life could get taken away really quickly if you weren t paying attention     he noticed nourishing looking around and sniffing the air as they trotted along a pipe .    that s right   he said approvingly .   you can t be too careful .  never rush in .  even the rat in front of you might have been lucky and missed the trigger .     yes  sir .     don t worry too much  though .     he did look awfully    flat  sir .     fools rush in  nourishing .  fools rush in      darktan could sense the fear spreading .  it worried him .  if the changelings panicked  they d panic as rats .  and the tunnels in this city were no place for a terrified rat to be running .  but if one rat broke ranks and ran  then most of them would follow .  smell held sway in the tunnels .  when things went well  everyone felt good .  when fear arrived  it flowed through the runs like flood water .  panic in the rat world was a kind of disease that could be caught too easily .   things did not get any better when they caught up with the rest of the trap squad .  this time  they d found a new poison .    not to worry   said darktan  who was worried .   we ve come across new poisons before  right .     not for ages   said a rat .   remember that one in scrote .  with the sparkly blue bits .  it burned if you got it on your feet .  people ran into it before they knew .     they ve got that here .     you d better come and see .    in one of the tunnels a rat was lying on its side .  its feet were curled up tight  like fists .  it was whimpering .   darktan took one look and knew that  for this rat  it was all over .  it was only a matter of time .  for the rats back in scrote  it had been a matter of horrible time .    i could bite her in the back of the neck   a rat volunteered .   it d be all over quickly .     it s a kind thought  but that stuff gets into the blood   said darktan .   find a snapper trap that hasn t been made safe .  do it carefully .     put a rat in a trap  sir .   said nourishing .    yes .  better die fast than slow .     even so  it s   the rat who had volunteered to do the biting started to protest .   the hairs around darktan s face stood out .  he reared up and showed his teeth .   do what you re told or i ll bite you .   he roared .   the other rat crouched back .   all right  darktan  all right       and warn all the other squads .   darktan bellowed .   this isn t rat catching  this is war .  everyone s to pull back smartly .  no one touch nothing .  we re going to yes .  what is it this time .    a small rat had crept up to darktan .  as the trap hunter spun around  the rat crouched hurriedly  almost rolling on its back to show how small and harmless it was .    please  sir     it mumbled .    yes .     this time we ve found a live one          chapter     there were big adventures and small adventures  mr bunnsy knew .  you didn t get told what size they were going to be before you started .  sometimes you could have a big adventure even when you were standing still .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure     hello .  hello  it s me .  and i m going to give the secret knock now .  there were three knocks on the stable door  and then malicia s voice rose again with  hello  did you hear the secret knock .     perhaps she ll go away if we keep quiet   said keith  in the straw .    i shouldn t think so   said maurice .  he raised his voice and called out   we re up here .     you ve still got to give the secret knock   shouted malicia .    oh  prbllttrrrp   said maurice under his breath  and fortunately no human knows how bad a swearword that is in cat language .   look  this is me  ok .  a cat .  which talks .  how will you recognize me .  shall i wear a red carnation .     i don t think you re a proper talking cat  anyway   said malicia  climbing the ladder .  she was still wearing black  and had bundled up her hair under a black scarf .  she also had a big bag slung from her shoulder .    gosh  you ve got that right   said maurice .    i mean  you don t wear boots and a sword and have a big hat with a feather in it   said the girl  pulling herself into the loft .   maurice gave her a long stare .   boots .   he said at last .   on these paws .     oh  it was in a picture in a book i read   said malicia  calmly .   a silly one for children .  full of animals that dressed up as humans .    it crossed maurice s cat mind  and not for the first time  that if he moved fast he could be out of the city in five minutes and on to a barge or something .   once  when he was no more than a kitten  he d been taken home by a small girl who d dressed him up in doll s clothes and sat him at a small table with a couple of dolls and three quarters of a teddy bear .  he d managed to escape through an open window  but it had taken him all day to get out of the dress .  that girl could have been malicia .  she thought animals were just people who hadn t been paying enough attention .    i don t do clothes   he said .  it wasn t much of a line  but it was probably better than saying  i think you are a loony  .    could be an improvement   said malicia .   it s nearly dark .  let s go .  we shall move like cats .     oh  right   said maurice .   i expect i can do that .    although  he thought a few minutes later  no cats ever moved like malicia .  she obviously thought that it was no good looking inconspicuous unless people could see that you were being inconspicuous .  people in the street actually stopped to watch her as she sidled along walls and scuttled from one doorway to another .  maurice and keith strolled along after her .  no one paid them any attention .   eventually  in a narrow street  she stopped at a black building with a big wooden sign hanging over the door .  the sign showed a lot of rats  a sort of star made of rats  with all their tails tied together in a big knot .    sign of the ancient guild of rat catchers   whispered malicia  swinging her bag off her shoulder .    i know   said keith .   it looks horrible .     makes an interesting design  though   said malicia .   one of the most significant things about the door below the sign was the big padlock holding it shut .  odd  maurice thought .  if rats make your legs explode  why do rat catchers have to have a big lock on their shed .    luckily  i m prepared for every eventuality   said malicia  and reached into her bag .  there was a sound as of lumps of metal and bottles being moved around .    what have you got in there .   asked maurice .   everything .     the grapnel and rope ladder take up a lot of the room   said malicia  still feeling around .   and then there s the big medicine kit  and the small medicine kit  and the knife  and the other knife  and the sewing kit  and the mirror for sending signals and    these      she pulled out a small bundle of black cloth .  when she unrolled it  maurice saw the gleam of metal .    ah   he said .   lock picks  right .  i ve seen burglars at work     hair pins   said malicia  selecting one .   hair pins always work in the books i ve read .  you just push it into the keyhole and twiddle .  i have a selection of pre bent ones .    once again  maurice felt a little chill at the back of his head .  they work in stories  he thought .  oh dear me .   and how come you know so much about picking locks .   he said .    i told you  they lock me out of my room to punish me   said malicia  twiddling .   maurice had seen thieves at work .  men breaking into buildings at night hated to see dogs  but they didn t mind cats .  cats never attempted to tear their throats out .  and what thieves tended to have  he knew  were complicated little tools which were used with great care and precision .  they didn t use stupi   click .    good   said malicia  in a satisfied voice .    that was just luck   said maurice  as the padlock swung free .  he looked up at keith .   you think it s just luck too  eh  kid .     how would i know .   said keith .   i ve never seen it done before .     i knew it would work   said malicia .   it worked in the fairy story the seventh wife of greenbeard  where she broke out of his room of terror and stabbed him in the eye with a frozen herring .     that was a  airy story .   said keith .    yes   said malicia  proudly .   right out of grim fairy tales .     you ve got some bad fairies in these parts   said maurice  shaking his head .   malicia pushed the door open .   oh  no   she moaned .   i didn t expect this      somewhere below maurice s paws  and about a street away  the one local rat that the changelings had found alive was crouched in front of dangerous beans .  the squads had been called back .  this was not turning out to be a good day .   traps that didn t kill  darktan thought .  you found them sometimes .  sometimes humans wanted to catch rats alive .   darktan didn t trust humans who wanted to catch rats alive .  honest traps that killed outright    well  they were bad  but you could usually avoid them and at least there was something clean about them .  live traps were like poison .  they cheated .   dangerous beans was watching the newcomer .  it was strange  but the rat who could think the most un rat like thoughts was also the best at talking to keekees  except that talking wasn t the right word .  no one  not even hamnpork  had a sense of smell like dangerous beans .   the new rat certainly wasn t giving any trouble .  for one thing  it was surrounded by rats who were big and well fed and tough  so its body was respectfully saying sir as hard as it could .  the changelings had also given it some food  which it was engulfing rather than eating .    she was in a box   said darktan  who was drawing on the floor with a stick .   there s a lot of them here .     i got caught in one once   said hamnpork .   then a female human came along and tipped me out over the garden wall .  couldn t see the point of it .     i believe some humans do it to be kind   said peaches .   they get the rat out of the house without killing them .     didn t do her any good  anyway   said hamnpork  with satisfaction .   i went back next night and widdled on the cheese .     i don t think anyone is trying to be kind here   said darktan .   there was another rat in there with her .  at least   he added  there was part of a rat in there with her .  i think she d been eating it to stay alive .     very sensible   nodded hamnpork .    we found something else   darktan said  still drawing furrows in the dirt .   can you see these  sir .    he d drawn lines and squiggles on the floor .    hrumph .  i can see them  but i don t have to know what they are   said hamnpork .  he rubbed his nose .   i ve never needed any more than this .    darktan gave a patient sigh .   then smell  sir  that this is a    a picture of all the tunnels we ve explored today .  it s    the shape i have in my head .  we ve explored a lot of the town .  there s a lot of the     he glanced at peaches   a lot of the kind traps  mostly empty .  there s poison all over the place .  it s mostly quite old .  lots of empty live traps .  lots of killer traps  still set .  and no live rats .  none at all  except for our    new friend .  we know there s something very odd .  i sniffed around a bit near where i found her  and i smelled rats .  lots of rats .  i mean lots .     alive .   said dangerous beans .    yes .     all in one place .     it smells that way   said darktan .   i think a squad should go and look .    dangerous beans got closer to the rat and sniffed at her again .  the rat sniffed at him .  they touched paws .  the watching changelings were astonished .  dangerous beans was treating the keekee as an equal .    lots of things  lots of things   he murmured .   many rats    humans    fear    lots of fear    lots of rats  crowded    food    rat    you said she s been eating rat .     it s a rat eat rat world   said hamnpork .   always has been  always will be .    dangerous beans wrinkled his nose .   there s something else .  something    odd .  strange    she s really scared .     she has been in a trap   said peaches .   and then she met us .     much   worse than that   said dangerous beans .   she s    she s frightened of us because we re strange rats but she smells relieved that we re not    what she s used to       humans .   darktan spat .    i    don t    think    so       other rats .     yes    no    i    don t    it s hard to tell       dogs .  cats .     no .   dangerous beans stepped back .   something new .     what shall we do with her .   said peaches .    let her go  i suppose .     we can t do that .   said darktan .   we ve triggered all the traps we ve found but there are still poisons all over the place .  i wouldn t send a mouse out into that lot .  she hasn t tried to attack us  after all .     so .   said hamnpork .   what s another dead keekee .     i know what darktan means   said peaches .   we can t just send her out to die .    big savings stepped forward and put a paw around the young female  cuddling her protectively .  she glared at hamnpork .  although she might nip him sometimes if she was annoyed  she wouldn t argue with him .  she was too old to do that .  but her look said  all males are stupid  you stupid old rat .   he looked lost .   we ve killed keekees  haven t we .   he said sadly .   why do we want this one hanging around .     we can t send her out to die   said peaches again  looking at dangerous beans  expression .  he had that faraway look in his pink eyes .    you want it trailing around eating our food and messing things up .   said hamnpork .   it can t talk  it can t think       nor could we  not long ago .   snapped peaches .   we were all like her .     we can think now  young female .   said hamnpork  his hair rising .    yes   said dangerous beans quietly .   we can think .  we can think about what we do .  we can pity the innocent one who means us no harm .  and that s why she can stay .    hamnpork s head turned sharply .  dangerous beans was still facing the newcomer .  hamnpork reared up instinctively  a rat ready to fight .  but dangerous beans couldn t see him .   peaches watched the old rat with concern .  he d been challenged  by a weedy little rat who would not last a second in a fight .  and dangerous beans hadn t even realized he d made the challenge .   he doesn t think like that  peaches told herself .   the other rats were watching hamnpork .  they still thought like that  and were waiting to see what he would do .   but it was dawning even on hamnpork that pouncing on the white rat would be unthinkable .  it would be like cutting off his own tail .  he very carefully let himself relax .   it s just a rat   he muttered .    but you  dear hamnpork  are not   said dangerous beans .   will you go with darktan s crew to find out where she came from .  it could be dangerous .    this made hamnpork s hair rise again .   i m not afraid of danger .   he roared .    of course not .  that is why you should go .  she was terrified   said dangerous beans .    i ve never been scared of anything .   shouted hamnpork .   now dangerous beans turned to face him .  in the candlelight there was a glow in the pink eyes .  hamnpork was not a rat who spent a lot of time thinking about things he couldn t see or smell or bite  but     he looked up .  the candlelight made big rat shadows dance on the wall .  hamnpork had heard the young rats talking about shadows and dreams and what happened to your shadow after you died .  he didn t worry about that stuff .  shadows couldn t bite you .  there was nothing to be frightened of in shadows .  but now his own voice in his head told him i m frightened of what those eyes can see .  he glared at darktan  who was scratching something in the mud with one of his sticks .    i ll go  but i will lead the expedition   he said .   i m senior rat here .     that doesn t worry me   said darktan .   mr clicky is going to be going in front in any case .     i thought he got smashed last week .   said peaches .    we ve got two left   said darktan .   then we ll have to raid another pet shop .     i m the leader   said hamnpork .   i ll say what we do  darktan .     fine  sir .  fine   said darktan  still drawing in the mud .   and you know how to make all the traps safe  do you .     no  but i can tell you to .     good .  good   said darktan  making more marks with his stick and not looking at the leader .   and you ll tell me which levers to leave alone and which bits to wedge open  will you .     i don t have to understand about traps   said hamnpork .    but i do  sir   said darktan  speaking in the same calm voice .   and i m telling you that there s a couple of things about some of these new traps i don t understand  and until i understand them i d very respectfully suggest you leave it all to me     that is not the way to talk to a superior rat .    darktan gave him a look  and peaches held her breath .   this is the showdown  she thought .  this is where we find out who is the leader .   then darktan said   i am sorry .  impertinence was not intended .    peaches picked up the astonishment amongst the older males who were watching .  darktan .  he d backed down .  he hadn t leapt .   but he hadn t cowered back  either .   hamnpork s fur settled .  the old rat was at a loss to know how to deal with this .  all the signals were mixed up .    well  er       obviously  as the leader you must give the orders   said darktan .    yes  er       but my advice  sir  is that we investigate this .  unknown things are dangerous .     yes .  certainly   said hamnpork .   yes  indeed .  we will investigate .  of course .  see to it .  i am the leader  and that is what i am saying .    maurice looked around at the inside of the rat catchers  shed .    it looks like a rat catchers  shed   he said .   benches  chairs  stove  lots of rat skins hanging up  piles of old traps  a couple of dog muzzles  rolls of wire netting  considerable evidence of a lack of any dusting ever being done .  it s what i d have expected a rat catchers  hut to look like inside .     i was expecting something    horrible yet interesting   said malicia .   some ghastly clue .     does there have to be a clue .   said keith .    of course .   said malicia  looking under a chair .   look  cat  there s two types of people in the world .  there are those who have got the plot  and those who haven t .     the world hasn t got a plot   said maurice .   things just    happen  one after another .     only if you think of it like that   said malicia  far too smugly in maurice s opinion .   there s always a plot .  you just have to know where to look .   she paused for a moment and then said   look .  that s the word .  there ll be a secret passage  of course .  everyone look for the entrance to the secret passage .     er    how will we know it s the entrance to a secret passage .   said keith  looking even more bewildered than norrmal .   what does a secret passage look like .     it won t look like one  of course .     oh  well  in that case i can see dozens of secret passages   said maurice .   doors  windows  that calendar from the acme poison company  that cupboard over there  that rathole  that desk  that     you re just being sarcastic   said malicia  lifting up the calendar and sternly inspecting the wall behind it .    actually  i was just being flippant   said maurice   but i can do sarcastic if you like .    keith stared at the long bench which was in front of a winckow frosted with ancient cobwebs .  traps were piled up on it .  all kinds of traps .  and beside them were row uporm row of battered old tins and jars with labels like  danger  hydrogen dioxide .   and  ratbane  and  firegut  and polyputaketlon  extreme caution  and  rataway .  .  .   and  killerat .   and  essence of barbed wire  danger .  .  .   and he leaned closer to look at this one  sugar  .  there were a couple of mugs  too  and a teapot .  white and green and grey powder was scattered on the bench .  some of it had even fallen on the floor .    you might try to be some help   said malicia  tapping the walls .    i don t know how to look for something that doesn t look like the thing i m looking for   said keith .   and they keep the poison right next to the sugar .  and so many poisons      malicia stood back and brushed her hair out of her eyes .   this isn t working   she said .    i suppose there might not be a secret passage .   said maurice .   i know it s a rather daring idea  but perhaps this is just an ordinary shed .    even maurice leaned back a little from the force of malicia s stare .    there has to be a secret passage   she said .   otherwise there s no point .   she snapped her fingers .   of course .  we re doing it wrong .  everyone knows you never find the secret passage by looking for it .  it s when you give up and lean against the wall that you inadvertently operate the secret switch .    maurice looked at keith for help .  he was a human  after all .  he should know how to deal with something like malicia .  but keith was just wandering around the shed  staring at things .   malicia leaned against the wall with incredible nonchalance .  there was not a click .  a panel in the floor not slide back .   probably the wrong place   she said .   i ll just rest my arm innocently on this coat hook   a sudden door in the wall completely failed to happen .   of course  it d help if there was an ornate candlestick   said malicia .   they re always a sure fire secret passage lever .  every adventurer knows that .     there isn t a candlestick   said maurice .    i know .  some people totally fail to have any idea of how to design a proper secret passage   said malicia .  she leaned against another piece of wall  which had no effect whatsoever .    i don t think you ll find it that way   said keith  who was carefully examining a trap .    oh .  won t i .   said malicia .   well  at least i m being constructive about things .  where would you look  if you re such an expert .     why is there a rat hole in a rat catchers  shed .   said keith .   it smells of dead rats and wet dogs and poison .  i wouldn t come near this place if i was a rat .    malicia glared at him .  then her face wrapped itself in an expression of acute concentration  as if she was trying out several ideas in her head .   ye es   she said .   that usually works  in stories .  it s often the stupid person who comes up with the good idea by accident   she crouched down and peered into the hole .   there s a sort of little lever   she said .   i ll just give it a little push      there was a clonk under the floor  part of it swung back  and keith dropped out of sight .    oh  yes   said malicia .   i thought something like that would probably happen      mr clicky bumped along the tunnel  making a whirring noise .   young rats had chewed his ears  and his string tail had been chopped off by a trap  and other traps had dented his body  but he had this advantage  surprise traps couldn t kill mr clicky because he wasn t alive  and he wasn t alive because he was powered by clockwork .   his key whirred around .  a stub of candle burned on his back .  the rest of the no .    trap squad watched .    any minute now     said darktan .   there was a snap  and a sound best described as gloink .  the light went out .  then a gear wheel rolled slowly back down the tunnel and fell over in front of hamnpork .    i thought the soil looked a bit disturbed there   said darktan in a satisfied voice .  he turned around .   ok  lads .  break out the other mr clicky  and i want half a dozen of you with a rope to dig out that trap and drag it out of the way .     all this testing the ground is slowing us down  darktan   said hamnpork .    fine  sir   said darktan  as the squad hurried past them .   you go on ahead .  that d be a good idea  because we ve only got one mr clicky left .  i hope this town s got a pet shop .            i just think we should move faster   said hamnpork .    ok  off you go then  sir .  try to shout out where the next trap is before it gets you     i am the leader  darktan .     yes  sir  i m sorry .  we re all getting a bit tired .     this is not a good place  darktan   said hamnpork wearily .   i ve been in some bad rprptlt holes  and this is worse than any of them .     that s true  sir .  this place is dead .     what s that word dangerous beans invented .     evil   said darktan  watching the squad drag the trap out of the walls of the tunnel .  he could see mangled springs and wheels in the jaws .  he added   i couldn t quite understand what he was going on about  at the time .  but now i think i can see what he meant .    he looked back along the tunnel to where a candle flame burned  and grabbed a passing rat .   peaches and dangerous beans are to stay right back  understand .   he said .   they re not to come any further .     right  sir .   said the rat  and hurried away .   the expedition moved forward  cautiously  as the runnel opened up into a large  old drain .  it had a trickle of water in the bottom .  there were ancient pipes in the roof of it .  here and there steam hissed from them .  weak green light came from a street grating  further down the drain .   the place smelled of rats .  it smelled freshly of rats .  in fact there was a rat in there  nibbling at a tray of food that had been set on a crumbling brick .  it glanced at the changelings and fled .    get after it .   hamnpork yelled .    no .   shouted darktan .  a couple of rats  who d begun to chase the keekee hesitated .    that was an order i gave .   roared hamnpork  turning on darktan .  the trap expert made a very brief crouch and said   of course .  but i think the view of hamnpork in possession of all the facts will be a little different than the view of hamnpork who just shouted because he saw a rat run away  hmm .  sniff the air .    hamnpork s nose wrinkled .   poison .    darktan nodded .   grey no .      he said .   foul stuff .  it s best to keep well away .    hamnpork looked both ways along the pipe .  it went on for a long way  and was just about high enough for a human to crawl along it .  lots of smaller pipes hung near the ceiling .   it s warm here   he said .    yes  sir .  peaches has been reading the guide book .  hot springs of water come up out of the ground here and they pump it around to some of the houses .     why .     to bath in  sir .     hrumph .   hamnpork didn t like that idea .  a lot of the young rats were keen on taking baths .   darktan turned to the squad .   hamnpork wants that poison buried and widdled on and a marker on it right now .    hamnpork heard a metallic sound beside him .  he turned and saw that darktan had drawn  from his web of tools  a long thin piece of metal .   what the krckrck is that .   he said .   darktan swished the thing backwards and forwards .   i got the stupid looking kid to make this for me   he said .   and then hamnpork realized what it was .   that s a sword   he said .   you got the idea out of mr bunnsy has an adventure .     that s right .     i ve never believed that stuff   hamnpork grumbled .    but a spike is a spike   said darktan  calmly .   i think we re close to the other rats .  it d be a good idea if most of us stay here    sir .   hamnpork felt he was being given orders again  but darktan was being polite .   i suggest that a few of us go on ahead to sniff them out   darktan went on .   sardines would be useful  and i ll go  of course    and me   said hamnpork .   he glared at darktan  who said   of course .        chapter     and because of olly the snake s trick with the road sign  mr bunnsy did not know that he had lost his way .  he wasn t going to howard the stoat s tea party .  he was heading into the dark wood .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    malicia looked at the open trapdoor as if giving it marks out of ten .    quite well hidden   she said .   no wonder we didn t see it .     i m not hurt much   keith called up from the darkness .    good   said malicia  still inspecting the trapdoor .   how far down are you .     it s some sort of cellar .  i m ok because i landed on some sacks     all right  all right  no need to go on about it  this wouldn t be an adventure if there weren t some minor hazards   said the girl .   here s the top of a ladder .  why didn t you use it .     i was unable to on account of falling past   said the voice of keith .    shall i carry you down .   malicia said to maurice .    shall i scratch your eyes out .   maurice responded .   malicia s brow wrinkled .  she always looked annoyed when she didn t understand something .   was that sarcasm .   she said .    that was a suggestion   said maurice .   i don t do  picking up  by strangers .  you go down .  i ll follow .     but you haven t got the legs for ladders .     do i make personal remarks about your legs .    malicia descended into the dark .  there was a metallic noise  and then the flare of a match .   it s full of sacks .   she said .    i know   came the voice of keith .   i landed on them .  i did say .     it s grain .  and    and there s strings and strings of sausages .  there s smoked meat .  bins of vegetables .  it s full of food .  aargh .  get out of my hair .  get off .  that cat just jumped onto my head .    maurice leapt off her and onto some sacks .    hah .   said malicia  rubbing her head .   we were told that the rats had got it all .  i see it all now .  the rat catchers get everywhere  they know all the sewers  all the cellars    and to think those thieves get paid out of our taxes .    maurice looked around the cellar  lit by the flickering lantern in malicia s hand .  there was  indeed  a lot of food .  nets hanging from the ceiling were indeed stuffed with big  white  heavy cabbages .  the aforesaid sausages did indeed loop from beam to beam .  there were indeed jars and barrels and sacks and sacks .  and  indeed  they all worried him .    that s it  then   said malicia .   what a hiding place .  we re going to go right away to the town watch  report what we ve found  and then it s a big cream tea for all of us and possibly a medal and then     i m suspicious   said maurice .    why .     because i m a suspicious character .  i wouldn t trust your rat catchers if they told me the sky was blue .  what have they been doing .  pinching the food and then saying   it was the rats  honest  .  and everyone believed them .     no  stupid .  people have found gnawed bones and empty egg baskets  that sort of thing   said malicia .   and rat droppings all over the place .     i suppose you could scratch the bones and i suppose rat catchers could shovel up a lot of rat droppings     maurice conceded .    and they re killing all the real rats so that there s more for them .   said malicia triumphantly .   very clever .     yeah  and that s a bit puzzling   said maurice   because we ve met your rat catchers and  frankly  if it was raining meatballs they wouldn t be able to find a fork .     i ve been thinking about something   said keith  who had been humming to himself .    well  i m glad someone has   malicia began .    it s about wire netting   said keith .   there was wire netting in the shed .     is this important .     why do rat catchers need rolls of wire netting .     how should i know .  cages  maybe .  does it matter .     why would rat catchers put rats in cages .  dead rats don t run away  do they .    there was silence .  maurice could see that malicia was not happy about that comment .  it was an unnecessary complication .  it spoiled the story .    i may be stupid looking   keith added   but i m not stupid .  i have time to think about things because i don t keep on talking all the time .  i look at things .  i listen .  i try to learn .  i     i don t talk all the time .    maurice let them argue and stalked away into the corner of the cellar .  or cellars .  they seemed to go on a long way .  he saw something streak across the floor in the shadows  and leapt before he could think .  his stomach remembered that it had been a long time since the mouse  and it connected itself straight to his legs .   all right   he said  as the thing squirmed in his paws  speak up or    a small stick hit him very sharply .   do you mind .   said sardines  struggling to get up .    dere s bno deed to be like dab .   muttered maurice  trying to lick his smarting nose .    i ve got a rkrklk hat on  right .   snapped sardines .   do you ever bother to look .     all ride  all ride  sorwy    why re you here .    sardines brushed himself off .   looking for you or stupid looking kid   he said .   hamnpork sent me .  we re in trouble now .  you just won t believe what we ve found .     he wants me .   said maurice .   i thought he didn t like me .     well  he said it s nasty and evil so you d know what to do  boss   said sardines  picking up his hat .   look at that  will you .  your claw went right through it .     but i did ask you if you could talk  didn t i .   said maurice .    yes  you did  but     i always ask .     i know  so     i m very definite about asking  you know .     yes  yes  you ve made your point  i believe you   said sardines .   i only complained about the hat .     i d hate anyone to think i don t ask   said maurice .    there s no need to go on and on about it   said sardines .   where s the kid .     back there  talking to the girl   said maurice sulkily .    what  the mad one .     that s her .     you d better get them .  this is seriously evil .  there s a door at the other end of these cellars .  i m amazed you can t smell it from here .     i d just like everyone to be clear that i asked  that s all       boss   said sardines  this is serious .    peaches and darktan waited for the exploration party .  they were with toxie  another young male rat  who was good at reading and acted as a kind of assistant .   peaches had also brought mr bunnsy has an adventure .    they ve been gone a long time   said toxie .    darktan checks every step   said peaches .    something s wrong   said dangerous beans .  his nose wrinkled .   a rat scurried down the tunnel and pushed frantically past them .   dangerous beans sniffed the air .   fear   he said .   three more rats scrambled past  knocking him over .    what s happening .   said peaches  as another rat spun her around in its effort to get past .  it squeaked at her and rushed on .    that was finest   she said .   why didn t she say anything .     more    fear   said dangerous beans .   they re    scared .  terrified      toxie tried to stop the next rat .  it bit him  and ran on  chittering .    we must go back   said peaches urgently .   what ve they found up there .  maybe it s a ferret .     can t be .   said toxie .   hamnpork killed a ferret once .    three more rats ran past  trailing fear behind them .  one of them squealed at peaches  gibbered madly at dangerous beans and ran on .    they    they ve forgotten how to talk     whispered dangerous beans .    something terrible must have frightened them .   said peaches  snatching up her notes .    they ve never been that frightened .   said toxie .   remember when that dog found us .  we were all frightened but we talked and we trapped it and hamnpork saw it off whimpering      to her shock  peaches saw that dangerous beans was crying .   they ve forgotten how to talk .    half a dozen more rats pushed their way past  screeching .  peaches tried to stop one  but it just squeaked at her and dodged out of the way .   that was feedsfour .   she said  turning to toxie .   i was talking to her only an hour ago .  she    toxie .    toxic s fur was bristling .  his eyes were unfocused .  his mouth was open  showing his teeth .  he stared at her  or right through her  and then turned and ran .   she turned and put her paws around dangerous beans  as the fear swept over them .   there were rats .  from wall to wall  floor to ceiling  there were rats .  the cages were crammed full of them  they clung to the wire in front  and to the ceilings .  the netting strained with the weight .  glistening bodies boiled and tumbled  paws and noses thrusting through the holes .  the air was solid with squeaking and rustling and chittering  and it stank .   what was left of hamnpork s exploration party were clustered in the middle of the room .  most of it had fled by now .  if the smells in that room had been sounds  they would have been shouts and screams  thousands of them .  they filled the long room with a strange kind of pressure .  even maurice could feel it  as soon as keith broke down the door .  it was like a headache outside your head  trying to get in .  it banged on the ears .   maurice was staying a little way behind .  you didn t need to be very clever to see that this was a bad situation and one which might need some running away from at any time .   he saw  between their legs  darktan and hamnpork and a few other changelings .  they were in the middle of the floor  looking up at the cages .   he was amazed to see that even hamnpork was trembling .  but he was trembling with rage .    let them out .   he shouted up to keith .   let them all out .  let them all out now .     another talking rat .   said malicia .    let them out .   hamnpork screamed .    all these foul cages     said malicia  staring .    i did say about the wire netting   said keith .   look  you can see where it s been repaired    they gnawed through wire to escape .     i said let them out .   screamed hamnpork .   let them out or i will kill you .  evil .  evil .  evil .     but they re just rats   said malicia .   hamnpork leapt and landed on the girl s dress .  he swarmed up towards her neck .  she froze .  he hissed   there are rats eating one another in there .  i will gnaw you  you evil    keith s hand grasped him firmly around the waist and pulled him off her neck .   screeching  hair bristling  hamnpork sunk his teeth into keith s finger .   malicia gasped .  even maurice winced .   hamnpork drew his head back  blood dripping from his muzzle  and blinked in horror .   tears welled up in keith s eyes .  very carefully  he put hamnpork down on the floor .   it s the smell   he said  quietly .   it upsets them .     i    i thought you said they were tame .   said malicia  able to speak at last .  she picked up a lump of wood that was leaning against the cages .   keith knocked it out of her hand .   never  ever threaten one of us .     he attacked you .     look around .  this is not a story .  this is real .  do you understand .  they re frightened out of their minds .     how dare you talk to me like that .   malicia shouted .    i rrkrkrk will .     one of us  eh .  was that a rat swearword .  do you even swear in rat  rat boy .    just like cats  maurice thought .  you stand face to face and scream at one another .  his ears swivelled as he heard another sound  in the distance .  someone was coming down the ladder .  maurice knew from experience that this was no time to talk to humans .  they always said things like  what .   and  that s not right .   or  where .     get out of here right now   he said  as he ran past darktan .   don t get human about it  just run .    and that was quite enough heroism  he decided .  it didn t pay to let other people actually slow you down .   there was a rusty old drain set in the wall .  he skidded on the slimy floor as he changed direction  and there  yes  was a maurice sized hole where a bar had rusted clean away .  paws scrabbling for speed  he darted through the hole just as the rat catchers entered the room of cages .  then  safe in the darkness  he turned around and peered out .   time to check .  was maurice safe .  all legs present .  tail .  yes .  good .   he could see darktan tugging at hamnpork  who seemed to have frozen on the spot  the others scuttling towards another drain in the opposite wall .  they moved unsteadily .  that s what happens when you let yourself go  maurice thought .  they thought they d got educated  but in a tight corner a rat is just a rat .   now me  i m different .  brain functioning perfectly at all times .  always on the lookout .  on the case and sniffing bottom .   the caged rats were making a din .  keith and the story telling girl were watching the rat catchers in amazement .  the rat catchers weren t unamazed  either .   on the floor  darktan gave up trying to get hamnpork to move .  he drew his sword  looked up at the humans  hesitated  and then ran for the drain .   yes  let them sort it out .  they re all human  maurice thought .  they ve got big brains  they can talk  it should be no problem at all .   hah .  tell them a story  story telling girl .   rat catcher   stared at malicia and keith .   what re you doing here  miss .   he said  his voice creaking with suspicion .    playing mummies and daddies .   said rat catcher   cheerfully .    you broke into our shed   said rat catcher   .   that s called  breaking in   that is .     you ve been stealing  yes  stealing food and blaming it on rats .   snapped malicia .   and why have you got all these rats caged up in here .  and what about the aglets  eh .  surprised  eh .  didn t think anyone would notice them  eh .     aglets .   said rat catcher    his brow wrinkling .    the little bits on the end of bootlaces   mumbled keith .   rat catcher   spun around .   you bloody idiot  bill .  i said we had enough real ones .  i told you someone would notice .  didn t i tell you someone would notice .  someone has noticed .     yes  don t think you ve got away with anything .   said malicia .  her eyes were gleaming .   i know you re only the humorous thugs .  one big fat one  one thin one   it s obvious .  so who s the big boss .    rat catcher   s eyes glazed slightly  as they often did when malicia talked at people .  he waved a fat finger at her .   you know what your father s been and gone and done just now .   he said .    hah .  humorous thug talk .   said malicia triumphantly .   do go on .     he s been and gone and sent off for the rat piper .   said rat catcher   .   he costs a fortune .  three hundred dollars a town and if you don t pay up he gets really mean .    oh dear  thought maurice .  someone s been and gone and sent for the real one    three hundred dollars .  three hundred dollars .  three hundred dollars .  and we only charged thirty .    it s you  isn t it   said rat catcher    waving his finger at keith .   the stupid looking kid .  you turn up  and suddenly there s all these new rats around .  there s something i don t like about you .  you and your funny looking cat .  if i see that funny looking cat again it s going to have mittens .    in the darkness of the drain  maurice shrank back .    hur  hur  hur   said rat catcher   .  he d probably studied to get a thug laugh like that  maurice thought .    and we don t have a boss   said rat catcher   .    yeah  we re our own bosses   said rat catcher   .   and then the story went wrong .    and you  miss   said rat catcher    turning to malicia   are too lippy by half .   he swung his fist  lifting her off her feet and slamming her against the rat cages .  the rats went mad and the cages boiled with frantic activity as she slumped to the ground .   the rat catcher turned to keith .   you going to try anything  kid .   he said .   you going to try anything .  she was a girl so i was nice and kind but you i ll put in one of the cages     yeah  and they ain t been fed today .   said a delighted rat catcher   .   go on  kid .  maurice thought .  do something .  but keith just stood there  staring at the man .   rat catcher   looked him up and down  scornfully .   what s that you ve got there  boy .  a pipe .  give it here .   the pipe was grabbed from keith s belt and he was pushed onto the floor .   a penny whistle .  think you re the rat piper  do you .   rat catcher   snapped the pipe in two and tossed the bits inside the cages .   y know  they say that over in porkscratchenz the rat piper led all the kids out of the town .  now there was a man with the right idea .    keith looked up .  his eyes narrowed .  he got to his feet .   here it comes  thought maurice .  he s going to leap forward with superhuman strength because he s so angry and they re going to wish he d never been born     keith leapt forward with ordinary human strength  landed one punch on rat catcher   and was smacked to the floor again by a big  brutal  sledgehammer blow .   all right  all right  he got knocked down  thought maurice as keith struggled for breath  but he s going to get up again .   there was a shrill scream  and maurice thought  aha .   but the scream hadn t come from the wheezing keith .  a grey figure had launched itself from the top of the rat cages right at the rat catcher s face .  it landed teeth first  and blood spurted on the rat catcher s nose .   aha .  thought maurice again  it s hamnpork to the rescue .  what .  mrillp .  i m thinking like the girl .  i keep thinking it s a story .   the rat catcher grabbed at the rat and held him out at arm s length by his tail .  hamnpork twisted and turned  squealing with rage .  his captor dabbed at his nose with his spare hand  and stared at hamnpork as he struggled .    he s a bit of a fighter   said rat catcher   .   how d he get out .     not one of ours   said rat catcher   .   he s a red .     red .  what s red about him .     a red rat s a kind of grey rat  as you would very well know if you d were an hexperienced guild member like me   said the rat catcher .   they ain t local .  you get  em down on the plains .  funny to find one up here .  very funny .  greasy old devil  too .  but game as anything .     your nose is all runny .     yeah .  i know .  i ve had more rat bites than you ve had hot dinners .  don t feel  em any more   said rat catcher    in a voice that suggested that the spinning  screeching hamnpork was a lot more interesting than his colleague .    i only have cold sausage for dinner .     there you are then .  what a little fighter you are  to be sure .  real little devil  aren t you .  plucky as anything .     kind of you to say so .     i was talking to the rat  mister .   he prodded keith with his boot .   go and tie up these two somewhere  ok .  we ll put them in one of the other cellars for now .  one with a proper door .  and a proper lock .  and no handy little trapdoors .  and you give me the key .     she s the mayor s daughter   said rat catcher   .   mayors can get really upset about daughters .     then he ll do what he s told  right .     you gonna give that rat a good squeezing .     what  a fighter like this one .  are you joking .  it s thinking like that that ll keep you a rat catcher s assistant your whole life .  i ve got a much better idea .  how many s in the special cage .    maurice watched rat catcher   go and examine one of the other cages on the far wall .    only two rats left .  they ve eaten the other four   he reported .   just skin left .  very neat .     ah  so they ll be full o  vim and vinegar .  well  we ll see what they do to him  shall we .    maurice heard a little wire door open and shut .   hamnpork was seeing red .  it filled his vision .  he d been angry for months  down inside  angry at humans  angry at the poisons and the traps  angry at the way younger rats weren t showing respect  angry that the world was changing so fast  angry that he was growing old    and now the smells of terror and hunger and violence met the anger coming the other way and they mingled and flowed through hamnpork in a great red river of rage .  he was a cornered rat .  but he was a cornered rat who could think .  he d always been a vicious fighter  long before there was all this thinking  and he was still very strong .  a couple of dumb  swanking young keekees with no tactics and no experience of down and dirty cellar fighting and no fancy footwork and no thoughts were simply not a contest .  a tumble  a twist and two bites were all it took     the caged rats across the room leapt back from the netting .  even they could feel the fury .    now there s a clever boy   said rat catcher   admiringly  when it was all over .   i ve got a use for you  my lad .     not the pit .   said rat catcher   .    yes  the pit .     tonight .     yeah   cos fancy arthur is putting in his jacko on a bet to kill a hundred rats in less than a quarter of an hour .     i bet he can  too .  jacko s a good terrier .  he did ninety a few months ago and fancy arthur been training him up .  should be a good show .     you d bet on jacko doing it  would you .   said ratcatcher   .    sure .  everyone will be .     even with our little friend here among the rats .   said rat catcher   .   full of lovely spite and bite and boilin  bile .     well  er       yeah  right .   rat catcher   grinned .    i don t like leaving those kids here  though .     it s  them kids   not  those kids  .  get it right .  how many times have i told you .  rule    of the guild  sound stupid .  people get suspicious of rat catchers that talk too good .     sorry .     talk thick  be clever .  that s the way to do it   said ratcatcher   .    sorry  i forgot .     you tend to do it the other way around .     sorry .  them kids .  it s cruel  tying people up .  and they re only kids  after all .     so .     so it d be a lot easier to take  em down the tunnel to the river and hit  em on the head and throw  em in .  they ll be miles down river before anyone fishes  em out  and they prob ly won t even be recognizable by the time the fish have finished with  em .    maurice heard a pause in the conversation .  then ratcatcher   said   i didn t know that you were such a kind hearted soul  bill .     right  and  sorry  an  i ve got an idea about gettin  rid of this piper  too    the next voice came from everywhere .  it sounded like a rushing wind and  in the heart of the wind  the groan of something in agony .  it filled the air .   no .  we can use the piper .    no  we can use the piper   said rat catcher   .    that s right   said rat catcher   .   i was just thinking the same thing .  er    how can we use the piper .    once again  maurice heard a sound in his head like wind blowing through a cave .   isn t it obvious .   isn t it obvious .   said rat catcher   .    yeah  obvious   muttered rat catcher   .   obviously it s obvious .  er      maurice watched the rat catchers open several of the cages  grab rats and drop them into a sack .  he saw hamnpork tipped into one  too .  and then the ratcatchers had gone  dragging the other humans with them  and maurice wondered  where  in this maze of cellars  is a maurice sized hole .   cats can t see in the dark .  what they can do is see by very little light .  a tiny scrap of moonlight was filtering into the space behind him .  it was coming through a tiny hole in the ceiling  barely big enough for a mouse and certainly not big enough for a maurice even if he could reach it .   it illuminated another cellar .  by the looks of it  the ratcatchers used this one too  there were a few barrels stacked in one corner  and piles of broken rat cages .  maurice prowled around it  looking for another way out .  there were doors  but they had handles  and even his mighty brain couldn t figure out the mystery of doorknobs .  there was another drain grating in a wall  though .  he squeezed through it .   another cellar .  and more boxes and sacks .  at least it was dry  though .   a voice behind him said  what kind of thing are you .   he spun around .  all he could make out were boxes sacks .  the air still stank of rats  and there was a continuous rustling  and the occasional faint squeak  but the place was a little piece of heaven compared to the hell of the cage room .   the voice had come from behind him  hadn t it .  he must have heard it  mustn t he .  because it seemed to him that he just had something like the memory of hearing a voice  something that had arrived in his head without bothering to go through his ragged ears .  it had been the same with the rat catchers .  they d talked as if they d heard a voice and thought it was their own thoughts .  the voice hadn t really been there  had it .   i can t see you  said the memory  i don t know what you are .   it was not a good voice for a memory to have .  it was all hisses  and it slid into the mind like a knife .   come closer  .   maurice s paws twitched .  the muscles in his legs started to push him forward .  he extended his claws  and got control of himself .  someone was hiding amongst the boxes  he thought .  and it would probably not be a good idea to say anything .  people could get funny about talking cats .  you couldn t rely on everyone being as mad as the story telling girl .   come closer  .   the voice seemed to pull at him .  he d have to say something .    i m happy where i am  thank you   said maurice .   then will you share our pain .   the last word hurt .  but it did not  and this was surprising  hurt a lot .  the voice had sounded sharp and and dramatic  as if the owner was keen to see maurice rolling in agony .  instead  it gave him a very brief headache .   when the voice arrived again  it sounded very suspicious .   what kind of creature are you .  your mind is wrong  .    i prefer amazing   said maurice .   anyway  who are you  asking me questions in the dark .    all he could smell was rat .  he heard a faint sound off to his left  and just made out the shape of a very large rat  creeping towards him .   another sound made him turn .  another rat was coming from the other direction .  he could only just make it out in the gloom .   a rustle ahead of him suggested that there was a rat right in front  slipping quietly through the dark .   here come my eyes    what .  cat .  cat .  kill .       chapter     mr bunnsy realized that he was a fat rabbit in the dark wood and wished he wasn t a rabbit or  at least  not a fat one .  but ratty rupert was on the way .  little did he know what was waiting for him .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    the three rats leapt they were already too late .  there was just a maurice shaped hole in the air .  maurice was across the room and scrambling up some boxes .   there was squeaking below him .  he jumped onto another box and saw a place in the wall where some of the rotten bricks had fallen out .  he aimed for it  scrabbled on thin air as more bricks moved under him  and pushed himself into the unknown .   it was another cellar .  and it was full of water .  in fact  what it was full of was not exactly water .  it was what water eventually becomes when rat cages drain into it  and gutters up above drain into it  and it has had a chance to sit and bubble gently to itself for a year or so .  to call it  mud  would be an insult to perfectly respectable swamps all over the world .   maurice landed in it .  it went  gloop  .   he cat paddled furiously through the thick stuff  trying not to breathe  and dragged himself out on a pile of rubble on the other side of the room .  a fallen rafter  slimy with mould  led up to more tangled  fire blackened wood in the ceiling .   he could still hear the dreadful voice in his head  but it was muffled .  it was trying to give him orders .  trying to give a cat orders .  it was easier to nail jelly to a wall .  what did it think he was  a dog .   stinking mud oozed off him .  even his ears were full of mud .  he went to lick himself clean  and then stopped .  it was a perfectly normal cat reaction  licking yourself clean .  but licking this off would probably kill him   there was a movement in the dark .  he could just make out some big rat shapes pouring through the hole .  there were a couple of splashes .  some of the shapes were creeping along the walls .   ah  said the voice .  you see them .  watch them come for you  cat .   maurice stopped himself from running .  this was no time to listen to his inner cat .  his inner cat had got him out of the room  but his inner cat was stupid .  it wanted him to attack things small enough and run away from everything else .  but no cat could tackle a bunch of rats this size .  he froze  and tried to keep an eye on the advancing rats .  they were heading directly for him .   hold on    hold on     the voice had said  you can see them     how did it know .   maurice tried to think loudly  can    you    read    my    mind .   nothing happened .   maurice had a burst of inspiration .  he shut his eyes .   open them .  came the immediate command  and his eyelids trembled .   shan t  thought maurice .  you can t hear my thoughts .  he thought .  you only use my eyes and ears .  you re just guessing what i m thinking .   there was no reply .  maurice didn t wait .  he leapt .  the sloping beam was where he remembered it .  he clawed his way up  and hung on .  at least all they could do was follow him up .  with any luck  he could use his claws     the rats got closer .  now they were sniffing for him down below  and he imagined quivering noses in the darkness .   one started to climb the beam  still sniffing .  it must have been within inches of maurice s tail when it turned around and went back down again .   he heard them reach the top of the rubble .  there was more bewildered sniffing and then  in the dark  the sound of the rats paddling through the mud .   maurice wrinkled his mud caked forehead in amazement .  rats who couldn t smell a cat .  and then he realized .  he didn t smell of cat   he stank of mud  he felt like mud  in a room full of stinking mud .   he sat  still as stone  until through muddy caked ears he heard claws heading back to the hole in the wall .  then  without opening his eyes  he crept carefully back down to the rubble and found that it had piled up against a rotten wooden door .  what must have been a piece of plank  soggy as a sponge  fell out as he touched it .   a feeling of openness suggested that there was another cellar beyond .  it stank of rot and burned wood .   would the    voice know where he was if he opened his eyes now .  didn t one cellar look like another .   perhaps this room was full of rats  too .   his eyes sprang open .  there were no rats  but there was another rusted drain cover which opened into a tunnel just big enough for him to walk through .  he could see a faint light .   so this is the rat world  he thought  as he tried to scrape the mud off himself .  dark and muddy and stinky and full of weird voices .  i m a cat .  sunlight and fresh air  that s my style .  all i need now is a hole into the outside world and they won t see me for dust  or at least for bits of dried mud .   a voice in his head  which wasn t the mysterious voice but a voice just like his own  said  but what about the stupid looking kid and the rest of them .  you ought to help them .  and maurice thought  where did you come from .  i ll tell you what  you help them and i ll go somewhere warm  how about that .   the light at the end of the tunnel grew brighter .  it still wasn t anything like daylight  or even moonlight  but anything was better than this gloom .   at least  nearly anything .   he pushed his head out of the pipe into a much larger one  made of bricks that were slimy with strange underground nastiness  and into the circle of candlelight .    it s    maurice .   said peaches  staring at the mud dripping off his matted fur .    smells better than he usually does  then   said darktan  grinning in what maurice considered was an unfriendly way .    oh ha  ha   said maurice  weakly .  he wasn t in the mood for repartee .    ah  i knew you wouldn t let us down  old friend   said dangerous beans .   i have always said that we can depend on maurice  at least .   he sighed deeply .    yes   said darktan  giving maurice a much more knowing look .   depend on him to do what  though .     oh   said maurice .   er .  good .  i ve found you all  then .     yes   said darktan  in what maurice thought was a nasty tone of voice .   amazing  isn t it .  i expect you ve been looking for a long time  too .  i saw you rush off to look for us .     can you help us .   said dangerous beans .   we need a plan .     ah  right   said maurice .   i suggest we go upwards at every opportun     to rescue hamnpork  said darktan .   we don t leave our people behind .     we don t .   said maurice .    we don t   said darktan .    and then there s the kid   said peaches .   sardines says he s tied up with the female kid in one of the cellars .     oh  well  you know  humans   said maurice  wrinkling his face .   humans and humans  you know  it s a human kind of thing  i don t think we should meddle  could be misunderstood  i know about humans  they ll sort it out    i don t care a ferret s shrlt for humans .   snapped darktan .   but those rat catchers took hamnpork off in a sack .  you saw that room  cat .  you saw the rats crammed in cages .  it s the rat catchers who are stealing the food .  sardines says there s sacks and sacks of food .  and there s something else       a voice   said maurice  before he could stop himself .   darktan looked up  wild eyed .   you heard it .   he said .   i thought it was just us .     the rat catchers can hear it too   said maurice .   only they think it s their own thoughts .     it frightened the others   mumbled dangerous beans .   they just    stopped thinking     he looked absolutely dejected .  open beside him  grubby with dirt and paw marks  was mr bunnsy has an adventure .   even toxie ran off   he went on .   and he knows how to write .  how can that happen .     it seemed to affect some of us more than others   said darktan  in a more matter of fact voice .   i ve sent some of the more sensible ones out to try and round up the rest  but it s going to be a long job .  they were just running blindly .  we ve got to get hamnpork .  he s the leader .  we re rats  after all .  a clan .  rats will follow the leader .     but he s a bit old  and you re the tough one  and he s not exactly the brains of the outfit   maurice began .    they took him away .   said darktan .   they re ratcatchers .  he s one of us .  are you going to help or not .    maurice thought he heard a scrabbling noise at the other end of his pipe .  he couldn t turn around to check  and he suddenly felt very exposed .   yeah  help you  yeah  yeah   he said hurriedly .    ahem .  do you really mean that  maurice .   said peaches .    yeah  yeah  right   said maurice .  he crawled out of the pipe and looked back along it .  there was no sign of any rats .    sardines is following the rat catchers   said darktan  so we ll find out where they re taking him     i ve got a bad feeling that i already know   said maurice .    how .   snapped peaches .    i m a cat  right .   said maurice .   cats hang around places .  we see things .  a lot of places don t mind cats wandering  right  because we keep down the vermi we keep the  er     all right  all right  we know you don t eat anyone who can talk  you keep telling us   said peaches .   get on with it .     i was in a place once  it was a barn  i was up in the hayloft  where you can always find a  er    peaches rolled her eyes .   yes  yes  go on .     well  anyway  all these men came in and i couldn t get away because they had lots of dogs and they shut the barn doors and  er  they put up this kind of  kind of big round wooden wall in the middle of the floor  and there were some men with boxes of rats and they tipped rats into the ring and then  and then they put some dogs in  too .  terriers   he added  trying to avoid their expressions .    the rats fought the dogs .   said darktan .    well  i suppose they could have done   said maurice .   they mostly ran around and around .  it s called rat coursing .  the rat catchers bring the rats along  of course .  alive .     rat coursing     said darktan .   how is it we ve never heard of this .    maurice blinked at him .  for clever creatures  the rats could be amazingly stupid at times .   why would you hear about it .   he said .    surely one of the rats who  .     you don t seem to understand   said maurice .   the rats that go into the pit don t come out .  at least  not breathing .    there was silence .    can t they jump out .   asked peaches in a little voice .    too high   said maurice .    why don t they fight the dogs .   said darktan .   really  really stupid  maurice thought .    because they re rats  darktan   said maurice .   lots of rats .  all stinking of one another s fear and panic .  you know how it happens .     i bit a dog on the nose once .   said darktan .    right  right   said maurice soothingly .   one rat can think and be brave  right .  but a bunch of rats is a mob .  a bunch of rats is just a big animal with lots of legs and no brain .     that s not true .   said peaches .   together we are strong .     exactly how high .   said darktan  who was staring at the candlelight as if seeing pictures in it .    what .   asked peaches and maurice together .    the wall    how high  exactly .     huh .  i don t know .  high .  humans were leaning their elbows on it .  does it matter .  it s far too high for a rat to jump  i know that .     everything we ve done we ve done because we ve stuck together   peaches began .    we ll rescue hamnpork together  then   said darktan .   we ll   he spun around at the sound of a rat coming along the pipe  and then wrinkled his nose .   it s sardines   he said .   and    let s see  smells female  young  nervous    nourishing .    the youngest member of the trap disposal squad was trailing after sardines .  she was wet and dejected .    you look like a drowned rat  miss   said darktan .    fell in a broken drain  sir   said nourishing .    good to see you  anyway .  what s happening  sardines .    the dancing rat did a few nervous steps .   i ve been climbing up more drainpipes and along more washing lines than is good for me   he said .   and don t ask me about krrkk cats  boss  i d like to see every last one of  em dead savin  yer honour s presence  o course   sardines added  eyeing maurice nervously .    and .   said peaches .    they ve gone to some kind of stables right on the edge of the town   said sardines .   smells bad .  lots of dogs around .  men  too .     rat pit   said maurice .   i told you .  they ve been breeding rats for the rat pit .     right   said darktan .   we re going to get hamnpork out of there .  sardines  you will show me the way .  we ll try to pick up others as we go .  the rest of you should try to find the kid .     why are you giving orders .   said peaches .    because someone has to   said darktan .   hamnpork might be a bit scabby and set in his ways but he s the leader and everyone smells that and we need him .  any questions .  right     can i come  sir .   said nourishing .    she s helping me carry my string  boss   sardines explained .  both he and the younger rat were carrying bundles of it .    you need all of that .   said darktan .    you should never say no to a piece of string  boss   said sardines earnestly .   it s amazing  some of the stuff i ve been finding     all right  so long as she s useful for something   said darktan .   she d better be able to keep up .  let s go .    and then there was just dangerous beans  peaches  and maurice .   dangerous beans sighed .   one rat can be brave  but a bunch of rats is just a mob .   he said .   are you right  maurice .     no  i was    look  there was something back there   said maurice .   it s in a cellar .  i don t know what it is .  it s the voice that gets into people s heads .     not everyone   said peaches .   it didn t frighten you  did it .  or us .  or darktan .  it made hamnpork very angry .  why .    maurice blinked .  he could hear the voice in his head again .  it was very faint  and it certainly wasn t his own thoughts  and it said i will find a way in  cat .    did you hear that .   he said .    i didn t hear anything   said peaches .   perhaps you have to be close  maurice thought .  perhaps  if you ve been close  it knows where your head lives .   he d never seen a rat so miserable as dangerous beans .  the little rat was huddled by the candle  staring unseeing at mr bunnsy has an adventure .    i hoped it would be better than this   said dangerous beans .   but it turns out we re just    rats .  as soon as there s trouble  we re just    rats .    it was very unusual for maurice to feel sympathetic to anyone who wasn t maurice .  in a cat  that is a major character flaw .  i must be ill  he thought .   if it s any help  i m just a cat   he said .    oh  but you are not .  you are kind and  deep down  i sense that you have a generous nature   said dangerous beans .   maurice tried not to look at peaches .  oh boy  he thought .    at least you ask people before you eat them   said peaches .   you d better tell them  said maurice s thoughts .  go on  tell them .  you d feel better .   maurice tried to tell his thoughts to shut up .  what a time to get a conscience .  what good was a cat with a conscience .  a cat with a conscience was a    a hamster  or something      um  i ve been meaning to talk to you about that   he muttered .   go on  tell them  said his shiny new conscience .  get it out in the open .    yes .   said peaches .   maurice squirmed .   well  you know i do always check my food these days       yes  and it does you great credit   said dangerous beans .   now maurice felt even worse .   well  you know how we ve always wondered how come i got changed even though i never ate any of that magical stuff on the dump       yes   said peaches .   that has always puzzled me .    maurice shifted uneasily .   well  you know    er    did you ever know a rat  quite big  one ear missing  bit of white fur on one side  couldn t run too fast  cos of a bad leg .     that sounds like additives   said peaches .    oh  yes   said dangerous beans .   he disappeared before we met you  maurice .  a good rat .  had a bit of a speech    difficulty .     speech difficulty   said maurice  gloomily .    he stammered   said peaches  giving maurice a long  cool stare .   couldn t get his words out very easily .     not very easily   said maurice  his voice now quite hollow .    but i m sure you never met him  maurice   said dangerous beans .   i miss him .  he was a wonderful rat once you got him talking .     ahem .  did you meet him  maurice .   said peaches  her stare nailing him to the wall .   maurice s face moved .  it tried various expressions one after another .  then he said   all right .  i ate him  ok .  all of him .  except for the tail and the green wobbly bit and that nasty purple lump  no one knows what it is .  i was just a cat .  i hadn t learned to think yet .  i didn t know .  i was hungry .  cats eat rats  that s how it goes .  it wasn t my fault .  and he d been eating the magic stuff and i ate him so then i got changed too .  know how that feels  seeing the green wobbly bit like that .  it doesn t feel good .  sometimes on dark nights i think i can hear him talking down there .  all right .  satisfied .  i didn t know he was anyone .  i didn t know i was anyone .  i ate him .  he d been eating the stuff on the dump and i ate him so that s how i got changed .  i admit it .  i ate him .  it wasn t my faauulltt .    and then there was silence .  after a while peaches said   yes  but that was a long time ago  wasn t it .     what .  you mean have i eaten anyone lately .  no .     are you sorry for what you did .   said dangerous beans .    sorry .  what do you think .  sometimes i have nightmares where i burp and he     then that s probably all right   said the little rat .    all right .   said maurice .   how can it be all right .  and you know the worst part .  i m a cat .  cats don t go round feeling sorry .  or guilty .  we never regret anything .  do you know what it feels like  saying  hello food  can you talk .   that s not how a cat is supposed to behave .     we don t act how rats are supposed to behave   said dangerous beans .  and then his face fell again .   up until now   he sighed .    everyone was frightened   said peaches .   fear spreads .     i hoped we could be more than rats   said dangerous beans .   i thought we could be more than things that squeak and widdle  whatever hamnpork says .  and now    where is everyone .     shall i read to you from mr bunnsy .   said peaches  her voice full of concern .   you know that always cheers you up when you re in one of your    dark times .    there was a nod from dangerous beans .   peaches pulled the huge book towards her and began to read .   one day mr bunnsy and his friend ratty rupert the rat went to see old man donkey  who lived by the river     read the bit where they talk to the humans   said dangerous beans .   peaches obediently turned a page .    hello  ratty rupert   said farmer fred .   what a lovely day it is  to be sure     this is mad  thought maurice  as he listened to a story about wild woods and fresh bubbling streams  being read to one rat by another rat while they sat beside a drain along which ran something that certainly wasn t fresh .  anything but fresh .  to be fair  though  it was bubbling a bit  or at least glooping .   everything s going down the drain and they have this little picture in their heads about how nice things could be     look at those little pink sad eyes  said maurice s own thoughts in maurice s own head .  look at those little wobbly wrinkly noses .  if you ran out on them and left them here  how could you look those little wobbly noses in the face again .    i wouldn t have to   said maurice  out loud .   that s the point .     what .   said peaches  looking up from the book .    oh  nothing     maurice paused .  there was nothing for it .  it went against everything a cat stood for .  this is what thinking does for you  he thought .  it gets you into trouble .  even when you know other people can think for themselves  you start thinking for them too .  he groaned .    we d better see what s happened to the kid   he said .   it was completely black in the cellar .  all there was  apart from the occasional drip of water  were voices .    so   said the voice of malicia   let s go over it again  shall we .  you don t have a knife of any kind .     that s right   said keith .    or some handy matches that could burn through the rope .     no .     and no sharp edge near you that you could rub the rope on .     no .     and you can t sort of pull your legs through your arms so that you can get your hands in front of you .     no .     and you don t have any secret powers .     no .     are you sure .  the moment i saw you  i thought  he s got some amazing power that will probably manifest itself when he s in dire trouble .  i thought  no one could really be as useless as that unless it was a disguise .     no .  i m sure .  look  i m just a normal person .  yes  all right  i was abandoned as a baby .  i don t know why .  it was something that happened .  they say it happens quite a lot .  it doesn t make you special .  and i don t have any secret markings as if i was some kind of sheep  and i don t think i m a hero in disguise and i don t have some kind of amazing talent that i m aware of .  ok  i m good at playing quite a few musical instruments .  i practise a lot .  but i m the kind of person heroes aren t .  i get by and i get along .  i do my best .  understand .     oh .     you should have found someone else .     in fact  you can t be any help at all .     no .    there was silence for a while and then malicia said   you know  in many ways i don t think this adventure has been properly organized .     oh  really .   said keith .    this is not how people should be tied up .     malicia  do you understand .  this isn t a story   said keith  as patiently as he could .   that s what i m trying to tell you .  real life isn t a story .  there isn t some kind of    of magic that keeps you safe and makes crooks look the other way and not hit you too hard and tie you up next to a handy knife and not kill you .  do you understand .    there was some more dark silence .    my granny and my great aunt were very famous story tellers  you know   said malicia eventually  in a strained little voice .   agoniza and eviscera grim .     you said   said keith .    my mother would have been a good story teller  too  but my father doesn t like stories .  that s why i ve changed my name to grim for professional purposes .     really       i used to get beaten when i was small for telling stories   malicia went on .    beaten .   said keith .    all right  then  smacked   said malicia .   on the leg .  but it did hurt .  my father says you can t run a city on stories .  he says you have to be practical .     oh .     aren t you interested in anything except music .  he broke your pipe .     i expect i ll buy another one .    the calm voice infuriated malicia .   well  i ll tell you something   she said .   if you don t turn your life into a story  you just become a part of someone else s story .     and what if your story doesn t work .     you keep changing it until you find one that does .     sounds silly .     huh  look at you .  you re just a face in someone else s background .  you let a cat make all the decisions .     that s because maurice is    a voice said   would you like us to go away until you ve stopped being human .     maurice .   said keith .   where are you .     i m in a drain and believe me  this has not been a good night .  do you know how many old cellars there are here .   said the voice of maurice  in the blackness .   peaches is bringing a candle in .  it s too dark even for me to see you .     who s peaches .   whispered malicia .    she s another changeling .  a thinking rat   said keith .    like pilchards .     like sardines  yes .     aha   hissed malicia .   see .  a story .  i am smug  i gloat .  the plucky rats rescue our heroes  probably by gnawing through the ropes .     oh  we re back in your story  are we .   said keith .   and what am i in your story .     i know it s not going to be romantic interest   said malicia .   and you re not funny enough for comic relief .  i don t know .  probably just    someone .  you know  like  man in street   something like that .   there were faint sounds in the darkness .   what are they doing now .   she whispered .    trying to light their candle  i think .     rats play with fire .   malicia hissed .    they don t play .  dangerous beans thinks lights and shadows are very important .  they always have a candle alight somewhere in their tunnels  wherever they     dangerous beans .  what sort of name is that .     shssh .  they just learned words off old food tins and signs and things .  they didn t know what the words meant  they just chose them because they liked the sounds .     yes  but    dangerous beans .  it sounds as if he makes you    it s his name .  don t make fun of it .     sorry  i m sure   said malicia  haughtily .   the match flared .  the candle flame grew .   malicia looked down at two rats .  one was    well  just a small rat  although sleeker than most of the ones she d seen .  in fact most of the ones she d seen had been dead  but even the living ones had always been    twitchy  nervy  sniffing the air all the time .  this one just    watched .  it stared right at her .   the other rat was white  and even smaller .  it was also watching her  although peering was a better word .  it had pink eyes .  malicia had never been very interested in other people s feelings  since she d always considered that her own were a lot more interesting  but there was something sad and worrying about that rat .   it was dragging a small book  or at least what would be a small book to a human  it was about half the size of a rat .  the cover was quite colourful  but malicia couldn t make out what it was .    peaches and dangerous beans   said keith .   this is malicia .  her father is the mayor here .     hello   said dangerous beans .    mayor .  isn t that like government .   said peaches .   maurice says governments are very dangerous criminals and steal money from people .     how did you teach them to speak .   said malicia .    they taught themselves   said keith .   they re not trained animals  you know .     well  my father does not steal from anyone .  who taught them that governments are very  .      scuse me   scuse me   said maurice s voice hurriedly  from the drain gate .   that s right  i m down here .  can we get on with things .     we d like you to gnaw at our ropes  please   said keith .    i ve got a bit of broken knife blade   said peaches .   it s for sharpening the pencil .  would that be better .     knife .   said malicia .   pencil .     i did say they weren t ordinary rats   said keith .   nourishing had to run to keep up with darktan .  and darktan was running because he had to run to keep up with sardines .  when it came to moving fast across a town  sardines was champion of the world .   they picked up more rats on the way .  nourishing couldn t help noticing that these were mostly the younger ones  who d fled because of the terror but hadn t gone far .  they fell in behind darktan readily  almost grateful to be doing something with a purpose .   sardines danced on ahead .  he just couldn t help it .  and he liked drainpipes  roofs and gutters .  you got no dogs up there  he said  and not many cats .   no cat could have followed sardines .  the people of bad blintz had strung washing lines between the ancient houses and he leapt onto them  clinging upside down and moving as fast as he would on a flat surface .  he went straight up walls  plunged through thatch  tap danced around smoking chimneys  slid down tiles .  pigeons erupted from their roosts as he sped past  the other rats trailing behind him .   clouds rolled across the moon .   sardines reached the edge of a roof and leapt  landing on a wall just below .  he ran along the top and disappeared in the crack between two planks .   nourishing followed him into a kind of loft .  hay was piled in parts of it  but a larger part was simply open to the ground floor below  and supported by several heavy beams that ran right across the building .  bright light shone up from below  and there was the buzz of human voices and   she shuddered   the barking of dogs .    this is a big stables  boss   said sardines .   the pit s under the beam over there .  come on      they crept out on the ancient woodwork and peered over the edge .   far below was a wooden circle  like half a giant barrel .  nourishing realized that they were right over the pit  if she fell now  she d land in the middle of it .  men were crowded around it .  dogs were tied up around the walls  barking at one another and at the universe in general in the mad  i m going to do this for ever way of all dogs .  and off to one side was a stack of boxes and sacks .   the sacks were moving .    crtlk .  how the krrp will we find hamnpork in this lot .   darktan said  his eyes gleaming in the light from below .    well  with old hamnpork  boss  i reckon we ll know when he turns up   said sardines .    could you drop into the pit on a string .     i m game for anything  guv   said sardines  loyally .    into a pit with a dog in it  sir .   said nourishing .   and won t the string cut you in half .     ah  i ve got something that helps there  boss   said sardines .  he took off his thick coil of string and put it aside .  there was another coil under it  glistening and light brown .  he pulled at a piece of it  and it snapped back with a faint  twang  .   bands of rubber   he said .   i pinched them off a desk when i was looking for more string .  i ve used  em before  boss .  very handy for a long drop  boss .    darktan took a step back on the boards .  there was an old candle lantern there  lying on its side  the glass smashed  the candle eaten long ago .   good   he said .   because i ve got an idea .  if you can drop down    there was a roar from below .  the rats looked over the beam again .   the circle of heads had thickened around the lip of the pit .  a man was talking in a loud voice .  occasionally there was a cheer .  the black top hats of the rat catchers moved through the crowd .  seen from above  they were sinister black blobs among the grey and brown caps .   one of the rat catchers emptied a sack into the pit  and the watchers saw the dark shapes of rats scurrying in a panic  as they tried to find  in that circle  a corner to hide in .   the crowd opened slightly and a man walked to the edge of the pit  holding a terrier .  there was some more shouting  a ripple of laughter  and the dog was dropped in with the rats .   the changelings stared down at the circle of death  and the cheering humans .   after a minute or two nourishing tore her gaze away .  when she looked around she caught the expression on darktan s face .  maybe it wasn t just the lamplight that made his eyes full of fire .  she saw him look along the stable to the big doors at the far end .  they had been barred shut .  then his head turned to the hay and straw piled up in the loft  and in the cribs and mangers below .   darktan pulled a length of wood out of one of his belts .   nourishing smelled the sulphur in the red blob on the end .   it was a match .   darktan turned and saw him staring at her .  he nodded towards the piles of hay in the loft .   my plan might not work   he said .   if it doesn t  you ll be in charge of the other plan .     me .   said nourishing .    you .  because i won t be    around   said darktan .  he held out the match .   you know what to do   he said  nodding to the nearest rack of hay .   nourishing swallowed .   yes .  yes  i think so .  er    when .     when the time comes .  you ll know when   said darktan  and looked back down at the massacre .   one way or the other  i want them to remember tonight   he said quietly .   they ll remember what they did .  and they ll remember what we did .  for as long as they    live .    hamnpork lay in his sack .  he could smell the other rats nearby  and the dogs  and the blood .  especially the blood .   he could hear his own thoughts  but they were like a little chirp of insects against the thunderstorm of his senses .  bits of memory danced in front of his eyes .  cages .  panic .  the white rat .  hamnpork .  that was his own name .  odd .  never used to have names .  just used to smell other rats .  darkness .  darkness inside  behind the eyes .  that bit was hamnpork .  everything outside was everything else .   hamnpork .  me .  leader .   the red hot rage still boiled inside him but now it had a kind of shape  like the shape a canyon gives to a river in flood  narrowing it  forcing it to flow faster  giving it direction .   now he could hear voices .        just slip him in  no one ll notice           ok  i ll shake it up a bit first to get him angry      the sack was jerked around .  it didn t make hamnpork any more angry than he was already .  there wasn t any room for more anger .   the sack swung as it was carried .  the roar of humans grew louder  the smells grew stronger .  there was a moment of silence  the sack was upturned  and hamnpork slid out into a roar of noise and a pile of struggling rats .   he snapped and clawed his way to the top as the rats scattered  and saw a growling dog being lowered into the pit .  it snatched up a rat  shook it vigorously  and sent the limp body flying .   the rats stampeded .    idiots .   screamed hamnpork .   work together .  you could strip this fleabag to the bone .    the crowd stopped shouting .   the dog stared down its nose at hamnpork .  it was trying to think .  the rat had spoken .  only humans spoke .  and it didn t smell right .  rats stank of panic .  this one didn t .   the silence rang like a bell .   then jacko grabbed the rat  shook him  not too hard  and tossed him down .  he d decided to do a sort of test  rats shouldn t be able to talk like humans  but this rat looked like a rat   and killing rats was ok   but talked like a human   and biting humans got you a serious thrashing .  he had to find out for sure .  if he got a wallop  this rat was a human .   hamnpork rolled  and managed to get upright  but there was a deep tooth wound in his side .   the other rats were still in a boiling huddle as far away from the dog as possible  every rat trying to be the one at the bottom .   hamnpork spat blood .   all right  then   he snarled  advancing on the puzzled dog .   now you find out how a real rat dies .     hamnpork .    he looked up .   string uncoiled behind sardines as he fell through the smoky air towards the frantic circle .  he was right above hamnpork  getting bigger and bigger         and slower and slower     he came to a stop between the dog and the rat .  for a moment he hung there .  he raised his hat  politely  and said   good evening .   then he wrapped all four legs around hamnpork .   and now the rope of elastic bands  stretched to twanging point  finally sprang back .  too late  too late  jacko snapped at empty air .  the rats were accelerated upwards  out of the pit and stopped  bouncing in mid air  just out of reach .   the dog was still looking up when darktan leapt off the other side of the beam .  as the crowd stared in astonishment  he plummeted down towards the terrier .   jacko s eyes narrowed .  rats disappearing into the air was one thing  but rats dropping right towards his mouth was something else .  it was rat on a plate  it was rat on a stick .   darktan looked back as he fell .  up above  nourishing was doing some frantic knotting and biting .  now darktan was on the other end of sardines  string .  but sardines had explained things very carefully .  darktan s weight alone wasn t heavy enough to pull the weight of two other rats back up to the beam     so  when darktan saw sardines and his struggling passenger had disappeared safely into the gloom of the roof    he let go of the big old candle lamp he d been holding for the extra weight and bit through the rope .   the lamp landed heavily on jacko and darktan landed on the lamp  rolling down onto the floor .   the crowd was silent .  they d been silent since hamnpork had been propelled out of the pit .  around the top of the wall which  yes  was far too high for a rat to jump  darktan saw faces .  they were mostly red .  the mouths were mostly open .  the silence was the silence of red faces drawing breath ready to start shouting at any moment .   around darktan the surviving rats were scrambling aimlessly for a foothold on the wall .  fools  he thought .  four or five of you together could make any dog wish you d never been born .  but you scrabble and panic and you get picked off one at a time     the slightly stunned jacko blinked and stared down at darktan  a growl rising in his throat .    right  you kkrrkk   said darktan  loud enough for the watchers to hear .   now i m going to show you how a rat can live .    he attacked .   jacko was not a bad dog  according to the way of dogs .  he was a terrier and liked killing rats in any case  and killing lots of rats in the pit meant that he got well fed and called a good boy and wasn t kicked very often .  some rats did fight back and that wasn t much of a problem  because they were smaller than jacko and he had a lot more teeth .  jacko wasn t that smart  but he was a lot smarter than a rat and  in any case  his nose and mouth did most of the thinking .   and he was surprised  therefore  when his jaws snapped shut on this new rat and it wasn t there .   darktan didn t run like a rat should .  he ducked like a fighter .  he nipped jacko under the chin and vanished .  jacko spun around .  the rat still wasn t there .  jacko had spent his show business career biting rats that tried to run away .  rats that stayed really close were unfair .   there was a roar from the watchers .  someone shouted   ten dollars on the rat .   and someone else punched him in the ear .  another man started to climb into the pit .  someone smashed a beer bottle on that man s head .   dancing back and forth under the spinning  yapping jacko  darktan waited for his moment         and saw it  and lunged  and bit hard .   jacko s eyes crossed .  a piece of jacko that was very private and of interest only to jacko and any lady dogs he might happen to meet was suddenly a little ball of pain .   he yelped .  he snapped at the air .  and then  in the uproar  he tried to climb out of the pit .  his claws scraped desperately as he reared up against the greasy  smooth planking .   darktan jumped onto his tail  ran up his back  scampered to the tip of jacko s nose  and leapt over the wall .   he landed among legs .  men tried to stamp on him  but that meant other men would have to give them room .  by the time they d elbowed one another out of the way and stamped heavily on one another s boots  darktan was gone .   but there were other dogs .  they were half mad with excitement in any case  and now they pulled away from ropes and chains and set off after a running rat .  they knew about chasing rats .   darktan knew about running .  he sped across the floor like a comet  with a tail of snarling  barking dogs  headed for the shadows  spied a hole in the planking and dived through into the nice  safe  darkness   click went the trap .       chapter     farmer fred opened his door and saw all the animals of furry bottom waiting for him .   we can t find mr bunnsy or ratty rupert .   they cried .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure     at last .   said malicia  shaking the ropes off .   somehow i thought rats would gnaw quicker .     they used a knife   said keith .   and you could say thank you  couldn t you .     yes  yes  tell them i m very grateful   said malicia  pushing herself upright .    tell them yourself .     i m sorry  i find it so embarrassing to    talk to rats .     i suppose that s understandable   said keith .   if you ve been brought up to hate them because they     oh  it s not that   said malicia  walking over to the door and looking at the keyhole .   it s just that it s so    childish .  so    tinkly winkly .  so    mr bunnsy .     mr bunnsy .   squeaked peaches  and it really was a squeak  a word that came out as a sort of little shriek .    what about mr bunnsy .   said keith .   malicia reached into her pocket and pulled out her packet of bent hair pins .   oh  some books some silly woman wrote   she said  poking at the lock .   stupid stuff for ickle kids .  there s a rat and a rabbit and a snake and a hen and an owl and they all go around wearing clothes and talking to humans and everyone s so nice and cosy it makes you absolutely sick .  d you know my father kept them all from when he was a kid .  mr bunnsy has an adventure  mr bunnsy s busy day  ratty rupert sees it through    he read them all to me when i was small and there s not an interesting murder in any of them .     i think you d better stop   said keith .  he didn t dare look down at the rats .    there s no sub texts  no social commentary     malicia went on  still fiddling .   the most interesting thing that happens at all is when doris the duck loses a shoe   a duck losing a shoe  right .    and it turns up under the bed after they ve spent the entire story looking for it .  do you call that narrative tension .  because i don t .  if people are going to make up stupid stories about animals pretending to be human  at least there could be a bit of interesting violence       oh  boy   said maurice  from behind the grating .   this time keith did look down .  peaches and dangerous beans had gone .   you know  i never had the heart to tell them   he said  not to anyone in particular .   they thought it was all true .     in the land of furry bottom  possibly   said malicia  and stood up as the lock gave a final click .   but not here .  can you imagine someone actually invented that name and didn t laugh .  let s go .     you upset them   said keith .    look  shall we get out of here before the rat catchers come back .   said malicia .   the thing about this girl  maurice thought  was that she was no good at all at listening to the way people spoke .  she wasn t much good at listening  if it came to that .    no   said keith .    no what .     no  i m not coming with you   said keith .   there s something bad going on here  much worse than stupid men stealing food .    maurice watched them argue again .  humans  eh .  think they re lords of creation .  not like us cats .  we know we are .  ever see a cat feed a human .  case proven .   how the humans shout  hissed a tiny voice in his head .   is that my conscience .  maurice thought .  his own thoughts said  what  me .  no .  but i feel a lot better now you told them about additives .  he shifted uneasily from paw to paw .   well then   he whispered  looking at his stomach   is that you  additives .    he d been worried about that ever since he d realized he d eaten a changeling .  they had voices  right .  supposing you ate one .  suppose their voice stayed inside you .  suppose the    the dream of additives around inside him .  that sort of thing could seriously interfere with a cat s napping time  it really could .   no  said the voice  like the sound of wind in distant trees  it is i .  i am    spider .    oh  you re a spider .   whispered thought maurice .   i could take on a spider with three paws tied behind my back .    not a spider .  spider .   the word actually hurt .  it hadn t before .   now i m in your head  cat .  cats  cats  bad as dogs  worse than rats .  i m in your head  and i will never go away  .   maurice s paw jerked .   i ll be in your dreams  .    look  i m just passing through   maurice whispered desperately .   i m not looking for trouble .  i m unreliable .  i m a cat .  i wouldn t trust me  and i am me .  just let me get into the nice fresh air and i ll be right out of your    hair or legs or furry bits or whatever .    you don t want to run away  .   that s right  thought maurice  i don t want to run hold on  i do want to run away .    i m a cat .   he muttered .   no rat is going to control me .  you ve tried .    yes  came the voice of spider  but then you were strong .  now your little mind runs in circles and wants someone else to do the thinking for it .  i can think for you .   i can think for everyone  .   i will always be with you  .   the voice faded away .   right  thought maurice .  time to say farewell  then  bad blintz .  the party is over .  the rats have got lots of other rats and even these two humans have got one another  but i ve just got me and i d like to get me somewhere where strange voices don t talk to me .     scuse me   he said  raising his voice .   are we going or what .    the two humans turned to look at the grating .    what .   said keith .    i d prefer going   said maurice .   pull this grating out  will you .  it s rusted right through  it shouldn t be a problem .  good lad .  and then we can make a run for it     they ve called in a rat piper  maurice   said keith .   and the clan is all over the place .  he ll be here in the morning .  a real rat piper  maurice .  not a fake one like me .  they have magical pipes  you know .  do you want to see that happen to our rats .    his new conscience gave maurice a good kicking .   well  not exactly see   he said reluctantly .   not as such  no .     right .  so we re not going to run away   said keith .    oh .  and what are we going to do  then .   said malicia .    we re going to talk to the rat catchers when they come back   said keith .  he had a thoughtful look .    and what makes you think they ll want to talk to us .     because if they don t talk to us   said keith  they re going to die .    it was twenty minutes later that the rat catchers arrived .  the door of their hut was unlocked  thrown back  then slammed shut .  rat catcher   bolted it  as well .   you know where you said it was going to be such a good evening .   he said  leaning against it and panting .   tell me about it again   cos i think i missed that part .     shut up   said rat catcher   .    someone punched me in the eye .     shut up .     and i think i lost my wallet .  that s twenty dollars i won t see again in a hurry .     shut up .     and i wasn t able to pick up any of the surviving rats from the last fight .     shut up .     and we left the dogs behind  too .  we could ve stopped to untie  em .  someone ll pinch  em .     shut up .     do rats often whizz through the air like that .  or is that the kind of thing you only get to hear about when you are a hexperienced rat catcher .     did i say shut up .     yes .     shut up .  all right  we ll leave right now .  we ll take the money and nick a boat down at the jetty  ok .  we ll leave the stuff we haven t sold and just go .     just like that .  johnny no hands and his lads are coming upriver tomorrow night to pick up the next load and     we ll go  bill .  i can smell things going bad .     just like that .  he owes us two hundred doll     yes .  just like that .  time to move on .  the jig is up  the bird has flown  and the cat is out of the bag .  the did you say that .     say what .     did you just say  i wish i was  .     me .  no .    the rat catcher looked around the shed .  there was no one else there .   all right  then   he said .   it s been a long night .  look  when things start to go bad  then it s time to go away .  nothing fancy .  we just go  right .  i don t want to be here when people come looking for us .  and i don t want to meet any of them rat pipers .  they are sharp men .  they pry around .  and they cost a lot of money .  people are going to ask questions  and the only question i want them to ask is  where did the rat catchers go .   understand .  it s a good man who knows when to quit .  what s in the kitty  .  what did you say .     what  me .  nothing .  cup of tea .  you always feel better after a cup of tea .     didn t you say  kitty yourself  .   rat catcher   demanded .    i just asked if you wanted a cup of tea .  honest .  are you all right .    rat catcher   stared at his friend  as if trying to see a lie in his face .  then he said   yeah  yeah .  i m fine .  three sugars  then .     that s right   said rat catcher    spooning it in .   keep up the blood sugar .  you have to look after yourself .    rat catcher   took the mug  sipped the tea  and stared at the swirling surface .   how did we get into this .   he said .   i mean  all this .  y know .  sometimes i wake up in the night and think  it s stupid  this  and then i come to work and it all seems  well  sensible .  i mean  stealin  stuff and blaming it on the rats  yes  and breeding big tough rats for the rat pits and bringing back the ones that survive so we can breed even bigger rats  yes  but    i dunno    i didn t used to be the kind of bloke that ties up kids       we ve made a big wad of cash  though .     yeah .   rat catcher   swirled the tea in his mug and took another drink .   there s that  i suppose .  is this a new tea .     no  it s just lord green  like normal .     tastes a bit different .   rat catcher   drained the mug and put it on the bench .   ok  let s get the     that s about enough   said a voice overhead .   now  stand still and listen to me .  if you run away  you ll die .  if you talk too much  you ll die .  if you wait too long  you ll die .  if you think you re smart  you ll die .  any questions .    a few wisps of dust drifted down from the rafters .  the rat catchers looked up  and saw a cat face peering down .    it s that kid s damn mog .   said rat catcher   .   i told you it was looking at me in a funny way .     if i was you  i wouldn t look at me   said maurice  conversationally .   i d look at the rat poison .    rat catcher   turned to look at the table .   here  who stole some of the poison .   he said .    oh   said rat catcher    who was a much faster thinker .    steal it .   said the cat on high .   we don t steal .  that s thieving .  we just put it somewhere else .     oh   said rat catcher    sitting down suddenly .    that s dangerous stuff .   said rat catcher    looking for something to throw .   you had no business touching it .  you tell me where it is right now .    there was a thump as the trapdoor in the floor slammed back .  keith stuck his head up  and then came up the ladder while the rat catchers watched in amazement .   he was holding a crumpled paper bag .    oh dear   said rat catcher   .    what have you done with the poison .   rat catcher   demanded .    well   said keith   now that you mention it  i think i put most of it in the sugar      darktan woke up .  his back was on fire and he couldn t breathe .  he could feel the weight of the trap s jaw pressing down on him  and the dreadful bite of the steel teeth on his belly .   i shouldn t be alive  he thought .  i wish i wasn t     he tried to push himself upwards  which made it worse .  the pain came back a little stronger as he sagged down again .   caught like a rat in a trap  he thought .   i wonder what type it is .    darktan .    the voice was a little way off .  darktan tried to speak  but every tiny movement pushed him further into the teeth below him .    darktan .    darktan managed a faint squeak .  words hurt too much .   feet scrabbled forward in the dry darkness .    darktan .    it smelled like nourishing .    gnh   darktan managed  trying to turn his head .    you re caught in a trap .    that was too much for darktan  even if every word was agony .   oh    really .   he said .    i ll go and fetch s sardines  shall i .   stammered nourishing .   darktan could smell the rat s panic begin .  and there wasn t time for panic .   no .  tell    me     he panted       what    kind    of    trap .     er    er    er     said nourishing .   darktan took a deep  fiery breath .   think  you    miserable widdler .     er  er    it s all rusty    er    rust everywhere .  looks like    er    could be a    breakback     there was a scratching noise behind darktan .   yes .  i gnawed the rust off .  it says nugent brothers breakback mk .     sir .    darktan tried to think as the constant  dreadful pressure squeezed him further .  mk .    .  ancient .  something out of the dawn of time .  the oldest he d ever seen was an improved breakback mk .    .  and all he had to help him was nourishing  a complete drrtlt with four left feet .    can you    see how    .   he began  but there were purple lights in front of his eyes now  a great tunnel of purple lights .  he tried again  as he felt himself drift towards the lights .   can    you    see    how    the    spring     .     it s all rusted  sir .   came the panicking voice .   it looks like it s a non return action like on the jenkins and jenkins big snapper  sir  but it hasn t got the hook on the end .  what does this bit do  sir .  sir .  sir .    darktan felt the pain go away .  so this is how it happens  he thought dreamily .  too late now .  she ll panic  and she ll run .  that s what we do .  when we re in trouble  we bolt for the first hole .  but it doesn t matter .  it is just like a dream  after all .  nothing to worry about .  quite nice  really .  perhaps there really is a big rat deep under the ground .  that d be nice .   he drifted happily  in the warm silence .  there were bad things happening  but they were a long way off and they didn t matter any more     he thought he heard a sound behind him  like rats  claws moving across a stone floor .  perhaps it s nourishing running away  part of him thought .  but another part thought  perhaps it is the bone rat .   the idea didn t frighten him .  nothing could frighten him here .  anything bad that could happen already had .  he felt that if he turned his head  he d see something .  but it was easier just to float in this big warm space .   the purple light was darkening now  to a deep blue and  in the centre of the blue  a circle of black .   it looked like a rat tunnel .   and that s where he lives  thought darktan .  that s the tunnel of the big rat .  how simple it all is     a shining white dot appeared in the centre of the tunnel and got bigger quickly .   and here he comes  thought darktan .  he must know a lot  the big rat .  i wonder what he s going to tell me .   the light grew bigger  and did indeed begin to look like a rat .   how strange  thought darktan  as the blue light faded into the black  to find it s all true .  off we go  then  into the tunn   there was noise .  it filled the world .  and the terrible  terrible pain was back .  and the big rat shouted  in the voice of nourishing    i gnawed through the spring  sir .  i gnawed through the spring .  it was old and weak  sir .  prob ly why you weren t cut in half  sir .  can you hear me  sir .  darktan .  sir .  i gnawed right through the spring  sir .  are you still dead  sir .  sir .    rat catcher   leapt out of his chair  his hands bunching into fists .   at least  it started out as a leap .  about halfway  it turned into a stagger .  he sat down heavily  clutching at his stomach .    oh  no .  oh  no .  i knew that tea tasted funny    he muttered .   rat catcher   had gone a pale green .   you nasty little   he began .    and don t even think of attacking us   said malicia .   otherwise you ll never walk out of here .  and we might get hurt and forget where we left the antidote .  you haven t got time to attack us .    rat catcher   tried standing up again  but his legs didn t want to play .   what poison was it .   he muttered .    by the smell of it  it s the one the rats call number three   said keith .   it was in the bag labelled killalot .  .  .     the rats call it number three .   said rat catcher   .    they know a lot about poison   said keith .    and they told you about this antidote  yeah .   said rat catcher   .   rat catcher   glared at him .   we heard them talk  bill .   in the pit  remember .   he looked back at keith  and shook his head .   nah   he said .   you don t look like the kind of kid that d poison a man to his face       how about me .   said malicia  leaning forward .    she would .  she would .   said rat catcher    clutching at his colleague s arm .   she s weird  that one .  everyone says so .   he clutched his stomach again  and leaned forward  groaning .    you said something about an antidote   said ratcatcher   .   but there s no antidote to killalot .  .  .     and i told you there is   said keith .   the rats found one .    rat catcher   fell on his knees .   please  young sir .  have mercy .  if not for me  please think of my dear wife and my four lovely children who ll be without their daddy .     you re not married   said malicia .   you don t have any children .     i might want some one day .     what happened to that rat you took away .   said keith .    dunno  sir .  a rat in a hat come down out of the roof and grabbed it and flew away .   rat catcher   burbled .   and then another big rat come down into the pit  shouted at everyone  bit jacko on the on the unutterables and jumped right out of the pit and did a runner .     sounds like your rats are all right   said malicia .    i haven t finished   said keith .   you stole from everyone and blamed it on the rats  didn t you .     yes .  that s it .  yes .  we did  we did .     you killed the rats   said maurice  quietly .   rat catcher   s head turned sharply .  there was an edge to that voice that he recognized .  he d heard it at the pit .  you got them there sometimes  high rolling types with fancy waistcoats  who travelled through the mountains making a living by betting and sometimes making a killing by knives .  they had a look to their eye and a tone to their voice .  they were known as  killing gentlemen  .  you didn t cross a killing gentleman .    yes  yes  that s right  we did .   babbled rat catcher   .    just go carefully there  bill   said rat catcher    still eyeing maurice .    why did you do it .   said keith .   rat catcher   looked from his boss to malicia and then to keith  as if trying to decide who frightened him the most .    well  ron said the rats ate stuff anyway   he said .   so    he said if we got rid of all the rats and pinched the stuff ourselves  well  it wouldn t exactly be like stealing  would it .  more like    re arranging stuff .  there s a bloke ron knows who comes up with a sailing barge in the middle of the night and pays us     that is a diabolical lie .   snapped rat catcher    and then looked as if he was going to be sick .    but you caught rats alive and crammed them into cages without food   keith went on .   they live on rat  those rats .  why did you do that .    rat catcher   clutched at his stomach .   i can feel things happening .   he said .    that s just your imagination .   snapped keith .    it is .     yes .  don t you know anything about the poisons you use .  your stomach won t start to melt for at least twenty minutes .     wow .   said malicia .    and after that   said keith   if you blow your nose  your brain will well  let s just say you ll need a really big handkerchief .     this is great .   said malicia  rummaging in her bag .   i m going to take notes .     and then  if you    just don t go to the lavatory  that s all .  don t ask why .  just don t .  it ll all be over in an hour  except for the oozing .    malicia was scribbling fast .   will they go runny .   she said .    very   said keith  not taking his eyes off the men .    this is inhuman .   shrieked rat catcher   .    no  it s very human   said keith .   it s extremely human .  there isn t a beast in the world that d do it to another living thing  but your poisons do it to rats every day .  now tell me about the rats in the cages .    sweat was pouring down the assistant rat catcher s face .  he looked as if he  too  were caught in a trap .   see  rat catchers have always caught rats alive for the rat pits   he moaned .   it s a perk .  nothing wrong with it .  always done it .  so we had to keep up a supply  so we bred  em .  had to .  no harm in feeding  em dead rats from the rat pits .  everyone knows rats eat rats  if you leave out the green wobbly bit .  and then     oh .  there s a then .   said keith  calmly .    ron said if we bred rats from the rats that survived in pit  you know  the ones that dodged the dogs  well  we d end up with bigger  better rats  see .     that s scientific  that is   said rat catcher   .    what would be the point of that .   said malicia .    well  miss  we ron said    we thought    i thought    we thought that    well  it s not exactly cheating to put really tough rats in amongst the others  see  especially if the dog that s going in is a bit borderline .  where s the harm in that .  gives us an edge  see  when it come to betting .  i thought    he thought       you seem a bit confused about whose idea it was   said keith .    his   said the rat catchers together .   mine  said a voice in maurice s head .  he almost fell off his perch .  what does not kill us makes us strong  said the voice of spider .  the strongest breed .    you mean   said malicia   if they didn t have ratcatchers here they d have fewer rats .   she paused  head on one side .   no  that s not right .  it doesn t feel right .  there s something else .  something you haven t told us .  those rats in those cages are    mad  insane      i d be too  maurice thought  with this horrible voice in my head every hour of the day .    i m going to throw up   said rat catcher   .   i am  i m going to     don t   said keith  watching rat catcher   .   you won t like it .  well  mr assistant rat catcher .     ask them what s in the other cellar   said maurice .  he said it fast  he could feel the voice of spider try to stop his mouth moving even as the sentence came out .    what is in the other cellar then .   said keith .    oh  just more stuff  old cages  stuff like that     said rat catcher   .    what else .   said maurice .    only the    only the    that s where     the ratcatcher s mouth opened and shut .  his eyes bulged .   can t say   he said .   er .  there s nothing .  yes  that s it .  there s nothing in there  just the old cages .  oh  and plague .  don t go in there  cos there s plague .  that s why you shouldn t go in there  see .   cos of the plague .     he s lying   said malicia .   no antidote for him .     i had to do it .   rat catcher   moaned .   you ve gotta do one to join the guild .     that s a guild secret .   rat catcher   snapped at him .   we don t give away guild secrets  he stopped  and clutched at his rumbling stomach .    what was it you had to do .   said keith .    make a rat king .   rat catcher   burst out .    a rat king .   said keith sharply .   what s a rat king .     i   i   i  the man stuttered .   stop it  i   i   i don t want to   tears ran down his face .   we i made a rat king stop it  stop it    stop it       and it s still alive .   said malicia .   keith turned to her in amazement .   you know about these things .   he said .    of course .  there s a lot of stories about them .  rat kings are deadly evil .  they     antidote  antidote  please   moaned rat catcher   .   my stomach feels like there s rats running round in it .     you made a rat king   said malicia .   oh  dear .  well  we left the antidote in that little cellar you locked us up in .  i should hurry if i was you .    both of the men staggered to their feet .  rat catcher   fell through the trapdoor .  the other man landed on him .  swearing  moaning and  it had to be said  farting enormously  they made their way to the cellar .   dangerous beans  candle was still alight .  beside it was a fat twist of paper .   the door was slammed behind the men .  there was the sound of a piece of wood being wedged under it .    there s enough antidote for one person   said keith s voice  muffled through the wood .   but i m sure you can sort it out in a humane sort of way .    darktan tried to get his breath back  but he thought he d never get it all  even if he breathed in for a year .  there was a ring of pain all around his back and chest .    it s amazing .   said nourishing .   you were dead in the trap and now you re alive .     nourishing .   said darktan  carefully .    yes  sir .     i m very    grateful   said darktan  still wheezing   but don t get silly .  the spring was stretched and weak and    the teeth were rusted and blunt .  that s all .     but there s teeth marks all round you .  no one s ever come out of a trap before  except the mr squeakies  and they were made of rubber .    darktan licked his stomach .  nourishing had been right .  he looked perforated .   i was just lucky   he said .    no rat has ever come alive out of a trap   nourishing repeated .   did you see the big rat .     the what .     the big rat .     oh  that   said darktan .  he was going to add  no  i don t go in for that nonsense   but stopped .  he could remember the light  and then the darkness ahead of him .  it hadn t seemed bad .  he d almost felt sorry that nourishing had got him out .  in the trap  all the pain had been a long way off .  and there had been no more hard decisions .  he settled for saying   is hamnpork all right .     sort of .  i mean  we can t see any wounds that won t heal .  he s had worse .  but  well  he was pretty old .  nearly three years .     was .   said darktan .    is pretty old  i mean  sir .  sardines sent me to find you because we ll need you to help us get him back  but   nourishing gave darktan a doubtful look .    it s all right  i m sure it looks worse than it is   said darktan  wincing .   let s get up there  shall we .    an old building is full of pawholds for a rat .  no one noticed them as they climbed up from manger to saddle  harness to hayrack .  besides  no one was looking for them .  some of the other rats had taken the jacko route to freedom  and the dogs were going mad searching for them and fighting with one another .  so were the men .   darktan knew a little bit about beer  since he had gone about his business under pubs and breweries  and the rats had often wondered why humans sometimes liked to switch their brains off .  to the rats  living in the centre of a web of sound and light and smells  it made no sense at all .   to darktan  now  it didn t sound quite so bad .  the idea that  for a while  you could forget things and not have a head buzzing with troublesome thoughts    well  that seemed quite attractive .   he couldn t remember a lot about life before he d been changed  but he was certain that it hadn t been so complicated .  oh  bad things had happened  because life on the tip had been pretty hard .  but when they were over  they were over  and tomorrow was a new day .   rats didn t think about tomorrow .  there was just a faint sensation that more things would happen .  it wasn t thinking .  and there was no  good  and  bad  and  right  and  wrong  .  they were new ideas .   ideas .  that was their world now .  big questions and big answers  about life  and how you had to live it  and what you were for .  new ideas spilled into darktan s weary head .   and among the ideas  in the middle of his head  he saw the little figure of dangerous beans .   darktan had never talked much to the little white rat or the little female who scurried around after him and drew pictures of the things he d been thinking about .  darktan liked people who were practical .   but now he thought  he s a trap hunter .  just like me .  he goes ahead of us and finds the dangerous ideas and thinks about them and traps them in words and makes them safe and shows us the way through .   we need him    we need him now .  otherwise  we re all running around like rats in a barrel     much later on  when nourishing was old and grey around the muzzle  and smelled a bit strange  she dictated the story of the climb and how she d heard darktan muttering to himself .  the darktan that she d pulled out of the trap  she said  was a different rat .  it was as though his thoughts had slowed down but got bigger .   the strangest bit  she said  was when they reached the beam .  darktan made sure that hamnpork was all right  and then picked up the match he d shown to nourishing .    he struck it on an old bit of iron   said nourishing   and then he walked out along the beam with it flaring  and down below i could see all the crowd  the hay racks and the straw all over the place  and the people milling around  just like  hah  just like rats    and i thought  if you drop that  mister  the place will fill with smoke in a few seconds and they ve locked the doors and by the time they realize it they ll be caught like  hah  yeah  like rats in a barrel and we ll be away along the gutters .    but he just stood there  looking down  until the match went out .  then he put it down and helped us with hamnpork and never said a word about it .  i asked him about it later on  after all the stuff with the piper and everything  and he said   yes .  rats in a barrel .   and that s all he said about it .     what was it you really put in the sugar .   said keith  as he led the way back to the secret trapdoor .    cascara   said malicia .    that s not a poison  is it .     no  it s a laxative .     what s that .     it makes you    go .     go where .     not where  stupid .  you just    go .  i don t particularly want to draw you a picture .     oh .  you mean    go .     that s right .     and you just happened to have it on you .     yes .  of course .  it was in the big medicine bag .     you mean you take something like that out just for something like this .     of course .  it could easily be necessary .     how .   said keith  climbing the ladder .    well  supposing we were kidnapped .  suppose we ended up at sea .  supposing we were captured by pirates .  pirates have a very monotonous diet  which might be why they re angry all the time .  or supposing we escaped and swam ashore and ended up on an island where there s nothing but coconuts .  they have a very binding effect .     yes  but    but    anything can happen .  if you think like that  you d end up taking just about everything in case of anything .     that s why it s such a big bag   said malicia calmly  pulling herself through the trapdoor and dusting herself off .   keith sighed .   how much did you give them .     lots .  but they should be all right if they don t take too much of the antidote .     what did you give them for the antidote .     cascara .     malicia  you are not a nice person .     really .  you wanted to poison them with the real poison  and you were getting very imaginative with all that stuff about their stomachs melting .     yes  but rats are my friends .  some of the poisons really do that .  and    sort of    making the antidote more of the poison     it s not a poison .  it s a medicine .  they ll feel lovely and clean afterwards .     all right  all right .  but    giving it to them as the antidote as well  that s a bit    a bit       clever .  narratively satisfying .   said malicia .    i suppose so   keith admitted reluctantly .   malicia looked around .   where s your cat .  i thought he was following us .     sometimes he just wanders off .  and he s not my cat .     yes  you re his boy .  but a young man with a smart cat can go a long way  you know .     how .     there was puss in boots  obviously   said malicia   and of course everyone knows about dick livingstone and his wonderful cat  don t they .     i don t   said keith .    it s a very famous story .     sorry .  i haven t been able to read for very long .     really .  well  dick livingstone was a penniless boy who became lord mayor of ubergurgl because his cat was so good at catching    er    pigeons .  the town was overrun with    pigeons  yes  and in fact later on he even married a sultan s daughter because his cat cleared all the    pigeons out of her father s royal palace     it was rats really  wasn t it .   said keith  glumly .    i m sorry  yes .     and it was just a story   said keith .   look  are there really stories about rat kings .  rats have kings .  i ve never heard of it .  how does it work .     not the way you think .  they ve been known about for years .  they really do exist  you know .  just like on the sign outside .     what  the rats with their tails all knotted together .  how do  .    there was a loud and persistent knocking on the door .  some of it sounded as though it was being done with someone s boot .   malicia went over to it and pulled back the bolts .   yes .   she said  coldly  as the night air poured in .   there was a group of angry men outside .  the leader  who looked as though he was only the leader because he happened to be the one in front  took a step back when he saw malicia .    oh    it s you  miss       yes .  my father s the mayor  you know   said malicia .    er    yes .  we all know .     why re you all holding sticks .   said malicia .    er    we want to talk to the rat catchers   said the spokesman .  he tried to look past her  and she stood aside .    there s no one in here but us   she said .   unless you think there s a trapdoor to a maze of underground cellars where desperate animals are caged up and vast supplies of stolen food are hoarded .    the man gave her another nervous look .   you and your stories  miss   he said .    has there been some trouble .   said malicia .    we think they were a    a bit naughty     said the man .  he blanched under the look she gave him .    yes .   she said .    they cheated us in the rat pit .   said a man behind him  made bold because there was someone else between him and malicia .   they must ve trained those rats .  one of them flew around on a string .     and one of them bit my jacko on the    on the    on the unmentionables .   said someone further back .   you can t tell me it wasn t trained to do that .     i saw one with a hat on this morning   said malicia .    there s been a good deal too many strange rats today   said another man .   my mum said she saw one dancing on the kitchen shelves .  and when my granddad got up and reached for his false teeth he said a rat bit him with them .  bit him with his own teeth .     what  wearing them .   said malicia .    no  it just snapped them around in the air .  and a lady down our street opened her pantry door and there were rats swimming in the cream bowl .  not just swimming  either .  they d been trained .  they were making kind of patterns  and diving and waving their legs in the air and stuff .     you mean synchronized swimming .   said malicia .   who s telling stories now  eh .     are you sure you don t know where those men are .   said the leader suspiciously .   people said they headed this way .    malicia rolled her eyes .   all right  yes   she said .   they got here and a talking cat helped us to feed them poison and now they re locked in a cellar .    the men looked at her .   yeah  right   said the leader  turning away .   well  if you do see them  tell them we re looking for them  ok .    malicia shut the door .   it s terrible  not being believed   she said .    now tell me about rat kings   said keith .       chapter      and as night fell  mr bunnsy remembered  there s something terrible in the dark wood .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    why am i doing this .  maurice asked himself  as he squirmed along a pipe .  cats are not built for this stuff .   because we are a kind person at heart  said his conscience .   no  i m not  thought maurice .   actually  that s true  said his conscience .  but we don t want to tell that to dangerous beans  do we .  the little wobbly nose .  he thinks we re a hero .   well  i m not  thought maurice .   then why are we scrabbling around underground trying to find him .   well  obviously it s because he s the one with the big dream about finding the rat island and without him the rats won t co operate and i won t get paid  said maurice .   we re a cat .  what does a cat need money for .   because i have a retirement plan  thought maurice .  i m four years old already .  once i ve made a pile  it s me for a nice home with a big fire and a nice old lady giving me cream every day .  i ve got it all worked out  every detail .   why should she give us a home .  we re smelly  we ve got ragged ears  we ve got something nasty and itchy on our leg  we look like someone kicked us in the face    why should an old lady take us in instead of a fluffy little kitten .   aha .  but black cats are lucky  thought maurice .   really .  well  we don t want to be first with the bad news  but we re not black .  we re a sort of mucky tabby .   there s such a thing as dyes  thought maurice .  a couple of packets of black dye  hold my breath for a minute  and it s  hello  cream and fish  for the rest of my life .  good plan  eh .   and what about the luck .  said the conscience .   ah .  that s the clever bit .  a black cat that brings in a gold coin every month or so  wouldn t you say that s a lucky cat to have .   his conscience fell silent .  probably amazed at the cleverness of the plan  maurice told himself .   he had to admit that he was cleverer at plans than at underground navigation .  he wasn t exactly lost  because cats never got lost .  he merely didn t know where everything else was .  there wasn t a lot of earth under the town  that was certain .  cellars and grating and pipeways and ancient sewers and crypts and bits of forgotten buildings formed a sort of honeycomb .  even humans could get around  maurice thought .  the rat catchers certainly had .   he could smell rats everywhere .  he d wondered about calling out to dangerous beans  but decided against it .  calling out might help him find out where the little rat was  but it d also alert    anyone else to where maurice was .  those big rats had been  well  big  and nasty looking .  even an idiot dog would have trouble with them .   now he was in a small square tunnel with lead pipes in it .  there was even a hiss of escaping steam  and here and there warm water dipped into a gutter that ran along the bottom of the tunnel .  up ahead was a grating leading up to the street .  faint light came through it .   the water in the gutter looked clean .  at least  you could see through it .  maurice was thirsty .  he leaned down  tongue out   there was a thin  bright red streak curling gently in the water     hamnpork seemed confused and half asleep but he knew enough to hold on to sardines  tail as the rats made their way back from the stables .  it was a slow journey .  sardines didn t think the old rat would manage the washing lines .  they skulked along gutters  and along drains  hiding in nothing more than the cloak of night .   a few rats were milling around in the cellar when they finally arrived .  by then darktan and sardines were walking on either side of hamnpork  who was barely moving his legs .   there was still a candle burning in the cellar .  darktan was surprised .  but a lot of things had happened in the last hour .   they let hamnpork sink to the floor  where he lay  breathing heavily .  his body shook with each breath .    poison  guv .   whispered sardines .    i think it was just too much for him   said darktan .   just too much .    hamnpork opened one eye .   am    i    still    the    leader .   he said .    yes  sir   said darktan .    need    to    sleep      darktan looked around the circle .  rats were creeping towards the group .  he could see them whispering to one another .  they kept looking at him .  he stared around  trying to spot the pale figure of dangerous beans .    nourishing    tells me    you saw the    tunnel    of the    big rat     said hamnpork .   darktan glared at nourishing  who looked embarrassed .   i saw    something   he said .    then i shall dream there and    never wake up   said hamnpork .  his head sagged again .  this isn t    the way a    an old rat should die   he mumbled .   not    like this .  not    in the light .    darktan nodded urgently at sardines  who snuffed out the candle with his hat .  the damp  thick underground darkness closed in .    darktan   hamnpork whispered .   you need to know this      sardines strained his ears to hear the old leader s last words to darktan .  then  a few seconds later  he shivered .  he could smell the change in the world .   there was movement in the darkness .  a match burst into life and the candle flame grew again  bringing shadows back into the world .   hamnpork was lying very still .    do we have to eat him now .   said someone .    he s    gone   said darktan .  somehow  the idea of eating hamnpork didn t feel right .   bury him   he said .   and mark the place so we know he s there .    there was a sense of relief in the group .  however much anyone might have respected hamnpork  he was still a bit on the whiffy side  even for a rat .   a rat at the front of the crowd looked uncertain .   er    when you say  mark the place    it said   do you mean like we mark other places where we bury things .     he means by widdling on it   said the rat beside him .   darktan looked at sardines  who shrugged .  darktan had a sinking feeling inside .  when you were the leader  everyone waited to see what you said .  and there was still no sign of the white rat .   he was on his own .   he thought hard for a moment  and then nodded .   yes   he said at last .   he d like that .  it s very    ratty .  but do this  too .  draw it on the ground above him .    he scraped a sign on the ground        he was a rat from a long line of rats and he thought about rats    said sardines .   good one  boss .     and will he come back like darktan did .   said someone else .    if he does  he ll get really mad if we ve eaten him   said a voice .  there was some nervous laughter .    listen  i didn t   darktan began  but sardines nudged him .    word in your ear  guv .   he said  raising his charred hat politely .    yes  yes     darktan was getting worried .  he d never had so many rats watching him so closely .  he followed sardines away from the group .    you know i used to hang around in the theatre an  that   said sardines .   and you pick up stuff in the theatre .  and the thing is    look  what i m saying is  you re the leader  right .  so you got to act like you know what you re doing  ok .  if the leader doesn t know what he s doing  no one else does  either .     i only know what i m doing when i m dismantling traps   said darktan .    all right  think of the future as a great big trap   said sardines .   with no cheese .     that is not a lot of help .     and you should let them think what they like about you and    that scar you ve got   said sardines .   that s my advice  guv .     but i didn t die  sardines .     something happened  didn t it .  you were going to set fire to the place .  i watched you .  something happened to you in the trap .  don t ask me what it was  i just do tap dancing .  i m just a little rat .  always will be  boss .  but there s big rats like inbrine and sellby and a bunch of others  boss  and now hamnpork s dead they might think they should be the leader .  get my drift .     no .    sardines sighed .   i reckon you do  boss .  do we want a lot of scrapping amongst ourselves at a time like this .     no .     right .  well  thanks to chattery little nourishing  you re the rat that looked the bone rat right in the face and came back  aren t you    .     yes  but she       seems to me  boss  that anyone who could stare down the bone rat    well  no one is going to want to mess with him  am i right .  a rat who wears the teeth marks of the bone rat like a belt .  uh uh  no .  rats ll follow a rat like that .  time like this  rats need someone to follow .  that was a good thing you did back there  with ol  hamnpork .  burying him and widdling on top and putting a sign on him    well  the old rats like that  and so do the young ones .  shows  em you re thinking for everyone .   sardines put his head on one side  and grinned a worried grin .    i can see i m going to have to watch you  sardines   said darktan .   you think like maurice .     don t worry about me  boss .  i m small .  i gotta dance .  i wouldn t be any good at leadering .    thinking for everyone  darktan thought .  the white rat     where is dangerous beans .   he said  looking around .   isn t he here .     haven t seen him  boss .     what .  we need him .  he s got the map in his head .     map  boss .   sardines looked concerned .   i thought you drew maps in the mud     not a map like a picture of tunnels and traps .  a map of    of what we are and where we re going       oh  you mean like that lovely island .  never really believed in it  boss     i don t know about any islands  i really don t   said darktan .   but when i was in that    place  i    saw the shape of an idea .  there s been a war between humans and rats for ever .  it s got to end .  and here  now  in this place  with these rats    i can see that it can .  this might be the only time and the only place where it can .  i can see the shape of an idea in my head but i can t think of the words for it  do you understand .  so we need the white rat  because he knows the map for thinking .  we ve got to think our way out of this .  running around and squeaking won t work any more .     you re doing fine so far  boss   said the dancer  patting him on the shoulder .    it s all going wrong   said darktan  trying to keep his voice down .   we need him .  i need him .     i ll get some squads together  boss  if you show me where to start looking   said sardines meekly .    in the drains  not far from the cages   said darktan .   maurice was with him   he added .    is that a good thing or a bad thing  guv .   said sardines .   you know what hamnpork always said   you can always trust a cat         to be a cat  .  yes .  i know .  i wish i knew the answer to that  sardines .    sardines stepped closer .   can i ask a question  guv .     of course .     what was it hamnpork whispered to you just before he died .  special leader wisdom  was it .     good advice   said darktan .   good advice .    maurice blinked .  very slowly  his tongue wound itself back in .  he flattened his ears and  legs moving in silent slow motion  crept along beside the gutter .   right under the grating there was something pale .  the red streak was coming from further upstream  and divided in two as it flowed around the thing  before becoming one swirling thread again .   maurice reached it .  it was a rolled up scrap of paper  sodden with water and stained with red .  he extended a claw and fished it out .  it flopped on the side of the gutter and  as maurice gently peeled the paper apart  he saw the smudged pictures drawn in thick pencil .  he knew what they were .  he d learned them  one day when he had nothing better to do .  they were stupidly simple .    no rat shall     he began .  then there was a damp mess  down to the bit that read   we are not like other rats  .    oh  no   he said .  they wouldn t drop this  would they .  peaches carried it around as though it was a hugely precious thing   will i find them first .  said an alien voice in maurice s head .  or perhaps i have     maurice ran  skidding on the slimy stone as the tunnel turned a corner .   what strange things they are  cat .  rats that think they are not rats .  shall i be like you .  shall i act like a cat .  shall i keep one of them alive .  for a while .   maurice yowled under his breath .  other  smaller tunnels branched off on either side but the thin red streak led straight on and there  under another grating  the thing lay in the water  the red leaking gently from it .   maurice sagged .  he d been expecting what .  but this    this was    this was worse  in a way .  worse than anything .   soaked in water  leaking the red ink from ratty rupert the rat s red waistcoat  was mr bunnsy has an adventure .   maurice hooked it out on claw tip  and the cheap paper pages fell out  one by one  and drifted away in the water .  they d dropped it .  had they been running .  or    had they thrown it away .  what was it dangerous beans had said .   we re nothing but rats  .  and he d said it in such a sad  hollow voice     where are they now  cat .  can you find them .  which way now .   it can see what i see  he thought .  it can t read my mind  but it can see what i see and hear what i hear and it s good at working out what i must be thinking     once again  he shut his eyes .   in the dark  cat .  how will you fight my rats .  the ones behind you .   maurice spun around  eyes wide .  there were rats there  dozens of them  some of them nearly half the size of maurice .  they watched him  all with the same blank expression .   well done  well done  cat .  you see the squeaky creatures and yet you don t leap .  how did a cat learn not to be a cat .   the rats  as one rat  moved forward .  they rustled as they moved .  maurice took a step backwards .   imagine it  cat  said the voice of spider .  imagine a million clever rats .  rats that don t run .  rats that fight .  rats that share one mind  one vision .  mine .    where are you .   said maurice  aloud .   you will see me soon .  keep going  pussy cat .  you have to keep going .  one word from me  one mere flicker of a thought  and the rats you see will take you down .  oh  you might kill one or two  but there are always more rats .  always more rats  .   maurice turned  and edged forward .  the rats followed .  he spun around .  they stopped .  he turned again  took a couple of steps  looked behind him .  the rats followed as if they were on string .   there was a familiar smell in the air here  of old  stale water .  he was somewhere near the flooded cellar .  but how close .  the stuff stank worse than tinned cat food .  it could be in any direction .  he could probably outrun the rats over a short distance .  bloodthirsty rats right behind you can give you wings .   are you planning to run to help the white rat .  said his conscience .  or are you thinking of making a dash for the daylight .   maurice had to admit that the daylight had never seemed a better idea .  there was no point in lying to himself .  after all  rats didn t live very long in any case  even if they had wobbly noses   they are close  cat .  shall we play a game .  cats like playing .  did you play with additives .  before you bit his head off .   maurice stopped dead .   you are going to die   he said softly .   they are getting closer to me  maurice .  so close now .  shall i tell you that the stupid looking kid and the silly sounding girl are going to die .  do you know that rats can eat a human alive .   malicia bolted the shed door .    rat kings are deeply mysterious   she said .   a rat king is a group of rats with their tails tied together    how .     well  the stories say it just    happens .     how does it happen .     i read somewhere that their tails become stuck together when they re in the nest  because of all the muck  and they get twisted up as     rats generally have six or seven babies  and they have quite short tails  and the parents keep the nests quite clean   said keith .   have the people who tell these stories ever seen rats .     i don t know .  maybe the rats just get crowded together and their tails get twisted up .  there s a preserved rat king in a big jar of alcohol in the town museum .     a dead one .     or very  very drunk .  what do you think .   said malicia .   it s ten rats  like a sort of star  with a big knot of tail in the middle .  lots of others have been found  too .  one had thirty two rats .  there s folklore about them .     but that rat catcher said he made one   said keith firmly .   he said he did it to get into the guild .  do you know what a masterpiece is .     oh course .  it s anything really good    i mean a real masterpiece   said keith .   i grew up in a big city  with guilds everywhere .  that s how i know .  a masterpiece is something that an apprentice makes at the end of his training to show the senior members of the guild that he deserves to be a  master  .  a full member .  you understand .  it might be a great symphony  or a beautiful piece of carving  or a batch of magnificent loaves   his  master piece  .     very interesting .  so .     so what sort of master piece would you have to make to become a master rat catcher .  to show that you could really control rats .  remember the sign over the door .    malicia frowned the frown of someone faced with an inconvenient fact .   anyone could tie a bunch of rat tails together if they wanted to   she said .   i m sure i could .     while they re alive .  you d have to trap them first  and then you ve got slippery bits of string that are moving all the time and the other end keeps on biting you .  eight of them .  twenty of them .  thirty two .  thirty two angry rats .    malicia looked around at the untidy shed .   it works   she said .   yes .  it makes almost as good a story .  probably there were one or two real rat kings    all right  all right  maybe just one   and people heard about this and decided that since there was all this interest they d try to make one .  yes .  it s just like crop circles .  no matter how many aliens own up to making them  there are always a few diehards who believe that humans go out with garden rollers in the middle of the night     i just think that some people like to be cruel   said keith .   how would a rat king hunt .  they d all pull in different directions .     ah  well  some of the stories about rat kings say that they can control other rats   said malicia .   with their minds  sort of .  get them to bring them food and go to different places and so on .  you re right  rat kings can t move around easily .  so they    learn how to see out of the eyes of other rats  and hear what they hear .     just other rats .   said keith .    well  one or two stories do say that they can do it to people   said malicia .    how .   said keith .   has it ever happened  really .     it couldn t  could it .   said malicia .   yes  .    yes what .   said malicia .    i didn t say anything .  you just said  yes    said keith .   silly little minds .  sooner or later there is always a way in .  the cat is much better at resisting .  you will obey me .  let the rats go  .    i think we should let the rats go   said malicia .   it s just too cruel  having them packed into those cages like that .     i was just thinking that   said keith .   and forget about me .  i am just a story  .    personally  i think rat kings really are just a story   said malicia  walking over to the trapdoor and raising it .   that rat catcher was a stupid little man .  he was just babbling .     i wonder if we should let the rats out   keith mused .   they looked pretty hungry .     they can t be worse than the rat catchers  can they .   said malicia .   anyway  the piper will be here soon .  he d lead them all into the river  or something     into the river     muttered keith .    that s what he does  yes .  everyone knows that .     but rats can   keith began .   obey me .  don t think .  follow the story .    rats can what .     rats can    rats can     keith stammered .   i can t remember .  something about rats and rivers .  probably not important .    thick  deep darkness .  and  somewhere in it  a little voice .    i dropped mr bunnsy   said peaches .    good   said dangerous beans .   it was just a lie .  lies drag us down .     you said it was important .     it was a lie .        endless  dripping darkness      and    i ve lost the rules  too .     so .   dangerous beans  voice was bitter .   no one bothered with them .     that s not true .  people tried to .  mostly .  and they were sorry when they didn t .     they were just another story  too .  a silly story about rats who thought they weren t rats   said dangerous beans .    why re you talking like this .  this isn t like you .     you saw them run .  they ran and squeaked and forgot how to talk .  underneath  we re just    rats .        foul  stinking darkness      yes  we are   said peaches .   but what are we on top .  that s what you used to say .  come on please .  let s go back .  you re not well .     it was all so clear to me     dangerous beans mumbled .    lie down .  you re tired .  i ve got a few matches left .  you know you always feel better when you see a light      worried in her heart  and feeling lost and a long way from home  peaches found a wall that was rough enough and dragged a match from her crude bag .  the red head flared and cracked .  she raised the match as high as she could .   there were eyes everywhere .   what s the worst part .  she thought  her body rigid with fear .  that i can see the eyes .  or that i m going to know they re still there when the match goes out .   and i ve only got two more matches     she mumbled to herself .   the eyes withdrew into the shadows  noiselessly .  how can rats be so still and so silent .  she thought .    there s something wrong   said dangerous beans .    yes .     there s something here   he said .   i smelled it on that keekee they found in the trap .  it s a kind of terror .  i can smell it on you .     yes   said peaches .    can you see what we should do .   said dangerous beans .    yes .   the eyes in front were gone  but peaches could still see them on either side .    what can we do .   said dangerous beans .   peaches swallowed .   we could wish we had more matches   she said .   and  in the darkness behind their eyes  a voice said  and so  in your despair  you come  at last  tome     light has a smell .   in the dank  damp cellars the sharp sulphur stink of the match flew like a yellow bird  rising on drafts  plunging through cracks .  it was a clean and bitter smell and it cut through the dull underground reek like a knife .   it filled the nostrils of sardines  who turned his head .   matches  boss .   he said .    head that way .   darktan commanded .    it s through the room of cages  boss   sardines warned .    so .     remember what happened last time  boss .    darktan looked around at his squad .  it wasn t everything he could have wished for .  rats were still trailing back from their hiding places  and some rats good  sensible rats had run into traps and poisons in the panic .  but he d picked the best he could .  there were a few of the experienced older ones  like inbrine and sardines  but most of them were young .  maybe that wasn t such a bad thing  he thought .  it was the older rats who d panicked most .  they hadn t been so used to thinking .    o k   he said .   now  we don t know what we re going to   he began  and caught sight of sardines .  the rat was shaking his head slightly .   oh  yes .  leaders weren t allowed not to know .   he stared at the young  worried faces  took a deep breath and started again .   there s something new down here   he said  and suddenly he knew what to say .   something that no one s ever seen before .  something tough .  something strong .   the squad was almost cowering  except for nourishing  who was staring at darktan with shining eyes .    something fearful .  something new .  something sudden   said darktan  leaning forward .   and it s you .  all of you .  rats with brains .  rats who can think .  rats who don t turn and run .  rats who aren t afraid of dark or fire or noises or traps or poisons .  nothing can stop rats like you  right .    now the words bubbled up .   you heard about the dark wood in the book .  well  we re in the dark wood now .  there s something else down there .  something terrible .  it hides behind your fear .  it thinks it can stop you and it s wrong .  we re going to find it and drag it out and we re gonna make it wish we d never been born .  and if we die    well   and he saw them  as one rat  stare at the livid wound across his chest   death ain t so bad .  shall i tell you about the bone rat .  he waits for those who break and run  who hide  who falter .  but if you stare into his eyes he ll give you a nod and pass right on .    now he could smell their excitement .  in the world behind their eyes they were the bravest rats that there ever were .  now he had to lock that thought there .   without thinking  he touched the wound .  it was healing badly  still leaking blood  and there was going to be a huge scar there for ever .  he brought his hand up  with his own blood  and the idea came to him right out of his bones .   he walked along the row  touching each rat just above the eyes  leaving a red mark .   and afterwards   he said quietly   people will say   they went there  and they did it  and they came back out of the dark wood  and this is how they know their own  .    he looked across their heads to sardines  who raised his hat .  that broke the spell .  the rats started to breathe again .  but something of the magic was still there  lodged in the gleam of an eye and the twitch of a tail .    ready to die for the clan  sardines .   darktan shouted .    no  boss .  ready to kill .     good   said darktan .   let s go .  we love the dark wood .  it belongs to us .    the smell of light drifted along the tunnels and reached the face of maurice  who sniffed it up .  peaches .  she was mad about light .  it was more or less all dangerous beans could see .  she always carried a few matches .  mad .  creatures that lived in darkness  carrying matches .  well  obviously not mad when you thought about it  but even so     the rats behind were pushing him in that direction .  i m being played with  he thought .  batted from paw to paw so spider can hear me squeak .   he heard in his head the voice of spider  and so  in your despair  you come  at last  to me     and heard with his ears  far off and faint  the voice of dangerous beans .   who are you .    i am the big rat that lives underground  .    you are .  really .  i have thought    a lot about you .    there was a hole in the wall here and  beyond it  the brilliance of a lighted match .  sensing the press of the rats behind him  maurice sidled through .   there were big rats everywhere  on the floor  on boxes  clinging to the walls .  and  in the centre  a circle of light from one half burned match held aloft by a trembling peaches .  dangerous beans was standing a little in front of her  staring up at a stack of boxes and sacks .   peaches spun around .  as she did so the flame of the match blew wide and flared .  the nearest rats jerked away as it did so  bending like a wave .    maurice .   she said .   the cat will not move  said the voice of spider .   maurice tried to  and his paws wouldn t obey him .   be still  cat .  or i shall command your lungs to stop .  see  little rats .  even a cat obeys me .    yes .  i see you have a power   said dangerous beans  tiny in the circle of light .   clever rat .  i have heard you talk to the others .  you understand the truth .  you know that by facing the dark we become strong .  you know about the darkness in front of us and the darkness behind the eyes .  you know that we co operate or die .  will you    co operate .    co operate .   said maurice .  his nose wrinkled .   like these other rats i smell here .  they smell    strong and stupid .    but the strong survive  said the voice of spider .  they dodge the rat catchers and bite their way out of cages .  and  like you  they are called to me .  as for their minds    i can think for everyone .    i  alas  am not strong   said dangerous beans  carefully .   you have an interesting mind .  you  too  look forward to the domination of rats  .    domination .   said dangerous beans .   do i .    you will have worked out that there is a race in this world which steals and kills and spreads disease and despoils what it cannot use  said the voice of spider .    yes   said dangerous beans .   that s easy .  it s called humanity .    well done .  see my fine rats .  in a few hours the silly piper will come and play his silly pipe and  yes  my rats will scamper after him out of the town .  do you know how a piper kills rats .    no .    he leads them into the river where    are you listening .     where they all drown .    but rats are good swimmers   said dangerous beans .   yes .  never trust a rat catcher .  they will leave themselves work for tomorrow .  but humans like to believe stones .  they would prefer to believe stories rather than the truth .  but we  we are rats .  and my rats will swim  believe me .  big rats  different rats  rats who survive  rats with part of my mind in them .  and they will spread from town to town and then there will be destruction such as people cannot imagine .  we will pay them back a thousandfold for every trap .  humans have tortured and poisoned and killed and all of that is now given form in me and there will be revenge  .    given form in you .  yes  i think i begin to understand   said dangerous beans .   there was a crackle and flare behind him .  peaches had lit the second match from the dying  flickering flame of the first one .  the ring of rats  which had been creeping closer  swayed back again .   two more matches  said spider .  and then  one way or another  little rat  you belong to me .    i want to see who i am talking to   said dangerous beans  firmly .   you are blind  little white rat .  through your pink eyes i see only mist  .    they see more than you think   said dangerous beans .   and if you are  as you say  the big rat    then show yourself to me .  smelling is believing .    there was a scrabbling  and spider came out of the shadows .   it looked to maurice like a bundle of rats  rats scampering across the boxes but flowing  as if all the legs were being operated by one creature .  as it crawled into the light  over the top of a sack  he saw that the tails were twisted together into one huge  ugly knot .  and each rat was blind .  as the voice of spider thundered in his head  the eight rats reared and tugged at the knot .   then tell me the truth  white rat .  do you see me .  come closer .  yes  you see me  in your mist .  you see me .  men made me for sport .  tie the rats  tails together and watch them struggle .  but i did not struggle .  together we are strong .  one mind is as strong as one mind and two minds are as strong as two minds  but three minds are four minds  and four minds are eight minds and eight minds    are one one mind stronger than eight .  my time is near .  the stupid men let rats fight and the strong survive  and then they fight  and the strongest of the strong survive    and soon the cages will open  and men shall know the meaning of the word  plague  .  see the stupid cat .  it wants to leap  but i hold it so easily .  no mind can withstand me .  yet you    you are interesting .  you have a mind like mine  that thinks for many rats  not just one rat .  we want the same things .  we have plans .  we want the triumph of rats .  join us .  together we will be    strong  .   there was a long pause .  it was  maurice thought  too long .  and then    yes  your offer is    interesting   said dangerous beans .   there was a gasp from peaches  but dangerous beans went on  in a small voice   the world is big and dangerous  indeed .  and we are weak  and i am tired .  together we can be strong .    indeed .    but what of those who aren t strong  please .    the weak are food .  that is how it has always been .    ah   said dangerous beans .   how it has always been .  things are becoming clearer .     don t listen to it .   peaches hissed .   it s affecting your mind .     no  my mind is working perfectly  thank you   said dangerous beans  still in the same calm voice .   yes  the proposition is beguiling .  and we would rule the rat world together  would we .    we would    co operate  .  and maurice  on the sidelines  thought  yeah  right .  you co operate  they rule .  surely you can t fall for this .   but dangerous beans said   co operate .  yes .  and together we could give the humans a war they won t believe .  tempting .  very tempting .  of course  millions of rats would die      they die anyway  .    mmm  yes .  yes .  yes  that is true .  and this rat here   said dangerous beans  suddenly waving a paw towards one of the big rats that was hypnotized by the flame   can you tell me what she thinks about this .    spider sounded taken aback .  thinks .  why should it think anything .  it is a rat .    ah   said dangerous beans .   how clear it is now .  but it would not work .    would not work .   dangerous beans raised his head .    because  you see  you just think for many rats   he said .   but you don t think of them .  nor are you  for all that you say  the big rat .  every word you utter is a lie .  if there is a big rat  and i hope there is  it would not talk of war and death .  it would be made of the best we could be  not the worst that we are .  no  i will not join you  liar in the dark .  i prefer our way .  we are silly and weak  sometimes .  but together we are strong .  you have plans for rats .  well  i have dreams for them .    spider reared up  quivering .  the voice raged in maurice s mind .   oh  so you think you are a good rat .  but a good rat is one that steals most .  you think a good rat is a rat in a waistcoat  a little human with fur .  oh yes  i know about the stupid  stupid book .  traitor .  traitor to rats .  will you feel my    pain .   maurice did .  it was like a blast of red hot air  leaving his head full of steam .  he recognized the sensation .  it was how he used to feel before he was changed .  it was how he used to feel before he was maurice .  he d just been a cat .  a bright cat  but nothing more than a cat .   you defy me .  spider screamed at the bowed form of dangerous beans .  when i am everything that truly is rat .  i am filth and darkness .  i am the noise under the floor  the rustling in the walls .  i am the thing that undermines and despoils .  i am the sum of all that you deny .  i am your true self .  will you obey me .    never   said dangerous beans .   you are nothing but shadows .    feel my pain .   maurice was more than a cat  he knew .  he knew the world was big and complex and involved a lot more than wondering if the next meal was going to be beetles or chicken legs .  the world was huge and difficult and full of amazing things and         the red hot flame of that horrible voice was boiling his mind away .  the memories were unwinding and whirling into the darkness .  all the other little voices  not the horrible voice but the maurice voices  the ones that nagged at him and argued amongst themselves and told him he was doing wrong or could be better  were getting fainter   and still dangerous beans stood there  small and wobbly  staring up into the dark .    yes   said dangerous beans .   i feel the pain .    you are nothing but a rat .  a little rat .  and i am the very soul of ratdom .  admit it  little blind rat  little blind pet rat  .   dangerous beans swayed  and maurice heard him say   i will not .  and i am not so blind that i can t see darkness .    maurice sniffed  and realized that dangerous beans was widdling himself in terror .  but the little rat didn t move  even so .   oh  yes  whispered the voice of spider .  and you can control the dark  yes .  you told a little rat that .  you can learn to control the dark .    i am a rat   whispered dangerous beans .   but i am not vermin .    vermin .    once we were just another squeaking thing in the forest   said dangerous beans .   and then men built barns and pantries full of food .  of course we took what we could .  and so they called us vermin  and they have trapped us and covered us in poison and  somehow  out of that wretchedness  you have come .  but you are no answer .  you are just another bad thing humans made .  you offer rats nothing except more pain .  you have a power that lets you enter people s minds when they are tired or stupid or upset .  and you are in mine now .    yes .  oh  yes .    and still i stand here   said dangerous beans .   now that i have smelled you  i can face you down .  even though my body is shaking  i can keep a place free from you .  i can feel you running round in my head  you see  but all the doors are closed to you now .  i can control the dark inside  which is where all darkness is .  you have shown me that i am more than just a rat .  if i am not more than a rat  i am nothing at all .    the many heads of spider turned this way and that .  there wasn t much left of maurice s mind to do any thinking now  but it looked as though the rat king was trying to reach a conclusion .   its reply came in a roar .   then be nothing .   keith blinked .  he had his hand on the latch of one of the rat cages .   the rats were watching him .  all standing the same way  all watching his fingers .  hundreds of rats .  they looked    hungry .    did you hear something .   said malicia .   keith lowered his hand very carefully  and took a couple of steps back .   why are we letting these out .   he said .   it was like i d been    dreaming       i don t know .  you re the rat boy .     but we agreed to let them out .     i    it was    i had a feeling that     rat kings can talk to people  can t they .   said keith .   has it been talking to us .     but this is real life   said malicia .    i thought it was an adventure   said keith .    damn .  i forgot   said malicia .   what re they doing .    it was almost as if the rats were melting .  they were no longer upright  attentive statues .  something like panic was spreading through them again .   then other rats poured out of the walls  running madly across the floor .  they were much bigger than the caged ones .  one of them bit keith on the ankle  and he kicked it away .    try to stamp on them but don t lose your balance  whatever you do .   he said .   these are not friendly .     tread on them .   said malicia .   yuk .     you mean you haven t got anything in your bag to fight rats .  this is a rat catchers  lair .  you ve got plenty of stuff for pirates and bandits and robbers .     yes  but there s never been a book about having an adventure in a rat catcher s cellar .   malicia shouted .   ow .  one s on my neck .  one s on my neck .  and there s another one .   she bent down frantically to shake the rats loose and reared up as one leapt at her face .   keith grabbed her hand .   don t fall over .  they ll go mad if you do .  try to get to the door .     they re so fast .   malicia panted .   now there s another one on my hair    hold still  stupid female .   said a voice in her ear .   hold quite still or i ll gnaw you .    there was a scrabble of claws  a swish and a rat dropped past her eyes .  then another rat thumped onto her shoulder and slid away .    right .   said the voice at the back of her neck .   now don t move  don t tread on anyone and keep out of the way .     what was that .   she hissed  as she felt something slide down her skirt .    i think it was the one they call big savings   said keith .   here comes the clan .    more rats were scrambling into the room  but these moved differently .  they stayed together and spread out into a line that moved forward slowly .  when an enemy rat attacked it  the line would close up over it quickly  like a fist  and when it opened again that rat was dead .   only when the surviving rats smelled the terror of their fellows and tried to escape from the room did the attacking line break  become pairs of rats that  with terrible purpose  hunted down one scurrying enemy after another and brought them down with a bite .   and then  seconds after it started  the war was over .  the squeaking of a few lucky refugees faded in the walls .   there was a ragged cheer from the clan rats  the cheer which says  i m still alive .  after all that .     darktan .   said keith .   what happened to you .    darktan reared up and pointed a paw to the door at the other end of the cellar .   if you want to help  open that door .   he shouted .   move it .   then he darted into a drain with the rest of the squad pouring in after him .  one of them tap danced as he went .       chapter      and there he found mr bunnsy  tangled in the brambles and his blue coat all torn .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    the rat king raged .   the watching rats clutched at their heads  peaches shrieked and stumbled back  the last flaring match flying out of her hand .   but something of maurice survived that roar  that storm of thought .  some tiny part hid behind some brain cell and cowered as the rest of maurice was blown away .  thoughts peeled back and vanished in the gale .  no more talking  no more wondering  no more seeing the world as something out there    layers of his mind streamed past as the blast stripped away everything that he d thought of as me  leaving only the brain of a cat .  a clever cat  but still    just a cat .   nothing but a cat .  all the way back to the forest and the cave  the fang and the claw     just a cat .   and you can always trust a cat to be a cat .   the cat blinked .  it was bewildered and angry .  its ears went flat .  its eyes flashed green .   it couldn t think .  it didn t think .  it was instinct that moved it now  something that operated right down at the level of its roaring blood .   it was a cat and there was a twitching squeaky thing and what cats do to twitching squeaking things is this  they leap     the rat king fought back .  teeth snapped at the cat  it was tangled in fighting rats  and it yowled as it rolled across the floor .  more rats poured in  rats that could kill a dog    but now  just for a few seconds  this cat could have brought down a wolf .   it didn t notice the crackling flame as the dropped match set fire to some straw .  it ignored the other rats breaking ranks and running .  it paid no attention to the thickening smoke .   what it wanted to do was kill things .   some dark river deep inside had been dammed up over the months .  it had spent too much time helpless and fuming while little squeaky people ran around in front of it .  it had longed to leap and bite and kill .  it had longed to be a proper cat .  and now the cat was out of the bag and so much ancestral fight and spite and viciousness was flowing through maurice s veins that it sparked off his claws .   and as the cat rolled and struggled and bit  a weak little voice right at the back of his tiny brain  cowering out of the way  the last tiny bit of him that was still maurice and not a blood crazed maniac said   now .  bite here .    teeth and claws closed on a lump made up of eight knotted tails  and tore it apart .   the tiny part of what had once been the me of maurice heard a thought shoot past .   noooo    ooo    oo    o     and then it died away  and the room was full of rats  just rats  nothing more than rats  fighting to get out of the way of a furious  spitting  snarling  bloodthirsty cat  catching up on catness .  it clawed and bit and ripped and pounced and turned to see a small white rat that had not moved throughout the whole fight .  it brought its claws down   dangerous beans screamed .    maurice .    the door rattled  and rattled again as keith s boot hit the lock for the second time .  on the third blow the wood split and burst apart .   there was a wall of fire at the other end of the cellar .  the flames were dark and evil  as much thick smoke as fire .  the clan were scrambling in through the grating and spreading out on either side  staring at the flames .    oh  no .  come on  there s buckets next door .   said keith .    but   malicia began .    we ve got to do it .  quickly .  this is a big people job .    the flames hissed and popped .  everywhere  on fire or in the floor beyond the flames  were dead rats .  sometimes there were only bits of dead rats .    what happened here .   said darktan .    looks like a war  guv   said sardines  sniffing the bodies .    can we get round it .     too hot  boss .  sorry  but we isn t that peaches .    she was sprawled close to the flames  mumbling to herself and covered in mud .  darktan crouched down .  peaches opened her eyes  blearily .    are you all right  peaches .  what s happened to dangerous beans .    sardines wordlessly tapped darktan on the shoulder  and pointed .   coming through the fire  a shadow     it padded slowly between walls of flame .  for a moment the waving air made it look huge  like some monster emerging from a cave  and then it became    just a cat .  smoke poured off its fur .  what wasn t smoking was caked with mud .  one eye was shut .  the cat was leaving a trail of blood and  every few footsteps  it sagged a little .   it had a small bundle of white fur in its mouth .   it reached darktan and continued past  without a glance .  it was growling all the time  under its breath .    is that maurice .   said sardines .    that s dangerous beans he s carrying .   shouted darktan .   stop that cat .   but maurice had stopped by himself  turned  lay down with his paws in front of him  and looked blearily at the rats .   then he gently dropped the bundle on the floor .  he it once or twice  to see if it would move .  he blinked slowly when it didn t .  he looked puzzled  in a land of slow motion way .  he opened his mouth to yawn  and smoke came out .  then he put his head down  and died .   the world seemed to maurice to be full of the ghost light you got before dawn  when it was just bright enough to see things but not bright enough to see colours .   he sat up and washed himself .  there were rats and humans running around  very  very slowly .  they didn t concern him much .  whatever it was they thought they had to be doing  they were doing it .  other people were rushing about  in a silent  ghostly way  and maurice was not .  this seemed a pretty good arrangement .  and his eye didn t hurt and his skin wasn t painful and his paws weren t torn  which was a big improvement on matters as they stood recently .   now he came to think about it  he wasn t quite sure what had happened recently .  something wretchedly bad  obviously .  there was something maurice shaped lying beside him  like a three dimensional shadow .  he stared at it  and then turned when in this soundless ghost world he heard a noise .   there was movement near the wall .  a small figure was striding across the floor towards the tiny lump that was dangerous beans .  it was rat sized  but it was much more solid than the rest of the rats  and unlike any rat he d seen before it wore a black robe .   a rat in clothes  he thought .  but this one did not belong in a mr bunnsy book .  just poking out from the hood of the robe was the bony nose of a rat skull .  and it was carrying a tiny scythe over its shoulder .   the other rats and the humans  who were drifting back and forth with buckets  paid it no attention .  some of them walked right through it .  the rat and maurice seemed to be in a separate world of their own .   it s the bone rat  thought maurice .  it s the grim squeaker .  he s come for dangerous beans .  after all i ve been through .  that is not happening .  he sprang into the air and landed on the bone rat .  the little scythe skidded across the floor .    ok  mister  let s hear you talk   maurice began .    er     said maurice  as the horrible awareness of what he d done caught up with him .   a hand grabbed him by the back of the neck and lifted him up  higher and higher  and then turned him around .  maurice stopped struggling immediately .   he was being held by another figure  much taller  human size  but with the same style of black robe  a much bigger scythe  and a definite lack of skin around the face .  strictly speaking  there was a considerable lack of face about the face  too .  it was just bone .   desist from attacking my associate  maurice  said death .    yessir  mr death  sir .  atoncesir .   said maurice quickly .   noproblemsir .    i haven t seen you lately  maurice .    no sir   said maurice  relaxing slightly .   been very careful  sir .  looking both ways when i cross the street and everything  sir .    and how many do you have left now .    six  sir .  six .  very definitely .  very definitely six lives  sir .    death looked surprised .  but you were run over by a cart only last month  weren t you .    that  sir .  barely grazed me  sir .  got away with hardly a scratch  sir .    exactly .    oh .    that makes five lives  maurice .  up until today s adventure .  you started with nine .    fair enough  sir .  fair enough .   maurice swallowed .  oh  well  might as well try .   so let s say i m left with three  right .    three .  i was only going to take one .  you can t lose more than one life at a time  even if you re a cat .  that leaves you four  maurice .    and i say take two  sir   said maurice urgently .   two of mine  and call it quits .    death and maurice looked down at the faint  shadowy outline of dangerous beans .  some other rats were standing around him now  picking him up .   you sure .  said death .  after all  he is a rat .    yessir .  that s where it all gets complicated  sir .    you can t explain .    yessir .  don t know why  sir .  everything s been a bit odd lately  sir .    that is very un cat like of you  maurice .  i m amazed .    i m pretty shocked too  sir .  i just hope no one finds out  sir .    death lowered maurice to the floor  next to his body .   you leave me little choice .  the sum is correct  even though it is amazing .  we came for two  and two we will take    the balance is preserved .    can i ask a question  sir .   said maurice  as death turned to go .   you may not get an answer .    i suppose there isn t a big cat in the sky  is there .    i m surprised at you  maurice .  of course there are no cat gods .  that would be too much like    work .   maurice nodded .  one good thing about being a cat  apart from the extra lives  was that the theology was a lot simpler .   i won t remember all this  will i  sir .   he said .   it d be just too embarrassing .    of course not  maurice     maurice .    colours returned to the world  and keith was stroking him .  every bit of maurice stung or ached .  how could fur ache .  and his paws screamed at him  and one eye felt like a lump of ice  and his lungs were full of fire .    we thought you were dead .   said keith .   malicia was going to bury you at the bottom of her garden .  she says she s already got a black veil .     what  in her adventuring bag .     certainly   said malicia .   supposing we d ended up on a raft in a river full of flesh eating     yeah  right  thanks   growled maurice .  the air stank of burnt wood and dirty steam .    are you all right .   said keith  still looking worried .   you re a lucky black cat now .     ha ha  yes  ha ha   said maurice gloomily .  he pushed himself up  painfully .   the little rat ok .   he said  trying to look around .    he was out just like you  but when they tried to move him he coughed up a lot of muck .  he s not well  but he s getting better .     all s well that ends   maurice began  and then winced .   i can t turn my head very well   he said .    you re covered in rat bites  that s why .     what s my tail like .     oh  fine .  it s nearly all there .     oh  well .  all s well that ends well  then .  adventure over  time for tea and buns  just like the girl says .     no   said keith .   there s still the piper .     can t they just give him a dollar for his trouble and tell him to go away .     not the rat piper   said keith .   you don t say that sort of thing to the rat piper .     nasty piece of work  is he .     i don t know .  he sounds like it .  but we ve got a plan .    maurice growled .   you ve got a plan .   he said .   you made it up .     me and darktan and malicia .     tell me your wonderful plan   sighed maurice .    we re going to keep the keekees caged up and no rats will come out to follow the piper .  that way he ll look pretty silly  eh .   said malicia .    that s it .  that s your plan .     you don t think it ll work .   said keith .   malicia says he ll be so embarrassed he ll leave .     you don t know anything about people  do you .   sighed maurice .    what .  i m a person .   said malicia .    so .  cats know about people .  we have to .  no one else can open cupboards .  look  even the rat king had a better plan than that .  a good plan isn t one where someone wins  it s where nobody thinks they ve lost .  understand .  this is what you have to do    no  it wouldn t work  we d need a lot of cotton wool      malicia swung her bag around with a look of triumph .   as a matter of fact   she said   i d worked out that if i was ever taken prisoner in a giant underwater mechanical squid and need to block up     you re going to say you ve got a lot of cotton wool  aren t you   said maurice  flatly .    yes .     it was silly of me to worry  wasn t it .   said maurice .   darktan stuck his sword in the mud .  the senior rats gathered round him  but seniority had changed .  among the older rats were younger ones  each one with a dark red mark on its head  and they were pushing to the front .   all of them were chattering .  he could smell the relief that came when the bone rat had gone past and had not turned aside      silence .   he yelled .   it struck like a gong .  every red eye turned to him .  he felt tired  he couldn t breathe properly  and he was streaked with soot and blood .  some of the blood wasn t his .    it s not over   he said .    but we just     it s not over .   darktan looked around the circle .   we didn t get all of those big rats  the real fighters   he panted .   inbrine  take twenty rats and go back and help guard the nests .  big savings and the old females are back there and they ll tear any attacker in half but i want to be certain .    for a moment inbrine glared at darktan .   i don t see why you   he began .    do it .    inbrine crouched hurriedly  waved at the rats behind him  and scurried away .   darktan looked at the others .  as his gaze passed across them  some of them leaned back  as if it was a flame .   we ll form into squads   he said .   all of the clan that we can spare from guarding will form into squads .  at least one trap disposal rat in each squad .  take fire with you .  and some of the young rats ll be runners  so you can keep in touch .  don t go near the cages  those poor creatures can wait .  but you ll work through all these tunnels  all these cellars  all these holes and all these corners .  and if you meet a strange rat and it cowers  then take it prisoner .  but if it tries to fight and the big ones will try to fight  because that s all they know then you will kill it .  burn it or bite it .  kill it deadl do you hear me .    there was a murmur of agreement .    i said do you hear me .    this time there was a roar .    good .  and we ll go on and on until these tunnels are safe  from end to end .  then we ll do it again .  until these tunnels are ours .  because     darktan grasped his sword  but leaned on it for a moment to catch his breath  and when he spoke next it was almost in a whisper   because we re in the heart of the dark wood now and we ve found the dark wood in our hearts and    for tonight    we are something    terrible .   he took another breath  and his next words were heard only by the rats closest to him   and we have nowhere else to go .    it was dawn .  sergeant doppelpunkt  who was one half of the city s official watch  and the largest half  awoke with a snort in the tiny office by the main gates .   he got dressed  a little unsteadily  and washed his face in the stone sink  peering at himself in the scrap of mirror hanging on the wall .   he stopped .  there was a faint but desperate squeaking sound  and then the little grille over the plughole was pushed aside and a rat plunged out .  it was big and grey and it ran up his arm before leaping onto the floor .   water dripping from his face  sergeant doppelpunkt stared in bleary amazement as three smaller rats erupted from the pipe and chased after it .  it turned to fight in the middle of the floor but the small rats hit it together  from three sides at once .  it wasn t like a fight .  it looked  thought the sergeant  more like an execution     there was an old rat hole in the wall .  two of the rats grabbed the tail and dragged the body into the hole and out of sight .  but the third rat stopped at the hole and turned  standing up on its hind legs .   the sergeant felt that it was staring at him .  it didn t look like an animal watching a human to see if it was dangerous .  it didn t look scared  it merely looked curious .  it had some kind of red blob on its head .   the rat saluted him .  it was definitely a salute  even though it only took a second .  then all the rats had gone .   the sergeant stared at the hole for some time  with water still dripping off his chin .   and heard the singing .  it was drifting up from the sink s plughole and it echoed a lot  as if it was coming from a long way away  one voice singing out and a chorus of voices replying    we fight dogs and we chase cats           ain t no trap can stop the rats .     got no plague and got no fleas           we drink poison  we steal cheese .     mess with us and you will see           we ll put poison in your tea .     here we fight and here we ll stay           we will never go away .    the sound faded .  sergeant doppelpunkt blinked  and looked at the bottle of beer he d drunk last night .  it got lonely  on night watch .  and it wasn t as if anyone invaded bad blintz  after all .  they didn t have anything to steal .   but it d probably be a good idea not to mention this to anyone .  it probably hadn t happened .  it was probably just a bad bottle of beer     the guardhouse door opened and corporal knopf stepped in .    morning  sergeant   he began .   it s that    what s up with you .     nothing  corporal .   said doppelpunkt quickly  wiping his face .   i certainly haven t seen anything strange at all .  why re you standing around .  time to get those gates open  corporal .    the watchmen stepped out and swung open the city gates and the sunlight streamed through .   it brought with it a long  long shadow .   oh dear  thought sergeant doppelpunkt .  this really is not going to be a nice day     the man on horseback rode past them without a glance  and on into the town square .  the guards hurried after him .  people aren t supposed to ignore people with weapons .    halt  what is your business here .   demanded corporal knopf  but he had to run crabwise to keep up with the horse .  the rider was dressed in white and black  like a magpie .   he didn t answer  but just smiled faintly to himself .    all right  maybe you haven t any actual business  but it won t cost you anything just to say who you are  will it .   said corporal knopf  who was not interested in any trouble .   the rider looked down at him  and then stared ahead again .   sergeant doppelpunkt spotted a small covered wagon coming through the gates  drawn by a donkey which was accompanied by an old man .  he was a sergeant  he told himself  which meant that he was paid more than the corporal  which meant that he thought more expensive thoughts .  and this one was  they didn t have to check everyone that came through the gate  did they .  especially if they were busy .  they had to pick people at random .  and if you were going to pick people at random  it was a good idea to randomly pick a little old man who looked small enough and old enough to be frightened of a rather grubby uniform with rusty chainmail .    halt .     heh  heh .  not gonna   said the old man .   mind the donkey  he can give you a nasty bite when he s roused .  not that i care .     are you trying to show contempt of the law .   demanded sergeant doppelpunkt .    well  i m not trying to conceal it  mister .  you want to make something of it  you talk to my boss .  that s him on the horse .  the big horse .    the black and white stranger had dismounted by the fountain in the centre of the square  and was opening his saddle bags .    i ll just go and talk to him  shall i .   said the sergeant .   by the time he d reached the stranger  walking as slowly as he dared  the man had propped a small mirror against the fountain and was having a shave .  corporal knopf was watching him .  he d been given the horse to hold .    why haven t you arrested him .   the sergeant whispered to the corporal .    what  for illegal shaving .  tell you what  sarge  you do it .    sergeant doppelpunkt cleared his throat .  a few early risers among the population were already watching him .   er    now  listen  friend  i m sure you didn t mean   he began .   the man straightened up  and gave the guards a look which made both men take a step backwards .  he reached out and undid the thong holding a thick roll of leather behind the saddle .   it unrolled .  corporal knopf whistled .  all down the length of leather  held in place by straps  were dozens of pipes .  they glistened in the rising sun .    oh  you re the pipe   the sergeant began  but the other man turned back to the mirror and said  as if talking to his reflection   where can a man get a breakfast around here .     oh  if it s breakfast you want then mrs shover at the blue cabbage will     sausages   said the piper  still shaving .   burned on one side .  three .  here .  ten minutes .  where is the mayor .     if you go down that street and take the first left    fetch him .     here  you can t   the sergeant began  but corporal knopf grabbed his arm and pulled him away .    he s the piper .   he hissed .   you don t mess with the piper .  don t you know about him .  if he blows the right note on his pipes  your legs will fall off .     what  like the plague .     they say that in porkscratchenz the council didn t pay him and he played his special pipe and led all the kids up into the mountains and they were never seen again .     good  do you think he ll do that here .  the place d be a lot quieter .     hah .  did you ever hear about that place in klatch .  they hired him to get rid of a plague of mime artists  and when they didn t pay up he made all the town s watchmen dance into the river and drown .     no .  did he .  the devil .   said sergeant doppelpunkt .    three hundred dollars he charges  did you know that .     three hundred dollars .     that s why people hate paying   said corporal knopf .    hang on  hang on    how can you have a plague of mime artists .     oh  it was terrible  so i heard .  people didn t dare go out onto the streets at all .     you mean  all those white faces  all that creeping around       exactly .  terrible .  still  when i woke up there was a rat dancing on my dressing table .  tapitty  tapitty  tap .     that s odd   said sergeant doppelpunkt  giving his corporal a strange look .    and it was humming there s no business like show business .  i call that more than just  odd  .     no  i meant it s odd you ve got a dressing table .  i mean  you re not even married .     stop messing about  sarge .     has it got a mirror .     come on  sarge .  you get the sausages  sarge  i ll get the mayor .     no  knopf .  you get the sausages and i ll get the mayor   cos the mayor s free and mrs shover will want paying .    the mayor was already up when the sergeant arrived  and wandering around the house with a worried expression .   he looked more worried when the sergeant arrived .   what s she done this time .   he said .    sir .   said the watchman .   sir  said like that meant  what are you talking about .     malicia hasn t been home all night   said the mayor .    you think something might have happened to her  sir .     no  i think she might have happened to someone  man .  remember last month .  when she tracked down the mysterious headless horseman .     well  you must admit he was a horseman  sir .     that is true .  but he was also a short man with a very high collar .  and he was the chief tax gatherer from mintz .  i m still getting official letters about it .  tax gatherers do not as a rule like young ladies dropping on them out of trees .  and then in september there was that business about the  the     the mystery of smuggler s windmill  sir   said the sergeant  rolling his eyes .    which turned out to be mr vogel the town clerk and mrs schuman the shoemaker s wife  who happened to be there merely because of their shared interest in studying the habits of barn owls           and mr vogel had his trousers off because he d torn them on a nail     said the sergeant  not looking at the mayor .        which mrs schuman was very kindly repairing for him   said the mayor .    by moonlight   said the sergeant .    she happens to have very good eyesight .   snapped the mayor .   and she didn t deserve to be bound and gagged along with mr vogel  who caught quite a chill as a result .  i had complaints from him and from her  and from mrs vogel and from mr schuman and from mr vogel after mr schuman went around to his house and hit him with a last and from mrs schuman after mrs vogel called her a     a last what  sir .     what .     hit him with a last what .     a last  man .  it s a kind of wooden foot shoemakers use when they re making shoes .  heaven knows what malicia s doing this time .     i expect you ll find out when we hear the bang  sir .     and what was it you wanted me for  sergeant .     the rat piper s here  sir .    the mayor went pale .   already .   he said .    yessir .  he s having a shave in the fountain .     where s my official chain .  my official robe .  my official hat .  quick  man  help me .     he looks like quite a slow shaver  sir   said the sergeant  following the mayor out of the room at a run .    over in klotz the mayor kept the piper waiting too long and he played his pipe and turned him into a badger .   said the mayor  flinging open a cupboard .   ah  here they are    help me on with them  will you .    when they arrived in the town square  out of breath  the piper was sitting on a bench  surrounded at a safe distance by a very large crowd .  he was examining half a sausage on the end of a fork .  corporal knopf was standing next to him like a schoolboy who has just turned in a nasty piece of work and is waiting to be told exactly how bad it is .    and this is called a  .   the piper was saying .    a sausage  sir   corporal knopf muttered .    this is what you think is a sausage here  is it .   there was a gasp from the crowd .  bad blintz was very proud of its traditional vole and pork sausages .    yessir   said corporal knopf .    amazing   said the piper .  he looked up at the mayor .   and you are  .     i am the mayor of this town  and    the piper held up a hand  and then nodded towards the old man who was sitting on his cart  grinning broadly .   my agent will deal with you   he said .  he threw away the sausage  put his feet up on the other end of the bench  pulled his hat down over his eyes and lay back .   the mayor went red in the face .  sergeant doppelpunkt leaned towards him .    remember the badger  sir .   he whispered .    ah    yes     the mayor  with what little dignity he had left  walked over to the cart .   i believe the fee for ridding the town of rats will be three hundred dollars .   he said .    then i expect you ll believe anything   said the old man .  he glanced at a notebook on his knee .   let s see    call out fee    plus special charge because it s st prodnitz s day    plus pipe tax    looks like a medium sized town  so that s extra    wear and tear on cart    travelling costs at a dollar a mile    miscellaneous expenses  taxes  charges     he looked up .   tell you what  let s say one thousand dollars  ok .     one thousand dollars .  we haven t got one thousand dollars .  that s outrag     badger  sir .   hissed sergeant doppelpunkt .    you can t pay .   said the old man .    we don t have that kind of money .  we ve had to spend a lot of money bringing in food .     you don t have any money .   said the old man .    nothing like that amount  no .    the old man scratched his chin .   hmm   he said   i can see where that s going to be a bit difficult  because    let s see     he scribbled in his notebook for a moment and then looked up .   you already owe us four hundred and sixty seven dollars and nineteen pence for call out  travel and miscellaneous sundries .     what .  he hasn t blown a note .     ah  but he s ready to   said the old man .   we ve come all this way .  you can t pay .  bit of what they call a imp arse  then .  he s got to lead something out of the town  you see .  otherwise the news ll get around and no one ll show him any respect  and if you haven t got respect  what have you got .  if a piper doesn t have respect  he s      rubbish   said a voice .   i think he s rubbish .    the piper raised the brim of his hat .   the crowd in front of keith parted in a hurry .    yeah .   said the piper .    i don t think he can pipe up even one rat   said keith .   he s just a fraud and a bully .  huh  i bet i can pipe up more rats than him .    some of the people in the crowd began to creep away .  no one wanted to be around when the rat piper lost his temper .   the piper swung his boots down onto the ground and pushed his hat back on his head .   you a rat piper  kid .   he said softly .   keith stuck out his chin defiantly .   yes .  and don t call me kid    old man .    the piper grinned .   ah   he said .   i knew i was going to like this place .  and you can make a rat dance  can you  kid .     more than you can  piper .     sounds like a challenge to me   said the piper .    the piper doesn t accept challenges from   the old man on the cart began  but the rat piper waved him into silence .    y know  kid   he said   this isn t the first time some kid has tried this .  i m walking down the street and someone yells   go for your piccolo  mister .   and i turn around  and it s always a kid like you with a stupid looking face .  now  i don t want anyone to say i m an unfair man  kid  so if you d just care to apologize you might walk away from here with the same number of legs you started with     you re frightened .   malicia stepped out of the crowd .   the piper grinned at her .   yeah .   he said .    yes  because everyone knows what happens at a time like this .  let me ask this stupid looking kid  who i ve never seen before  are you an orphan .     yes   said keith .    do you know nothing about your background at all .     no .     aha .   said malicia .   that proves it .  we all know what happens when a mysterious orphan turns up and challenges someone big and powerful  don t we .  it s like being the third and youngest son of a king .  he can t help but win .    she looked triumphantly at the crowd .  but the crowd looked doubtful .  they hadn t read as many stories as malicia  and were rather attached to the experience of real life  which is that when someone small and righteous takes on someone big and nasty he is grilled bread product  very quickly .   however  someone at the back shouted   give the stupid looking kid a chance .  at least he ll be cheaper .   and someone else shouted   yes  that s right .   and someone else shouted   i agree with the other two .   and no one seemed to notice that all the voices came from near ground level or were associated with the progress around the crowd of a scruffy looking cat with half its fur missing .  instead  there was a general murmuring  no real words  nothing that would get anyone into trouble if the piper turned nasty  but a muttering indicating  in a general sense  without wishing to cause umbrage  and seeing everyone s point of view  and taking one thing with another  and all things being equal  that people would like to see the boy given a chance  if it s all right with you  no offence meant .   the piper shrugged .   fine   he said .   it ll be something to talk about .  and when i win  what will i get .    the mayor coughed .   is a daughter s hand in marriage usual in these circumstances .   he said .   she has very good teeth  and would make a goo a wife for anyone with plenty of free wall space     father .   said malicia .    later on  later on  obviously   said the mayor .   he s unpleasant  but he is rich .     no  i ll just take my payment   said the piper .   one way or another .     and i said we can t afford it .   said the mayor .    and i said one way or the other   said the piper .   and you  kid .     your rat pipe   said keith .    no .  it s magic  kid .     then why are you scared to bet it .    the piper narrowed his eyes .   ok  then   he said .    and the town must let me solve its rat problem   said keith .    and how much will you charge .   said the mayor .    thirty gold pieces .  thirty gold pieces .  go on  say it .   shouted a voice at the back of the crowd .    no  i won t cost you a thing   said keith .    idiot .   shouted the voice in the crowd .  people looked around  puzzled .    nothing at all .   said the mayor .    no  nothing .     er    the hand in marriage thing is still on offer  if you     father .     no  that only happens in stories   said keith .   and i shall also bring back a lot of the food that the rats stole .     they ate it .   said the mayor .   what re you going to do  stick your fingers down their throats .     i said that i ll solve your rat problem   said keith .   agreed  mr mayor .     well  if you re not charging     but first  i shall need to borrow a pipe   keith went on .    you haven t got one .   said the mayor .    it got broken .    corporal knopf nudged the mayor .   i ve got a trombone from when i was in the army   he said .   it won t take a mo to nip and get it .    the rat piper burst out laughing .    doesn t that count .   said the mayor  as corporal knopf hurried off .    what .  a trombone for charming rats .  no  no  let him try .  can t blame a kid for trying .  good with a trombone  are you .     i don t know   said keith .    what do you mean  you don t know .     i mean  i ve never played one .  i d be a lot happier with a flute  trumpet  piccolo or lancre bagpipe  but i ve seen people playing the trombone and it doesn t look too difficult .  it s only an overgrown trumpet  really .     hah .   said the piper .   the watchman came running back  rubbing a battered trombone with his sleeve and therefore making it just a bit more grimy .  keith took it  wiped the mouthpiece  put it to his mouth  pressed the keys a few times and then blew one long note .    seems to work   he said .   i expect i can learn as i go along .   he gave the rat piper a brief smile .   do you want to go first .     you won t charm one rat with that mess  kid   said the piper   but i m glad i m here to see you try .    keith gave him a smile again  took a breath  and played .   there was a tune there .  the instrument squeaked and wheezed  because corporal knopf had occasionally used the thing as a hammer  but there was a tune  quite fast  almost jaunty .  you could tap your feet to it .   someone tapped his feet to it .   sardines emerged from a crack in a nearby wall  going  hwunftwothreefour  under his breath .  the crowd him dance ferociously across the cobbles until he disappeared into a drain .  then they broke into applause .   the piper looked at keith .   did that one have a hat on .   he said .    i didn t notice   said keith .   your go .    the piper pulled a short length of pipe from inside his jacket .  he took another length from his pocket  and slotted it into place on the first piece .  it went click  in a military kind of way .   still watching keith  and still grinning  the piper took a mouthpiece from his top pocket  and screwed it into the rest of the pipe with another  very final  click .   then he put it to his mouth and played .   from her lookout on a roof big savings shouted down a drainpipe   now .   then she pushed two lumps of cotton wool in her ears .   at the bottom of the pipe  inbrine shouted into a drain   now .   and then he too snatched up his earplugs .       ow  ow  ow echoed through the pipes          now .   shouted darktan in the room of cages .  he rammed some straw into the drainpipe .   everyone block their ears .    they d done their best with the rat cages .  malicia had brought blankets  and the rats had spent a feverish hour blocking up holes with mud .  they d done their best to feed the prisoners properly  too  and even though they were only keekees it was heartbreaking to see them cower so desperately .   darktan turned to nourishing .   got your ears blocked .   he said .    pardon .     good .   darktan picked up two lumps of cotton wool .   the silly sounding girl better be right about this stuff   he said .   i don t think many of us have got any strength left to run .    the piper blew again  and then stared at his pipe .    just one rat   said keith .   any rat you like .    the piper glared at him  and blew again .   i can t hear anything   said the mayor .    humans can t   muttered the piper .    perhaps it s broken   said keith helpfully .   the piper tried again .  there was murmuring from the crowd .   you ve done something   he hissed .    oh yes .   said malicia  loudly .   what could he have done .  told the rats to stay underground with their ears blocked up .    the murmuring turned into muffled laughter .   the piper tried one more time .  keith felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck .   a rat emerged .  it moved slowly across the cobbles  bouncing from side to side  until it reached the piper s feet  where it fell over and started making a whirring noise .   people s mouths fell open .  it was a mr clicky .   the piper nudged it with his foot .  the clockwork rat rolled over a few times and then its spring  as a result of months of being punished in traps  gave up .  there was a poiyonngggg  and a brief shower of cogwheels .   the crowd burst out laughing .    hmm   said the piper  and this time the look he gave keith was shaded with grudging admiration .   ok  kid   he said .   shall you and i have a little talk .  piper to piper .  over by the fountain .     provided people can see us   said keith .    you don t trust me  kid .     of course not .    the piper grinned .   good .  you ve got the makings of a piper  i can see that .    over by the fountain  he sat down with his booted legs in front of him  and held out the pipe .  it was bronze  with a raised pattern of brass rats on it  and it glinted in the sunlight .    here   said the piper .   take it .  it s a good one .  i ve got plenty of others .  go on  take it .  i d like to hear you play it .    keith looked at it uncertainly .    it s all trickery  kid   said the piper  as the pipe shone like a sunbeam .   see the little slider there .  move it down and the pipe plays a special note humans can t hear .  rats can .  sends  em nuts .  they come rushing out of the ground and you drive  em into the river  just like a sheepdog .     that s all there is to it .   said keith .    you were expecting something more .     well  yes .  they say you turn people into badgers and lead children into magic caves and    the piper leaned forward conspiratorially .   it always pays to advertise  kid .  sometimes these little towns can be pretty slow when it comes to parting with the cash .   cos the thing about turning people into badgers and all the rest of that stuff is this  it never happens round here .  most of the people round here never go more than ten miles away in their lives .  they ll believe just about anything could happen fifty miles away .  once the story gets around  it does your work for you .  half the things people say i ve done even i didn t make up .     tell me   said keith   have you ever met someone called maurice .     maurice .  maurice .  i don t think so .     amazing   said keith .  he took the pipe  and gave the piper a long  slow stare .   and now  piper   he said   i think you re going to lead the rats out of town .  it s going to be the most impressive job you ve ever done .     hey .  what .  you won  kid .     you ll lead out the rats because that s how it should go   said keith  polishing the pipe on his sleeve .   why do you charge such a lot .     because i give  em a show   said the piper .   the fancy clothes  the bullying    charging a lot is part of the whole thing .  you ve got to give  em magic  kid .  let  em think you re just a fancy rat catcher and you ll be lucky to get a cheese lunch and a warm handshake .     we ll do it together  and the rats will follow us  really follow us into the river .  don t bother about the trick note  this will be even better .  it ll be    it ll be a great    story   said keith .   and you ll get your money .  three hundred dollars  wasn t it .  but you ll settle for half  because i m helping you .     what are you playing at  kid .  i told you  you won .     everyone wins .  trust me .  they called you in .  they should pay the piper .  besides     keith smiled .   i don t want people to think pipers shouldn t get paid  do i .     and i thought you were just a stupid looking kid   said the piper .   what kind of a deal have you got with the rats .     you wouldn t believe it  piper .  you wouldn t believe it .    inbrine scurried through the tunnels  scrabbled through the mud and straw that had been used to block the last one  and jumped into the cage room .  the clan rats unblocked their ears when they saw him .    he s doing it .   said darktan .    yessir .  right now .    darktan looked up at the cages .  the keekees were more subdued  now that the rat king was dead and they d been fed .  but by the smell of it they were desperate to leave this place .  and rats in a panic will follow other rats      ok   he said .   runners  get ready .  open the cages .  make sure they re following you .  go .  go .  go .    and that was almost the end of the story .   how the crowd yelled when rats erupted from every hole and drain .  how they cheered when both pipers danced out of the town  with the rats racing along behind them .  how they whistled when the rats plunged off the bridge into the river .   they didn t notice that some rats stayed on the bridge  urging the others with shouts of  remember  strong regular strokes .   and  there s a nice beach just downstream .   and  hit the water feet first  it won t hurt so much .    even if they had noticed  they probably wouldn t have said anything .  details like that don t fit in .   and the piper danced off over the hills and never  ever came back .   there was general applause .  it had been a good show  everyone agreed  even if it had been expensive .  it was definitely something to tell their children .   the stupid looking kid  the one who had duelled with the piper  strolled back into the square .  he got a round of applause too .  it was turning out to be a good day all round .  people wondered if they d have to have extra children to make room for all the stories .   but they realized they d have enough to save for the grandchildren when the other rats arrived .   they were suddenly there  pouring up out of drains and gutters and cracks .  they didn t squeak  and they weren t running .  they sat there  watching everyone .    here  piper .   shouted the mayor .   you missed some .     no .  we re not the rats who follow pipers   said a voice .   we re the rats you have to deal with .    the mayor looked down .  a rat was standing by his boots  looking up at him .  it appeared to be holding a sword .    father   said malicia behind him   it would be a good idea to listen to this rat .     but it s a rat .     he knows  father .  and he knows how to get your money back and a lot of the food and where to find some of the people who ve been stealing food from us all .     but he s a rat .     yes  father .  but if you talk to him properly  he can help us .    the mayor stared at the assembled ranks of the clan .   we should talk to rats .   he said .    it would be a very good idea  father .     but they re rats .   the mayor seemed to be trying to hold on to this thought as if it was a lifebelt on a stormy sea  and he d drown if he let go of it .     scuse me   scuse me   said a voice from beside him .  he looked down at a dirty  half scorched cat  which grinned at him .    did that cat just speak .   said the mayor .   maurice looked around .   which one .   he said .    you .  did you just talk .     would you feel better if i said no .   said maurice .    but cats can t talk .     well  i can t promise that i could give a  you know  full length after dinner speech  and don t ask me to do a comic monologue   said maurice   and i can t pronounce difficult words like  marmalade  and  lumbago  .  but i m pretty happy with basic repartee and simple wholesome conversation .  speaking as a cat  i d like to know what the rat has got to say .     mr mayor .   said keith  strolling up and twirling the new rat pipe in his fingers .   don t you think it s time i sorted out your rat problem once and for all .     sort it out .  but     all you have to do is talk to them .  get your town council together and talk to them .  it s up to you  mr mayor .  you can yell and shout and call out the dogs and people can run around and flail at the rats with brooms and  yes  they ll run away .  but they won t run far .  and they ll come back .   when he was standing next to the bewildered man he leaned towards him and whispered   and they live under your floorboards  sir .  they know how to use fire .  they know all about poison .  oh  yes .  so    listen to this rat .     is it threatening us .   said the mayor  looking down at darktan .    no  mr mayor   said darktan   i m offering you     he glanced at maurice  who nodded .       a wonderful opportunity .     you really can talk .  you can think .   said the mayor .   darktan looked up at him .  it had been a long night .  he didn t want to remember any of it .  and now it was going to be a longer  harder day .  he took a deep breath .   here s what i suggest   he said .   you pretend that rats can think  and i ll promise to pretend that humans can think  too .        chapter       well done  ratty rupert .   cried the animals of furry bottom .     from mr bunnsy has an adventure    the crowd clustered into the rathaus s council hall .  most of it had to stay outside  craning over other people s heads to see what was going on .   the town council was crammed around one end of their long table .  a dozen or so of the senior rats were crouched at the other end .   and  in the middle  was maurice .  he was suddenly there  leaping up from the floor .   hopwick the clockmaker glared at the other members of the council .   we re talking to rats .   he snapped  trying to make himself heard above the hubbub .   we ll be a laughing stock if this gets out .   the town that talked to its rats  .  can t you just see it .     rats aren t there to be spoken to   said raufman the bootmaker  prodding the mayor with a finger .   a mayor who knew his business would send for the ratcatchers .     according to my daughter  they are locked in a cellar   said the mayor .  he stared at the finger .    locked in by your talking rats .   said raufman .    locked in by my daughter   said the mayor  calmly .   take your finger away  mr raufman .  she s taken the watchmen down there .  she s making very serious allegations  mr raufman .  she says there s a lot of food stored under their shed .  she says they ve been stealing it and selling it to the river traders .  the head rat catcher is your brother in law  isn t he  mr raufman .  i remember you were very keen to see him appointed  weren t you .    there was a commotion outside .  sergeant doppelpunkt pushed his way through  grinning broadly  and laid a big sausage on the table .    one sausage is hardly theft   said raufman .   there was rather more commotion in the crowd  which parted to reveal what was  strictly speaking  a very slowly moving corporal knopf .  this fact only became clear  though  when he d been stripped of three bags of grain  eight strings of sausages  a barrel of pickled beetroot and fifteen cabbages .   sergeant doppelpunkt saluted smartly  to the sound of muffled swearing and falling cabbages .   requesting permission to take six men to help us bring up the rest of the stuff  sir .   he said  beaming happily .    where are the rat catchers .   said the mayor .    in deep    trouble  sir   said the sergeant .   i asked them if they wanted to come out  but they said they d like to stay in there a bit longer  thanks all the same  although they d like a drink of water and some fresh trousers .     was that all they said .    sergeant doppelpunkt pulled out his notebook .   no  sir  they said quite a lot .  they were crying  actually .  they said they d confess to everything in exchange for the fresh trousers .  also  sir  there was this .    the sergeant stepped out and came back with a heavy box  which he thumped down onto the polished table .   acting on information received from a rat  sir  we took a look under one of the floorboards .  there must be more n two hundred dollars in it .  ill gotten gains  sir .     you got information from a rat .    the sergeant pulled sardines out of his pocket .  the rat was eating a biscuit  but he raised his hat politely .    isn t that a bit    unhygienic .   said the mayor .    no  guv  he s washed his hands   said sardines .    i was talking to the sergeant .     no  sir .  nice little chap  sir .  very clean .  reminds me of a hamster i used to have when i was a lad  sir .     well  thank you  sergeant  well done  please go and     his name was horace   added the sergeant helpfully .    thank you  sergeant  and now     does me good to see little cheeks bulging with grub again  sir .     thank you  sergeant .    when the sergeant had left  the mayor turned and stared at mr raufman .  the man had the grace to look embarrassed .    i hardly know the man   he said .   he s just somebody my sister married  that s all .  i hardly ever see him .     i quite understand   said the mayor .   and i ve no intention of asking the sergeant to go and search your larder   and he gave another little smile  and a sniff  and added   yet .  now  where were we .     i was about to tell you a story   said maurice .   the town council stared at him .    and your name is  .   said the mayor  who was feeling in quite a good mood now .    maurice   said maurice .   i m a freelance negotiator  style of thing .  i can see it s difficult for you to talk to rats  but humans like talking to cats  right .     like in dick livingstone .   said hopwick .    yeah  right  him yeah  and   maurice began .    and puss in boots .   said corporal knopf .    yeah  right  books   said maurice  scowling .   anyway    cats can talk to rats  ok .  and i m going to tell you a story .  but first  i m going to tell you that my clients  the rats  will all leave this town if you want them to  and they won t come back .  ever .    the humans stared at him .  so did the rats .    will we .   said darktan .    will they .   said the mayor .    yes   said maurice .   and now  i m going to tell you a story about the lucky town .  i don t know its name yet .  let s suppose my clients leave here and move down river  shall we .  there are lots of towns on this river  i ll be bound .  and somewhere there s a town that ll say  why  we can do a deal with the rats .  and that will be a very lucky town  because then there ll be rules  see .     not exactly  no   said the mayor .    well  in this lucky town  right  a lady making  as it might be  a tray of cakes  well  all she ll need to do is shout down the nearest rat hole and say   good morning  rats  there s one cake for you  i ll be much obliged if n you didn t touch the rest of them   and the rats will say  right you are  missus  no problem at all  .  and then     are you saying we should bribe the rats .   said the mayor .    cheaper than pipers .  cheaper than rat catchers   said maurice .   anyway  it ll be wages .  wages for what  i hear you cry .     did i cry that .   said the mayor .    you were going to   said maurice .   and i was going to tell you that it d be wages for    for vermin control .     what .  but rats are ver     don t say it .   said darktan .    vermin like cockroaches   said maurice  smoothly .   i can see you ve got a lot of them here .     can they talk .   said the mayor .  now he had the slightly hunted expression of anyone who d been talked to by maurice for any length of time .  it said  i m going where i don t want to go  but i don t know how to get off .     no   said maurice .   nor can the mice  and nor can norma can other rats .  well  vermin ll be a thing of the past in that lucky town  because its new rats will be like a police force .  why  the clan ll guard your larders sorry  i mean the larders in that town .  no rat catchers required .  think of the savings .  but that ll only be the start .  the will be getting richer  too  in the lucky town .     how .   said hauptmann the woodcarver  sharply .    because rats will be working for them   said maurice .   they have to gnaw all the time to wear their teeth down  so they might as well be making cuckoo clocks .  and the clockmakers will be doing well  too     why .   said hopwick the clockmaker .    tiny little paws  very good with little springs and things   said maurice .   and then     would they just do cuckoo clocks  or could they do other stuff .   said hauptmann .     and then there s the whole tourism aspect   said maurice .   for example  the rat clock .  you know that clock they ve got in bonk .  in the town square .  little figures come out every quarter of an hour and bang the bells .  cling bong bang  bing clong bong .  very popular  you can get postcards and everything .  big attraction .  people come a long way just to stand there waiting for it .  well  the lucky town will have rats striking the bells .     so what you re saying   said the clockmaker   is that if we that is  if the lucky town had a special big clock  and rats  people might come to see it .     and stand around waiting for up to a quarter of an hour   said someone .    a perfect time to buy hand crafted models of the clock   said the clockmaker .   people began to think about this .    mugs with rats on   said a potter .    hand gnawed souvenir wooden cups and plates   said hauptmann .    cuddly toy rats .     rats on a stick .    darktan took a deep breath .  maurice said  quickly   good idea .  made of toffee  naturally .   he glanced towards keith .   and i expect the town would want to employ its very own rat piper  even .  you know .  for ceremonial purposes .   have your picture drawn with the official rat piper and his rats   sort of thing .     any chance of a small theatre .   said a little voice .   darktan spun around .   sardines .   he said .    well  guv  i thought if everyone was getting in on the act   sardines protested .    maurice  we ought to talk about this   said dangerous beans  tugging at the cat s leg .    excuse me a moment   said maurice  giving the mayor a quick grin   i need to consult with my clients .  of course   he added   i m talking about the lucky town .  which won t be this one because  of course  when my clients move out some new rats will move in .  there are always more rats .  and they won t talk  and they won t have rules  and they ll widdle in the cream and you ll have to find some new rat catchers  ones you can trust  and you won t have as much money because everyone will be going to the other town .  just a thought .    he marched down the table and turned to the rats .    i was doing so well .   he said .   you could be on ten per cent  you know .  your faces on mugs  everything .     and is this what we fought for all night .   spat darktan .   to be pets .     maurice  this isn t right   said dangerous beans .   surely it is better to appeal to the common bond between intelligent species than     i don t know about intelligent species .  we re dealing with humans here   said maurice .   do you know about wars .  very popular with humans .  they fight other humans .  not hugely big on common bonding .     yes  but we are not     now listen   said maurice .   ten minutes ago these people thought you were pests .  now they think you re    useful .  who knows what i can have them thinking in half an hour .     you want us to work for them .   said darktan .   we ve won our place here .     you ll be working for yourself   said maurice .   look  these people aren t philosophers .  they re just    everyday .  they don t understand about the tunnels .  this is a market town .  you ve got to approach them the right way .  anyway  you will keep other rats away  and you won t go around widdling in the jam  so you might as well get thanked for it .   he tried again .   there s going to be a lot of shouting  right  yeah .  and then sooner or later you have to talk .   he saw the bewilderment still glazing their eyes  and turned to sardines in desperation .   help me   he said .    he s right  boss .  you ve got to give  em a show   said sardines  dancing a few steps nervously .    they ll laugh at us .   said darktan .    better laugh than scream  boss .  it s a start .  you gotta dance  boss .  you can think and you can fight  but the world s always movin   and if you wanna stay ahead you gotta dance .   he raised his hat and twirled his cane .  on the other side of the room  a couple of humans saw him and chuckled .   see .   he said .    i d hoped there was an island somewhere   said dangerous beans .   a place where rats could really be rats .     and we ve seen where that leads   said darktan .   and  you know  i don t think there re any wonderful islands in the distance for people like us .  not for us .   he sighed .   if there s a wonderful island anywhere  it s here .  but i m not intending to dance .     figure of speech  boss  figure of speech   said sardines  hopping from one foot to the other .   there was a thump from the other end of the table .  the mayor had hit it with his fist .   we ve got to be practical .   he was saying .   how much worse off can we be .  they can talk .  i m not going to go all through this again  understand .  we ve got food  we ve got a lot of the money back  we survived the piper    these are lucky rats      the figures of keith and malicia loomed over the rats .    it sounds as if my father s coming round to the idea   said malicia .   what about you .     discussions are continuing   said maurice .    i    er    i m sorr    er    look  maurice told me where to look and i found this in the tunnel   said malicia .  the pages were stuck together  and they were all stained  and they had been sewn together by a very impatient person  but it was still recognizable as mr bunnsy has an adventure .   i had to lift up a lot of drain gratings to find all the pages   she said .   the rats looked at it .  then they looked at dangerous beans .    it s mr bunn   peaches began .    i know .  i can smell it   said dangerous beans .   the rats all looked again at the remains of the book .    it s a lie   said peaches .    maybe it s just a pretty story   said sardines .    yes   said dangerous beans .   yes .   he turned his misty pink eyes to darktan  who had to stop himself from crouching  and added   perhaps it s a map .    if it was a story  and not real life  then humans and rats would have shaken hands and gone on into a bright new future .   but since it was real life  there had to be a contract .  a war that had been going on since people first lived in houses could not end with just a happy smile .  and there had to be a committee .  there was so much detail to be discussed .  the town council were on it  and most of the senior rats  and maurice marched up and down the table  joining in .   darktan sat at one end .  he really wanted to sleep .  his wound ached  his teeth ached  and he hadn t eaten for ages .  for hours the argument flowed back and forwards over his drooping head .  he didn t pay attention to who was doing the talking .  most of the time  it seemed to be everyone .    next item  compulsory bells on all cats .  agreed .     can we just get back to clause thirty  mr  er  maurice .  you were saying killing a rat would be murder .     yes .  of course .     but it s just     talk to the paw  mister   cos the whiskers don t want to know .     the cat is right   said the mayor .   you re out of order  mr raufman .  we ve been through this .     then what about if a rat steals from me .     ahem .  then that ll be theft  and the rat will have to go before the justices .     oh  young  .   said raufman .    peaches .  i m a rat  sir .     and    er    and the watch officers will be able to get down the rat tunnels  will they .     yes .  because there will be rat officers in the watch .  there ll have to be   said maurice .   no problem .     really .  and what does sergeant doppelpunkt think about that .  sergeant doppelpunkt .     er    dunno  sir .  could be all right  i suppose .  i know i couldn t get down a rat hole .  we ll have to make the badges smaller  of course .     but surely you wouldn t suggest a rat officer could be allowed to arrest a human .     oh  yes  sir   said the sergeant .    what .     well  if your rat s a proper sworn in watchman    i mean  a watchrat    then you can t go around saying you re not allowed to arrest anyone bigger than you  can you .  could be useful  a rat watchman .  i understand they have this trick where they run up your trouser leg     gentlemen  we should move on .  i suggest this one goes to the sub committee .     which one  sir .  we ve already got seventeen .    there was a snort from one of the councillors .  this was mr schlummer  who was    and had been peacefully asleep all morning .  the snort meant that he was waking up .   he stared at the other side of the table .  his whiskers moved .    there s a rat there .   he said  pointing .   look  mm  bold as brass .  a rat .  in a hat .     yes  sir .  this is a meeting to talk to the rats  sir   said the person beside him .   he looked down and fumbled for his glasses .   wassat .   he said .  he looked closer .   here   he said   aren t  mm  you a rat  too .     yes  sir .  name of nourishing  sir .  we re here to talk to humans .  to stop all the trouble .    mr schlummer stared at the rat .  then he looked across the table at sardines  who raised his hat .  then he looked at the mayor  who nodded .  he looked at everyone again  his lips moving as he tried to sort this out .    you re all talking .   he said  at last .    yes  sir   said nourishing .    so    who s doing the listening .   he said .    we re getting round to that   said maurice .   mr schlummer glared at him .   are you a cat .   he demanded .    yes  sir   said maurice .   mr schlummer slowly digested this point too .   i thought we used to kill rats .   he said  as if he wasn t quite certain any more .    yes  but  you see  sir  this is the future   said maurice .    is it .   said mr schlummer .   really .  i always wondered when it was going to happen .  oh  well .  cats talk now  too .  well done .  got to move with the  mm  the    things that move  obviously .  wake me up when they bring the  mm  tea in  will you  puss .     er    it s not allowed to call cats  puss  if you re over ten years old  sir   said nourishing .    clause   b   said maurice  firmly .    no one is to call cats by silly names unless they intend to give them an immediate meal  .  that s my clause   he added  proudly .    really .   said mr schlummer .   my word  the future is strange .  still  i daresay everything needed sorting out      he settled back in his chair  and after a while began to snore .   around him the arguments started again  and kept going .  a lot of people talked .  some people listened .  occasionally  they agreed    and moved on    and argued .  but the piles of paper on the table grew bigger  and looked more and more official .   darktan forced himself to wake up again  and realized that someone was watching him .  at the other end of the table  the mayor was giving him a long  thoughtful stare .   as he watched  the man leaned back and said something to a clerk  who nodded and walked around the table  past the arguing people  until he reached darktan .   he leaned down .   can    you    un der stand    me .   he said  pronouncing each word very carefully .    yes    be cause    i m    not    stu pid   said darktan .    oh  er    the mayor wonders if he can see you in his private office   said the clerk .   the door over there .  i could help you down  if you like .     i could bite your finger  if you like   said darktan .  the mayor was already walking away from the table .   darktan slid down and followed him .  no one paid any attention to either of them .   the mayor waited until darktan s tail was out of the way and carefully shut the door .   the room was small and untidy .  paper occupied most flat surfaces .  bookcases filled several of the walls  extra books and more paper were stuffed in between the tops of the books and any space in the shelves .   the mayor  moving with exaggerated delicacy  went and sat in a big  rather tatty swivel chair  and looked down at darktan .   i m going to get this wrong   he said .   i thought we should have a    a little talk .  can i pick you up .  i mean  it d be easier to talk to you if you were on my desk       no   said darktan .   and it d be easier to talk to you if you lay flat on the floor .   he sighed .  he was too tired for games .   if you put your hand flat on the floor i ll stand on it and you can raise it up to the height of the desk   he said   but if you try anything nasty i ll bite your thumb off .    the mayor lifted him up  with extreme caution .  darktan hopped off into the mass of papers  empty teacups and old pens that covered the battered leather top  and stood looking up at the embarrassed man .    er    do you have to do much paperwork in your job .   said the mayor .    peaches writes things down   said darktan  bluntly .    that s the little female rat that coughs before she speaks  isn t it .   said the mayor .    that s right .     she s very    definite  isn t she .   said the mayor  and  darktan could see that he was sweating .   she s rather frightening some of the councillors  ha ha .     ha ha   said darktan .   the mayor looked miserable .  he seemed to be searching for something to say .   you are  er  settling in well .   he said .    i spent part of last night fighting a dog in a rat pit  and then i think i was stuck in a rat trap for a while   said darktan  in a voice like ice .   and then there was a bit of a war .  apart from that  i can t complain .    the mayor gave him a worried look .  for the first time he could remember  darktan felt sorry for a human .  the stupid looking kid had been different .  the mayor seemed to be as tired as darktan felt .    look   he said   i think it might work  if that s what you want to ask me .    the mayor brightened up .   you do .   he said .   there s a lot of arguing .     that s why i think it might work   said darktan .   men and rats arguing .  you re not poisoning our cheese  and we re not widdling in your jam .  it s not going to be easy  but it s a start .     but there s something i have to know   said the mayor .    yes .     you could have poisoned our wells .  you could have set fire to our houses .  my daughter tells me you are very    advanced .  you don t owe us anything .  why didn t you .     what for .  what would we have done afterwards .   said darktan .   gone to another town .  gone through all this again .  would killing you have made anything better for us .  sooner or later we d have to talk to humans .  it might as well be you .     i m glad you like us .   said the mayor .   darktan opened his mouth to say  like you .  no  we just don t hate you enough .  we re not friends .   but     there would be no more rat pits .  no more traps  no more poisons .  true  he was going to have to explain to the clan what a policeman was  and why rat watchmen might chase rats who broke the new rules .  they weren t going to like that .  they weren t going to like that at all .  even a rat with the marks of the bone rat s teeth on him was going to have difficulty with that .  but as maurice had said  they ll do this  you ll do that .  no one will lose very much and everyone will gain a lot .  the town will prosper  everyone s children will grow up  and suddenly  it ll all be normal .   and everyone likes things to be normal .  they don t like to see normal things changed .  it must be worth a try  thought darktan .    now i want to ask you a question   he said .   you ve been the leader for    how long .     ten years   said the mayor .    isn t it hard .     oh  yes .  oh  yes .  everyone argues with me all the time   said the mayor .   although i must say i m expecting a little less arguing if all this works .  but it s not an easy job .     it s ridiculous to have to shout all the time just to get things done   said darktan .    that s right   said the mayor .    and everyone expects you to decide things   said darktan .    true .     the last leader gave me some advice just before he died  and do you know what it was .   don t eat the green wobbly bit  .     good advice .   said the mayor .    yes   said darktan .   but all he had to do was be big and tough and fight all the other rats that wanted to be leader .     it s a bit like that with the council   said the mayor .    what .   said darktan .   you bite them in the neck .     not yet   said the mayor .   but it s a thought  i must say .     it s just all a lot more complicated than i ever thought it would be .   said darktan  bewildered .   because after you ve learned to shout you have to learn not to .     right again   said the mayor .   that s how it works .   he put his hand down on the desk  palm up .   may i .   he said .   darktan stepped aboard  and kept his balance as the mayor carried him over to the window and set him down on the sill .    see the river .   said the mayor .   see the houses .  see the people in the streets .  i have to make it all work .  well  not the river  obviously  that works by itself .  and every year it turns out that i haven t upset enough people for them to choose anyone else as mayor .  so i have to do it again .  it s a lot more complicated than i ever thought it would be .     what  for you  too .  but you re a human .   said darktan in astonishment .    hah .  you think that makes it easier .  i thought rats were wild and free .     hah .   said darktan .   they both stared out of the window .  down in the square below they could see keith and malicia walking along  deep in conversation .    if you like   said the mayor  after a while   you could have a little desk here in my office     i ll live underground  thank you all the same   said darktan  pulling himself together .   little desks are a bit too mr bunnsy .    the mayor sighed .   i suppose so .  er     he looked as if he was about to share some guilty secret and  in a way  he was .   i did like those books when i was a boy  though .  of course i knew it was all nonsense but  all the same  it was nice to think that     yeah  yeah   said darktan .   but the rabbit was stupid .  whoever heard of a rabbit talking .     oh  yes .  i never liked the rabbit .  it was the minor characters everyone liked .  ratty rupert and phil the pheasant and olly the snake     oh  come on   said darktan .   he had a collar and tie .     well .     well  how did it stay on .  a snake is tube shaped .     do you know  i never thought of it like that   said the mayor .   silly  really .  he d wriggle out of it  wouldn t he .     and waistcoats on rats don t work .     no .     no   said darktan .   i tried it .  tool belts are fine  but waistcoats .  dangerous beans got quite upset about that .  but i told him  you ve got to be practical .     it s just like i always tell my daughter   said the man .   stories are just stories .  life is complicated enough as it is .  we have to plan for the real world .  there s no room for the fantastic .     exactly   said the rat .   and man and rat talked  as the long light faded into the evening .   a man was painting  very carefully  a little picture underneath the street sign that said  river street  .  it was a long way underneath  only just higher than the pavement  and he had to kneel down .  he kept referring to a small piece of paper in his hand .   the picture looked like     keith laughed .   what s funny .   said malicia .    it s in the rat alphabet   said keith .   it says water fast stones .  the streets have got cobbles on  right .  so rats see them as stones .  it means river street .     both languages on the street signs .  clause       said malicia .   that s fast .  they only agreed that two hours ago .  i suppose that means there will be tiny signs in human language in the rat tunnels .     i hope not   said keith .    why not .     because rats mostly mark their tunnels by widdling on them .    he was impressed at the way malicia s expression didn t change a bit .   i can see we re all going to have to make some important mental adjustments   she said  thoughtfully .   it was odd about maurice  though  after my father told him there were plenty of kind old ladies in the town that d be happy to give him a home .     you mean when he said that wouldn t be any fun  getting it that way .   said keith .    yes .  do you know what he meant .     sort of .  he meant he s maurice   said keith .   i think he had the time of his life  strutting up and down the table ordering everyone around .  he even said the rats could keep the money .  he said a little voice in his head told him it was really theirs .    malicia appeared to think about things for a while  and then said  as if it wasn t very important really   and  er    you re staying  yes .     clause    resident rat piper   said keith .   i get an official suit that i don t have to share with anyone  a hat with a feather and a pipe allowance .     that will be    quite satisfactory   said malicia .   er       yes .     when i told you that i had two sisters  er  that wasn t entirely true   she said .   er    it wasn t a lie  of course  but it was just    enhanced a bit .     yes .     i mean it would be more literally true to say that i have  in fact  no sisters at all .     ah   said keith .    but i have millions of friends  of course   malicia went on .  she looked  keith thought  absolutely miserable .    that s amazing   he said .   most people just have a few dozen .     millions   said malicia .   obviously  there s always room for another one .     good   said keith .    and  er  there s clause     said malicia  still looking a bit nervous .    oh  yes   said keith .   that one puzzled everyone .   a slap up tea with cream buns and a medal   right .     yes   said malicia .   it wouldn t be properly over  otherwise .  would you  er  join me .    keith nodded .  he stared around at the town .  it seemed a nice place .  just the right size .  a man could find a future here      just one question     he said .    yes .   said malicia  meekly .    how long does it take to become mayor .    there s a town in uberwald where  every time the clock shows a quarter of an hour  the rats come out and strike the bells .   and people watch  and cheer  and buy the souvenir gnawed mugs and plates and spoons and clocks and other things which have no use whatsoever other than to be bought and taken home .  and they go to the rat museum  and they eat ratburgers  guaranteed no rat  and buy rat ears that you can wear and buy the books of rat poetry in rat language and say  how odd  when they see the streets signs in rat and marvel at how the whole place seems so clean     and once a day the town s rat piper  who is rather young  plays his pipes and the rats dance to the music  usually in a conga line .  it s very popular  on special days a little tap dancing rat organizes vast dancing spectaculars  with hundreds of rats in sequins  and water ballet in the fountains  and elaborate sets  .   and there are lectures about the rat tax and how the whole system works  and how the rats have a town of their own under the human town  and get free use of the library  and even sometimes send their young rats to the school .  and everyone says  how perfect  how well organized  how amazing .   and then most of them go back to their own towns and set their traps and put down their poisons  because some minds you couldn t change with a hatchet .  but a few see the world as a different place .   it s not perfect  but it works .  the thing about stories is that you have to pick the ones that last .   and far downstream a handsome cat  with only a few bare patches still in its fur  jumped off a barge  sauntered along the dock  and entered a large and prosperous town .  it spent a few days beating up the local cats and getting the feel of the place and  most of all  in sitting and watching .   finally  it saw what it wanted .  it followed a young lad out of the city .  he was carrying a stick over his back  on the end of which was a knotted handkerchief of the kind used by people in story circumstances to carry all their worldly goods .  the cat grinned to himself .  if you knew their dreams  you could handle people .   the cat followed the boy all the way to the first milestone along the road  where the boy stopped for a rest .  and heard    hey  stupid looking kid .  wanna be lord mayor .  nah  down here  kid      because some stories end  but old stories go on  and you gotta dance to the music if you want to stay ahead .   the end      author s note   i think i have read  in the past few months  more about rats than is good for me .  most of the true stuff or  at least  the stuff that people say is true is so unbelievable that i didn t include it in case readers thought i d made it up .   rats have been known to escape from a rat pit using the same method darktan used on poor jacko .  if you don t believe it  this was witnessed by old alf  jimma and uncle bob .  i have it on the best authority .   rat kings really exist .  how they come into existence is a mystery  in this book malicia mentions a couple of the theories .  i am indebted to dr jack cohen for a more modern and depressing one  which is that down the ages some cruel and inventive people have had altogether too much time on their hands .       foot notes         you scrape the butter on .  then you scrape the butter off .  then you eat the bread .         it s hard to translate  sir  into rat the rat word for sir  isn t a word  it s a sort of momentary crouch  indicating that  just at the moment  the crouching rat is prepared to accept that the other rat is the boss  but that he or she shouldn t get funny about it .         rat measurement .  about an inch .         the rats had found one in the town of quirm  which is where they d got the mr clickies .  they were on a shelf labelled  kitty toys   along with a box of squeaky rubber rats called  with great imagination  mr squeaky .  the rats had tried to set off traps by poking them with a rubber rat on the end of a stick  but the squeak when the trap shut upset everyone .  no one cared about what happened to a mr clicky .
