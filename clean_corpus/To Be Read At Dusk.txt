to be read at dusk             one  two  three  four  five .  there were five of them .   five couriers  sitting on a bench outside the convent on the summit of the great st .  bernard in switzerland  looking at the remote heights  stained by the setting sun as if a mighty quantity of red wine had been broached upon the mountain top  and had not yet had time to sink into the snow .   this is not my simile .  it was made for the occasion by the stoutest courier  who was a german .  none of the others took any more notice of it than they took of me  sitting on another bench on the other side of the convent door  smoking my cigar  like them  and   also like them   looking at the reddened snow  and at the lonely shed hard by  where the bodies of belated travellers  dug out of it  slowly wither away  knowing no corruption in that cold region .   the wine upon the mountain top soaked in as we looked  the mountain became white  the sky  a very dark blue  the wind rose  and the air turned piercing cold .  the five couriers buttoned their rough coats .  there being no safer man to imitate in all such proceedings than a courier  i buttoned mine .   the mountain in the sunset had stopped the five couriers in a conversation .  it is a sublime sight  likely to stop conversation .  the mountain being now out of the sunset  they resumed .  not that i had heard any part of their previous discourse  for indeed  i had not then broken away from the american gentleman  in the travellers  parlour of the convent  who  sitting with his face to the fire  had undertaken to realise to me the whole progress of events which had led to the accumulation by the honourable ananias dodger of one of the largest acquisitions of dollars ever made in our country .    my god .   said the swiss courier  speaking in french  which i do not hold  as some authors appear to do  to be such an all  sufficient excuse for a naughty word  that i have only to write it in that language to make it innocent   if you talk of ghosts       but i don t talk of ghosts   said the german .    of what then .   asked the swiss .    if i knew of what then   said the german   i should probably know a great deal more .    it was a good answer  i thought  and it made me curious .  so  i moved my position to that corner of my bench which was nearest to them  and leaning my back against the convent wall  heard perfectly  without appearing to attend .    thunder and lightning .   said the german  warming   when a certain man is coming to see you  unexpectedly  and  without his own knowledge  sends some invisible messenger  to put the idea of him into your head all day  what do you call that .  when you walk along a crowded street   at frankfort  milan  london  paris   and think that a passing stranger is like your friend heinrich  and then that another passing stranger is like your friend heinrich  and so begin to have a strange foreknowledge that presently you ll meet your friend heinrich   which you do  though you believed him at trieste   what do you call that .     it s not uncommon  either   murmured the swiss and the other three .    uncommon .   said the german .   it s as common as cherries in the black forest .  it s as common as maccaroni at naples .  and naples reminds me .  when the old marchesa senzanima shrieks at a card  party on the chiaja   as i heard and saw her  for it happened in a bavarian family of mine  and i was overlooking the service that evening   i say  when the old marchesa starts up at the card table  white through her rouge  and cries   my sister in spain is dead .  i felt her cold touch on my back .     and when that sister is dead at the moment   what do you call that .     or when the blood of san gennaro liquefies at the request of the clergy   as all the world knows that it does regularly once a year  in my native city   said the neapolitan courier after a pause  with a comical look   what do you call that .     that .   cried the german .   well  i think i know a name for that .     miracle .   said the neapolitan  with the same sly face .   the german merely smoked and laughed  and they all smoked and laughed .    bah .   said the german  presently .   i speak of things that really do happen .  when i want to see the conjurer  i pay to see a professed one  and have my money s worth .  very strange things do happen without ghosts .  ghosts .  giovanni baptista  tell your story of the english bride .  there s no ghost in that  but something full as strange .  will any man tell me what .    as there was a silence among them  i glanced around .  he whom i took to be baptista was lighting a fresh cigar .  he presently went on to speak .  he was a genoese  as i judged .    the story of the english bride .   said he .   basta .  one ought not to call so slight a thing a story .  well  it s all one .  but it s true .  observe me well  gentlemen  it s true .  that which glitters is not always gold  but what i am going to tell  is true .    he repeated this more than once .   ten years ago  i took my credentials to an english gentleman at long s hotel  in bond street  london  who was about to travel   it might be for one year  it might be for two .  he approved of them  likewise of me .  he was pleased to make inquiry .  the testimony that he received was favourable .  he engaged me by the six months  and my entertainment was generous .   he was young  handsome  very happy .  he was enamoured of a fair young english lady  with a sufficient fortune  and they were going to be married .  it was the wedding trip  in short  that we were going to take .  for three months  rest in the hot weather  it was early summer then  he had hired an old place on the riviera  at an easy distance from my city  genoa  on the road to nice .  did i know that place .  yes  i told him i knew it well .  it was an old palace with great gardens .  it was a little bare  and it was a little dark and gloomy  being close surrounded by trees  but it was spacious  ancient  grand  and on the seashore .  he said it had been so described to him exactly  and he was well pleased that i knew it .  for its being a little bare of furniture  all such places were .  for its being a little gloomy  he had hired it principally for the gardens  and he and my mistress would pass the summer weather in their shade .    so all goes well  baptista .   said he .    indubitably  signore  very well .    we had a travelling chariot for our journey  newly built for us  and in all respects complete .  all we had was complete  we wanted for nothing .  the marriage took place .  they were happy .  i was happy  seeing all so bright  being so well situated  going to my own city  teaching my language in the rumble to the maid  la bella carolina  whose heart was gay with laughter  who was young and rosy .   the time flew .  but i observed   listen to this  i pray .   and here the courier dropped his voice    i observed my mistress sometimes brooding in a manner very strange  in a frightened manner  in an unhappy manner  with a cloudy  uncertain alarm upon her .  i think that i began to notice this when i was walking up hills by the carriage side  and master had gone on in front .  at any rate  i remember that it impressed itself upon my mind one evening in the south of france  when she called to me to call master back  and when he came back  and walked for a long way  talking encouragingly and affectionately to her  with his hand upon the open window  and hers in it .  now and then  he laughed in a merry way  as if he were bantering her out of something .  by and by  she laughed  and then all went well again .   it was curious .  i asked la bella carolina  the pretty little one  was mistress unwell .    no .    out of spirits .    no .    fearful of bad roads  or brigands .    no .  and what made it more mysterious was  the pretty little one would not look at me in giving answer  but would look at the view .   but  one day she told me the secret .    if you must know   said carolina   i find  from what i have overheard  that mistress is haunted .     how haunted .     by a dream .     what dream .     by a dream of a face .  for three nights before her marriage  she saw a face in a dream   always the same face  and only one .     a terrible face .     no .  the face of a dark  remarkable looking man  in black  with black hair and a grey moustache   a handsome man except for a reserved and secret air .  not a face she ever saw  or at all like a face she ever saw .  doing nothing in the dream but looking at her fixedly  out of darkness .     does the dream come back .     never .  the recollection of it is all her trouble .     and why does it trouble her .    carolina shook her head .    that s master s question   said la bella .   she don t know .  she wonders why  herself .  but i heard her tell him  only last night  that if she was to find a picture of that face in our italian house  which she is afraid she will  she did not know how she could ever bear it .    upon my word i was fearful after this  said the genoese courier  of our coming to the old palazzo  lest some such ill starred picture should happen to be there .  i knew there were many there  and  as we got nearer and nearer to the place  i wished the whole gallery in the crater of vesuvius .  to mend the matter  it was a stormy dismal evening when we  at last  approached that part of the riviera .  it thundered  and the thunder of my city and its environs  rolling among the high hills  is very loud .  the lizards ran in and out of the chinks in the broken stone wall of the garden  as if they were frightened  the frogs bubbled and croaked their loudest  the sea wind moaned  and the wet trees dripped  and the lightning   body of san lorenzo  how it lightened .   we all know what an old palace in or near genoa is   how time and the sea air have blotted it   how the drapery painted on the outer walls has peeled off in great flakes of plaster   how the lower windows are darkened with rusty bars of iron   how the courtyard is overgrown with grass   how the outer buildings are dilapidated   how the whole pile seems devoted to ruin .  our palazzo was one of the true kind .  it had been shut up close for months .  months .    years .    it had an earthy smell  like a tomb .  the scent of the orange trees on the broad back terrace  and of the lemons ripening on the wall  and of some shrubs that grew around a broken fountain  had got into the house somehow  and had never been able to get out again .  there was  in every room  an aged smell  grown faint with confinement .  it pined in all the cupboards and drawers .  in the little rooms of communication between great rooms  it was stifling .  if you turned a picture   to come back to the pictures   there it still was  clinging to the wall behind the frame  like a sort of bat .   the lattice blinds were close shut  all over the house .  there were two ugly  grey old women in the house  to take care of it  one of them with a spindle  who stood winding and mumbling in the doorway  and who would as soon have let in the devil as the air .  master  mistress  la bella carolina  and i  went all through the palazzo .  i went first  though i have named myself last  opening the windows and the lattice blinds  and shaking down on myself splashes of rain  and scraps of mortar  and now and then a dozing mosquito  or a monstrous  fat  blotchy  genoese spider .   when i had let the evening light into a room  master  mistress  and la bella carolina  entered .  then  we looked round at all the pictures  and i went forward again into another room .  mistress secretly had great fear of meeting with the likeness of that face   we all had  but there was no such thing .  the madonna and bambino  san francisco  san sebastiano  venus  santa caterina  angels  brigands  friars  temples at sunset  battles  white horses  forests  apostles  doges  all my old acquaintances many times repeated .    yes .  dark  handsome man in black  reserved and secret  with black hair and grey moustache  looking fixedly at mistress out of darkness .    no .   at last we got through all the rooms and all the pictures  and came out into the gardens .  they were pretty well kept  being rented by a gardener  and were large and shady .  in one place there was a rustic theatre  open to the sky  the stage a green slope  the coulisses  three entrances upon a side  sweet smelling leafy screens .  mistress moved her bright eyes  even there  as if she looked to see the face come in upon the scene  but all was well .    now  clara   master said  in a low voice   you see that it is nothing .  you are happy .    mistress was much encouraged .  she soon accustomed herself to that grim palazzo  and would sing  and play the harp  and copy the old pictures  and stroll with master under the green trees and vines all day .  she was beautiful .  he was happy .  he would laugh and say to me  mounting his horse for his morning ride before the heat    all goes well  baptista .     yes  signore  thank god  very well .    we kept no company .  i took la bella to the duomo and annunciata  to the cafe  to the opera  to the village festa  to the public garden  to the day theatre  to the marionetti .  the pretty little one was charmed with all she saw .  she learnt italian   heavens .  miraculously .  was mistress quite forgetful of that dream .  i asked carolina sometimes .  nearly  said la bella   almost .  it was wearing out .   one day master received a letter  and called me .    baptista .     signore .     a gentleman who is presented to me will dine here to day .  he is called the signor dellombra .  let me dine like a prince .    it was an odd name .  i did not know that name .  but  there had been many noblemen and gentlemen pursued by austria on political suspicions  lately  and some names had changed .  perhaps this was one .  altro .  dellombra was as good a name to me as another .   when the signor dellombra came to dinner  said the genoese courier in the low voice  into which he had subsided once before   i showed him into the reception room  the great sala of the old palazzo .  master received him with cordiality  and presented him to mistress .  as she rose  her face changed  she gave a cry  and fell upon the marble floor .   then  i turned my head to the signor dellombra  and saw that he was dressed in black  and had a reserved and secret air  and was a dark  remarkable looking man  with black hair and a grey moustache .   master raised mistress in his arms  and carried her to her own room  where i sent la bella carolina straight .  la bella told me afterwards that mistress was nearly terrified to death  and that she wandered in her mind about her dream  all night .   master was vexed and anxious   almost angry  and yet full of solicitude .  the signor dellombra was a courtly gentleman  and spoke with great respect and sympathy of mistress s being so ill .  the african wind had been blowing for some days  they had told him at his hotel of the maltese cross   and he knew that it was often hurtful .  he hoped the beautiful lady would recover soon .  he begged permission to retire  and to renew his visit when he should have the happiness of hearing that she was better .  master would not allow of this  and they dined alone .   he withdrew early .  next day he called at the gate  on horse back  to inquire for mistress .  he did so two or three times in that week .   what i observed myself  and what la bella carolina told me  united to explain to me that master had now set his mind on curing mistress of her fanciful terror .  he was all kindness  but he was sensible and firm .  he reasoned with her  that to encourage such fancies was to invite melancholy  if not madness .  that it rested with herself to be herself .  that if she once resisted her strange weakness  so successfully as to receive the signor dellombra as an english lady would receive any other guest  it was for ever conquered .  to make an end  the signore came again  and mistress received him without marked distress  though with constraint and apprehension still   and the evening passed serenely .  master was so delighted with this change  and so anxious to confirm it  that the signor dellombra became a constant guest .  he was accomplished in pictures  books  and music  and his society  in any grim palazzo  would have been welcome .   i used to notice  many times  that mistress was not quite recovered .  she would cast down her eyes and droop her head  before the signor dellombra  or would look at him with a terrified and fascinated glance  as if his presence had some evil influence or power upon her .  turning from her to him  i used to see him in the shaded gardens  or the large half lighted sala  looking  as i might say   fixedly upon her out of darkness .   but  truly  i had not forgotten la bella carolina s words describing the face in the dream .   after his second visit i heard master say    now  see  my dear clara  it s over .  dellombra has come and gone  and your apprehension is broken like glass .     will he   will he ever come again .   asked mistress .    again .  why  surely  over and over again .  are you cold .    she shivered  .    no  dear   but   he terrifies me  are you sure that he need come again .     the surer for the question  clara .   replied master  cheerfully .   but  he was very hopeful of her complete recovery now  and grew more and more so every day .  she was beautiful .  he was happy .    all goes well  baptista .   he would say to me again .    yes  signore  thank god  very well .    we were all  said the genoese courier  constraining himself to speak a little louder   we were all at rome for the carnival .  i had been out  all day  with a sicilian  a friend of mine  and a courier  who was there with an english family .  as i returned at night to our hotel  i met the little carolina  who never stirred from home alone  running distractedly along the corso .    carolina .  what s the matter .     o baptista .  o  for the lord s sake .  where is my mistress .     mistress  carolina .     gone since morning   told me  when master went out on his day s journey  not to call her  for she was tired with not resting in the night  having been in pain   and would lie in bed until the evening  then get up refreshed .  she is gone .    she is gone .  master has come back  broken down the door  and she is gone .  my beautiful  my good  my innocent mistress .    the pretty little one so cried  and raved  and tore herself that i could not have held her  but for her swooning on my arm as if she had been shot .  master came up   in manner  face  or voice  no more the master that i knew  than i was he .  he took me  i laid the little one upon her bed in the hotel  and left her with the chamber women   in a carriage  furiously through the darkness  across the desolate campagna .  when it was day  and we stopped at a miserable post house  all the horses had been hired twelve hours ago  and sent away in different directions .  mark me .  by the signor dellombra  who had passed there in a carriage  with a frightened english lady crouching in one corner .   i never heard  said the genoese courier  drawing a long breath  that she was ever traced beyond that spot .  all i know is  that she vanished into infamous oblivion  with the dreaded face beside her that she had seen in her dream .    what do you call that .   said the german courier  triumphantly .   ghosts .  there are no ghosts there .  what do you call this  that i am going to tell you .  ghosts .  there are no ghosts here .    i took an engagement once  pursued the german courier  with an english gentleman  elderly and a bachelor  to travel through my country  my fatherland .  he was a merchant who traded with my country and knew the language  but who had never been there since he was a boy   as i judge  some sixty years before .   his name was james  and he had a twin brother john  also a bachelor .  between these brothers there was a great affection .  they were in business together  at goodman s fields  but they did not live together .  mr .  james dwelt in poland street  turning out of oxford street  london  mr .  john resided by epping forest .   mr .  james and i were to start for germany in about a week .  the exact day depended on business .  mr .  john came to poland street  where i was staying in the house   to pass that week with mr .  james .  but  he said to his brother on the second day   i don t feel very well  james .  there s not much the matter with me  but i think i am a little gouty .  i ll go home and put myself under the care of my old housekeeper  who understands my ways .  if i get quite better  i ll come back and see you before you go .  if i don t feel well enough to resume my visit where i leave it off  why you will come and see me before you go .   mr .  james  of course  said he would  and they shook hands   both hands  as they always did   and mr .  john ordered out his old fashioned chariot and rumbled home .   it was on the second night after that   that is to say  the fourth in the week   when i was awoke out of my sound sleep by mr .  james coming into my bedroom in his flannel gown  with a lighted candle .  he sat upon the side of my bed  and looking at me  said    wilhelm  i have reason to think i have got some strange illness upon me .    i then perceived that there was a very unusual expression in his face .    wilhelm   said he   i am not afraid or ashamed to tell you what i might be afraid or ashamed to tell another man .  you come from a sensible country  where mysterious things are inquired into and are not settled to have been weighed and measured   or to have been unweighable and unmeasurable   or in either case to have been completely disposed of  for all time   ever so many years ago .  i have just now seen the phantom of my brother .    i confess  said the german courier  that it gave me a little tingling of the blood to hear it .    i have just now seen   mr .  james repeated  looking full at me  that i might see how collected he was   the phantom of my brother john .  i was sitting up in bed  unable to sleep  when it came into my room  in a white dress  and regarding me earnestly  passed up to the end of the room  glanced at some papers on my writing desk  turned  and  still looking earnestly at me as it passed the bed  went out at the door .  now  i am not in the least mad  and am not in the least disposed to invest that phantom with any external existence out of myself .  i think it is a warning to me that i am ill  and i think i had better be bled .    i got out of bed directly  said the german courier  and began to get on my clothes  begging him not to be alarmed  and telling him that i would go myself to the doctor .  i was just ready  when we heard a loud knocking and ringing at the street door .  my room being an attic at the back  and mr .  james s being the second floor room in the front  we went down to his room  and put up the window  to see what was the matter .    is that mr .  james .   said a man below  falling back to the opposite side of the way to look up .    it is   said mr .  james   and you are my brother s man  robert .     yes  sir .  i am sorry to say  sir  that mr .  john is ill .  he is very bad  sir .  it is even feared that he may be lying at the point of death .  he wants to see you  sir .  i have a chaise here .  pray come to him .  pray lose no time .    mr .  james and i looked at one another .   wilhelm   said he   this is strange .  i wish you to come with me .   i helped him to dress  partly there and partly in the chaise  and no grass grew under the horses  iron shoes between poland street and the forest .   now  mind .   said the german courier  i went with mr .  james into his brother s room  and i saw and heard myself what follows .   his brother lay upon his bed  at the upper end of a long bed  chamber .  his old housekeeper was there  and others were there  i think three others were there  if not four  and they had been with him since early in the afternoon .  he was in white  like the figure   necessarily so  because he had his night dress on .  he looked like the figure   necessarily so  because he looked earnestly at his brother when he saw him come into the room .   but  when his brother reached the bed side  he slowly raised himself in bed  and looking full upon him  said these words    james  you have seen me before  to night   and you know it .    and so died .   i waited  when the german courier ceased  to hear something said of this strange story .  the silence was unbroken .  i looked round  and the five couriers were gone  so noiselessly that the ghostly mountain might have absorbed them into its eternal snows .  by this time  i was by no means in a mood to sit alone in that awful scene  with the chill air coming solemnly upon me   or  if i may tell the truth  to sit alone anywhere .  so i went back into the convent  parlour  and  finding the american gentleman still disposed to relate the biography of the honourable ananias dodger  heard it all out .              end of project
