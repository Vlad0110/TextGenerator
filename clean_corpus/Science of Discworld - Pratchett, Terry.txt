 discworld is the flat world  carried through space on the back of a giant turtle  which has been the source of     so far     twenty seven novels  four maps  an encylopaedia  two animated series  t shirts  scarves  models  badges  beer  embroidery  pens  posters  and probably  by the time this is published  talcum powder and body splash  if not  it can only be a matter of time  .   it has  in short  become immensely popular .   and discworld runs on magic .   roundworld     our home planet  and by extension the universe in which it sits  runs on rules .  in fact  it simply runs .  but we have watched the running  and those observations and the ensuing deductions are the very basis of science .   magicians and scientists are  on the face of it  poles apart .  certainly  a group of people who often dress strangely  live in a world of their own  speak a specialized language and frequently make statements that appear to be in flagrant breach of common sense have nothing in common with a group of people who often dress strangely  speak a specialized language  live in  .  .  .  er  .  .  .   perhaps we should try this another way .  is there a connection between magic and science .  can the magic of discworld  with its eccentric wizards  down to earth witches  obstinate trolls  fire breathing dragons  talking dogs  and personified death  shed any useful light on hard  rational  solid  earthly science .   we think so .   we ll explain why in a moment  but first  let s make it clear what the science of discworld is not .  there are several media tie in the science of     books at the moment  such as the science of the x files and the physics of star trek .  they will tell you about areas of today s science that may one day lead to the events or devices that the fiction depicts .  did aliens crash land at roswell .  could an antimatter warp drive ever be invented .  could we ever have the ultra long life batteries that scully and mulder must be using in those torches of theirs .   we could have taken that approach .  we could  for example  have pointed out that darwin s theory of evolution explains how lower lifeforms can evolve into higher ones  which in turn makes it entirely reasonable that a human should evolve into an orangutan  while remaining a librarian  since there is no higher life form than a librarian  .  we could have speculated on which dna sequence might reliably incorporate asbestos linings into the insides of dragons .  we might even have attempted to explain how you could get a turtle ten thousand miles long .   we decided not to do these things  for a good reason  .  .  .  um  two reasons .   the first is that it would be  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  dumb .   and this because of the second reason .  discworld does not run on scientific lines .  why pretend that it might .  dragons don t breathe fire because they ve got asbestos lungs  they breathe fire because everyone knows that s what dragons do .   what runs discworld is deeper than mere magic and more powerful than pallid science .  it is narrative imperative  the power of story .  it plays a role similar to that substance known as phlogiston  once believed to be that principle or substance within inflammable things that enabled them to burn .  in the discworld universe  then  there is narrativium .  it is part of the spin of every atom  the drift of every cloud .  it is what causes them to be what they are and continue to exist and take part in the ongoing story of the world .   on roundworld  things happen because the things want to happen .   what people want does not greatly figure in the scheme of things  and the universe isn t there to tell a story .   with magic  you can turn a frog into a prince .  with science  you can turn a frog into a ph . d and you still have the frog you started with .   that s the conventional view of roundworld science .  it misses a lot of what actually makes science tick .  science doesn t just exist in the abstract .  you could grind the universe into its component particles without finding a single trace of science .  science is a structure created and maintained by people .  and people choose what interests them  and what they consider to be significant and  quite often  they have thought narratively .   narrativium is powerful stuff .  we have always had a drive to paint stories on to the universe .  when humans first looked at the stars  which are great flaming suns an unimaginable distance away  they saw in amongst them giant bulls  dragons  and local heroes .   this human trait doesn t affect what the rules say     not much  anyway  but it does determine which rules we are willing to contemplate in the first place .  moreover  the rules of the universe have to be able to produce everything that we humans observe  which introduces a kind of narrative imperative into science too .  humans think in stories .   classically  at least  science itself has been the discovery of  stories      think of all those books that had titles like the story of mankind  the descent of man  and  if it comes to that  a brief history of time .   over and above the stories of science  though  discworld can play an even more important role  what if .  we can use discworld for thought experiments about what science might have looked like if the universe had been different  or if the history of science had followed a different route .  we can look at science from the outside .   to a scientist  a thought experiment is an argument that you can run through in your head  after which you understand what s going on so well that there s no need to do a real experiment  which is of course a great saving in time and money and prevents you from getting embarrassingly inconvenient results .  discworld takes a more practical view     there  a thought experiment is one that you can t do and which wouldn t work if you could .  but the kind of thought experiment we have in mind is one that scientists carry out all the time  usually without realizing it  and you don t need to do it  because the whole point is that it wouldn t work .  many of the most important questions in science  and about our understanding of it  are not about how the universe actually is .  they are about what would happen if the universe were different .   someone asks  why do zebras form herds .   you could answer this by an analysis of zebra sociology  psychology  and so on  .  .  .  or you could ask a question of a very different kind   what would happen if they didn t .   one fairly obvious answer to that is  they d be much more likely to get eaten by lions .   this immediately suggests that zebras form herds for self protection     and now we ve got some insight into what zebras actually do by contemplating  for a moment  the possibility that they might have done something else .   another  more serious example is the question  is the solar system stable .      which means  could it change dramatically as a result of some tiny disturbance .   in      king oscar ii of sweden offered a prize of       crowns for the answer it took about a century for the world s mathematicians to come up with a definite answer   maybe  .   it was a good answer  but they didn t get paid .  the prize had already been awarded to someone who didn t get the answer and whose prizewinning article had a big mistake right at the most interesting part .  but when he put it right  at his own expense  he invented chaos theory and paved the way for the  maybe  .  sometimes  the best answer is a more interesting question .   the point here is that stability is not about what a system is actually doing  it is about how the system would change if you disturbed it .  stability  by definition  deals with  what if .   .   because a lot of science is really about this non existent world of thought experiments  our understanding of science must concern itself with worlds of the imagination as well as with worlds of reality .  imagination  rather than mere intelligence  is the truly human quality .  and what better world of the imagination to start from than discworld .  discworld is a consistent  well developed universe with its own kinds of rules  and convincingly real people live on it despite the substantial differences between their universe s rules and ours .  many of them also have a thoroughgoing grounding in  common sense   one of science s natural enemies .   appearing regularly within the discworld canon are the buildings and faculty of unseen university  the discworld s premier college of magic .  the wizards  are a lively bunch  always ready to open any door that has  this door to be kept shut  written on it or pick up anything that has just started to fizz .  it seemed to us that they could be useful  .  .  .   clearly  as the wizards of unseen university believe  this world is a parody of the discworld one .  if we  or they  compare discworld s magic to roundworld science  the more similaritiesa and parallels we find .  and when we didn t discover parallels  we found that the differences were very revealing .  science takes on a new character when you stop asking questions like  what does newt dna look like .   and instead ask  i wonder how the wizards would react to this way of thinking about newts .    there is no science as such on discworld .  so we have put some there .  by magical means  the wizards on discworld must be led to create their own brand of science  some kind of pocket universe  in which magic no longer works  but rules do .  then  as the wizards learn to understand how the rules make interesting things happen     rocks  bacteria  civilizations  we watch them watching  .  .  .  well  us .  it s a sort of recursive thought experiment  or a russian doll wherein the smaller dolls are opened up to find the largest doll inside .   and then we found that  .  .  .  ah  but that is another story .   tp  is    jc  december         ps we have  we are afraid  mentioned in the ensuing pages schr  dinger s cat  the twins paradox  and that bit about shining a torch ahead of a spaceship travelling at the speed of light .  this is because  under the rules of the guild of science writers  they have to be included .  we have  however  tried to keep them short .   we ve managed to be very  very brief about the trousers of time  as well .     pps sometimes scientists change their minds .  new developments cause a rethink .  if this bothers you  consider how much damage is being done to the world by people for whom new developments do not cause a rethink .   this second edition has been changed to reflect three years of scientific progress  .  .  .  forwards or backwards .   you will find both .   and we ve added two completely new chapters  one on the life of dinosaurs  because the existing chapter on the death of dinosaurs seemed a bit depressing  and one on cosmic disasters  because in many ways the universe is depressing .   the discworld story has proved more robust than the science .  as should be expected .  discworld makes so much more sense than roundworld does .   tp  is   jc  january           in a manner of speaking .  they happen because things obey the rules of universe .  a rock has no detectable opinion about gravity .       it took three years for this sentence to sink in .  when it did  we wrote the science of discworld ii  the globe .       like the denizens of any roundworld university  they have unlimited time for research  unlimited funds and no worries about tenure .  they are also by turns erratic  inventively malicious  resistant to new ideas until they ve become old ideas  highly creative at odd moments and perpetually argumentative     in this respect they bear no relation to their roundworld counterparts at all .       one   splitting the thaum  some questions should not be asked .  however  someone always does .    how does it work .   said archchancellor mustrum ridcully  the master of unseen university .   this was the kind of question that ponder stibbons hated almost as much as  how much will it cost .   they were two of the hardest questions a researcher ever had to face .  as the university s de facto head of magical development  he especially tried to avoid questions of finance at all costs .    in quite a complex way .   he ventured at last .    ah .     what i d like to know   said the senior wrangler   is when we re going to get the squash court back .     you never play  senior wrangler   said ridcully  looking up at the towering black construction that now occupied the centre of the old university court .     i might want to one day .  it ll be damn hard with that thing in the way  that s my point .  we ll have to completely rewrite the rules .    outside  snow piled up against the high windows .  this was turning out to be the longest winter in living memory     so long  in fact  that living memory itself was being shortened as some of the older citizens succumbed .  the cold had penetrated even the thick and ancient walls of unseen university itself  to the general concern and annoyance of the faculty .  wizards can put up with any amount of deprivation and discomfort  provided it is not happening to them .   and so  at long last  ponder stibbons s project had been authorized .  he d been waiting three years for it .  his plea that splitting the thaum would push back the boundaries of human knowledge had fallen on deaf ears  the wizards considered that pushing back the boundaries of anything was akin to lifting up a very large  damp stone .  his assertion that splitting the thaum might significantly increase the sum total of human happiness met with the rejoinder that everyone seemed pretty happy enough already .   finally he d ventured that splitting the thaum would produce vast amounts of raw magic that could very easily be converted into cheap heat .  that worked .  the faculty were lukewarm on the subject of knowledge for knowledge s sake  but they were boiling hot on the subject of warm bedrooms .   now the other senior wizards wandered around the suddenly cramped court  prodding the new thing .  their archchancellor took out his pipe and absent mindedly knocked out the ashes on its matt black side .    um  .  .  .  please don t do that  sir   said ponder .    why not .     there might be  .  .  .  it might .  .  .  there s a chance that .  .  .   ponder stopped .   it will make the place untidy  sir   he said .    ah .  good point .  so it s not that the whole thing might explode  then .     er  .  .  .  no  sir .  haha   said ponder miserably .   it d take a lot more than that  sir         there was a whack as a squash ball ricocheted off the wall  rebounded off the casing  and knocked the archchancellor s pipe out of his mouth .    that was you .  dean   said ridcully accusingly .   honestly  you fellows haven t taken any notice of this place in years and suddenly you all want to     mr stibbons .  mr stibbons .    he nudged the small mound that was the hunched figure of the university s chief research wizard .  ponder stibbons uncurled slightly and peered between his fingers .    i really think it might be a good idea if they stopped playing squash  sir   he whispered .    me too .  there s nothing worse than a sweaty wizard .  stop it  you fellows .  and gather round .  mr stibbons is going to do his presentation .   the archchancellor gave ponder stibbons a rather sharp look .   it is going to be very informative and interesting  isn t it  mister stibbons .  he s going to tell us what he spent am        .   p on .     and why he s ruined a perfectly good squash court   said the senior wrangler  tapping the side of the thing with his squash racket .    and if this is safe   said the dean .   i m against dabbling in physics    ponder stibbons winced .    i assure you  dean  that the chances of anyone being killed by the  er  reacting engine are even greater than the chance of being knocked down while crossing the street   he said .    really .  oh  well  .  .  .  all right then .    ponder reconsidered the impromptu sentence he d just uttered and decided  in the circumstances  not to correct it .  talking to the senior wizards was like building a house of cards  if you got anything to stay upright  you just breathed out gently and moved on .   ponder had invented a little system he d called  in the privacy of his head  lies to wizards .  it was for their own good  he told himself .  there was no point in telling your bosses everything  they were busy men  they didn t want explanations .  there was no point in burdening them .  what they wanted was little stories that they felt they could understand  and then they d go away and stop worrying .   he d got his students to set up a small display at the far end of the squash court .  beside it  with pipes looping away through the wall into the high energy magic building next door  was a terminal to hex  the university s thinking engine .  and beside that was a plinth on which was a very large red lever  around which someone had tied a pink ribbon .   ponder looked at his notes  and then surveyed the faculty .    ahem  .  .  .   he began .    i ve got a throat sweet somewhere   said the senior wrangler  patting his pockets .   ponder looked at his notes again  and a horrible sense of hopelessness overcame him .  he realized that he could explain thaumic fission very well  provided that the person listening already knew all about it .  with the senior wizards  though  he d need to explain the meaning of every word .  in some cases this would mean words like  the  and  and  .   he glanced down at the water jug on his lectern  and decided to extemporize .   ponder held up a glass of water .    do you realize  gentlemen   he said   that the thaumic potential in this water  .  .  .  that is  i mean to say  the magical field generated by its narrativium content which tells it that it is water and lets it keep on being water instead of  haha  a pigeon or a frog  .  .  .  would  if we could release it  be enough to move this whole university all the way to the moon .    he beamed at them .    better leave it in there  then   said the chair of indefinite studies .   ponder s smile froze .    obviously we cannot extract all of it   he said   but we .  .  .       enough to get a small part of the university to the moon .   said the lecturer in recent runes .    the dean could do with a holiday   said the archchancellor .    i resent that remark  archchancellor    just trying to lighten the mood  dean .     but we can release just enough for all kinds of useful work   said ponder  already struggling .    like heating my study   said the lecturer in recent runes .   my water jug was iced up again this morning .     exactly .   said ponder  striking out madly for a useful lie to wizards .   we can use it to boil a great big kettle .  that s all it is .  it s perfectly harmless .  not dangerous in any way .  that s why the university council let me build it .  you wouldn t have let me build it if it was dangerous  would you .    he gulped down the water .   as one man  the assembled wizards took several steps backwards .    let us know what it s like up there   said the dean .    bring us back some rocks .  or something   said the lecturer in recent runes .    wave to us   said the senior wrangler .   we ve got quite a good telescope .    ponder stared at the empty glass  and readjusted his mental sights once more .    er  no   he said .   the fuel has to go inside the reacting engine  you see .  and then  .  .  .  and then  .  .  .    he gave up .    the magic goes round and round and it comes up under the boiler that we have plumbed in and the university will then be lovely and warm   he said .   any questions .     where does the coal go .   said the dean   it s wicked what the dwarfs are charging these days .     no  sir .  no coal .  the heat is  .  .  .  free   said ponder .  a little bead of sweat ran down his face .    really .   said the dean .   that ll be a saving  then  eh  bursar .  eh .  where s the bursar .     ah  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  the bursar is assisting me today  sir   said ponder .  he pointed to the high gallery over the court .  the bursar was standing there  smiling his distant smile  and holding an axe .  a rope was tied around the handrail  looped over a beam  and held a long heavy rod suspended over the centre of the reaction engine .    it is  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  just possible that the engine may produce too much magic   said ponder .   the rod is lead  laminated with rowan wood .  together they naturally damp down any magical reaction  you see .  so if things get too  .  .  .  if we want to settle things down  you see  he just chops through the rope and it drops into the very centre of the reacting engine  you see .     what s that man standing next to him for .     that s mr turnipseed  my assistant .  he s the backup fail safe device .     what does he do  then .     his job is to shout  for gods  sakes cut the rope now .   sir .    the wizard nodded at one another .  by the standards of ankh morpork  where the common thumb was used as a temperature measuring device  this was health and safety at work taken to extremes .    well  that all seems safe enough to me   said the senior wrangler .    where did you get the idea for this  mister stibbons .   said ridcully .    well  er  a lot of it is from my own research  but i got quite a few leads from a careful reading of the scrolls of loko in the library  sir .   ponder reckoned he was safe enough there .  the wizards liked ancient wisdom  provided it was ancient enough .  they felt wisdom was like wine  and got better the longer it was left alone .  something that hadn t been known for a few hundred years probably wasn t worth knowing .    loko  .  .  .  loko  .  .  .  loko   mused ridcully .   that s up on uberwald  isn t it .    that s right  sir .     tryin  to bring it to mind   ridcully went on  rubbing his beard .   isn t that where there s that big deep valley with the ring of mountains round it .  very deep valley indeed  as i recall .     that s right  sir .  according to the library catalogue the scrolls were found in a cave by the crustley expedition .  .  .       lots of centaurs and fauns and other curiously shaped magical whatnots are there  i remember reading .     is there  sir .     wasn t stanmer crustley the one who died of planets .     i m not familiar with .  .  .       extremely rare magical disease  i believe .     indeed  sir  but         now i come to think about it  everyone on that expedition contracted something seriously magical within a few months of getting back   ridcully went on .    er  yes  sir .  the suggestion was that there was some kind of curse on the place .  ridiculous notion  of course .     i somehow feel i need to ask  mister stibbons  .  .  .  what chance is there of this just blowin  up and destroyin  the entire university .    ponder s heart sank .  he mentally scanned the sentence  and took refuge in truth .   none  sir .     now try honesty  mister stibbons .   and that was the problem with the archchancellor .  he mostly strode around the place shouting at people  but when he did bother to get all his brain cells lined up he could point them straight at the nearest weak spot .    well  .  .  .  in the unlikely event of it going seriously wrong  it  .  .  .  wouldn t just blow up the university  sir    what would it blow up  pray .     er  .  .  .  everything  sir .     everything there is  you mean .     within a radius of about fifty thousand miles out into space  sir  yes .  according to hex it d happen instantaneously .  we wouldn t even know about it .     and the odds of this are  .  .  .   .     about fifty to one  sir .    the wizards relaxed .    that s pretty safe .  i wouldn t bet on a horse at those odds   said the senior wrangler .  there was half an inch of ice on the inside of his bedroom windows .  things like this give you a very personal view of risk .       wizard or  real  squash bears very little relationship to the high speed sweat bath played elsewhere .  wizards see no point in moving fast .  the ball is lobbed lazily .  certain magical inconsistencies are built into the floor and walls  however  so that the wall a ball hits is not necessarily the wall it rebounds from .  this was one of the factors which  ponder stibbons realized some time afterwords  he really ought to have taken into consideration .  nothing excites a magical particle like meeting itself coming the other way .       two   squash court science    a squash court can be used to make things go much faster than a small rubber ball  .  .  .   on   december       in a squash court in the basement of stagg field at the university of chicago  a new technological era came into being .  it was a technology born of war  yet one of its consequences was to make war so terrible in prospect that  slowly and hesitantly  war on a global scale became less and less likely .   at stagg field  the roman born physicist enrico fermi and his team of scientists achieved the world s first self sustaining nuclear chain reaction .  from it came the atomic bomb  and later  civilian nuclear power .  but there was a far more significant consequence  the dawn of big science and a new style of technological change .   nobody played squash in the basement of stagg field  not while the reactor was in place     but a lot of the people working in the squash court had the same attitudes as ponder stibbons  .  .  .  mostly insatiable curiosity  coupled with periods of nagging doubt tinged with a flicker of terror .  it was curiosity that started it all and terror that concluded it .   in       following a lengthy series of discoveries in physics related to the phenomenon of radioactivity  fermi discovered that interesting things happen when substances are bombarded with  slow neutrons      subatomic particles emitted by radioactive beryllium  and passed through paraffin to slow them down .  slow neutrons  fermi discovered  were just what you needed to persuade other elements to emit their own radioactive particles .  that looked interesting  so he squirted streams of slow neutrons at everything he could think of  and eventually he tried the then obscure element uranium  up until then mostly used as a source of yellow pigment .  by something apparently like alchemy  the uranium turned into something new when the slow neutrons cannoned into it     but fermi couldn t work out what .   four years later three germans     otto hahn  lise meitner  and fritz strassmann     repeated fermi s experiments  and being better chemists  they worked out what had happened to the uranium .  mysteriously  it had turned into barium  krypton  and a small quantity of other stuff .  meitner realized that this process of  nuclear fission  produced energy  by a remarkable method .  everyone knew that chemistry could turn matter into other kinds of matter  but now some of the matter in uranium was being transformed into energy  something that nobody had seen before .  it so happened that albert einstein had already predicted this possibility on theoretical grounds  with his famous formula     an equation which the orangutan librarian of unseen university  would render as  ook  .   einstein s formula tells us that the amount of energy  contained  in a given amount of matter is equal to the mass of that matter  multiplied by the speed of light and then multiplied by the speed of light again .  as einstein had immediately noticed  light is so fast it doesn t even appear to move  so its speed is decidedly big  .  .  .  and the speed multiplied by itself is huge .  in other words  you can get an awful lot of energy from a tiny bit of matter  if only you can find a way to do it .  now meitner had worked out the trick .   a single equation may or may not halve your book sales  but it can change the world completely .   hahn  meitner and strassmann published their discovery in the british scientific journal nature in january      .  nine months later britain was at war  a war which would be ended by a military application of their discovery .  it is ironic that the greatest scientific secret of world war ii was given away just before the war began  and it shows how unaware politicians then were of the potential     be it for good or bad     of big science .  fermi saw the implications of the nature article immediately  and he called in another top ranking physicist  niels bohr  who came up with a novel twist  the chain reaction .  if a particular  rare form of uranium  called uranium      was bombarded with slow neutrons  then not only would it split into other elements and release energy     it would also release more neutrons .  which  in turn  would bombard more uranium      .  .  .  the reaction would become self sustaining  and the potential release of energy would be gigantic .   would it work .  could you get  something for nothing  in this way .  finding out was never going to be easy  because uranium     is mixed up with ordinary uranium  uranium       and getting it out is like looking for a needle in a haystack when the needle is made of straw .   there were other worries too  .  .  .  in particular  might the experiment be too successful  setting off a chain reaction that not only spread through the experiment s supply of uranium      but through everything else on earth as well .  might the atmosphere catch fire .  calculations suggested  probably not .  besides  the big worry was that if the allies didn t get nuclear fission working soon then the germans would beat them to it .  given the choice between our blowing up the world and the enemy blowing up the world  it was obvious what to do .   that is  on reflection  not a happy sentence .     loko is remarkably similar to oklo in southeastern gabon  where there are deposits of uranium .  in the     s  french scientists unearthed evidence that some of that uranium had either been undergoing unusually intense nuclear reactions or was much  much older than the rest of the planet .   it could have been an archaeological relic of some ancient civilization whose technology had got as far as atomic power  but a duller if more plausible expanation is that oklo was a  natural reactor  .  for some accidental reason  that particular patch of uranium was richer than usual in uranium      and a spontaneous chain reaction ran for hundreds of thousands of years .  nature got there well ahead of science  and without the squash court .   unless  of course  it was an archaeological relic of some ancient civilization .   until late in       the natural reactor at oklo was also the best evidence we could find to show that one of the biggest  what if .   questions in science had an uninteresting answer .  this question was  what if the natural constants aren t .   our scientific theories are underpinned by a variety of numbers  the  fundamental constants  .  examples include the speed of light  planck s constant  basic to quantum mechanics   the gravitational constant  basic to gravitational theory   the charge on an electron  and so on .  ad of the accepted theories assume that these numbers have always been the same  right from the very first moment when the universe burst into being .  our calculations about that early universe rely on those numbers having been the same  if they used to be different  we don t know what numbers to put into the calculations .  it s like trying to do your income tax when nobody will tell you the tax rates .  from time to time maverick scientists advance the odd  what if .   theory  in which they try out the possibility that one or more of the fundamental constants isn t .  the physicist lee smolin has even come up with a theory of evolving universes  which bud off baby universes with different fundamental constants .  according to this theory  our own universe is particularly good at producing such babies  and is also particularly suited to the development of life .  the conjunction of these two features  he argues  is not accidental  the wizards at uu  incidentally  would be quite at home with ideas like this     in fact  sufficiently advanced physics is indistinguishable from magic  .   oklo tells us that the fundamental constants have not changed during the last two billion years     about half the age of the earth and ten per cent of that of the universe .  the key to the argument is a particular combination of fundamental constants  known as the  fine structure constant  .   its value is very close to        and a lot of ink was devoted to explanations of that whole number      at least until more accurate measurements put its value at     .      .  the advantage of the fine structure constant is that its value does not depend on the chosen units of measurement     unlike say  the speed of light  which gives a different number if you express it in miles per second or kilometres per second .  the russian physicist alexander shlyakhter analysed the different chemicals in the oklo reactor s  nuclear waste   and worked out what the value of the fine structure constant must have been two billion years ago when the reactor was running .  the result was the same as today s value to within a few parts in ten million .   in late       though  a team of astronomers led by john webb made a very accurate study of the light emitted by extremely distant  but very bright  bodies called quasars .  they found subtle changes in certain features of that light  called spectral lines  which are related to the vibrations of various types of atom .  in effect  what they seem to have discovered is that many billion years ago     much further back than the oklo reactor  atoms didn t vibrate at quite the same rate as they do today .  in very old gas clouds from the early universe  the fine structure constant differs from today s value by one part in        .  that s a huge amount by the standards of this particular area of physics .  as far as anyone can tell  this unexpected result is not due to experimental error .  a theory suggested in      by thibault damour and alexander polyakov does indicate a possible variation in the fine structure constant  but only one ten thousandth as large as that found by webb s team .   it s all a bit of a puzzle  and most theorists sensibly prefer to hedge their bets and wait for further research .  but it could be a straw in the wind  perhaps we will soon have to accept that the laws of physics were subtly different in the distant reaches of time and space .  not turtle shaped  perhaps  but .  .  .  different .       or at least  less radioactive .  we can but hope .       he was the victim of a magical accident  which he rather enjoyed .  but you know this .       they say that every formula halves the sales of a popular science book .  this is rubbish     if it was true  then the emperor s new mind by roger penrose would have sold one eighth of a copy  whereas its actual sales were in the hundreds of thousands .  however  just in case there is some truth to the myth  we have adopted this way of describing the formula to double our potential sales .  you all know which formula we mean .  you can find it written out in symbols on page     of stephen hawking s a brief history of time     so if the myth is right  he could have sold twice as many copies  which is a mindboggling thought .       the fine structure constant is defined to be the square of the charge of an electron  divided by   times planck s constant times the speed of light times the permittivity of the vacuum  as a handy lie  the last term might be thought as  the way it reacts to an electric charge   .  thank you .       three   i know my wizards    it did not take long for the faculty to put its collective finger on the philosophical nub of the problem  vis    vis the complete destruction of everything .    if no one will know if it happens  then in a very real sense it wouldn t have happened   said the lecturer in recent runes .  his bedroom was on one of the colder sides of the university .    certainly we wouldn t get the blame   said the dean   even if it did .     as a matter of fact   ponder went on  emboldened by the wizards  relaxed approach   there is some theoretical evidence to suggest that it could not possibly happen  due to the non temporal nature of the thaumic component .     say again .   said ridcully .    a malfunction would not result in an explosion exactly  sir   said ponder .   nor  as far as i can work out  would it result in things ceasing to exist from the present onwards .  they would cease to have existed at all  because of the multidirectional collapse of the thaumic field .  but since we are here  sir  we must be living in a universe where things did not go wrong .     ah  i know this one   said ridcully .   this is because of quantum  isn t it .  and there s some usses in some universe next door where it did go wrong  and the poor devils got blown up .     yes  sir or  rather  no .  they didn t get blown up because the device the other ponder stibbons would have built would have gone wrong  and so  .  .  .  he didn t exist not to build it .  that s the theory  anyway .     i m glad that s sorted out  then   said the senior wrangler briskly .   we re here because we re here .  and since we re here  we might as well be warm .     then we seem to be in agreement   said ridcully .   mr stibbons  you may start this infernal engine .   he nodded towards the red lever on the plinth .    i was rather assuming you would do the honours  archchancellor   said ponder  bowing .   all you need to do is pull the lever .  that will  ahem  release the interlock  allowing the flux to enter the exchanger  where a simple octiron reaction will turn the magic into heat and warm up the water in the boiler .     so it really is just a big kettle .   said the dean .    in a manner of speaking  yes   said ponder  trying to keep his face straight .   ridcully grasped the lever .    perhaps you would care to say a few words  sir .   said ponder .    yes .   ridcully looked thoughtful for a moment  and then brightened up .   let s get this over quickly  and have lunch .    there was a smattering of applause .  he pulled the lever .  the hand on a dial on the wall moved off zero .    well  we re not blown up after all   said the senior wrangler .   what are the numbers on the wall for  stibbons .     oh  er  .  .  .  they re  .  .  .  they re to tell you what number it s got to   said ponder .    oh .  i see .   the senior wrangler grasped the lapels of his robe .   duck with green peas today  gentlemen  i believe   he said  in a far more interested tone of voice .   well done  mr stibbons .    the wizards ambled off in the apparently slow yet deceptively fast way of wizards heading towards food .   ponder breathed a sigh of relief  which turned into a gulp when he realized that the archchancellor had not  in fact  left but was inspecting the engine quite closely .    er  .  .  .  is there anything else i can tell you  sir .   he said  hurriedly .    when did you really start it  mister stibbons .     sir .     every single word in the sentence was quite short and easy to understand .  was there something wrong about the way i assembled them .     i  .  .  .  we  .  .  .  it was started just after breakfast  sir   said ponder meekly .   the needle on the dial was just turned by mr turnipseed by means of a string  sir    did it blow up at all when you started it up .     no sir .  you d  .  .  .  well  you d have known  sir .     i thought you said back there that we wouldn t have known  stibbons .     well  no  i mean .  .  .       i know you  stibbons   said ridcully .   and you would never test something out publicly before trying it to see if it worked .  no one wants egg all over their face  do they .    ponder reflected that egg on the face is only of minor concern when the face is part of a cloud of particles expanding outwards at an appreciable fraction of the speed of dark .    ridcully slammed his hand against the black panels of the engine  causing ponder visibly to leave the ground .    warm already   he said .   you all right up there  bursar .    the bursar nodded happily .    good man .  well done  mister stibbons .  let s have lunch .    after a while  when the footsteps had died away  it dawned on the bursar that he was  as it were  holding the short end of the string .   the bursar was not  as many thought  insane .  on the contrary  he was a man with both feet firmly on the ground  the only difficulty being that the ground in question was on some other planet  the one with the fluffy pink clouds and the happy little bunnies .  he did not mind because he much preferred it to the real one  where people shouted too much  and he spent as little time there as possible .  unfortunately this had to include mealtimes .  the meal service on planet nice was unreliable .   smiling his faint little smile  he put down his axe and ambled off .  after all  he reasoned  the point was that the wretched thing stayed out of the  .  .  .  whatever it was  and it could certainly do a simple job like that without his watching it .   unfortunately mr stibbons was too worried to be very observant  and none of the other wizards bothered much about the fact that everything which stood between them and thaumic devastation was blowing bubbles into his glass of milk .       as yet unmeasured  but believed to be faster than the speed of light owing to its ability to move so quickly out of light s way .       four   science and magic    if we wanted to  we could comment on several features of ponder stibbons s experiment  describing the associated science .  for example  there is a hint of the  many worlds  interpretation of quantum mechanics  in which billions of universes branch off from ours every time a decision might go more than one way .  and there is the unofficial standard procedure of public opening ceremonies  in which a royal personage or the president pulls a big lever or pushes a big button to  start  some vast monument to technology     which has been running for days behind the scenes .  when queen elizabeth ii opened calder hall  the first british nuclear power station  this is just what went on     big meter and all .   however  it s a bit early for quantum  and most of us have forgotten calder hall completely .  in any case there s a more urgent matter to dispose of .  this is the relation between science and magic .  let s start with science .     human interest in the nature of the universe  and our place within it  goes back a long  long way .  early humanoids living on the african savannahs  for instance  can hardly have failed to notice that at night the sky was full of bright spots of light .  at what stage in their evolution they first began to wonder what those lights were is a mystery  but by the time they had evolved enough intelligence to poke sticks into edible animals and to use fire  it is unlikely that they could stare at the night sky without wondering what the devil it was for  and  given humanity s traditional obsessions  whether it involved sex in some way  .  the moon was certainly impressive     it was big  bright  and changed shape .   creatures lower on the evolutionary ladder were certainly aware of the moon .  take the turtle  for instance     about as discwordly a beast as you can get .  when today s turtles crawl up the beach to lay their eggs and bury them in the sand  they somehow choose their timing so that when the eggs hatch  the baby turtles can scramble towards the sea by aiming at the moon .  we know this because the lights of modern buildings confuse them .  this behaviour is remarkable  and it s not at all satisfactory to put it down to  instinct  and pretend that s an answer .  what is instinct .  how does it work .  how did it arise .  a scientist wants plausible answers to such questions  not just an excuse to stop thinking about them .  presumably the baby turtles  moonseeking tendencies  and their mothers  uncanny sense of timing  evolved together .  turtles that just happened  by accident  to lay their eggs at just the right time for them to hatch when the moon would be to seawards of their burial site  and whose babies just happened to head towards the bright lights  got more of the next generation back to sea than those that didn t .  all that was needed to establish these tendencies as a universal feature of turtle hood was some way to pass them on to the next generation  which is where genes come in .  those turtles that stumbled on a workable navigational strategy  and could pass that strategy on to their offspring by way of their genes  did better than the others .  and so they prospered  and outcompeted the others  so that soon the only turtles around were the ones that could navigate by the moon .   does great a tuin  the turtle that holds up the elephants that hold up the disc  swim through the depths of space in search of a distant light .  perhaps .  according to the light fantastic   philosophers have debated for years about where great a tuin might be going  and have often said how worried they are that they might never find out .  they re due to find out in about two months .  and then they re really going to worry  .  .  .   for  like its earthbound counterpart  great a tuin is in reproductive mode  in this case going to its own hatching ground to watch the emergence .  that story ends with it swimming off into the cool depths of space  orbited by eight baby turtles  who appear to have gone off on their own  and perhaps even now support very small discworlds   .  .  .   the interesting thing about the terrestrial turtlish trickery is that at no stage is it necessary for the animals to be conscious that their timing is geared to the moon s motion  or even that the moon exists .  however  the trick won t work unless the baby turtles notice the moon  so we deduce that they did .  but we can t deduce the existence of some turtle astronomer who wondered about the moon s puzzling changes of shape .   when a particular bunch of social climbing monkeys arrived on the scene  however  they began to ask such questions .  the better the monkeys got at answering those questions  the more baffling the universe became  knowledge increases ignorance .  the message they got was  up there is very different from down here .   they didn t know that down here was a pretty good place for creatures like them to live .  there was air to breathe  animals and plants to eat  water to drink  land to stand on  and caves to get out of the rain and the lions .  they did know that it was changeable  chaotic  unpredictable  .  .  .   they didn t know that up there  the rest of the universe  isn t like that .  most of it is empty space  a vacuum .  you can t breathe vacuum .  most of what isn t vacuum is huge balls of overheated plasma .  you can t stand on a ball of flame .  and most of what isn t vacuum and isn t burning is lifeless rock .  you can t eat rock .   they were going to learn this later on .  what they did know was that up there was  in human timescales  calm  ordered  regular .  and predictable  too     you could set your stone circle by it .   all this gave rise to a general feeling that up there was different from down here for a reason .  down here was clearly designed for us .  equally clearly  up there wasn t .  therefore it must be designed for somebody else .  and the new humanity was already speculating about some suitable tenants  and had been ever since they d hidden in the caves from the thunder .  the gods .  they were up there  looking down .  and they were clearly in charge  because humanity certainly wasn t .  as a bonus  that explained all of the things down here that were a lot more complicated than anything visible up there  like thunderstorms and earthquakes and bees .  those were under the control of the gods .   it was a neat package .  it made us feel important .  it certainly made the priests important .  and since priests were the sort of people who could have your tongue torn out or banish you into lion country for disagreeing with them  it rapidly became an enormously popular theory  if only because those who had other ones either couldn t speak or were up a tree somewhere .   and yet  .  .  .  every so often some lunatic with no sense of self preservation was born who found the whole story unsatisfying  and risked the wrath of the priesthood to say so .  such folk were already around by the time of the babylonians  whose civilization flourished between and around the tigris and euphrates rivers from      bc to     bc .  the babylonians     a term that covers a whole slew of semi independent peoples living in separate cities such as babylon  ur  nippur  uruk  lagash  and so on     certainly worshipped the gods like everyone else .  one of their stories about gods is the basis of the biblical tale of noah and his ark  for instance .  but they also took a keen interest in what those lights in the sky did .  they knew that the moon was round  a sphere rather than a flat disc .  they probably knew that the earth was round  too  because it cast a rounded shadow on the moon during lunar eclipses .  they knew that the year was about       days long .  they even knew about the  precession of the equinoxes   a cyclic variation that completes one cycle every        years .  they made these discoveries by keeping careful records of how the moon and the planets moved across the sky .  babylonian astronomical records from     bc survive to this day .   from such beginnings  an alternative explanation of the universe came into being .  it didn t involve gods  at least directly  so it didn t find much favour with the priestly class .  some of their descendants are still trying to stamp it out  even today .  the traditional priesthoods  who then and now often included some very intelligent people  eventually worked out an accommodation with this godless way of thinking  but it s still not popular with postmodernists  creationists  tabloid astrologers and others who prefer the answers you can make up for yourself at home .   the current name for what has variously been called  heresy  and  natural philosophy  is  of course   science  .   science has developed a very strange view of the universe .  it thinks that the universe runs on rules .  rules that never get broken .  rules that leave little room for the whims of gods .   this emphasis on rules presents science with a daunting task .  it has to explain how a lot of flaming gas and rocks up there  obeying simple rules like  big things attract small things  and while small things also attract big things they don t do it strongly enough so as you d notice   can have any chance whatsoever of giving rise to down here .  down here  rigid obedience to rules seems notably absent .  one day you go out hunting and catch a dozen gazelles  next day a lion catches you .  down here the most evident rule seems to be  there are no rules   apart perhaps from the one that could be expressed scientifically as  excreta occurs  .  as the harvard law of animal behaviour puts it   experimental animals  under carefully controlled laboratory conditions  do what they damned well please .   not only animals  every golfer knows that something as simple as a hard  bouncy sphere with a pattern of tiny dots on it never does what it s supposed to do .  and as for the weather  .  .  .     science has now divided into two big areas  the life sciences  which tell us about living creatures  and the physical sciences  which tell us about everything else .  historically   divides  is definitely the word  the scientific styles of these two big divisions have about as much in common as chalk and cheese .  indeed  chalk is a rock and so clearly belongs to the geological sciences  whereas cheese  formed by bacterial action on the bodily fluids of cows  belongs to the biological sciences .  both divisions are definitely science  with the same emphasis on the role of experiments in testing theories  but their habitual thought patterns run along different lines .   at least  until now .   as the third millennium approaches  more and more aspects of science are straddling the disciplines .  chalk  for instance  is more than just a rock  it is the remains of shells and skeletons of millions of tiny ocean living creatures .  and making cheese relies on chemistry and sensor technology as much as it does on the biology of grass and cows .   the original reason for this major bifurcation in science was a strong perception that life and non life are extremely different .  non life is simple and follows mathematical rules  life is complex and follows no rules whatsoever .  as we said  down here looks very different from up there .   however  the more we pursue the implications of mathematical rules  the more flexible a rule based universe begins to seem .  conversely  the more we understand biology  the more important its physical aspects become  because life isn t a special kind of matter  so it too must obey the rules of physics .  what looked like a vast  unbridgeable gulf between the life sciences and the physical sciences is shrinking so fast that it s turning out to be little more than a thin line scratched in the sand of the scientific desert .   if we are to step across that line  though  we need to revise the way we think .  it s all too easy to fall back on old     and inappropriate     habits .  to illustrate the point  and to set up a running theme for this book  let s see what the engineering problems of getting to the moon tell us about how living creatures work .   the main obstacle to getting a human being on to the moon is not distance  but gravity .  you could waik to the moon in about thirty years     given a path  air  and the usual appurtenances of the experienced traveller     were it not for the fact that it s uphill most of the way .  it takes energy to lift a person from the surface of the planet to the neutral point where the moon s pull cancels out the earth s .  physics provides a definite lower limit for the energy you must expend  it s the difference between the  potential energy  of a mass placed at the neutral point and the potential energy of the same mass placed on the ground .  the law of conservation of energy says that you can t do the job with less energy  however clever you are .   you can t beat physics .   this is what makes space exploration so expensive .  it takes a lot of fuel to lift one person into space by rocket  and to make matters worse  you need more fuel to lift the rocket  .  .  .  and more fuel to lift the fuel .  .  .  and  .  .  .  at any rate  it seems that we re stuck at the bottom of the earth s gravity well  and the ticket out has to cost a fortune .   are we  though .   at various times  similar calculations have been applied to living creatures  with bizarre results .  it has been  proved  that kangaroos can t jump  bees can t fly  and birds can t get enough energy from their food to power their search for the food in the first place .  it has even been  proved  that life is impossible because living systems become more and more ordered  whereas physics implies that all systems become more and more disordered .  the main message that biologists have derived from these exercises has been a deep scepticism about the relevance of physics to biology  and a comfortable feeling of superiority  because life is clearly much more interesting than physics .   the correct message is very different  be careful what tacit assumptions you make when you do that kind of calculation .  take that kangaroo  for instance .  you can work out how much energy a kangaroo uses when it makes a jump  count how many jumps it makes in a day  and deduce a lower limit on its daily energy requirements .  during a jump  the kangaroo leaves the ground  rises  and drops back down again  so the calculation is just like that for a space rocket .  do the sums  and you find that the kangaroo s daily energy requirement is about ten times as big as anything it can get from its food .  conclusion  kangaroos can t jump .  since they can t jump  they can t find food  so they re all dead .   strangely  australia is positively teeming with kangaroos  who fortunately cannot do physics .   what s the mistake .  the calculation models a kangaroo as if it were a sack of potatoes .  instead of a thousand kangaroo leaps per day  say   it works out the energy required to lift a sack of potatoes off the ground and drop it back down       times .  but if you look at a slow motion film of a kangaroo bounding across the australian outback  it doesn t look like a sack of potatoes .  a kangaroo bounces  lolloping along like a huge rubber spring .  as its legs go up  its head and tail go down  storing energy in its muscles .  then  as the feet hit the ground  that energy is released to trigger the next leap .  because most of the energy is borrowed and paid back  the energy cost per leap is tiny .   here s an association test for you .   sack of potatoes  is to  kangaroo  as  rocket  is to     what .  one possible answer is a space elevator .  in the october      issue of wireless world the science fiction writer arthur c .  clarke invented the concept of a geostationary orbit  now the basis of virtually all communications satellites .  at a particular height     about        miles         km  above the ground  a satellite will go round the earth exactly in synchrony with the earth s rotation .  so from the ground it will look as though the satellite isn t moving .  this is useful for communications  you can point your satellite dish in a fixed direction and always get coherent  intelligent signals or  failing that  mtv .   nearly thirty years later clarke popularized a concept with far greater potential for technological change .  put up a satellite in geostationary orbit and drop a long cable down to the ground .  it has to be an amazingly strong cable  we don t yet have the technology but  carbon nanotubes  now being created in the laboratory come close .  if you get the engineering right  you can build an elevator        miles high .  the cost would be enormous  but you could then haul stuff into space just by pulling on the cable from above .   ah  but you can t beat physics .  the energy required would be exactly the same as if you used a rocket .   of course .  just as the energy required to lift a kangaroo is exactly the same as that required to lift a sack of potatoes .   the trick is to find a way to borrow energy and pay it back .  the point is that once the space elevator is in place  after a while there s just as much stuff coming down it as there is going up .  indeed  if you re mining the moon or the asteroids for metals  there will soon be more stuff coming down than goes up .  the materials going down provide the lifting energy for those going up .  unlike a rocket  which gets used up every time you fire it  a space elevator is self sustaining .   life is like a space elevator .  what life self sustains is not energy  but organization .  once you have a system that is so highly organized that it can reliably make copies of itself  that degree of organization is no longer  expensive  .  the initial investment may have been huge  as for a space elevator  but once the investment has been made  everything else is free .   if you want to understand biology  it is the physics of space elevators that you need  not the physics of rockets .   how can discworld s magic illuminate roundworld s science .  just as the gulf between the physical and biological sciences is turning out to be far narrower than we used to think  so the gulf between science and magic is also becoming smaller the more advanced our technologies become  the less possible it is for the everyday user to have any idea of how they work .  as a result  they look more and more like magic .  as clarke realized  this tendency is inevitable  gregory benford went further and declared it desirable .   technology works because whoever built it in the first place figured out enough of the rules of the universe to make the technology do what was required of it .  you don t need to get the rules right to do this  just right enough     space rockets work fine even though their orbits are computed using newton s stab at the rules of gravity  which aren t as accurate as einstein s .  but what you can accomplish is severely constrained by what the universe will permit .  with magic  in contrast  things work because people want them to .  you still have to find the right spell  but what drives the development is human wishes  and  of course  the knowledge  skill and experience of the practitioner  .  this is one reason why science often seems inhuman  because it looks at how the universe drives us  rather than the other way round .   magic  however  is only one aspect of discworld .  there s a lot of science on discworld  too     or at least rational engineering .  balls get thrown and caught  the biology of the river ankh resembles that of a typical terrestrial swamp or sewage farm  and light goes in more or less straight lines .  very slowly  though .  as we read in the light fantastic   another disc day dawned  but very gradually  and this is why .  when light encounters a strong magical field it loses all sense of urgency .  it slows right down .  and on the discworld the magic was embarrassingly strong  which meant that the soft yellow light of dawn flowed over the sleeping landscape like the caress of a gentle lover or  as some would have it  like golden syrup .   the same quote tells us that as well as rational engineering there s a lot of magic in discworld  overt magic which slows light down  magic that allows the sun to orbit the world provided that occasionally one of the elephants lifts its leg to let the sun pass .  the sun is small  nearby  and travels faster than its own light .  this appears to cause no major problems .   there is magic in our world  too  but of a different  less obvious kind .  it happens around everybody all the time  in all those little causalities which we don t understand but just accept .  when we turn the switch and the light comes on .  when we get into the car and start the engine .  when we do all those improbable and ridiculous things that  thanks to biological causality  make babies .  certainly many people understand  often to quite a detailed degree  what is going on in particular areas     but sooner or later we all reach our magical event horizon .  clarke s law states that any sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic .   advanced  here is usually taken to mean  shown to us by advanced aliens or people from the future   like television shown to neanderthals .  but we should realize that television is magic to nearly everyone that uses it now     to those behind the camera as well as to those sitting on the couch in front of the moving picture in the funny box .  at some point in the process  in the words of cartoonist s .  harris   a miracle occurs  .   science takes on the aura of magic because the design of a civilization proceeds by a type of narrative imperative     it makes a coherent story .  in about       jack gave a lecture to a school audience on  the possibility of life on other planets  .   he talked about evolution  what planets were made of     all the things that you d expect in such a lecture .  the first question was from a girl of about     who asked  you believe in evolution  don t you  sir .   the teacher went on about it not being a  proper  question  but jack answered it anyway  saying     rather pretentiously      no  i don t believe in evolution  like people believe in god  .  .  .  science and technology are not advanced by people who believe  but by people who don t know but are doing their best to find out  .  .  .  steam engine  .  .  .  spinning jenny  .  .  .  television  .  .  .  at that  she was on her feet again   no  that ain t how television was invented .   the teacher tried to calm the discussion by asking her to explain how she thought television was invented .   my father works for fisher ludlow making pressed steel for car bodies .  he gets paid and he gives some of the money to the government to give him things .  so he tells the government he wants to watch television  and they pay someone to invent television  and they do .    it s very easy to make this mistake  because technology progresses by pursuing goals .  we get the feeling that if we pour in enough resources  we can achieve anything .  not so .  pour in enough resources  and we can achieve anything that is within reach of current know how  or possibly just a bit beyond if we re lucky .  but nobody tells us about the inventions that fail .  nobody tries to raise funding for a project that they know can t possibly work .  no funding body will pay for research projects in which we have no idea where to start .  we could pour as much money as we liked into developing antigravity or faster than light travel  and we d get nowhere .   when you can take a machine to bits and see how it works  you get a clear feeling for the constraints within which it has to operate .  in such cases  you re not going to confuse science and magic .  the first cars required an extremely hands on starting system  you stuck a big handle into the engine and literally  turned it over  .  whatever the engine did when it started  you knew it wasn t magic .  however  as technology develops it usually doesn t remain transparent to the user .  as more people began to use cars  more and more of the obvious technology was replaced by symbols .  you worked switches with labels to get things to happen .  that s our version of the magic spell  you pull a knob called cold start and the engine does all the cold start things for itself .  when granny wants to drive she does not have to do much more than push the accelerator for  go  .  little imps do the rest  by magic .   this process is the core of the relation between science and magic in our own world .  the universe into which we were born  and in which our species evolved  runs by rules     and science is our way of trying to work out what the rules are .  but the universe that we are now constructing for ourselves is one that  to anyone other than a member of the design team and very possibly even to them  works by magic .     a special kind of magic is one of the many things that have made humans what they are .  it s called education .  it s how we pass on ideas from one generation to the next .  if we were like computers  we d be able to copy our minds into our children  so that they would grow up agreeing with every opinion that we hold dear .  well  actually they wouldn t  though they might start out that way .  there is an aspect of education that we want to draw to your attention .  we call it  lies to children  .  we re aware that some readers may object to the word  lie   it got ianand jack into terrible trouble with some literally minded swedes at a scientific conference who took it all terribly seriously and spent several days protesting that  it s not a lie .   it is .  it is for the best possible reasons  but it is still a lie .  a lie to children is a statement that is false  but which nevertheless leads the child s mind towards a more accurate explanation  one that the child will only be able to appreciate if it has been primed with the lie .   the early stages of education have to include a lot of lies to children  because early explanations have to be simple .  however  we live in a complex world  and lies to children must eventually be replaced by more complex stories if they are not to become delayed action genuine lies .  unfortunately  what most of us know about science consists of vaguely remembered lies to children .  for example  the rainbow .  we all remember being told at school that glass and water split light into its constituent colours     there s even a nice experiment where you can see them     and we were told that this is how rainbows form  from light passing through raindrops .  when we were children  it never occurred to us that while this explains the colours of the rainbow it doesn t explain its shape .  neither does it explain how the light from the many different raindrops in a thundershower somehow combines to create a bright arc .  why doesn t it all smudge out .  this is not the place to tell you about the elegant geometry of the rainbow     but you can see why  lie  is not such a strong word after all .  the school explanation diverts our attention from the real marvel of the rainbow  the cooperative effects of all the raindrops  by trying to pretend that once you ve explained the colours  that s it .   other examples of lies to children are the idea that the earth s magnetic field is like a huge bar magnet with n and s marked on it  the picture of an atom as a miniature solar system  the idea that a living amoeba is a billion year old  primitive  organism  the image of dna as the blueprint for a living creature  and the connection between relativity and einstein s hairstyle  it s the sort of crazy idea that only people with hair like that can come up with  .  quantum mechanics lacks a public  icon  of this kind  it doesn t tell a simple story that a non specialist can grab and hang on to  so we feel uncomfortable about it .   when you live in a complex world  you have to simplify it in order to understand it .  indeed  that s what  understand  means .  at different stages of education  different levels of simplification are appropriate .  liar to children is an honourable and vital profession  otherwise known as  teacher  .  but what teaching does not do     although many politicians think it does  which is one of the problems     is erect a timeless edifice of  facts  .   every so often  you have to unlearn what you thought you already knew  and replace it by something more subtle .  this process is what science is all about  and it never stops .  it means that you shouldn t take everything we say as gospel  either  for we belong to another  equally honourable profession  liar to readers .   on discworld  one of ponder stibbons s lies to wizards is about to come seriously unstuck .       actually  you can eat salt .  but nobody outside discworld goes to a restaurant to order a basalt balti .       now turned into a book  evolving the alien by jack cohen and ian stewart .       as humans  we have invented lots of useful kinds of lie .  as well as lies to children   as much as they need to know   lies to patients   they won t worry about what they don t know   and  for all sorts of reasons  lies to ourselves .  lies to children is simply a prevalent and necessary kind of lie .  universities are very familiar with bright  qualified school leavers who arrive and then go into shock on finding that biology or physics isn t quite what they ve been taught so far .   yes  but you need to understand that   they are told   so that now we can tell you why it isn t exactly true .   discworld teachers know this  and use it to demonstrate why universities are truly storehouses of knowledge  students arrive from school confident that they know very nearly everything  and they leave years later certain that they know practically nothing .  where did the knowledge go in the meantime .  into the university  of course  where it is carefully dried and stored .       five   the roundworld project    archchancellor ridcully awoke from an afternoon nap in which he had been crawling through a baking desert under a flamethrower sky  and found that this was more or less true .   superheated steam whistled from the joints of the radiator in the corner .  ridcully walked over through the stifling air and touched it gently .    ouch .  damnation .    sucking his right hand and using his left hand to unwrap the scarf from his neck  he strode out into the corridor and what looked like hell with the heat turned up .  steam rolled along the corridors  and from somewhere overhead came the once heard never forgotten thwack of a high energy magical discharge .  violet light filled the windows for a moment .    will someone tell me what the heck is going on .   ridcully demanded of the air in general .   something like an iceberg loomed out of the steam .  it was the dean .    i would like to make it absolutely clear  archchancellor  that this is nothing to do with me .    ridcully wiped away the sweat that was beginning to trickle down his forehead .    why are you standin  there in just your drawers  dean .     i     well  my room is absolutely boiling hot          i demand you put something on  man  you look thoroughly unhygienic .    there was another crack of discharged magic .  sparks flew off the end of ridcully s fingers .    i felt that one .   he said  running back into his room .   beyond the window  on the other side of the gardens  the air wavered over the high energy magic building .  as the archchancellor watched  the two huge bronze globes on its roof became covered in crawling  zig zagging purple lines      he hit the floor rolling  as wizards are wont to do  just before the shock of the discharge blew the windows in .     melted snow was pouring off the rooftops .  every icicle was a streaming finger of water .   a large door bumped and scraped its way across the steaming lawns .   tor goodness  sake  dean  handle your end  can t you .    the door skidded a little further .    it s no good  ridcully  it s solid oak .     and i m very glad of it .    behind ridcully and the dean  who were inching the door forward largely by arguing with each other  the rest of the faculty crept forward .   the bronze globes were humming now  in the rapidly decreasing intervals between discharges .  they had been installed  to general scoffing  as a crude method of releasing the occasional erratic build up of disorganized magic in the building .  now they were outlined in unhealthy looking light .    and we know what that means  don t we  mister stibbons .   said ridcully  as they reached the entrance to the high energy magic building .    the fabric of reality being unravelled and leaving us prey to creatures from the dungeon dimensions  sir .   mumbled stibbons  who was trailing behind .    that s right  mister stibbons .  and we don t want that  do we  stibbons .     no  sir .     no  sir .  we don t  sir .   ridcully roared .   it ll be tentacles all over the place again .  and none of us wants tentacles all over the place  do we .     no  sir .     no  sir .  so switch the damned thing off sir .     but it d be certain death to go into        ponder stopped  swallowed and restarted .   in fact it would be uncertain death to go into the squash court at the moment  archchancellor .  there must be million of thaums of random magic in there .  anything could happen .    inside the hem the ceiling was vibrating .  the whole building seemed to be dancing .    they certainly knew how to build  didn t they  when they built the old squash court   said the lecturer in recent runes  in an admiring tone of voice .   of course  it was built to contain large amounts of magic  .  .  .     even if we could switch it off  i don t think that d be such a good idea   said ponder .    sounds a lot better than what s happening now   said the dean .    but is falling through the air better than hitting the ground .   said ponder .   ridcully sucked in his breath between his teeth .    that s a point   he said .   could be something of an implosion  i suppose .  you can t just stop something like this .  something bad would happen .     the end of the world .   quavered the senior wrangler .    probably just this part of it   said ponder .    are we talking here about a sort of huge valley about twenty miles across with mountains all round it .   said ridcully  staring at the ceiling .  cracks were zig zagging across it .    yes  sir  i m wondering if whoever tried this at loko actually did manage to switch it off  .  .  .    the walls groaned .  there was a rattling noise behind ponder .  he recognized it  even above the din .  it was the sound of hex resetting its writing device .  ponder always thought of it as a kind of mechanical throat clearing .   the pen jerked in its complex network of threads and springs  and then wrote       this may be time for the roundworld project       what are you talking about  man .   snapped ridcully  who d never quite understood what hex was .    oh  that .  that s been around for ages   said the dean .   no one s ever taken it seriously .  it s just a thought experiment .  you couldn t do it .  it s completely absurd .  it needs far too much magic .     well  we ve got far too much magic   said ridcully .   right now we need to use it up .    there was a moment s silence .  that is  the wizards were silent .  overhead  magic flared into the sky with a sound like roaring gas .    can t let it build up here   ridcully went on .   what s the roundworld project then .     it was  er  .  .  .  there was once some suggestion that it might be possible to create a  .  .  .  an area where the laws of magic don t apply   said ponder .   we could use it to learn more about magic .     magic s everywhere  said ridcully .   it s part of what everywhere is    yes  sir   said ponder  watching the archchancellor carefully .   the ceiling creaked .    what use would it be  anyway .   said ridcully  still thinking aloud .    well  sir  you could ask what use is a new born child  .  .  .     no  that s not the sort of question i ask   said ridcully .   and it s a highly suspicious one  too .    the wizards ducked as the latest discharge crackled overhead .  it was followed by a louder explosion .    i think the balls have just exploded  sir   said ponder .    all right  then  how long would the project take to set up .   said ridcully .    months   said the dean firmly .    we ve got about ten seconds to the next discharge  sir   said ponder .   only  .  .  .  now the balls have gone it will simply earth itself .  .  .     ah .  oh .  really .  well  then  .  .  .   ridcully looked around at his fellow wizards as the wall began to shake again .   it s been nice knowing you .  some of you .  one or two of you  anyway  .  .  .    the whine of increasing magic rose in pitch .   the dean cleared his throat .    i d just like to say  mustrum   he began .    yes  old friend .     i d just like to say  .  .  .  i think i d have made a much better archchancellor than you .    the whine stopped .  the silence twanged .  the wizards held their breath .   something went  ping  .   a globe about a foot across hung in the air between the faculty .  it looked like glass  or the sheen of a pearl without the pearl itself .   from the squash court next door there was  instead of the wild roar of disorganized thaums  the steady thrum thrum of purpose .    what the heck is that .   said ridcully  as the wizards unfolded themselves .   hex rattled .  ponder picked up the piece of paper .    well  according to this  it s the roundworld project   he said .   and it s absorbing all the energy from the thaumic pile .    the dean brushed some dust off his robe .    nonsense   he said .   takes months .  anyway  how could that machine possibly know the spells .     mr turnipseed did copy in a lot of the grimoires last year   said ponder .   it s vital that hex knows basic spell structure  you see  .   .    the senior wrangler peered irritably at the sphere .    is this all it is .   he said .   doesn t seem much for all that effort .    there was a frightening moment as the dean walked up to the sphere and his nose  enormously magnified  appeared in it .    old archchancellor bewdley devised it   he said .   everyone said it was impossible  .  .  .     mr stibbons .   said ridcully .    yes  sir .     are we in danger of blowing up at the moment .     i don t think so  sir .  the  .  .  .  project is sucking up everything .     shouldn t it be glowing  then .  or something .  what s in there .    hex wrote      nothing       all that magic s going into empty space .        empty space is not nothing  archchancellor .  there is not even empty space inside the project .  there is no time for it to be empty in       what s it got in it  then .        i am checking      hex wrote patiently .    look  i can stick my hand right in it   said the dean .   the wizards watched in horror .  the dean s fingers were visible  darkly  within the sphere  outlined in thousands of tiny sparkling lights .    that was a really very foolish thing you just did   said ridcully .   how did you know it wasn t dangerous .     i didn t   said the dean cheerfully   it feels  .  .  .  cool .  and rather chilly .  prickly  in a funny sort of way   hex rattled .  ponder walked back and looked down at the paper .   it almost feels sticky when i move my fingers   said the dean .    er  .  .  .  dean .   said ponder  stepping back carefully .   i think it would be a really good idea if you pulled your hand out very  very carefully and really very soon .     that s odd  it s beginning to tingle        right now  dean .  right now .    for once  the urgency in ponder s voice got through the dean s cosmic self confidence .  he turned to argue with ponder stibbons just a moment before a white spark appeared in the centre of the sphere and began to expand rapidly .   the sphere flickered .    anyone know what caused that .   said the senior wrangler  his face bathed in the growing light of the project .    i think   said ponder slowly  holding up hex s write out   it was time and space starting to happen .    in hex s careful writing  the words said      in the absence of duration and dimension  there must be potentiality .       and the wizards looked upon the universe that was growing within the little sphere and spake amongst themselves  saying   it s rather a small one  don t you think .  is it dinner time yet .    later on  the wizards wondered if the new universe might have been different if the dean had waggled his fingers in a different way .  perhaps  within it  matter might have naturally formed itself into  say  garden furniture  or one giant nine dimensional flower a trillion miles across .  but archchancellor ridcully pointed out that this was not very useful thinking  because of the ancient principle of wygiwygaingw  .        what you get is what you   re given and it   s no good whining .         six   beginnings and becomings    potentiality is the key .   our immediate task is to start from a lot of vacuum and a few rules  and convince you that they have enormous potentiality .  given enough time  they can lead to people  turtles  weather  the internet     hold it .  where did all that vacuum come from .  either the universe has been around forever  or once there wasn t a universe and then there was .  the second statement fits neatly with the human predilection for creation myths .  it also appeals to today s scientists     possibly for the same reason .  lies to children run deep .   isn t vacuum just  .   .   .  empty space .  what was there before we had space .  how do you make space .  out of vacuum .  isn t that a vicious circle .  if in the past we didn t have space  how can there have been a  there  for whatever it was to exist in .  and if there wasn t anywhere for it to exist  how did it manage to make space .  maybe space was there all along  .   .   .  but why .  and what about time .  space is easy compared to time .  space is just  .  .  .  somewhere to put matter .  matter is just  .  .  .  stuff .  but time     time flows  time passes  time makes sense in the past and the future but not in the instantaneous  frozen present .  what makes time flow .  could the flow of time be stopped .  what would happen if it did .   there are little questions  there are medium sized questions  and there are big questions .  after which there are even bigger questions  huge questions  and questions so vast that it is hard to imagine what kind of response would count as an answer .   you can usually recognize the little questions  they look immensely complicated .  things like  what is the molecular structure of the left handed isomer of glucose .   as the questions get bigger  they become deceptively simpler   why is the sky blue .   the really big questions are so simple that it seems astonishing that science has absolutely no idea how to answer them   why doesn t the universe run backwards instead .   or  why does red look like that .      all this goes to show that it s a lot easier to ask a question than it is to answer it  and the more specialized your question is  the longer are the words that you must invent to state it .  moreover  the bigger a question is  the more people are interested in it .  hardly anybody cares about left handed glucose  but nearly all of us wonder why red looks the way it does  and we vaguely wonder whether it looks the same to everybody else .   out on the fringes of scientific thought are questions that are big enough to interest almost everybody  but small enough for there to be a chance of answering them reasonably accurately .  they are questions like  how did the universe begin .   and  how will it end .     what happens in between .   is quite a different matter .   let us acknowledge  right up front  that the current answers to such questions depend upon various questionable assumptions .  previous generations have been absolutely convinced that their scientific theories were well nigh perfect  only for it to turn out that they had missed the point entirely .  why should it be any different for our generation .  beware of scientific fundamentalists who try to tell you everything is pretty much worked out  and only a few routine details are left to do .  it is just when the majority of scientists believe such things that the next revolution in our world view creeps into being  its feeble birth squeaks all but drowned by the earsplitting roar of orthodoxy .   let s take a look at the current view of how the universe began .  one of the points we are going to make is that human beings have trouble with the concept of  beginning  .  and even more trouble  let it be said  with  becoming  .  our minds evolved to carry out rather specific tasks like choosing a mate  killing bears with a sharp stick  and getting dinner without becoming it .  we ve been surprisingly good at adapting those modules to tasks for which they were never  intended   that is  tasks for which they were not used during their evolution  there being no conscious  intention   such as planning a route up the matterhorn  carving images of sea lions on polar bears  teeth   and calculating the combustion point of a complex hydrocarbon molecule .  because of the way our mental modules evolved  we think of beginnings as being analogous to how a day begins  or how a hike across the desert begins  and we think of becomings in the same way that a polar bear s tooth becomes a carved amulet  or a live spider becomes dead when you squash it .   that is  beginnings start from somewhere  which is where whatever it is begins   and becomings turn thing one into thing two by pushing it across a clearly defined boundary  the tooth was not carved  but now it is  the spider was not dead  but now it is  .  unfortunately the universe doesn t work in such a simple minded manner  so we have serious trouble thinking about how a universe can begin  or how an ovum and a sperm can become a living child .   let us leave becomings for a moment  and think about beginnings .  thanks to our evolutionary prejudices  we tend to think of the beginning of the universe as being some special time  before which the universe did not exist and after which it did .  moreover  when the universe changed from not being there to being there  something must have caused that change     something that was around before the universe began  otherwise it wouldn t have been able to cause the universe to come into being .  when you bear in mind that the beginning of the universe is also the beginning of space and the beginning of time  however  this point of view is distinctly problematic .  how can there be a  before  if time has not yet started .  how can there be a cause for the universe starting up  without space for that cause to happen in     and time for it to happen .   maybe there was something else in existence already  .  .  .  but now we have to decide how that got started  and the same difficulties arise .  all right  let s go the whole hog  something     perhaps the universe itself  perhaps some precursor     was around forever .  it didn t have a beginning  it just was  always .   satisfied .  things that exist forever don t have to be explained  because they don t need a cause .  then what caused them to have been around forever .   it now becomes impossible not to mention the turtle joke .  stephen hawking tells it at the start a brief history of time  but it goes back a lot further .  according to hindu legend  the earth rides on the back of four elephants  which ride on a turtle .  but what supports the turtle .  in discworld  great a tuin needs no support  swimming through the universe unperturbed by any thought about what holds it up .  that s magic in action  world carrying turtles are like that .  but according to the old lady who espoused the hindu cosmology  and was asked the same question by a learned astronomer  there is a different answer   it s turtles all the way down .   the image of an infinite pile of turtles is instantly ludicrous  and very few people find it a satisfying explanation .  indeed very few people find it a satisfying kind of explanation  if only because it doesn t explain what supports the infinite pile of turtles .  however  most of us are quite content to explain the origins of time as  it s always been there  .  seldom do we examine this statement closely enough to realize that what it really says is  it s time all the way back .   now replace  time  by  turtle  and  back  by  down   .  .  .  each instant of time is  supported   that is  a causal consequence of  the previous instant of time .  fine  but that doesn t explain why time exists .  what caused that infinite expanse of time .  what holds up the whole pile .   all of which puts us in a serious quandary .  we have problems thinking of time as beginning without a precursor  because it s hard to see how the causality goes .  but we have equally nasty problems thinking of time as beginning with a precursor  because then we hit the turtle pile problem .  we have similar problems with space  either it goes on forever  in which case it s  space all the way out  and we need somewhere even bigger to put the whole thing  or it stops  in which case we wonder what s outside it .   the real point is that neither of these options is satisfactory  and the origins of space and time fit neither model .  the universe is not like a village  which ends at a fence or an imaginary line on the ground  neither is it like the distant desert which seems to vanish into eternity but actually just gets too far away for us to see it clearly .  time is not like a human lifespan  which starts at birth and ends at death  nor is it like the extended lifespan found in many religions  where the human soul continues to live indefinitely after death  and the much rarer belief  held  for example  by mormons  that some aspect of each person was somehow already alive in the indefinite past .   so how did the universe begin .   begin  is the wrong word .  nonetheless  there is good evidence that the age of the universe is about    billion years   so nothing     not space  not time     existed before some instant of time roughly    billion years ago .  see how our narrativium powered semantics confuses us .  this does not mean that if you went back    billion and one years  you would find nothing .  it means that you cannot go back    billion and one years .  that description makes no sense .  it refers to a time before time began  which is logically incoherent  let alone physically so .   this is not a new point .  saint augustine made it very clearly in his confessions of about      when he said       if there was no time before heaven and earth were created  how can anyone ask what you  god  were doing    then    .  if there was no time  there was no    then      .   some have gone to greater extremes .  in the end of time  julian barbour argues that time does not exist .  in his view  the  real  laws of physics specify a static universe of timeless  nows  .  he argues that time is not a physical dimension in the way that space is .  the apparent flow of time is an illusion  created because the collection of nows that corresponds to a human being makes that human experience its world as if it were an ordered series of events  happening one after the other .  apparent gaps of  duration  between successive events are merely blanks where no  now  exists .  thief of time explores some remarkably similar issues from the discworld viewpoint .  but for this book  we will take a conventional attitude towards time  and consider it to be a real part of physics .   cosmologists are pretty sure that it all began like this .  the universe came into being as a tiny speck of space and time .  the amount of space inside this tiny speck grew rapidly  and time began to elapse so that  rapidly  actually had a meaning .  everything that there is  today  right out into the furthest depths of space  stems from that astonishing  beginning  .  colloquially  the event is known as the big bang .  the name reflects several features of the event     for example  that tiny speck of space time was enormously hot  and grew in size exceedingly rapidly .  it was like a huge explosion  but there was no stick of cosmic dynamite  sitting there in no space with its non material fuse burning away as some kind of pre time pseudo clock counted down the seconds to detonation .  what exploded was     nothing .  space  time  and matter are the products of that explosion  they played no part in its cause .  indeed  in a very real sense  it had no cause .   the evidence in favour of the big bang is twofold .  the first item is the discovery that the universe is expanding .  the second is that  echoes  from the big bang can still be detected today .  the possibility that the universe might be getting bigger first appeared in mathematical solutions to equations formulated by albert einstein .  einstein viewed spacetime as being  curved  .  a body moving through curved spacetime deviates from its normal straight line path  much as a marble rolling on a curved surface does .  this deviation can be interpreted as a  force      something that pulls the body away from that ideal straight line .  actually there is no pull  just a bend in spacetime  causing a bend in the body s path .  but it looks as if there s a pull .  indeed this apparent pull is what newton called  gravity   back in the days when people thought it really did pull bodies together .  anyway  einstein wrote down some equations for how such a bendy universe ought to behave .  they were very difficult equations to solve  but after making some extremely strong assumptions     basically that at any instant of time space is a sphere     mathematical physicists worked out few answers .  and this tiny  very special list of solutions  the only ones their feeble methods could find  told them three things that the universe could do .  it could stay the same size forever  it could collapse down to a single point  or it could start from a single point and grow in size without limit .   we now know that there are many other solutions to einstein s equations  leading to all sorts of bizarre behaviour  but back in the days when today s paradigm was being set  these solutions were the only ones anybody knew .  so they assumed that the universe must behave according to one or other of those three solutions .  science was subliminally prepared either for continuous creation  the universe is always the same  or for the big bang .  the big crunch  in which the universe shrinks to an infinitely dense  infinitely hot point  lacked psychological appeal .   enter edwin hubble  an american astronomer .  hubble was observing distant stars  and he made a curious discovery .  the further away the stars were  the faster they were moving .  he knew this for distinctly indirect     but scientifically impeccable     reasons .  stars emit light  and light has many different colours  including  colours  that the human eye is unable to see  colours like infra red  ultra violet  radio  x ray  .  .  .  light is an electromagnetic wave  and there is one  colour  for each possible wavelength of light     the distance from one electromagnetic peak to the next .  for red light  this distance is   .   hundred thousandths of an inch    .   millionths of a metre  .   hubble noticed that something funny was happening to the light emitted by stars  the colours were shifting in the red direction .  the further away a star was  the bigger the shift .  he interpreted this  red shift  as a sign that the stars are moving away from us  because there is a similar shift for sound  known as the  doppler effect   and it s caused by the source of the sound moving .  so the further away the stars are  the faster they re travelling .  this means that the stars aren t just moving away from us     they re moving away from each other  like a flock of birds dispersing in all directions .   the universe  said hubble  is expanding .   not expanding into anything  of course .  it s just that the space inside the universe is growing .   that made the physicists  ears prick up  because it fitted exactly one of their three scenarios for changes in the size of the universe  stay the same  grow  collapse .  they  knew  it had to be one of the three  but which .  now they knew that  too .  if we accept that the universe is growing we can work out where it came from by running time backwards  and this time reversed universe collapses back to a single point .  putting time the right way round again  it must all have grown from a single point     the big bang .  by estimating the rate of expansion of the universe we can work out that the big bang happened about    billion years ago .   there is further evidence in the big bang s favour  it left  echoes  .  the big bang produces vast amounts of radiation  which spreads through the universe .  because the universe is spherical  the radiation eventually comes back on itself like a round the world traveller .  over billions of years  the remnants of the big bang s radiation smeared out into the  cosmic background   a kind of low level simmering of radiant energy across the sky  the light analogue of a reverberating echo of sound .  it is as if god shouted  hello .   at the instant of creation and we can still hear a faint  elloelloelloelloello  .  .  .   from the distant mountains .  on discworld this is exactly the case  and the listening monks in their remote temples spend their whole lives straining to pick out from the sounds of the universe the faint echoes of the words that set it in motion .   according to the details of the big bang  the cosmic background radiation should have a  temperature   the analogue of loudness  of about     kelvin      kelvin is the coldest anything can get  equivalent to about        celsius  .  astronomers can measure the temperature of the cosmic background radiation  and they do indeed get     kelvin .  the big bang isn t just a wild speculation .  not so long ago  most scientists didn t want to believe it  and they only changed their minds because of hubble s evidence for the expansion of the universe  and that impressively accurate figure of     kelvin for the temperature of the cosmic background radiation .   it was  indeed  a very loud  and hot  bang .     we are ambivalent  then  about beginnings     their  creation myth  aspect appeals to our sense of narrative imperative  but we sometimes find the  first it wasn t  then it was  lie to children unpalatable .  we have even more trouble with becomings .  our minds attach labels to things in the surrounding world  and we interpret those labels as discontinuities .  if things have different labels  then we expect there to be a clear line of demarcation between them .  the universe  however  runs on processes rather than things  and a process starts as one thing and becomes another without ever crossing a clear boundary .  worse  if there is some apparent boundary  we are likely to point to it and shout  that s it .   just because we can t see anything else worth getting agitated about .   how many times have you been in a discussion in which somebody says  we have to decide where to draw the line  .  for instance  most people seem to accept that in general terms women should be permitted abortions during the earliest stages of pregnancy but not during the very late stages .   where you draw the line   though  is hotly debated  and of course some people wish to draw it at one extreme or the other .  there are similar debates about exactly when a developing embryo becomes a person  with legal and moral rights .  is it at conception .  when the brain first forms .  at birth .  or was it always a potential person  even when it  existed  as one egg and one sperm .   the  draw a line  philosophy offers a substantial political advantage to people with hidden agendas .  the method for getting what you want is first to draw the line somewhere that nobody would object to  and then gradually move it to where you really want it  arguing continuity all the way .  for example  having agreed that killing a child is murder  the line labelled  murder  is then slid back to the instant of conception  having agreed that people should be allowed to read whichever newspaper they like  you end up supporting the right to put the recipe for nerve gas on the internet .   if we were less obsessed with labels and discontinuity  it would be much easier to recognize that the problem here is not where to draw the line  it is that the image of drawing a line is inappropriate .  there is no sharp line  only shades of grey that merge unnoticed into one another  despite which  one end is manifestly white and the other is equally clearly black .  an embryo is not a person  but as it develops it gradually becomes one .  there is no magic moment at which it switches from non person to person     instead  it merges continuously from one into the other .  unfortunately our legal system operates in rigid black and white terms     legal or illegal  no shades of grey     and this causes a mismatch  reinforced by our use of words as labels .  a kind of triage might be better  this end of the spectrum is legal  that end of the spectrum is illegal  and in between is a grey area which we do our best to avoid if we possibly can .  if we can t avoid it  we can at least adjust the degree of criminality and the appropriate penalty according to whereabouts in the spectrum the activity seems to lie .   even such obviously black and white distinctions as alive dead or male female turn out  on close examination  to be more like a continuous merging than a sharp discontinuity .  pork sausages from the butcher s contain many live pig cells .  with today s techniques you might even clone an adult pig from one .  a person s brain can have ceased to function but their body  with medical assistance  can keep going .  there are at least a dozen different combinations of sex chromosomes in humans  of which only xx represents the traditional female and xy the traditional male .   although the big bang is a scientific story about a beginning  it also raises important questions about becomings .  the big bang theory is a beautiful bit of science     very nearly consistent with the picture we now have of the atomic and the subatomic world  with its diverse kinds of atom  their protons and neutrons  their clouds of electrons  and the more exotic particles that we see when cosmic rays hit our atmosphere or when we insult the more familiar particles by slamming them together very hard .   physicists have now found  or perhaps invented  the allegedly  ultimate  constituents of these familiar particles  more exotic things known as quarks  gluons  .  .  .  at least the names are becoming familiar  .   the holy grail of particle physics has been to find the  higgs boson   which     if it exists     explains why the other particles have mass .  in the     s peter higgs suggested that space is filled with a kind of quantum treacle called the higgs field .  he suggested that this field would exert a force on particle through the medium of the higgs boson  and that force would be observed as mass .  for    years  physicists have constructed ever larger and more energetic particle accelerators in the search for this elusive particle  such as the new large hadron collider  due to start up in      .   late in       scientists analysing data from its predecessor  the large electron positron collider  lep   announced that the higgs boson probably doesn   t exist .  if it does  then it has to be even more massive than everyone expected  and the lep scientists are sceptical .  no good substitute for higgs    theory exists  not even the fashionable concept of  supersymmetry  which pairs every known particle with a more massive partner .  supersymmetry predicts several higgs particles  which masses well inside the range where the lep data prove no such thing exists .  some physicists still hope that the higgs boson will show up when the new accelerator comes on line     but if it doesn   t particle physics will have to rethink the entire basis of their subject .   whatever happens to the higgs boson  they   re already starting to wonder whether that are more layers of reality further down  particles more  ultimate  still .   turtles all the way down .   does physics go all the way down  or does it stop at some level .  if it stops  is that the ultimate secret  or just a point beyond which the physicists  way of thinking fails .   the conceptual problem here is difficult because the universe is a becoming     a process     and we want to think of it as a thing .  we don t only find it puzzling that the universe was so different back then  that particles behaved differently  that the universe then became the universe now  and will perhaps eventually cease expanding and collapse back to a point in a big crunch .  we are familiar with babies becoming children becoming adults  but these processes always surprise us     we like things to keep the same character  so  becoming  is difficult for our minds to handle .     there is another element of the first moments of our universe that is even more difficult to think about .  where did the laws come from .  why are there such things as protons and electrons  quarks and gluons .  we usually separate processes into two conceptually distinct causal chunks  the initial conditions  and the rules by which they are transformed as time passes .  for the solar system  for instance  the initial conditions are the positions and speeds of the planets at some chosen instant of time  the rules are the laws of gravitation and motion  which tell us how those positions and speeds will change thereafter .  but for the beginning of the universe  the initial conditions seem not to be there at all .  even there isn t there .  so it seems that it s all done by rules .  where did the rules come from .  did they have to be invented .  or were they just sitting in some unimaginable timeless pseudo existence  waiting to be called up .  or did they uncurl in the early moments of the universe  as something appeared     so that the universe invented its own rules along with space and time .   two recent books by top ranking scientists explore how rules could be  invented  .  the most recent is stuart kauffman s      investigations .  this is mainly aimed at biology and economics  but it begins with rules of physics .  in a new answer to the old question  what is life .    kauffman defines a lifeform to be an  autonomous agent      any entity or system that can redirect energy and reproduce .   autonomous  here means that such a system makes up its own rules  determines its own behaviour .  such lifeforms need not be at all conventional .  for example  the quantum mechanical vacuum is a seething mass of particles and antiparticles  being created and annihilated in amazingly complicated ways .  a vacuum has more than enough complexity to organise itself into an autonomous agent .  if it did  then quantum mechanics would be able to make up its own rules .   the other noteworthy book on this topic is lee smolin s      the life of the cosmos  which asks  can universes evolve .  a remarkable feature of our universe is the presence of black holes .  these are regions of space time that contain so much mass that light  and matter  cannot get out  they are formed by the collapse of massive stars .  it used to be thought that black holes are rare  but now they seem to be showing up all over the place  in particular at the cores of most galaxies .  theoretical work shows that the constants of our universe are unusually good for making black holes .   why .  smolin argues that each black hole in our universe is in effect a doorway to an adjacent universe  but because nothing can come out of a black hole we cannot know what is on the far side of that door .  in particular  the adjacent universe might have different fundamental constants compared to ours .  so universes could  breed  by budding off baby universes through black holes  and natural selection would favour those that had the most offspring     whose constants would automatically be unusually good for making black holes .  so maybe we live in one of those babies .   there are some difficulties with this theory .  in particular  how would selection work .  how can universes compete .  but it s an interesting  if rather wild  idea .  and it offers a concrete proposal about how a universe can  make up  its laws  some  at least  could be imposed upon it at birth .   the big bang  then  may have done more than just bringing space and time into being .  it may also have brought  the  rules of physics     the ones that now apply to our world     into being .  during the becoming of its first moments  our universe kept changing its state  changing the rules it accessed .  in this respect it was rather like a flame  which changes its composition according to its own dynamics and the things that it is burning .  flames are all more or less the same shape  but they don t inherit that shape from a  parent  .  when you set light to a piece of paper  the flame builds itself from scratch using the rules of the outside universe .   in the opening instants of the universe  it wasn t just substances  temperatures and sizes that changed .  the rules by which they changed also changed .  we don t like to think this way  we want immutable laws  the same always .  so we look for  deeper  laws to govern how the rules changed .  possibly the universe is  really  governed by these deeper laws .  but perhaps it just makes up its own rules as it goes along .       not while these are still in the polar bear .       this figure replaces the previously favoured value of about    billion years .  recently lots of scientists collectively decided it should be    billion instead .   for a while some stars seemed to be older than the universe  but the age of those stars has been downsized .   in other circumstances they might well have settled for    billion .  if this worries you  substitute the term  a very long time  .       indeed  impeccable discworld thinking is that no matter how big the universe grows  it   s always the same size .       seven   beyond the fifth element    in the quiet of the night  hex computed .  along its myriad glass tubes  the ants scurried .  crude magic sparkled along cobwebs of fine bronze wire  changing colour as it changed logic states .   in the special room next door the beehives  long term storage  buzzed .  the thing that went  parp  did so occasionally .  huge wheels turned  stopped  turned back .  and still it wasn t enough .   the light of the project fell across hex s keyboard .  things were happening in there  and hex did not understand them .  and that was taxing  because there was something there to understand .   hex was largely self designed  which was why it worked better than most things in the university .  it generally tried to develop a responsive way of coming to grips with any new task  the bees had been a particularly good idea  because although the memory retrieval was slow  the total memory increased with time and good apiary practice .   now it reasoned thus   one day it would find a way of increasing its conceptual capacity to understand what was happening in the project   if this could ever happen  then     according to stryme s directionless law     there was already a shape in happening space  where time did not exist  caused by the fact of that happening  all that was required was a virtual collapse of the wave form    .  .  .  and  although this was in a very strict sense garbage  it was not complete garbage .  any answer that would exist somewhere in the future must  inevitably  be available in potentia now .   the ants went faster .  magic flashed .  hex could be said to be concentrating .   then silvery  shimmering lines appeared in the air around it  outlining towers of unimaginable cogitation .   ah .  that was acceptable .   once and future computing was now in operation .  of course  it always had been .   hex wondered how much he should tell the wizards .  he felt it would not be a good idea to burden them with too much input .   hex always thought of his reports as lies to people .     it was the second day  .  .  .   the project was nudged gently under a glass dome to prevent any more interference .  a variety of spells had been installed around it .    so that s a universe  is it .   said the archchancellor .    yes  sir .  hex says that  .  .  .   ponder hesitated .  you had to think hard before trying to explain things to mustrum ridcully .   .  .  .  hex seems to suggest that complete and utter nothing is automatically a universe waiting to happen .     you mean nothing becomes everything .     why  yes  sir .  er  .  .  .  in a way  it has to  sir .     and the dean here swirled it all around and that started it off .     it could have been anything at all  sir .  even a stray thought .  absolute nothing is very unstable .  it s so desperate to be something .      i thought you had to have creators and gods   mumbled the senior wrangler .    i should jolly well think so   said ridcully  who was examining the project with a thaumic omniscope .   it s been here since last night and there s nothing to be seen except elements  if you could call them that .  bloody stupid elements  too .  half of them fall to bits as soon as you look at them .     well  what do you expect .   said the lecturer in recent runes .   they re made out of nothing  right .  even a really bad creator would at least have started with earth  air  fire  water and surprise .     proper worlds are out of the question here  too   said ridcully  peering into the omniscope again .   there s no sign of chelonium and elephantigen .  what kind of worlds can you build without them .    ridcully turned to ponder .    not much of a universe  then   he said .   it must have gone wrong  mister stibbons .  it s a dud .  by now the first human should be looking for his trousers .     perhaps we could give him a hand   said the senior wrangler .    what are you suggesting .     well  it s our universe  isn t it .    ponder was shocked .   we can t own a universe  senior wrangler .     it s a very small one .     only on the outside  sir .  hex says it s a lot bigger on the inside .     and the dean stirred it up   the senior wrangler went on .    that s right .   said the dean .   that means i m a sort of god .     waggling your fingers around and saying  oo  it prickles  is not godliness   said ridcully severely .    well  i m the next best thing   said the dean  reluctant to let go of anything that placed him socially higher than the archchancellor .    my grandmother always said that cleanliness was next to godliness   mused the lecturer in recent runes .    ah  that s more like it   said ridcully cheerfully .   you re more like a janitor  dean .     i was really just suggesting that we give the thing a few shoves in the right direction   said the senior wrangler .   we are  after all  learned men .  and we know what a proper universe ought to be like  don t we .     i imagine we have a better idea than the average god with a dog s head and nineteen arms  certainly   said ridcully .   but this is pretty second rate material .  it just wants to spin all the time .  what do you expect us to do  bang on the side and shout  come on  you lot  stop messing about with stupid gases  they ll never amount to anything  .    they compromised  and selected a small area for experimentation .  they were  after all  wizards .  that meant that if they saw something  they prodded it .  if it wobbled  they prodded it some more .  if you built a guillotine  and then put a sign on it saying  do not put your neck on this block   many wizards would never have to buy a hat again .   moving the matter was simple .  as ponder said  it almost moved under the pressure of thought .   and spinning it into a disc was easy .  the new matter liked to spin .  but it was also far too sociable .    you see .   said ridcully  around mid morning .   it seems to get the idea  and then you just end up with a ball of rubbish .     which gets hot in the middle  have you noticed .   said ponder .    embarrassment  probably   said the archchancellor .   we ve lost half the elements since elevenses .  there s no more cohenium  explodium went ten minutes ago  and i m beginning to suspect that the detonium is falling to bits .  temporarium didn t last for any time at all .     any runium .   said the lecturer in recent runes .   hex wrote      runium may or may not still exist .  it was down to one atom ten minutes ago  which i do not seem to be able to find any more       how s wranglium doing .   said the senior wrangler hopefully .    exploded after breakfast  according to hex .  sorry   said ridcully .   you can t build a world out of smoke and mirrors .  damn  .  .  .  there goes bursarium  too .  i mean  i know iron rusts  but these elements collapse for a pastime .     my hypothesis  for what it s worth   said the lecturer in recent runes   is that since it was all started off by the dean  a certain dean like tendency may have imparted itself to the ensuing  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  developments .     what .  you mean we ve got a huge windy universe with a tendency to sulk .     thank you  archchancellor   said the dean .    i was referring to the predilection of matter to  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  accrete into  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  spherical shapes .     like the dean  you mean   said archchancellor .    i can see i m among friends here   said the dean .   there was a soft chime from the apparatus that had been accumulated around the project .    that ll be etherium vanishing   said ridcully gloomily .   i knew that d be the next to go .     actually  .  .  .  no   said ponder stibbons  peering into the project .   er  .  .  .  something has caught fire .    points of light were appearing .    i knew something like that would happen   said the archchancellor .   all those discs are heating up  just like damn compost heaps .     or suns   said ponder .    don t be silly  stibbons  they re far too large for that .  i d hate to see one of those floating over the clouds   said the lecturer in recent runes .    i said there was far too much gas   the archchancellor went on .   that wraps it up  then .     i wonder   said the senior wrangler .    what .   said the dean .    well  at least we ve got some heat in there  .  .  .  and there nothing like a good furnace for improving matters .     good point   said ridcully .   look at bronze     you can make that out of just about anything .  and we could burn off some of the rubbish .  all right  you fellows  help me dump more of the stuff in it .  .  .    around about teatime  the first of the furnaces exploded  just as happened every day down at the alchemists  guild .    ye gods   said ridcully  watching the shapes in the omniscope .    yo .   said the dean .    we ve made new elements .     keep it down  keep it down .   hissed the senior wrangler .    there s iron  .  .  .  silicon  .  .  .  we ve got rocks  even  .  .  .     we re going to be in serious trouble if the alchemists  guild finds out   said the lecturer in recent runes .   you know we re not supposed to do that stuff .     this is a different universe   said ridcully .  he sighed .   you have to blow things up to get anything useful .     i see politicium is still there in large quantities  then   said the senior wrangler .    i meant that this is a godless reality  gentlemen .     excuse me  the dean began .    i shouldn t look so smug if i was you  dean   said ridcully .   look at the place .  everything wants to spin  and sooner or later you have balls .     and we re getting the same sort of stuff that we get here  isn t that strange .   said the senior wrangler  as mrs whitlow the housekeeper came in with the tea trolley .    i don t see why   said the dean .   iron s iron .     well  it s a whole new universe  so you d expect new things  wouldn t you .  metals like noggo  perhaps  or plinc .     what s your point  senior wrangler .     i mean  take a look at the thing now  .  .  .  all those burning exploding balls do look a bit like the stars  don t they .  i mean they re vaguely familiar .  why isn t it a universe full of tapioca  say  or very large chairs .  i mean  if nothing wants to be something  why can t it be anything .      the wizards stirred their tea and thought about this .    because   said the archchancellor  after a while .    that s a good answer  sir   said ponder  as diplomatically as he could   but it does rather close the door on further questions .     best kind of answer there is  then .    the senior wrangler watched mrs whitlow produce a duster and polish the top of the project .     as above  so below    said ridcully  slowly .    pardon .   said the senior wrangler .    we re forgetting our kindergarten magic  aren t we .  it s not even magic  it s a  .  .  .  a basic rule of everything .  the project can t help being affected by this world .  piles of sand try to look like mountains .  men try to act like gods .  little things so often appear to look like big things made smaller .  our new universe  gentlemen  will do its crippled best to look like ours .  we should not be surprised to see things that look hauntingly familiar .  but not as good  obviously .      the inner eye of hex gazed at a vast cloud of mind .  hex couldn t think of a better word .  it didn t technically exist yet  but hex could sense the shape .  it had hints of many things  of tradition  of libraries  of rumour  .  .  .   there had to be a better word .  hex tried again .   on discworld  words had real power .  they had to be dealt with carefully .   what lay ahead had the shape of intelligence  but only in the same way that a sun had the shape of something living out its brief life in a puddle of ditchwater .   ah  .  .  .  extelligence would do for now .   hex decided to devote part of its time to investigating this interesting thing .  it wanted to find out how it had developed  what kept it going  .  .  .  and why  particularly  a small but annoying part of it seemed to believe that if everyone sent five dollars to the six names at the top of the list  everyone would become immensely rich .       of which there were quite a number  given hex   s unusual construction .  in addition to and  or and their combinations and variants  hex could call up maybe  perhaps  suppose and why .  hex could think the unthinkable quite easily .       eight   we are stardust   or at least we went to woodstock      iron s iron .   but is it .  or is iron made from other things .   according to empedocles  an ancient greek  everything in the universe was a combination of four ingredients  earth  air  fire  and water .  set light to a stick and it burns  showing that it contains fire   gives off smoke  showing that it contains air   exudes bubbly liquids  showing that it contains water   and leaves a dirty heap of ash behind  showing that it contains earth  .  as a theory  it was a bit too simple minded to survive for long     a couple of thousand years at best .  things moved more slowly in those days  and europe  at least  was more interested in making sure that the peasants didn t get above their station and copying out bits of the bible by hand in as laborious and colourful a manner as possible .   the main technological invention to come out of the middle ages was a better horse collar .   empedocles s theory was a distinct advance on its predecessors .  thales  heraclitus  and anaximenes all agreed that everything was made from just one basic  principle   or element     but they disagreed completely about what it was .  thales reckoned it was water  heraclitus preferred fire  and anaximenes was willing to bet the farm on air .  empedocles was a wishy washy synthesist who thought everyone had a valid point of view  if alive today he would definitely wear a bad tie .   the one good idea that emerged from all this was that  elementary  constituents of matter should be characterized by having simple  reliable properties .  earth was dirty  air was invisible  fire burned  and water was wet .   aside from the superior horse collar  the medieval period did act as a breeding ground for what eventually turned into chemistry .  for centuries the nascent science known as alchemy had flourished  people had discovered that some strange things happen when you mix substances together and heat them  or pour acid over them  or dissolve them in water and wait .  you could get funny smells  bangs  bubbles  and liquids that changed colour .  whatever the universe was made of  you could clearly convert some of it into something else if you knew the right trick .  maybe a better word is  spell   for alchemy was akin to magic     lots of special recipes and rituals  many of which actually worked  but no theory about how it all fitted together .  the big goals of alchemy were spells     recipes     for things like the elixir of life  which would make you live forever  and how to turn lead into gold  which would give you lots of money to finance your immortal lifestyle .  towards the end of the middle ages  alchemists had been messing about for so long that they got quite good at it  and they started to notice things that didn t fit the greeks  theory of four elements .  so they introduced extra ones  like salt and sulphur  because these substances also had simple  reliable properties  different from being dirty  invisible  burning  or wet .  sulphur  for example  was combustible  though not actually hot  you understand  and salt was incombustible .   by      robert boyle had sorted out two important distinctions  putting them into his book the sceptical chymist .  the first distinction was between a chemical compound and a mixture .  a mixture is just different things  well  mixed up .  a compound is all the same stuff  but whatever that stuff is  it can be persuaded to come apart into components that are other kinds of stuff     provided you heat it  pour acid on it  or find some other effective treatment .  what you can t do is sort through it and find a different bit  for a mixture you can  although you might need very good eyesight and tiny fingers .  the second distinction was between compounds and elements .  an element really is one kind of stuff  you can t separate it into different components .   sulphur is an element .  salt  we now know  is a compound made by combining  not just mixing  the two elements sodium  a soft  inflammable metal  and chlorine  a toxic gas  .  water is a compound  made from hydrogen and oxygen  both gases  .  air is a mixture  containing various gases such as oxygen  an element   nitrogen  also an element   and carbon dioxide  a combination of carbon and oxygen  .  earth is a very complicated mixture and the mix varies from place to place .  fire isn t a substance at all  but a process involving hot gases .   it took a while to sort all this out  but by      antoine lavoisier had come up with a list of    elements that were a reasonable selection of the ones we use today .  he made a few understandable mistakes  and he included both light and heat as elements  but his approach was systematic and careful .  today we know of     distinct elements .  a few of these are artificially produced  and several of those have existed on earth only for the tiniest fraction of a second  but most elements on the list can be dug up  extracted from the sea or separated from the air around us .  and apart from a few more artificially produced elements that it might just be possible to make in future  today s list is almost certainly complete .   it took another while for us to get that far .  the art of alchemy slowly gave way to the science of chemistry .  gradually the list of accepted elements grew  occasionally it shrunk when people realized that a previously supposed element was actually a compound  such as lavoisier s lime  now known to be made from the elements calcium and oxygen .  the one thing that didn t change was the only thing the greeks had got right  each element was a unique individual with its own characteristic properties .  density  whether it was solid  liquid  or gas at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure  melting point if it was solid     for each element  these quantities had definite  unvarying values .  it is the same on discworld  with its to our eyes bizarre elements such as chelonium  for making world bearing turtles   elephantigen  ditto elephants   and narrativium     a hugely important  element  not just for discworld  but for understanding our own world too .  the characteristic feature of narrativium is that it makes stories hang together .  the human mind loves a good dose of narrativium .   in this universe  we began to understand why elements were unique individuals  and what distinguished them from compounds .  again the glimmerings of the right idea go back to the greeks  with democritus  suggestion that all matter is made from tiny indivisible particles  which he called atoms  greek for  not divisible   .  it is unclear whether anybody  even democritus  actually believed this in greek times  it may just have been a clever debating point .  boyle revived the idea  suggesting that each element corresponds to a single kind of atom  whereas compounds are combinations of different kinds of atoms .  so the element oxygen is made from oxygen atoms and nothing else  the element hydrogen is made from hydrogen atoms and nothing else  but the compound water is not made from water atoms and nothing else  it is made from atoms of hydrogen and atoms of oxygen .     by       one of the most significant steps in the development of both chemistry and physics had taken place .  the englishman john dalton had found a way to bring a degree of order to the different atoms that made up the elements  and to transfer some of that order to compounds too .  his predecessors had noticed that when elements combine together to form compounds  they do so in simple and characteristic proportions .  so much oxygen plus so much hydrogen makes so much water  and the proportions by weight of oxygen and hydrogen are always the same .  moreover  those proportions all fit together nicely if you look at other compounds involving hydrogen and other compounds involving oxygen .   dalton realized that all this would make perfect sense if each atom of hydrogen had a fixed weight  each atom of oxygen had a fixed weight  and the weight of an oxygen atom was    times that of hydrogen .  the evidence for this theory had to be indirect  because an atom is far too tiny for anyone to be able to weigh one  but it was extensive and compelling .  and so the theory of  atomic weight  arrived on the scene  and it let chemists list the elements in order of atomic weight .   that list begins like this  modern values for atomic weights in brackets   hydrogen    .         helium    .         lithium    .       beryllium    .         boron     .      carbon     .       nitrogen     .        oxygen     .        fluorine     .          neon     .       sodium     .        .  a striking feature is that the atomic weight is nearly always close to a whole number  the first exception being chlorine at    .     .  all a bit puzzling  but it was an excellent start because now people could look for other patterns and relate them to atomic weights .  however  looking for patterns proved easier than finding any .  the list of elements was unstructured  almost random in its properties .  mercury  the only element known to be liquid at room temperature  was a metal .   later just one further liquid was added to the list  bromine .   there were lots of other metals like iron  copper  silver  gold  zinc  tin  each a solid and each quite different from the others  sulphur and carbon were solid but not metallic  quite a few elements were gases .  so unstructured did the list of elements seem that when a few mavericks     johann dobereiner  alexandre emile beguyrer de chancourtois  john newlands     suggested there might be some kind of order dimly visible amid the muddle and mess  they were howled down .   credit for coming up with a scheme that was basically right goes to dimitri mendeleev  who finished the first of a lengthy series of  periodic charts  in      .  his chart included    known elements placed in order of atomic weight .  it left gaps where undiscovered elements allegedly remained to be inserted .  it was  periodic  in the sense that the properties of the elements started to repeat after a certain number of steps  the commonest being eight .   according to mendeleev  the elements fall into families  whose members are separated by the aforementioned periods  and in each family there are systematic resemblances of physical and chemical properties .  indeed those properties vary so systematically as you run through the family that you can see clear  though not always exact  numerical patterns and progressions .  the scheme works best  however  if you assume that a few elements are missing from the known list  hence the gaps .  as a bonus  you can make use of those family resemblances to predict the properties of those missing elements before anybody finds them .  if those predictions turn out to be correct when the missing elements are found  bingo .  mendeleev s scheme still gets modified slightly from time to time  but its main features survive  today we call it the periodic table of the elements .   we now know that there is a good reason for the periodic structure that mendeleev uncovered .  it stems from the fact that atoms are not as indivisible as democritus and boyle thought .  true  they can t be divided chemically     you can t separate an atom into component pieces by doing chemistry in a test tube     but you can  split the atom  with apparatus that is based on physics rather than chemistry .  the  nuclear reactions  involved require much higher energy levels     per atom     than you need for chemical reactions  which is why the old time alchemists never managed to turn lead into gold .  today  this could be done     but the cost of equipment would be enormous  and the amount of gold produced would be extremely small  so the scientists would be very much like discworld s own alchemists  who have only found ways of turning gold into less gold .   thanks to the efforts of the physicists  we now know that atoms are made from other  smaller particles .  for a while it was thought that there were just three such particles  the neutron  the proton  and the electron .  the neutron and proton have almost equal masses  while the electron is tiny in comparison  the neutron has no electrical charge  the proton has a positive charge  and the electron has a negative charge exactly opposite to that of the proton .  atoms have no overall charge  so the numbers of protons and electrons are equal .  there is no such restriction on the number of neutrons .  to a good approximation  you get an element s atomic weight by adding up the numbers of protons and neutrons     for example oxygen has eight of each  and             the atomic weight .   atoms are incredibly small by human standards     about a hundred millionth of an inch      millionths of a centimetre  across for an atom of lead .  their constituent particles  however  are considerably smaller .  by bouncing atoms off each other  physicists found that they behave as if the protons and neutrons occupy a tiny region in the middle     the nucleus     but the electrons are spread outside the nucleus over what  comparatively speaking  is a far bigger region .  for a while  the atom was pictured as being rather like a tiny solar system  with the nucleus playing the role of the sun and the electrons orbiting it like planets .  however  this model didn t work very well     for example  an electron is a moving charge  and according to classical physics a moving charge emits radiation  so the model predicted that within a split second every electron in an atom would radiate away all of its energy and spiral into the nucleus .  with the kind of physics that developed from isaac newton s epic discoveries  atoms built like solar systems just don t work .  nevertheless  this is the public myth  the lie to children that automatically springs to mind .  it is endowed with so much narrativium that we can t eradicate it .   after a lot of argument  the physicists who worked with matter on very small scales decided to hang on to the solar system model and throw away newtonian physics  replacing it with quantum theory .  ironically  the solar system model of the atom still didn t work terribly well  but it survived for long enough to help get quantum theory off the ground .  according to quantum theory the protons  neutrons  and electrons that make an atom don t have precise locations at all     they re kind of smeared out .  but you can say how much they are smeared out  and the protons and neutrons are smeared out over a tiny region near the middle of the atom  whereas the electrons are smeared out all over it .   whatever the physical model  everyone agreed all along that the chemical properties of an atom depend mainly on its electrons  because the electrons are on the outside  so atoms can stick together by sharing electrons .  when they stick together they form molecules  and that s chemistry .  since an atom is electrically neutral overall  the number of electrons must equal the number of protons  and it is this  atomic number   not the atomic weight  that organizes the periodicities found by mendeleev however  the atomic weight is usually about twice the atomic number  because the number of neutrons in an atom is pretty close to the number of protons for quantum reasons  so you get much the same ordering whichever quantity you use .  nevertheless  it is the atomic number that makes more sense of the chemistry and explains the periodicity .  it turns out that period eight is indeed important  because the electrons live in a series of  shells   like russian dolls  one inside the other  and until you get some way up the list of elements a complete shell contains eight electrons .   further along  the shells get bigger  so the period gets bigger too .  at least  that s what joseph  j .  j .   thompson said in      .  the modern theory is quantum and more complicated  with far more than three  fundamental  particles  and the calculations are much harder  but they have much the same implications .  like most science  an initially simple story became more complicated as it was developed and headed rapidly towards the magical event horizon for most people .   but even the simplified story explains a lot of otherwise baffling things .  for instance  if the atomic weight is the number of protons plus neutrons  how come atomic weight isn t always a whole number .  what about chlorine  for instance  with atomic weight    .     .  it turns out there are two different kinds of chlorine .  one kind has    protons and    neutrons  and    electrons  naturally  the same as protons   with atomic weight    .  the other kind has    protons and    neutrons  and    electrons  again      an extra two neutrons  which raises the atomic weight to    .  naturally occurring chlorine is a mixture of these two  isotopes   as they are called  in roughly the proportions   to   .  the two isotopes are  almost  indistinguishable chemically  because they have the same number and arrangement of electrons  and that s what makes chemistry work  but they have different atomic physics .   it is easy for a non physicist to see why the wizards of uu considered this universe to be made in too much of a hurry out of obviously inferior components  .  .  .     where did all those     elements come from .  were they always around  or did they get put together as the universe developed .   in our universe  there seem to be five different ways to make elements     start up a universe with a big bang  obtaining a highly energetic   hot   sea of fundamental particles .  wait for it to cool  or possibly use one you made earlier  .  .  .   .  along with ordinary matter  you ll probably get a lot of exotic objects like tiny black holes  and magnetic monopoles but these will disappear pretty quickly and only conventional matter will remain     mostly .  in a very hot universe  electromagnetic forces are too weak to resist disruption  but once the universe is cool enough  fundamental particles can stick together as a result of electromagnetic attraction .  the only element that arises directly in this manner is hydrogen     one electron joined with one proton .  however  you get an awful lot of it  in our universe it is by far the commonest element  and nearly all of it arose from the big bang .   protons and electrons can also associate to form deuterium  one electron  one proton  one neutron  or tritium  one electron  one proton  two neutrons   but tritium is radioactive  meaning that it spits out neutrons and decays into hydrogen again .  a far more stable product is helium  two electrons  two protons  two neutrons   and helium is the second most abundant element in the universe .     let gravity get in on the act .  now hydrogen and helium collect together to form stars     the wizards   furnaces  .  at the centre of stars  the pressure is extremely high .  this brings new nuclear reactions into play  and you get nuclear fusion  in which atoms become so squashed together that they merge into a new  bigger atom .  in this manner  many other familiar elements were formed  from carbon  nitrogen  oxygen  to the less familiar lithium  beryllium and so on up to iron .  many of these elements occur in living creatures  the most important being carbon .  for reasons to do with its unique electron structure  carbon is the only atom that can combine with itself to form huge  complex molecules  without which our kind of life would be impossible .   anyway  the point is that most of the atoms from which you are made must have come into being inside a star .  as joni mitchell sang at woodstock    we are stardust .     scientists like quoting this line  because it sounds as though they were young once .     wait for some of the stars to explode .  there are  comparatively  small explosions called novas  meaning  new  star    and more violent ones     supernovas .   what s  new  is that usually we can t see the star until it explodes  and then we can .   it s not just that the nuclear fuel gets used up  the hydrogen and helium that fuel the star fuse into heavier elements  which in effect become impurities that disturb the nuclear reaction .  pollution is a problem even at the heart of a star .  the physics of these early suns changes  and some of the larger ones explode  generating higher elements like iodine  thorium  lead  uranium  and radium .  these stars are called  population ii  by astrophysicists     they are old stars  low in heavy elements  but not lacking them entirely .     there are two kinds of supernova  and the other type creates heavy elements in abundance  leading to  population i  stars  which are much younger than population ii .   because many of these elements have unstable atoms  various other elements are made by their radioactive decay .  these  secondhand  elements include lead .     lastly  human beings have made some elements by special arrangements in atomic reactors     the best known being plutonium  a by product of conventional uranium reactors and a raw material for nuclear weapons .  some rather exotic ones  with very short lifetimes  have been made in experimental atombashers  so far we ve got to element      with     still missing .  element     may also have been made  but a claim of element     from the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in      has been withdrawn .  physicists always fight over who got what first and who therefore has the right to propose a name  so at any given time the heaviest elements are likely to have been assigned temporary  and ludicrous  names such as  ununnilium  for element         dog latin for        ium  .   what s the point of making extremely short lived elements like these .  you can t use them for anything .  well  like mountains  they are there  moreover  it always helps to test your theories on extreme cases .  but the best reason is that they may be steps towards something rather more interesting  assuming that it actually exists .  generally speaking  once you get past polonium at atomic number    everything is radioactive     it spits out particles of its own accord and  decays  into something else     and the greater an element s atomic number  the more rapidly it decays .  however  this tendency may not continue indefinitely .  we can t model heavy atoms exactly     in fact we can t even model light atoms exactly  but the heavier they are the worse it gets .   various empirical models  intelligent approximations based on intuition  guesswork  and fiddling adjustable constants  have led to a surprisingly accurate formula for how stable an element should be when it has a given number of protons and a given number of neutrons .  for certain  magic numbers      roundworld terminology that suggests the physicists concerned have imbibed some of the spirit of discworld and realized that the formula is closer to a spell than a theory     the corresponding atoms are unusually stable .  the magic numbers for protons are                  and      those for neutrons are                            and     .  for example the most stable element of all is lead  with    protons and     neutrons .   only two steps beyond the incredibly unstable element     lies element      tentatively named eka lead .  with     protons and     neutrons it is doubly magic and is therefore likely to be a lot more stable than most elements in its vicinity .  the uncertainty arises from worries about the approximations in the stability formula  which may not work for such large numbers .  every wizard is aware that spells can often go wrong .  assuming that the spell works  though  we can play mendeleev and predict the properties of eka lead by extrapolating from those in the  lead  series in the periodic table  carbon  silicon  germanium  tin  lead  .  as the name suggests  eka lead turns out to resemble lead     it s expected to be a metal with a melting point of     c and a boiling point of      c at atmospheric pressure .  its density should be     greater than that of lead .   in      the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna  russia  announced that it had created one atom of element      though this isotope had only     neutrons and so missed one of the magic numbers .  even so  its lifetime was about    seconds     astonishingly long for an element this heavy  and suggesting that the magic may be working .  soon after  the same group produced two atoms of element     with     neutrons .  element     was also created in a separate experiment in the usa .  until we can make  eka lead  in bulk  not just a few atoms at a time  its physical properties can   t be verified .  but its nuclear properties seem to be holding up well in comparison to theory .   even further out lies the doubly magic element      with     protons and     neutrons  and beyond that  the magic numbers may continue  .  .  .  it is always dangerous to extrapolate  but even if the formula is wrong  there could well be certain special configurations of protons and neutrons that are stable enough for the corresponding elements to hang around in the real universe .  perhaps this is where elephantigen and chelonium come from .  possibly noggo and plinc await our attention  somewhere .  maybe there are stable elements with vast atomic numbers     some might even be the size of a star .  consider  for instance  a neutron star  one made almost entirely of neutrons  which forms when a larger star collapses under its own gravitational attraction .  neutron stars are incredibly dense  about forty trillion pounds per square inch      billion kg cc      twenty million elephants in a nutshell .  they have a surface gravity seven billion times that of the earth  and a magnetic field a trillion times that of the earth .  the particles in a neutron star are so closely packed that in effect it is one big atom .   bizarre though they are  some of these superheavy elements may lurk in unusual corners of our universe .  in      it was suggested that elements         could sometimes be observed in cosmic rays     highly energetic particles coming from outer space     but these reports went unconfirmed .  it is thought that cosmic rays originate in neutron stars  so maybe in the astonishing conditions found there superheavy elements are formed .  what would happen if population i stars changed by accumulating superheavy stable elements .   because the stellar population numbers go iii  ii  i as time passes     a convention that astrophysicists may yet have cause to regret     we must name these hypothetical stars  population    .  at any rate  the future universe could easily contain stellar objects quite different from anything we know about today  and as well as novas and supernovas  we might witness even more energetic explosions     hypernovas .  there might even be further stages     population minus i and the like .  as we ve said  our universe often seems to make up its rules as it goes along  unlike the rational  stable universe of discworld .       silicon might also be able to do this  but nowhere near as readily  if you want other exotic lifeforms you have to start thinking in terms of organized vortices in the upper reaches of a sun  weird quantum assemblages in interstellar plasma  or completely implausible creatures based on non material concepts such as information  thought  or narrativium .  dna is a different matter entirely  you could surely base lifeforms on other carbon rich molecules .  we can do it now  in laboratories  with minor variants of dna .  see evolving the alien by jack cohen and ian stewart .       ask mummy or daddy  if you have no idea what we   re talking about .       there also ought to be  population iii  stars  older than population ii and consisting entirely of hydrogen and helium .  these would explain the occurrence of some heavy elements in population ii .  however  nobody has ever confirmed finding a population iii star  though a whole group of them may have been sighted in       in two tiny red patches in the galaxy cluster abell      .  these patches are highly magnified images of the same region of space  the two images  and the magnification  result from gravitational lensing  without which the stars would not have been visible at all .  a recent  competing theory removes the need for population iii stars altogether .  instead  very soon after the big bang there were heavy elements around  even before any stars formed .  so when the first stars condensed  they already were population ii .  this contradicts what we say in the main text     lies to children  of course .       nine   eat hot naphtha  evil dog .     the rocks fell gently together again  and to the annoyance of the archchancellor they moved in curved lines while doing so .    well  i think we ve proved that a giant turtle made of stone isn t going to work   said the senior wrangler  sighing .    for the tenth time   sighed the lecturer in recent runes .    i told you we d need chelonium   said archchancellor ridcully .   early attempts spun gently a little way away .  small balls  big balls  .  .  .  some of them even had a mantle of gases  pouring out of the clumsy aggregations of ice and rock .  it was as if the new universe had some basic idea of what it ought to be  but it couldn t quite manage to get a grip .   after all  the archchancellor pointed out  once people had something to stand on they d need something to breathe  wouldn t they .  atmospheres seemed to turn up on cue .  but they were dreadful things  full of stuff not even a troll would suck .   in the absence of gods  he declared     and a series of simple tests had found no trace of deitygen  it was up to men to get it right .   the high energy magic building was getting crowded now .  even the student wizards were taking an interest  and usually they weren t even seen during daylight .  the project promised to offer even greater attractions than staying up all night playing with hex and eating herring and banana pizza .   more desks had been moved in .  the project was in an expanding circle of instruments and devices  because it appeared that every wizard apart from  possibly  the professor of eldritch lacemaking  had decided he was working on something that would benefit immensely from access to the project .  there was certainly room .  while the project was indeed about a foot wide  the space inside seemed to be getting bigger by the second .  a universe offers lots of space  after all .   and while ignorant laymen objected to magical experiments that were by no means dangerous  there being less than one chance in five of making a serious breach in the fabric of reality  there was no one in there to object to anything .   there were  of course  accidents  .  .  .    will you two stop shouting .   yelled the senior wrangler .  two student wizards were arguing vehemently  or at least repeatedly stating their point of view in a loud voice  which suffices for argument most of the time .    i d spent ages putting together a small icy ball and he sent that wretched great rock smack into it  sir .     i wasn t trying to .   said the other student .  the senior wrangler stared at him  trying to remember his name .  as a general rule  he avoided getting to know the students  since he felt they were a tedious interruption to the proper running of college life .    what were you trying to do  then  .  .  .  boy .   he said .    er  .  .  .  i was trying to hit the big ball of gas  sir .  but it just sort of swung around it  sir .    the senior wrangler looked around .  the dean was not present .  then he looked into the project .    oh  i see .  that one .  quite pretty .  all those stripes .  who built that .    a student raised his hand .    ah  yes  .  .  .  you   said the senior wrangler .   good stripes .  well done .  what s it made of .     i just dragged a lot of ice together  sir .  but it got hot .     really .  ice gets hot in a ball .    in a big ball  sir .     have you told mister stibbons .  he likes to know that sort of thing .     yes  sir .    the senior wrangler turned to the other student .    and why were you throwing rocks at his big ball of gas .     er  .  .  .  because you score ten for hitting it  sir .    the senior wrangler looked owlishly at the students .  it all became clear .  he d wandered into the hem one night when he couldn t sleep and a mob of students had been hunched over the keyboards of hex and shouting things like  i ve got the battering ram .  hah  eat hot naphtha  evil dog .   doing that sort of thing in a whole new universe seemed  .  .  .  well  impolite .   on the other hand  the senior wrangler shared with some of his colleagues an unformed thought that pushing back the boundaries of knowledge was not quite  .  .  .  well  polite .  boundaries were there for a reason .    are you meaning to tell me   he said   that faced with the multitudinous possibilies of the infinity that is the project you are using it to play some sort of game .     er  .  .  .  yes  sir    oh .   the senior wrangler looked closely at the big ball of gas .  a number of small rocks were already spinning slowly around it .   well  then  .  .  .  can i have a go .        ten   the shape of things    when wizards find a new thing  they play with it .  so do scientists .  they play with ideas so wild that often they seem to defy common sense     and then they insist that those ideas are right  and common sense isn t .  they often make out a surprisingly good case .  einstein once said something nasty about common sense being akin to nonsense  but he went too far .  science and common sense are related  but indirectly .  science is something like a third cousin of common sense twice removed .  common sense tells us what the universe seems like to creatures of our particular size  habits  and disposition .  for instance  common sense tells us that the earth is flat .  it looks flat     leaving out the hills  valleys  and other bumps and dents  .  .  .  if it wasn t flat  things ought to roll around or fall off .  despite this  the earth isn t flat .  on discworld  in contrast  the relation between common sense and reality is usually very direct indeed .  common sense tells the wizards of unseen university that discworld is flat     and it is .  to prove it  they can go to the edge  as rincewind and twoflower do in the colour of magic  and watch stuff disappearing over it in rimfall   the roaring was louder now .  a squid bigger than anything ricewind had seen before broke the surface a few hundred yards away and thrashed madly with its tentacles before sinking away  .  .  .  they were running out of world .   then they can be trapped in the circumfence  a ten thousand mile long net set just below the edge  one tiny bit of which is patrolled by tethis the sea troll .  and they can peer over the edge    .  .  .  the scene beneath him flipped into a whole  new  terrifying perspective .  because down there was the head of an elephant as big as a reasonably sized continent .  .  .  below the elephant there was nothing but the distant  painful disc of the sun .  and  sweeping slowly past it  was something that for all its city sized scales  its crater pocks  its lunar cragginess  was indubitably a flipper .    it is widely imagined that ancient people thought the earth was flat  for all those obvious commonsense reasons .  actually  most ancient civilizations that left records seem to have worked out that the earth has to be round .  ships came back from invisible lands over the horizon and  in the sky  a round sun and a round moon were a definite clue  .  .  .    that s where science and common sense overlap .  science is common sense applied to evidence .  using common sense in that manner  you often come to conclusions that are very different from the obvious common sense assumptions that because the universe appears to behave in some manner  then it really does .  of course it also helps to realize that if you live on a very big sphere  it s going to look pretty flat for quite a long way off .  and if gravity always points towards the middle of the sphere  then things don t actually roll around or fall off .  but those are refinements .     around     bc a greek called eratosthenes tested the theory that the earth is a sphere  and he even worked out just how big that sphere is .  he knew that in the city of syene     present day aswan in egypt     the midday sun could be seen reflected in the bottom of a well .   this would not work in ankh morpork  where the well water is often more solid than the well that surrounds it .   eratosthenes threw in a few other simple facts and got back a lot more than he d bargained for .   it s a matter of geometry .  the well was dug straight down .  so the sun at syene had to be straight up     dead overhead .  but in eratosthenes  home city of alexandria  in the nile delta  that didn t happen .  at midday  when the sun was at its highest  eratosthenes cast a definite shadow .  in fact  he estimated that at noon the angle between the sun and the vertical was just over      near enough      of       .  then came the leap of deduction .  the sun is in the same place wherever you observe it from .  on other grounds  it was known that the sun had to be a long way away from the earth  and that meant that the sun s rays that hit the ground in alexandria were very nearly parallel to those that went down the well in syene .  eratosthenes reasoned that a round earth would explain the difference .  he deduced that the distance from syene to alexandria must be      of the circumference of the earth .  but how far was that .   on such occasions it pays to be familiar with the camel herders .  not just because the greatest mathematician in the world is the camel called you bastard  as it is on discworld  see pyramids   but because the camel trains from alexandria to syene took    days to make the trip  at an average speed of     stadia per day .  so the distance from alexandria to syene was       stadia  and the circumference of the earth was         stadia .  the stadium was a greek measure of distance  and nobody knows how long it was .  scholars think it was     feet      m   and if they re right  eratosthenes  value was        miles         km  .  the true value is about        miles         km   so eratosthenes got amazingly close .  unless     sorry  but we re incorrigibly suspicious     the scholars worked backwards from the answer .   it is here that we encounter another feature of scientific reasoning .  in order to make comparisons between theory and experiment  you have to interpret the experiment in terms of your theory .  to clarify this point  we recount the story of ratonasticthenes  an early relative of cut me own throat dibbler  who proved that the discworld was round  and even estimated its circumference  .  ratonasticthenes noticed that at midday in the ramtops the sun was overhead  whereas in lancre  some      miles away  it was at      to the vertical .  since      is roughly a quarter of        ratonasticthenes reasoned that the discworld is round  and the distance from the ramtops to ankh morpork is one quarter of the circumference .  that puts the circumference of this spherical discworld at       miles        km  .  unfortunately for this theory  it was known on other grounds that discworld is some        miles         km  from rim to rim .  still  you can t let an awkward fact get in the way of a good theory  and ratonasticthenes went to his grave believing that it was a small world after all .   his error was to interpret perfectly good observational data in terms of a flawed theory .  scientists repeatedly return to established theories to test them in new ways  and tend towards testiness with those priests  religious or secular  who know the answers already     whatever the questions are .  science is not about building a body of known  facts  .  it is a method for asking awkward questions and subjecting them to a reality check  thus avoiding the human tendency to believe whatever makes us feel good .     from the earliest times  humans have been interested not just in the shape of the world  but in the shape of the universe .  to begin with  they probably thought that these were the same question .  then they worked out  using roughly the same sort of geometry as eratosthenes  that those lights in the sky were a very long way away .  they came up with an amazing range of myths about the sun god s fiery chariot and so on  but after the babylonians got the idea of making accurate measurements  their theories started to lead to surprisingly good predictions of things like eclipses and the motion of the planets .  by the time of ptolemy  claudius ptolemaeus  ad          the best model of planetary motion involved a series of  epicycles      the planets moved as if they were rotating round circles whose centres rotated round other circles whose centres rotated round  .  .  .   isaac newton replaced this theory  and its more accurate successors  with a rule  the law of gravity  it describes how each body in the universe attracts every other body .  it explained johannes kepler s discovery that planetary orbits are ellipses  and in the fullness of time it explained a lot of other things too .   after a few centuries of stunning success  newton s theory ran into its first big failure  it made incorrect predictions about the orbit of mercury .  the place in its orbit at which mercury came closest to the sun didn t move quite the way newton s law predicted .  einstein came to the rescue with a theory based not on attractive forces  but on geometry     on the shape of spacetime .  this was the celebrated theory of relativity .  the theory came in two flavours  special relativity and general relativity .  special relativity is about the structure of space  time  and electromagnet ism  general relativity describes what happens when you throw in gravity too .   the main point to appreciate is that  relativity  is a silly name .  the whole point of special relativity is not that  everything is relative   but that one particular thing     the speed of light     is unexpectedly absolute .  the thought experiment is well known .  if you re travelling in a car at    mph     kph  and you fire a gun forwards  so that the bullet moves at     mph      kph  relative to the car  then it will hit a stationary target at a speed of     mph      kph   adding the two components .  however  if instead of firing the gun you switch on a torch  which  fires  light at a speed of             mph          mps or         kps   then that light will not hit the stationary target at a speed of             mph .  it will hit it at             mph  exactly the same speed as if the car had been stationary .   there are practical problems in staging that experiment  but less graphic and dangerous ones have indicated what the result would be .   einstein published special relativity in       along with the first serious evidence for quantum mechanics and a ground breaking paper on diffusion .  a lot of other people     among them the dutch physicist hendrik lorentz and the french mathematician henri poincar       were working on the same idea  because electro magnetism didn t entirely agree with newtonian mechanics .  the conclusion was that the universe is a lot weirder than common sense tells us  although they probably didn t use that actual word .  objects shrink as they approach the speed of light  time slows down to a crawl  mass becomes infinite  .  .  .  and nothing can go faster than light .  another key idea was that space and time are to some extent interchangeable .  the traditional three dimensions of space plus a separate one for time are merged into a single unified spacetime with four dimensions .  a point in space becomes an event in spacetime .   in ordinary space  there is a concept of distance .  in special relativity  there is an analogous quantity  called the interval between events  which is related to the apparent rate of flow of time .  the faster an object moves  the slower time flows for an observer sitting on that object .  this effect is called time dilation .   if you could travel at the speed of light  time would be frozen .   one startling feature of relativity is the twin paradox  pointed out by paul langevin in      .  again  it is a classic illustration .  suppose that rosencrantz and guildenstern are born on earth on the same day .  rosencrantz stays there all his life  while guildenstern travels away at nearly lightspeed  and then turns round and comes home again .  because of time dilation  only one year  say  has passed for guildenstern  whereas    years have gone by for rosencrantz .  so guildenstern is now    years younger than his twin brother .  experiments carrying atomic clocks around the earth on jumbo jets have verified this scenario  but aircraft are so slow compared to light that the time difference observed  and predicted  is only the tiniest fraction of a second .   so far so good  but there s no place yet for gravity .  einstein racked his brains for years until he found a way to put gravity in  let spacetime be curved .  the resulting theory is called general relativity  and it is a synthesis of newtonian gravitation and special relativity .  in newton s view  gravity is a force that moves particles away from the perfect straight line paths that they would otherwise follow in general relativity  gravity is not a force  it is a distortion of the structure of spacetime .  the usual image is to say that space time becomes  curved   though this term is easily misinterpreted .  in particular  it doesn t have to be curved round anything else .  the curvature is interpreted physically as the force of gravity  and it causes light rays to bend .  one result is  gravitational lensing   the bending of light by massive objects  which einstein discovered in      and published in      .  the effect was first observed during an eclipse of the sun .  more recently it has been discovered that some distant quasars produce multiple images in telescopes because their light is lensed by an intervening galaxy .     einstein s theory of gravity ousted newton s because it fitted observations better  but newton s remains accurate enough for many purposes  and is simpler  so it is by no means obsolete .  now it s beginning to look as if einstein may in turn be ousted  possibly by a theory that he rejected as his greatest mistake .   in      two different observations called einstein s theory into question .  one involved the structure of the universe on truly massive scales  the other happened in our own backyard .  the first has survived everything so far thrown at it  the second can possibly be traced to something more prosaic .  so let s start with the second curious discovery .   in      and      two space probes  pioneer    and     were launched to study jupiter and saturn .  by the end of the     s they were in deep space  heading out of the known solar system .  there has long been a belief  a scientific legend waiting to happen  that beyond pluto there may be an as yet undiscovered planet  planet x .  such a planet would disturb the motions of the two pioneers  so it was worth tracking the probes in the hope of finding unexpected deviations .  john andersen s team found deviations  all right  but they didn t fit planet x     and they didn t fit general relativity either .  the pioneers are coasting  with no active form of propulsion  so the gravity of the sun  and the much weaker gravity of the other bodies of the known solar system  pulls on them and gradually slows them down .  but the probes were slowing down a tiny bit more than they should have been .  in      michael martin suggested that this effect had become sufficiently well established that it cast doubt on einstein s theory  and in      anderson s team reported that what was observed could not be explained by such effects as instrument error  gas clouds  the push of sunlight  or the gravitational pull of outlying comets .   three other scientists quickly responded by suggesting other things that might explain the anomalies .  two wondered about waste heat .  the pioneers are powered by onboard nuclear generators  and they radiate a small amount of surplus heat into space .  the pressure of that radiation might slow the craft down by the observed amount .  the other possible explanation is that the pioneers may be venting tiny quantities of fuel into space .  anderson thought about these explanations and found problems with them both .   the strangest feature of the observed slowing down is that it is precisely what would be predicted by an unorthodox theory suggested in      by mordehai milgrom .  this theory changes not the law of gravity  but newton s law of motion  force equals mass times acceleration .  milgrom s modification applies when the acceleration is very small  and it was introduced in order to explain another gravitational puzzle  the fact that galaxies do not rotate at the speeds predicted by either newton or einstein .  this discrepancy is usually put down to the existence of  cold dark matter  which exerts a gravitational pull but can t be seen in telescopes .  if galaxies have a halo of cold dark matter then they will rotate at a speed that is inconsistent with the matter in the visible portions .  a lot of theorists dislike cold dark matter  because you can t observe it directly     that s what  cold dark  means  and milgrom s theory has slowly gained in popularity .  further studies of the pioneers may help decide .   the other discovery is about the expansion of the universe .  the universe is getting bigger  but it now seems that the very distant universe is expanding faster than it ought to .  this startling result     confirmed by later  more detailed studies     comes from the supernova cosmology project headed by saul perlmutter and its arch rival high z supernova search team headed by brian schmidt .  it shows up as a slight bend in a graph of how a distant supernova s apparent brightness varies with its red shift .  according to general relativity  that graph ought to be straight  but it s not .  it behaves as if there is some repulsive component to gravity which only shows up at extremely long distances     say half the radius of the universe .  a form of antigravity  in fact .   recent work seems to have confirmed this remarkable discovery .  but     as always     ingenious scientists have come up with alternative explanations .  in      csaba cs  ki  john terning  and nemanja kaloper put forward a totally different theory to explain the observations .  they suggest that the light from distant supernovas is dimmer than expected because some of the particles of light     photons     are changing into something else .  specifically  they are changing into  axions   hypothetical particles predicted by several of the currently fashionable quantum mechanical theories of particle physics .  axions are not expected to interact much with other matter  which makes it hard to detect them  but if they have a very small but non zero mass  about one sextillionth of that of an electron  then they will interact with intergalactic magnetic fields .  this interaction would convert a small fraction of photons into axions  and that would account for the missing light .  in fact  the most distant supernovas could lose one third of their photons this way .   it is a sobering thought that such a tiny a modification of known physics  by introducing a particle whose mass ought to be negligible  could have such a big effect .  at any rate  either gravity is not as we thought  or axions exist  as expected  and have mass  not as expected  .  or there s a third reason for the observations  which no one has yet thought of .   one theory of the repulsive force is an exotic form of matter   quintessence  .   this is a form of vacuum energy that pervades all of space  and exerts negative pressure .   as we write this  we can picture ridcully s expression .  we shall have to ignore it .  this isn t something sensible  like magic .  this is science .  empty space can be full of interest .   curiously  einstein originally included a repulsive force of this kind in his relativistic equations for gravity  he called it the cosmological constant .  later he changed his mind and threw the cosmological constant out  complaining that he d been foolish to include it in the first place .  he died thinking it was a blemish on his record  but maybe his original intuition was spot on after all .   unless axions exist and have mass  of course .   in einstein s approach to the cosmological constant  quintessence is effectively spread uniformly throughout space .  but suppose it isn t .  ordinary matter is clumpy  not uniform .  david santiago has pointed out that if quintessence is clumpy too  then einstein s equations predict that the universe could contain  anti black holes  that repel matter instead of swallowing it .  these are not quite the same as hypothetical white holes  time reversed black holes  which spit matter out .  however  it s not yet clear that anti black holes can be stable .  ordinary matter is clumpy because gravity is an attractive force     it likes to create clumps .  antigravity is a repulsive force  and by analogy it ought to destroy clumps .  if that argument is right  then anti black holes are unstable  and would not be able to form in the first place .  they would be mathematical solutions of einstein s equations  but not ones that could be physically realised .  until somebody does the necessary calculations  we can t be sure .        most civilizations  is admittedly not the same as  most people  .   most people  throughout the history of the planet have not needed to concern themselves with what shape the world is  provided it supports  somewhere  the next meal .       this word  meaning  fifth essence   originally referred to a fifth  element  after earth  air  fire and water .  on discworld this role is played by surprise .       eleven   never trust a curved universe    ponder stibbons had set up a desk a little separate from the others and surrounded it with a lot of equipment  primarily in order to hear himself think .   everyone knew that stars were points of light .  if they weren t  some would be visibly bigger than others .  some were fainter than others  of course  but that was probably due to clouds .  in any case their purpose  according to established discworld law  was to lend a little style to the night .   and everyone knew that the natural way for things to move was in a straight line .  if you dropped something  it hit the ground .  it didn t curve .  the water fell over the edge of the world  drifting sideways just a tiny bit to make up for the spin  but that was common sense .  but inside the project  spin was everything .  everything was bent .  archchancellor ridcully seemed to think this was some sort of large scale character flaw  akin to shuffling your feet or not owning up to things .  you couldn t trust a universe of curves .  it wasn t playing a straight bat .   at the moment ponder was rolling damp paper into little balls .  he d had the gardener push in a large stone ball that had spent the last few hundred years on the university s rockery  relic of some ancient siege catapult .  it was about three feet across .   he d hung some paper balls of string near it .  now  glumly  he threw others over it and around it .  one or two did stick  admittedly  but only because they were damp .  he was in the grip of some thought  you had to start with what you were certain of .  things fell down .  little things fell down on to big things .  that was common sense .   but what would happen if you had two big things all alone in the universe .   he set up two balls of ice and rock  in an unused corner of the project  and watched them bang into each other .  then he tried with ball of different sizes .  small ones drifted towards big ones but  oddly enough  the big ones also drifted slightly towards the small ones .   so  .  .  .  if you thought that one through  .  .  .  that meant that if you dropped a tennis ball to the ground it would certainly go down  but in some tiny  immeasurable way the world would  very slightly  come up .   and that was insane .   he also spent some time watching clouds of gas swirl and heat in the more distant regions of the project .  it was all so  .  .  .  well  godless .   ponder stibbons was an atheist .  most wizards were .  this was because uu had some quite powerful standing spells against occult interference  and knowing that you re immune from lightning bolts does wonders for an independent mind .  because the gods  of course  existed .  ponder wouldn t even attempt to deny it .  he just didn t believe in them .  the god currently gaining popularity was om  who never answered prayers or manifested himself .  it was easy to respect an invisible god .  it was the ones that turned up everywhere  often drunk  that put people off .   that s why  hundreds of years before  philosophers had decided that there was another set of beings  the creators  that existed independently of human belief and who had actually built the universe .  they certainly couldn t have been gods of the sort you got now  who by all accounts were largely incapable of making a cup of coffee .   the universe inside the project was hurtling through its high speed time and there was still nothing in there that was even vaguely homely for humans .  it was all too hot or too cold or too empty or too crushed .  and  distressingly  there was no sign of narrativium .   admittedly  it has never been isolated on discworld either  but its existence had long ago been inferred  as the philosopher lye tin wheedle had put it   in the same way that milk infers cows  .  it might not even have a discrete existence .  it might be a particular way in which every other element spun through history  something that they had but did not actually possess  like the gleam on the skin of a polished apple .  it was the glue of the universe  the frame that held all the others  the thing that told the world what it was going to be  that gave it purpose and direction .  you could detect narrativium  in fact  by simply thinking about the world .   without it  apparently  everything all was just balls spinning in circles  without meaning .   he doodled on the pad in front of him   there are no turtles anywhere .    eat hot plasma .  oh  .  .  .  sorry  sir .    ponder peered over his defensive screen .    when worlds collide  young man  someone is doing something wrong .    that was the voice of the senior wrangler .  it sounded more petulant than usual .   ponder went to see what was going on .       twelve   where do rules come from .     something is making roundworld do strange things  .   .   .   it seems to be obeying rules .  or maybe it s just making them up as it goes along .   isaac newton taught us that our universe runs on rules  and they are mathematical .  in his day they were called  laws of nature   but  law  is too strong a word  too final  too arrogant .  but it does seem that there are more or less deep patterns in how the universe works .  human beings can formulate those patterns as mathematical rules  and use the resulting descriptions to work out some aspects of nature that would otherwise be totally mysterious  and even exploit them to make tools  vehicles  technology .   thomas malthus changed a lot of people s minds when he found a mathematical rule for social behaviour .  he said that food grows arithmetically              but populations grow geometrically              .  whatever the growth rates  eventually population will outstrip food supply  there are limits to growth .   malthus s law shows that there are rules down here as well as up there  and it tells us that poverty is not the result of evil or sin .  rules can have deep implications .   what are rules .  do they tell us how the universe  really  works  or do our pattern seeking brains invent or select them .   there are two main viewpoints here .  one is fundamentalist at heart  as fundamentalist as the taliban and southern baptists     indeed  as fundamentalist as the exquisitor vorbis in small gods who states his position thus     .   .   .  that which appears to our senses is not the fundamental truth .  things that are seen and heard and done by the flesh are mere shadows of a deeper reality .    scientific fundamentalism holds that there is one set of rules  the theory of everything  which doesn t just describe nature rather well  but is nature .  for about three centuries science seems to have been converging on just such a system  the deeper our theories of nature become  the simpler they become too .  the philosophy behind this view is known as reductionism  and it proceeds by taking things to bits  seeing what the bits are and how they fit together  and using the bits to explain the whole .  it s a very effective research strategy  and it s served us well for a long time .  we ve now managed to reduce our deepest theories to just two  quantum mechanics and relativity .   quantum mechanics set out to describe the universe on very small scales  subatomic scales  but then became involved in the largest scales of all  the origin of the universe in the big bang .  relativity set out to describe the universe on very large scales  supergalactic ones  but then became involved in the smallest scales of all  the quantum effects of gravity .  despite this  the two theories disagree in fundamental ways about the nature of the universe and what rules it obeys .  the theory of everything  it is hoped  will subtly modify both theories in such a way that they fit seamlessly together into a unified whole  while continuing to work well in their respective domains .  with everything reduced to one ultimate rule  reductionism will have reached the end of its quest  and the universe will be completely explained .   the extreme version of the alternative view is that there are no ultimate rules  indeed that there are no totally accurate rules either .  what we call laws of nature are human approximations to regularities that crop up in certain specialized regions of the universe     chemical molecules  galaxy dynamics  whatever .  there is no reason why our formulations of regularities in molecules and regularities in galaxies should be part of some deeper set of regularities that explains both  any more than chess and soccer should somehow be aspects of the same greater game .  the universe could perfectly well be patterned on all levels  without there being an ultimate pattern from which all the others must logically follow .  in this view  each set of rules is accompanied by a statement of which areas it can safely be used to describe      use these rules for molecules with fewer than a hundred atoms  or  this rule works for galaxies provided you don t ask about the stars that make them up  .  many such rules are contextual rather than reductionist  they explain why things work the way they do in terms of what is outside them .   evolution  especially before it was interpreted through the eyes of dna  is one of the clearest examples of this style of reasoning .  animals evolve because of the environment in which they live  including other animals .  a curious feature of this viewpoint is that to a great extent the system builds its own rules  as well as obeying them .  it is rather like a game of chess played with tiles that can be used to build new bits of board  upon which new kinds of chess piece can move in new ways .   could the entire universe sometimes build its own rules as it proceeds .  we ve suggested as much a couple of times  here s a sense in which it might happen .  it s hard to see how rules for matter could meaningfully  exist  when there is no matter  only radiation     as there was at an early stage of the big bang .  fundamentalists would maintain that the rules for matter were always implicit in the theory of everything  and became explicit when matter appeared .  we wonder whether the same  phase transition  that created matter might also have created its rules .  physics might not be like that  but biology surely is .  before organisms appeared  there couldn t have been any rules for evolution .   for a more homely example  think of a stone rolling down a bumpy hillside  skidding on a clump of grass  bouncing wildly off bigger rocks  splashing through muddy puddles  and eventually coming to rest against the trunk of a tree .  if fundamentalist reductionism is right  then every aspect of the stone s movement  right down to how the blades of grass get crushed  what pattern the mud makes when it splatters  and why the tree is growing where it is anyway  are consequences of one set of rules  that theory of everything .  the stone  knows  how to roll  skid  bounce  splash  and stop because the theory of everything tells it what to do .  more than that  because the theory of everything is true  the stone itself is tracking through the logical consequences of those rules as it skitters down the hillside .  in principle you could predict that the stone would hit that particular tree  just by working out necessary consequences of the theory of everything .   the picture of causality that this viewpoint evokes is one in which the only reasons for things to happen are because the theory of everything says so .  the alternative is that the universe is doing whatever the universe does  and the stone is in a sense exploring the consequences of what the universe does .  it doesn t  know  that it will skid on grass until it hits some grass and finds itself skidding .  it doesn t  know  how to splash mud all over the place  but when it hits the puddle  that s what happens .  and so on .  then we humans come along and look at what the stone does  and start finding patterns .   yes  the reason it skids is because friction works like this  .  .  .    and the laws of fluid dynamics tell us that the mud must scatter like that .  .  .    we know that these human level rules are approximate descriptions  because that s why we invented them .  mud is lumpy  but the rules of fluid dynamics don t take account of lumps .  friction is something rather complicated involving molecules sticking together and pulling apart again  but we can capture a lot of what it does by thinking of it as a force that opposes moving bodies when in contact with surfaces .  because our human level theories are approximations  we get very excited when some more general principle leads to more accurate results .  we then  unless we are careful  confuse  the new theory gives results that are closer to reality than the old  with  the new theory s rules are closer to the real rules of the universe than the old one s rules were  .  but that doesn t follow  we might be getting a more accurate description even though our rules differ from whatever the universe  really  does .  what it really does may not involve following neat  tidy rules at all .     there is a big gap between writing down a theory of everything and understanding its consequences .  there are mathematical systems that demonstrate this point  and one of the simplest is langton s ant  now the small star of a computer program .  the ant wanders around on an infinite square grid .  every time it comes to a square  the square changes colour from black to white or from white to black  and if it lands on a white square then it turns right  but if it lands on a black square then it turns left .  so we know the theory of everything for the ant s universe     the rule that governs its complete behaviour by fixing what can happen on the small scale     and everything that happens in that universe is  explained  by that rule .   when you set the ant in motion  what you actually see is three separate modes of behaviour .  everybody     mathematician or not     immediately spots them .  something in our minds makes us sensitive to the difference  and it s got nothing to do with the rule .  it s the same rule all the time  but we see three distinct phases     simplicity  during the first two or three hundred moves of the ant  starting on a completely white grid  it creates tiny little patterns which are very simple and often very symmetric .  and you sit there thinking  of course  we ve got a simple rule  so that will give simple patterns  and we ought to be able to describe everything that happens in a simple way .      chaos  then  suddenly  you notice it s not like that any more .  you ve got a big irregular patch of black and white squares  and the ant is wandering around in some sort of random walk  and you can t see any structure at all .  for langton s ant this kind of pseudo random motion happens for about the next        steps .  so if your computer is not very fast you can sit there for a long time saying  nothing interesting is going to happen  it s going to go on like this forever  it s just random .   no  it s obeying the same rule as before .  it s just that to us it looks random .     emergent order  finally the ant locks into a particular kind of repetitive behaviour  and it builds a  highway  .  it goes through a cycle of     steps  after which it has moved out two squares diagonally and the shape and the colours along the edge are the same as they were at the beginning of that cycle .  so that cycle repeats forever  and the ant just builds a diagonal highway     forever .     those three modes of activity are all consequences of the same rule  but they are on different levels from the rule itself .  there are no rules that talk about highways .  the highway is clearly a simple thing  but a     step cycle isn t a terribly obvious consequence of the rule .  in fact the only way mathematicians can prove that the ant really does build its highway is to track through those        steps .  at that point you could say  now we understand why langton s ant builds a highway .   but no sooner .   however  if we ask a slightly more general question  we realize that we don t understand langton s ant at all .  suppose that before the ant starts we give it an environment     we paint a few squares black .  now let s ask a simple question  does the ant always end up building a highway .  nobody knows .  all of the experiments on computers suggest that it does .  on the other hand  nobody can prove that it does .  there might be some very strange configuration of squares  and when you start it off on that it gets triggered into some totally different behaviour .  or it could just be a much bigger highway .  perhaps there is a cycle of                   steps that builds a different kind of highway  if only you start from the right thing .  we don t know .  so for this very simple mathematical system  with one simple rule  and a very simple question  where we know the theory of everything  .  .  .  it doesn t tell us the answer .     langton s ant will be our icon for a very important idea  emergence  simple rules may lead to large  complex patterns .  the issue here is not what the universe  really does  .  it is how we understand things and how we structure them in our minds .  the simple ant and its tiled universe are technically a  complex system   it consists of a large number of entities that interact with each other  even though most of those entities are simply squares that change colour when an ant walks on them  .   we can create a system  and give it simple rules which  common sense  suggests should lead to a rather dull future  and we will often find that quite complex features will result .  and they will be  emergent      that is  we have no practical way of working out what they are going to be apart from  .  .  .  well  watching .  the ant must dance .  there are no short cuts .   emergent phenomena  which you can t predict ahead of time  are just as causal as the non emergent ones  they are logical consequences of the rules .  and you have no idea what they are going to be .  a computer will not help     all it will do is run the ant very fast .   a  geographical  image is useful here .  the  phase space  of a system is the space of all possible states or behaviours     all of the things that the system could do  not just what it does do .  the phase space of langton s ant consists of all possible ways to put black and white squares on a grid     not just the ones that the ant puts there when it follows its rules .  the phase space for evolution is all conceivable organisms  not just the ones that have existed so far .  discworld is one  point  in the phase space of consistent universes .  phase spaces deal with everything that might be  not what is .   in this imagery  the features of a system are structures in phase space that give it a well defined  geography  .  the phase space of an emergent system is indescribably complicated  a generic term for such phase spaces is  ant country   which you can think of as a computational form of infinite suburbia .  to understand an emergent feature you would have to find it without traversing ant country step by step .  the same problem arises when you try to start from a theory of everything and work out what it implies .  you may have pinned down the micro rules  but that doesn t mean that you understand their macro consequences .  a theory of everything would tell you what the problem is  in precise language  but that might not help you solve it .   suppose  for instance  that we had very accurate rules for fundamental particles  rules that really do govern everything about them .  despite that  it s pretty clear that those rules would not greatly help our understanding of something like economics .  we want to understand someone who goes into a supermarket  buys some bananas  and pays over some money .  how do we approach that from the particle rules .  we have to write down an equation for every particle in the customer s body  in the bananas  in the note that passes from customer to cashier .  our description of the transaction     money for bananas     and our explanation of it is in terms of an incredibly complicated equation about fundamental particles .   solving that equation is even harder .  and it might not even be the only fruit they buy .   we re not saying that the universe hasn t done it that way .  we re saying that even if it has  that won t help us understand anything .  so there s a big  emergent gap between the theory of everything and its consequences .   a lot of philosophers seem to have got the idea that in an emergent phenomenon the chain of causality is broken .  if our thoughts are emergent properties of our brain  then to many philosophers they are not physically caused by the nerve cells  the electrical currents  and the chemicals in the brain .  we don t mean that .  we think it s confused nonsense .  we re perfectly happy that our thoughts are caused by those physical entities  but you can t describe someone s perceptions or memory in terms of electrical currents and chemicals .   human beings never understand things that way .  they understand things by keeping them simple     in archchancellor ridcully s case  the simpler the better .  a little narrativium goes a long way  the simpler the story  the better you understand it .  storytelling is the opposite of reductionism     letters and some rules of grammar are no story at all .     one set of modern physical rules poses more philosophical questions than all the others combined  quantum mechanics .  newton s rules explained the universe in terms of force  position  speed  and the like     things that make intuitive sense to human beings and let us tell good stories .  a century or so ago  however  it became clear that the universe s hidden wiring has other  less intuitive layers .  concepts such as position and speed not only ceased to be fundamental     they ceased to have a well defined meaning at all .   this new layer of explanation  quantum theory  tells us that on small scales the rules are random .  instead of something happening or not  it may do a bit of both .  empty space is a seething mass of potentialities  and time is something you can borrow and pay back again if you do it quickly enough for the universe not to notice .  and the heisenberg uncertainty principle says that if you know where something is then you can t also know how fast it s going .  ponder stibbons would consider himself lucky if he did not have to explain this to his archchancellor .   a thorough discussion of the quantum world would need a book all to itself  but there s one topic that benefits from some discworld insights .  this is the notorious case of the cat in the box .  quantum objects obey schr  dinger s equation  a rule named after erwin schr  dinger which describes how  wave functions      waves of quantum existence  propagate through space and time .  atoms and their sub atomic components aren t really particles  they re quantum wave functions .   the early pioneers of quantum mechanics had enough problems solving schr  dinger s equation  they didn t want to worry about what it meant .  so they spatchcocked together a cop out clause  the  copenhagen interpretation  of quantum observations .  this says that whenever you try to observe a quantum wave function it immediately  collapses  to give a single particle like answer .  this seems to promote the human mind to a special status  it has even been suggested that our purpose in the universe is to observe it     thereby ensuring its existence  an idea that the wizards of uu consider to be simple common sense .   schr  dinger  however  thought this was silly  and in support he introduced a thought experiment now called schr  dinger s cat .  imagine a box  with a lid that can be sealed so tightly that nothing  not even the barest hint of a quantum wavelet  can leak out .  the box contains a radioactive atom  which at some random moment will decay and emit a particle  and a particle detector that releases poison gas when it detects the atom decaying .  put the cat in the box and close the lid .  wait a bit .   is the cat alive or dead .   if the atom has decayed  then the cat s dead .  if not  it s alive .  however  the box is sealed  so you can t observe what s inside .  since unobserved quantum systems are waves  the quantum rules tell us that the atom must be in a  mixed  state     half decayed and half not .  therefore the cat  which is a collection of atoms and so can be considered as a gigantic quantum system  is also in a mixed state  half alive  half dead .  in      schr  dinger pointed out that cats aren t like that .  cats are macroscopic systems with classical yes no physics .  his point was that the copenhagen interpretation does not explain     or even address     the link from microscopic quantum physics to macroscopic classical physics .  the copenhagen interpretation replaces a complex physical process  which we don t understand  by a piece of magic  the wave collapses as soon as you try to observe it .   most of the time this problem is discussed  physicists manage to turn schr  dinger s point on its head .   no  quantum waves really are like that .   and they ve done lots of experiments to prove they re right .  except .  .  .  those experiments have no box  no poison gas  no alive  no dead  and no cat .  what they have is quantum scale analogues     an electron for a cat  positive spin for alive and negative for dead  and a box with chinese walls  through which anything can be observed  but you take great care not to notice .   these discussions and experiments are lies to children  their aim is to convince the next generation of physicists that quantum level systems do actually behave in the bizarre way that they do .  fine  .  .  .  but it s got nothing to do with cats .  the wizards of unseen university  who know nothing about electrons but have an intimate familiarity with cats  wouldn t be fooled for an instant .  neither would the witch gytha ogg  whose cat greebo is shut in a box in lords and ladies .  greebo is the sort of cat that would take on a ferocious wolf and eat it .   in witches abroad he eats a vampire by accident  and the witches can t understand why the local villagers are so ecstatic .   greebo has his own way of handling quantum paradoxes   greebo had spent an irritating two minutes in that box .  technically  a cat locked in a box may be alive or it may be dead .  you never know until you look .  in fact  the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat  although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in  these being alive  dead  and bloody furious .    schr  dinger would have applauded .  he wasn t talking about quantum states  he wanted to know how they led to ordinary  classical physics in the large  and he could see that the copenhagen interpretation didn t have anything to say about that .  so how do classical yes no answers emerge from quantum ant country .  the closest we have to an answer is something called  decoherence   which has been studied by a number of physicists  among them anthony leggett  roland omn  s  serge haroche and luis davidovich .  if you have a big collection of quantum waves and you leave it to its own devices  then the component waves get out of step and fuzz out .  this is what a classical object is  really  like from the quantum standpoint  and it means that cats do  in fact  behave like cats .  experiments show that the same is true even when the role of the detector is played by a microscopic quantum object  a photon s wave function can collapse without any observers being aware  at the time  that it has done so .  even with a quantum cat  death occurs at the instant that the detector notices that the atom has decayed .  it doesn t require a mind .   in short  archchancellor  the universe always notices the cat .  and a tree in a forest does make a sound when it falls  even if no one is around .  the forest is always there .       this rule does require some special assumptions  such as the chronic and irreversible stupidity of humanity .       as nanny ogg always says   he   s just a big softy .         thirteen   no  it can t do that    archchancellor ridcully looked around at his colleagues .  they d chosen the long table in the great hall for the meeting  since the hem was getting too crowded .    all here .  good   he said .   carry on  mister stibbons .    ponder sifted through his papers .    i ve  er  asked for this meeting   he said   because i m afraid we re doing things wrong .     how can that be .   said the dean .   it s our universe .     yes  dean .  and  er  no .  it s made up its own rules .     no  no  it can t do that   said the archchancellor .   we re intelligent creatures .  we make the rules .  lumps of rock don t make rules     not exactly  sir   said ponder  employing the phrase in its traditional sense of  absolutely wrong  .   there are some rules in the project .     how .  is someone else meddling with it .   the dean demanded .   has a creator turned up .     an interesting thought  sir .  i m not qualified to answer that one .  the point i m trying to make is that if we want to do anything constructive  we ve got to obey the rules .    the lecturer in recent runes looked down at the table in front of him .  it had been laid for lunch .    i don t see why   he said .   this knife and fork don t tell me how to eat .     er  .  .  .  in fact  sir  they do .  in a roundabout way .     are you trying to tell us that the rules are built in .   said ridcully .    yes  sir .  like  big rocks are heavier than small rocks .     that s not a rule  man  that s just common sense .     yes  sir .  it s just that the more i look into the project  the more i m not sure any more what common sense is .  sir  if we re going to build a world it has to be a ball .  a big ball .     that s a lot of outmoded religious nonsense  mister stibbons .      yes  sir .  but in the project universe  it s real .  some of the ba  .  .  .  the spheres the students have made are huge .     yes  i ve seen them .  showy  to my mind     i was thinking of something smaller  sir .  and  .  .  .  and i m pretty sure things will stay on it .  i ve been experimenting .     experimenting .   said the dean .   what good does that do .    the doors were flung open .  turnipseed  ponder s assistant  hurried across to the table in a state of some agitation .    mister stibbons .  hex has found something .    the wizards turned to stare at him .  he shrugged .    it s gold   he said .      the guild of alchemists is not going to be happy about this   said the senior wrangler  as the entire faculty clustered around the project .   you know what they are for demarcation .     fair enough   said ridcully  steering the omniscope .   we ll just give them a few minutes to turn up  otherwise we ll go on as we are  all right .     how can we get it out .   said the dean .   ponder looked horrified .   sir .  this is a universe .  it is not a piggy bank .  you can t just turn it upside down  stick a knife in the slot and rattle it around .     i don t see why not   said ridcully  without looking up .   it s what people do all the time .   he adjusted the focus .   personally i m glad nothing can get out of the thing  though .  call me old fashioned  but i don t intend to occupy the same room as a million miles of exploding gas .  what happened .     hex says one of the new stars exploded .     they re too big to be stars  ponder  we ve been into this .     yes  sir   ponder disagreed .    they ve only been around for five minutes .     a few days  sir .  but millions of years in project time .  people have been dumping rubbish into it  and i think some just drifted in and  .  .  .  i don t think it was a very well made st  furnace in the first place .    the exploding star was shrinking now  but flinging out a great halo of brilliant gases that even lit up one side of the rocky lumps the wizards had been making .  things want to come together and get big  ponder thought .  but when they re big enough  they want to explode .  another law .    there s lead and copper here  too   said ridcully .   we re in the money now  gentlemen .  except that in this universe there s nothing to spend it on .  even so  it seems we re making progress .  you re looking peaky  mister stibbons .  you ought to get some sleep .    progress  thought ponder .  was that what they were making .  but without narrativium  how did anything know .     it was day four .  ponder had been awake all night .  he wasn t sure  but he thought he d probably been awake the previous night  too .  he may have nodded off for a while  pillowing his head on the growing pile of screwed up pieces of paper  with the project winking and twinkling in front of him .  if so  he d dreamed of nothing .   but he d decided that progress was what you made it .   after breakfast  the wizards looked at the ball which currently occupied the centre of the omniscope .    um  i used iron to start with   said ponder .   well  mostly iron .  there s quite a lot of it about .  some of the ices are really nasty things  and rock by itself just sits there .  see this one here .    a smaller ball of rock hung in space a little way away .    yes  very dull   said the senior wrangler .   why s it got holes all over it .     i m afraid that when i was dropping rocks on the ball of iron there were a few that went out of control .     could happen to anyone  stibbons   said the archchancellor generously .   did you add gold .     oh yes  sir .  and other metals     gold does give a crust some style  i think .  are these volcanoes .     sort of  sir .  they are the  er  acne of young worlds .  only unlike ours  where the rock is melted in the internal magical fields generated in the sub strata  the magma is kept molten by the heat trapped inside the sphere .     very smoky atmosphere .  i can hardly see anything .     yes  sir .     well  i don t call it much of a world   said the dean  sniffing .   practically red hot  smoke belching out everywhere  .  .  .     the dean does have a point  young man   said ridcully .  he was extra kind  just to annoy the dean .   it s a brave attempt  but you just seem to have made another ball .    ponder coughed .   i just put this one together for demonstration purposes  sir .   he fiddled with the controls of the omniscope .  the scene flickered  and changed .   now this   he said  and there was a twinge of pride in his voice   is one i made earlier .    they stared into the lens .    well .  just more smoke   said the dean .    cloud  sir  in fact   said ponder .    well  we can all make clouds of gas          er  .  .  .  it s water vapour  sir   said ponder .   he reached over and adjusted the omniscope .   the room was filled with the roar of the biggest rainstorm of all time .     by lunchtime it was a world of ice .    and we were doing so well   said ridcully .    i can t think what went wrong   said ponder  wringing his hands .   we were getting seas .     can t we just warm it up .   said the senior wrangler .   ponder sat down on his chair and put his head in his hands .    bound to cool a world down  all that rain   said the lecturer in recent runes  slowly .    very good  .  .  .  er  rocks   said the dean .  he patted ponder on the back .    poor chap looks a bit down   hissed the senior wrangler to ridcully .   i don t think he s been eating properly .     you mean  .  .  .  not chewing right .     no eating enough  archchancellor .    the dean picked up a piece of paper from ponder s crowded desk .    i say  look at these   he said .   on the paper was written  in ponder s very neat handwriting     the rules    things fall apart  but centres hold .     everything moves in curves .     you get balls .     big balls tell space to bend .     there are no turtles anywhere .      .  .  .  it s so depressing .      always been a bit of a one for rules  our ponder   said the senior wrangler .    number six doesn t sound incredibly well formulated   said ridcully .    you don t think he s going a bit bursar  do you .   said the lecturer in recent runes .    he always thinks everything has to mean something   said ridcully  who generally took the view that trying to find any deep meaning to events was like trying to find reflections in a mirror  you always succeeded  but you didn t learn anything new .    i suppose we could simply heat the thing up   said the senior wrangler .    a sun should be easy   said ridcully  a big ball of fire should be no problem to a thinking wizard .   he cracked his knuckles .   get some of the students to put mister stibbons to bed .  we ll soon have his little world all warm or my name s not mustrum ridcully .        omnianism had taught for thousands of years that the discworld was in fact a sphere  and violently persecuted those who preferred to believe the evidence of their own eyes .  at the time of writing  omnianism was teaching that there was something to be said for every point of view .       fourteen   disc worlds    to the wizards of unseen university  the heavens include two obviously different types of body  stars  which are tiny pinpricks of light  and the sun  which is a hot ball  not too far away  and passes over the disc during the day and under it at night .  it s taken humanity a while to realize that in our universe it s not like that .  our sun is a star  and like all stars it s huge  so those tiny pinpricks must be a very long way off .  moreover  some of the pinpricks that seem to be stars aren t  they betray themselves by moving differently from the rest .  these are the planets  which are a lot closer and a lot smaller  and together with the earth  moon  and sun they form the solar system .  our solar system may look like a lot of balls whizzing around in some kind of cosmic game of pool  but that doesn t mean that it started out as balls or rock and ice .  it is the outcome of a physical process  and the ingredients that went into that process are not obliged to resemble the result that comes out .   the more we learn about the solar system  the more difficult it is to give a plausible answer to the question  how did it start .  it is not the  answer  part that gets harder     it s the plausibility .  as we learn more and more about the solar system  the reality check that our theories have to pass becomes more and more stringent .  this is one reason why scientists have a habit of opening up old questions that everybody assumed were settled long ago  and deciding that they weren t .  it doesn t mean that scientists are incompetent  it demonstrates their willingness to contemplate new evidence and re examine old conclusions in its light .  science certainly does not claim to get things right  but it has a good record of ruling out ways to get things wrong .   what must a theory of the formation of the solar system explain .  principally  of course  the planets     nine of them  dotted rather randomly in space  mercury  venus  earth  mars  jupiter  saturn  uranus  neptune  pluto .  it must explain their differences in size .  mercury is a mere       miles        km  in diameter  whereas jupiter is        miles          km  in diameter        times as big         times the volume  an enormous discrepancy .  it must explain their differences in chemical composition  mercury is made of iron  nickel  and silicate rock  jupiter is made from hydrogen and helium .  it must explain why the planets near the sun are generally smaller than those further out  with the exception of tiny pluto  out in the cold and the dark .  we don t know a great deal about pluto  but most of what we do know is strange .  for instance  all the other planets lie pretty close to a single plane through the centre of the sun  but pluto s orbit is inclined at a noticeable angle .  all the other planets have orbits that are pretty close to circles  but pluto s orbit is much more elongated     to the extent that some of the time it is closer to the sun than neptune is .   but that s not all that a theory of the origin of the solar system has to get right .  most planets have smaller bodies in orbit around them     our own familiar moon  phobos and deimos  the diminutive twin satellites of mars  jupiter s    satellites  saturn s     .  .  .  even pluto has a satellite  called charon  and that s weird too .  saturn goes one better and also has entire rings of smaller bodies surrounding it  a broad  thin band of encircling rocks that breaks up into a myriad distinct ringlets  with satellites mixed up among them as well as more conventional satellites elsewhere .  then there are the asteroids  thousands of small bodies  some spherical like planets  others irregular lumps of rock  most of which orbit between mars and jupiter     except for quite a few that don t .  there are comets  which fall in towards the sun from the huge  oort cloud  way out beyond the orbit of pluto     a cloud that contains trillions of comets .  there is the kuiper belt  a bit like the asteroid belt but outside pluto s orbit  we know over    bodies out there now  but we suspect there are hundreds of thousands .   these bodies are known as  kuiper belt objects  or kbos .  a few years back there was a big fuss because some astronomers wanted to redefine pluto as a kbo rather than a planet .  pluto probably wouldn   t have minded either way  but an awful lot of textbook publishers would have .  the scientific case was strong  pluto is weird in almost every respect  as we   ve just seen  and it could easily be a kbo that accidentally strayed into the outer reaches of the solar system when disturbed by other bodies .  if so  that would explain why it   s so weird .  it doesn   t look like a planet because it isn   t one .  other astronomers disagreed strongly with this proposal     for sentimental reasons  for historical ones  or because we don   t know for sure that pluto is a wandering kbo .  in the end  pluto remained on the list of planets .  but whether it can hang on to that status for much longer is unclear .   then there are meteorites  lumps of rock of various sizes that wander erratically through the whole thing  .  .  .   each of these celestial objects  moreover  is a one off .  mercury is a blisteringly hot lump of cratered rock .  venus has a sulphuric acid atmosphere  rotates the wrong way compared to nearly everything else in the solar system  and is believed to resurface itself every hundred million years or so in a vast  planetwide surge of volcanic activity .  earth has oceans and supports life  since we live on it we find it the most congenial of the planets  but many aliens would probably be aghast at its deadly  poisonous  corrosive oxygen atmosphere .  mars has rock strewn deserts and dry ice at its poles .  jupiter is a gas giant  with a core of hydrogen compressed so much that it has become metallic  and maybe a small rocky core inside that      small  compared to jupiter  but about three times the diameter of the earth .  saturn has its rings     but so do jupiter  uranus  and neptune  though these are nowhere near as extensive or spectacular .  uranus has an icy mantle of methane and ammonia  and its axis of rotation is tilted so far that it is slightly upside down .  neptune is similar to uranus but without that ridiculous axial tilt .  pluto  as we ve said  is just crazy .  we don t even know accurately how big it is or how massive it is  but it s a lilliputian in the country of the gas giants .   right .  .  .  all that is what a theory of the origins of the solar system has to explain .  it was all a lot easier when we thought there were six planets  plus the sun and the moon  and that was it .  as for the solar system being an act of special creation by a supernatural being     why would any self respecting supernatural being make the thing so complicated .     because it makes itself complicated     that s why .  we now think that the solar system was formed as a complete package  starting from quite complicated ingredients .  but it us took a while to realize this .   the first theory of planetary formation that makes any kind of sense by modern standards was thought up by the great german philosopher immanuel kant about     years ago .  kant envisaged it all starting as a vast cloud of matter     big lumps  small lumps  dust  gas     which attracted each other gravitationally and clumped together .   about    years later the french mathematician pierre simon de laplace came up with an alternative theory of enormous intrinsic beauty  whose sole flaw is that it doesn t actually work .  laplace thought that the sun formed before the planets did  perhaps by some cosmic aggregation process like kant s .  however  that ancient sun was much bigger than today s  because it hadn t fully collected together  and the outer fringes of its atmosphere extended well beyond what is now the orbit of pluto .  like the wizards of unseen university  lapkce thought of the sun as a gigantic fire whose fuel must be slowly burning away .  as the sun aged  it would cool down .  cool gas contracts  so the sun would shrink .   now comes a neat peculiarity of moving bodies  a consequence of another of newton s laws  the law s  of motion .  associated with any spinning body is a quantity called  angular momentum      a combination of how much mass it contains  how fast it is spinning  and how far out from the centre the spinning takes place .  according to newton  angular momentum is conserved     it can be redistributed  but it neither goes away nor appears of its own accord .  if a spinning body contracts  but the rate of spin doesn t change  angular momentum will be lost  therefore the rate of spin must increase to compensate .  this is how ice skaters do rapid spins  they start with a slow spin  arms extended  and then bring their arms in close to their body .  moreover  spinning matter experiences a force  centrifugal force  which seems to pull it outwards  away from its centre .   laplace wondered whether centrifugal force acting on a spinning gascloud might throw off a belt of gas round the equator .  he calculated that this ought to happen whenever the gravitational force attracting that belt towards the centre was equal to the centrifugal force trying to fling it away .  this process would happen not once  but several times  as the gas continued to contract     so the shrinking sun would surround itself with a series of rings of material  all lying in the same plane as the sun s equator .  now suppose that each belt coalesced into a single body  .  .  .  planets .   what laplace s theory got right  but kant s did not  was that the planets lie roughly in a plane and they all rotate round the sun in the same direction that the sun spins .  as a bonus  something rather similar might have occurred while those belts were coalescing into planets  in which case the motion of satellites is explained as well .  it s not hard to combine the best features of kant s and laplace s theories  and this combination satisfied scientists for about a century .  however  it slowly became clear that our solar system is far more unruly than either kant or laplace had recognized .  asteroids have wild orbits  and some satellites revolve the wrong way .  the sun contains     of the solar system s mass  but the planets possess     of its angular momentum  either the sun is rotating too slowly or the planets are revolving too quickly .   as the twentieth century opened  these deficiencies of the laplacian theory became too great for astronomers to bear  and several people independently came up with the idea that a star developed a solar system when it made a close encounter with another star .  as the two stars whizzed past each other  the gravitational attraction from one of them was supposed to draw out a long cigar shaped blob of matter from the other  which then condensed into planets .  the advantage of the cigar shape was that it was thin at the ends and thick at the middle  just as the planets are small close to the sun or out by pluto  but big in the middle where jupiter and saturn live .  mind you  it was never entirely clear why the blob had to be cigar shaped  .  .  .   one important feature of this theory was the implication that solar systems are rather uncommon  because stars are quite thinly scattered and seldom get close enough together to share a mutual cigar .  if you were the sort of person who d be comforted by the idea that human beings are unique in the universe  then this was a rather appealing suggestion  if planets were rare  then inhabited planets would be rarer still if you were the sort of person who preferred to think that the earth isn t especially unusual  and neither are its life forms  then the cigar theory definitely put a crimp on the imagination .     by the middle of the twentieth century  the shared cigar theory had turned out to be even less likely than the kant laplace theory .  if you rip a lot of hot gas from the atmosphere of a star  it doesn t condense into planets     it disperses into the unfathomable depths of interstellar space like a drop of ink in a raging ocean .  but by then  astronomers were getting a much clearer idea of how stars originated  and it was becoming clear that planets must be created by the same processes that produce the stars  a solar system is not a sun that later acquires some tiny companions  it all comes as one package  right from the start .  that package is a disc  the nearest thing in our universe  so far as we know  to discworld .  but the disc begins as a cloud and eventually turns into a lot of balls  stibbons s third rule  .   before the disc formed  the solar system and the sun started out as a random portion of a cloud of interstellar gas and dust .  random jigglings triggered a collapse of the dustcloud  with everything heading for roughly     but not exactly     the same central point .  all it takes to start such a collapse is a concentration of matter somewhere  whose gravity then pulls more matter towards it  random jigglings will produce such a concentration if you wait long enough .  once the process has started  it is surprisingly rapid  taking about ten million years from start to finish .  at first the collapsing cloud is roughly spherical .  however  it is being carried along by the rotation of the entire galaxy  so its outer edge  relative to the centre of the galaxy  moves more slowly than its inner edge .  conservation of angular momentum tells us that as the cloud collapses it must start spinning  and the more it collapses  the faster it spins .  as its rate of spin increases  the cloud flattens out into a rough disc .   more careful calculations show that near the middle this disc thickens out into a dense blob  and most of the matter ends up in the blob .  the blob condenses further  its gravitational energy gets traded for heat energy  and its temperature goes up fast .  when the temperature rises enough  nuclear reactions are ignited  the blob has become a star .  while this is happening  the material in the disk undergoes random collisions  just as kant imagined  and coalesces in a not terribly ordered way .  some clumps get shoved into wildly eccentric orbits  or swung out of the plane of the disc  most clumps  however  are better behaved and turn into decent  sensible planets .  a miniature version of the self same processes can equip most of those planets with satellites .   the chemistry fits  too .  near the sun  those incipient planets get very hot  too hot for solid water to form .  further out     around the orbit of jupiter for a dustcloud suitable for making our sun and solar system     water can freeze into solid ice .  this distinction is important for the chemical composition of the planets  and we can see the main outlines if we focus on just three elements  hydrogen  oxygen  and silicon .  hydrogen and oxygen happen to be the two most abundant elements in the universe  apart from helium which doesn t undergo chemical reactions .  silicon is less abundant but still common .  when silicon and oxygen combine together  you get silicates     rocks .  but even if the oxygen can mop up all the available silicon  some     of the oxygen is still unattached  and it combines with hydrogen to make water .  there is so much hydrogen     a thousand times as much as oxygen     that virtually all of the oxygen that doesn t go into rocks gets locked away in water .  so by far the most common compound in the condensing disc is water .   close to the star  that water is liquid  even vapour  but out at jovian distances  it s solid ice .  you can pick up a lot of solid mass if you re condensing in a region where ice can form .  so the planets there are bigger  and  at least to begin with  they are icy nearer the star  the planets are smaller  and rocky .  but now the big guys can parky their initial weight advantage into an even bigger one .  anything that is ten times the mass of the earth  or greater  can attract and retain the two most abundant elements of the disc  hydrogen and helium .  so the big balls soak up large amount of extra mass in the form of these two gases .  they can also retain compounds like methane and ammonia  which are volatile gases closer to the star .   this theory explains rather a lot .  it gets all the main features of the solar system pretty much right .  it allows for the odd exceptional motion  but not too many .  it agrees with observations of condensing gas clouds in distant regions of space .  it may not be perfect  and some special pleading might be necessary to explain odd things like pluto  but most of the important features click neatly into place .   it also seems likely that huge numbers of planets exist without a central star .  in      a team led by rafael rebolo observed isolated large planets .  a survey of such bodies in the sigma orionis cluster shows that the smaller these bodies are  the more numerous they become .  if this relationship continues down to earth sized bodies  which are too small to observe with current methods  then  isolated planets  will litter the galaxy .  there are probably hundreds of them within    light years of earth  for example .  but without a nearby star  there is no way we can observe them directly .  there is no star to wobble  no light output to dim as a planet gets in the way  and the planets themselves emit only reflections of distant starlight  far too faint to be seen from here .  the conventional theory of planetary formation  in which a star and its accompanying solar system come into being together  cannot apply to such worlds .  small gas clouds are not massive enough to collapse under gravity in the right way  but magnetic effects might cause a collapsing gas cloud round a star to break up and be ejected before its planets are fully formed .  or perhaps these worlds came into being in the usual way  but were then ejected from their solar systems .     the future of the solar system is at least as interesting as its past .  the picture of the solar system that emerged from the ideas of newton and his contemporaries was very much that of a clockwork universe     a celestial machine that  once set ticking  would continue to follow some simple mathematical rules and continue ticking merrily away forever .  they even built celestial machines  called orreries  with lots and lots of cogwheels  in which little brass planets with ivory moons went round and round when you turned a handle .   we now know that the cosmic clockwork can go haywire .  it won t happen quickly  but there may be some big changes to the solar system on the way .  the underlying reason is chaos     chaos in the sense of  chaos theory   with all those fancy multicoloured  fractal  things  a rapidly expanding area of mathematics which is invading all of the other sciences .  chaos teaches us that simple rules need not lead to simple behavior     something that ponder stibbons and the other wizards are in the process of discovering .  in fact  simple rules can lead to behaviour that in certain respects has distinct elements of randomness .  chaotic systems start out behaving predictably  but after you cross some  prediction horizon  all predictions fail .  weather is chaotic  with a prediction horizon of about four days .  the solar system  we now know  is chaotic  with a prediction horizon of tens of millions of years .  for example  we can t be sure which side of the sun pluto will be in a hundred million years  time .  it will be in the same orbit  but its position in that orbit is completely uncertain .   we know this because of some mathematical work that was done  in part  with an orrery     but this was a  digital orrery   a custom built computer that could do celestial mechanics very fast .  the digital orrery was developed by jack wisdom s research group  which     in competition with its rival headed by jaques laskar     has been extending our knowledge of the solar system s future .  even though a chaotic system is unpredictable in the long run  you can make a whole series of independent attempts at predicting it and then see what they agree about .  according to the mathematics  you can be pretty sure those things are right .   one of the most striking results is that the solar system is due to lose a planet .  about a billion years from now  mercury will move outwards from the sun until it crosses the orbit of venus .  at that point  a close encounter between venus and mercury will fling one or the other  possibly both  out of the solar system altogether     unless they hit something on the way  which is highly unlikely  but possible .  it might even be the earth  or the passing venus might join with us in a cosmic dance whose end result is the earth being flung out of the solar system .  the details are unpredictable  but the general scenario is very likely .   this means that we ve got the wrong picture of the solar system .  on a human timescale it s a very simple place  in which nothing much changes .  on its own timescale  hundreds of millions of years  it s full of drama and excitement  with planets roaring all over the place  whirling around each other  and dragging each other out of orbit in a mad gravitational dance .   this is vaguely reminiscent of worlds in collision  a book published in      by immanuel velikovsky  who believed that a giant comet was once spat out by jupiter  passed close to the earth twice  had a love affair with mars  giving rise to a brood of baby comets   and finally retired to live in peace as venus .  along the way it gave rise to many strange effects that became stories in the bible .  velikovsky was right about one thing  the orbits of the planets are not fixed forever .  he wasn t right about much else .     do other solar systems encircle distant stars  or are we unique .  until a few years ago there was a lot of argument about this question  but no hard evidence .  most scientists  if they had to bet  would have backed the existence of other solar systems  because the collapsing dustcloud mechanism could easily get going almost anywhere there s cosmic dust     and there are a hundred billion stars in our own galaxy  let alone the billions upon billions of others in the universe  all of which once were cosmic dust .  but that s only indirect evidence .  now the position is much clearer .  characteristically  however  the story involves at least one false start  and a critical re examination of evidence that at first looked rather convincing .   in      jocelyn bell  a graduate student at the university of cambridge  was working for a doctorate under the direction of anthony hewish .  their field was radio astronomy like light  radio is an electromagnetic wave  and like light  radio waves can be emitted by stars .  those radio waves can be detected using parabolic dish receivers     today s satellite tv dishes are a close relative     rather misleadingly called  radio telescopes   even though they work on very different principles from normal optical telescopes .  if we look at the sky in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum  we can often  see  things that are not apparent using ordinary visible light .  this should be no surprise  for example military snipers can  see in the dark  using infra red waves     detecting things by the heat they emit .  the technology in those days wasn t terribly slick  and the radio signals were recorded on long rolls of paper using automatic pens that drew wiggly curves in good old fashioned ink .  bell was given the task of looking for interesting things on the paper charts     carefully scanning about     feet of chart per week .  what she found was very strange     a signal that pulsated about thirty times per second .  hewish was sceptical  suspecting that the signal was somehow generated by their measuring instruments  but bell was convinced it was genuine .  she searched through three miles of previous charts and found several earlier instances of the same signal  which proved she was right .  something out there was emitting the radio equivalent of a reverberating whistle .  the object responsible was named a  pulsar      a pulsating starlike object .   what could these strange things be .  some people suggested they were radio signals from an alien civilization  but all attempts to extract the alien equivalent of the jerry springer show failed  which was possibly just as well  .  there seemed to be no structured messages hidden in the signals .  in fact  what they are now believed to be is even stranger than an alien tv programme .  pulsars are thought to be neutron stars  stars composed of highly degenerate matter containing only neutrons  usually a mere    miles     km  in diameter .   recall that neutron stars are incredibly dense  formed when a larger star undergoes gravitational collapse .  that initial star  as we have seen  will be spinning  and because of conservation of angular momentum  the resulting neutron star has to spin a lot faster in fact  it typically spins through about thirty complete revolutions every second .  for a star  that s pretty speedy .  only a tiny star like a neutron star can do it  if an ordinary star were to revolve that fast  its surface would have to be travelling faster than light  which wouldn t greatly please einstein .   more realistically  a normal star would be torn apart at much lower speeds .   but a neutron star is small  and its angular momentum is comparatively large  and pirouetting thirty times a second is no problem at all .   for a helpful analogy  contemplate our own earth .  like a pulsar  it spins on an axis .  like a pulsar  it has a magnetic field .  the magnetic field has an axis too  but it s different from the axis of rotation     that s why magnetic north is not the same as true north .  there s no good reason for magnetic north to be the same as true north on a pulsar  either .  and if it isn t  that magnetic axis whips round thirty times every second .  a rapidly spinning magnetic field emits radiation  known as synchrotron radiation     and it emits it in two narrow beams which point along the magnetic axis .  in short  a neutron star projects twin radio beams like the spinning gadgetry on top of a terrestrial lighthouse .  so if you look at a neutron star in radio light  you see a bright flash as the beam points towards you  and then virtually nothing until the beam comes round again .  every second  you see thirty flashes .  that s what bell had noticed .   if you re a living creature of remotely orthodox construction  you definitely do not want your star to be a pulsar .  synchrotron radiation is spread over a wide range of wavelengths  from visible light to x rays  and x rays can seriously damage the health of any creature of remotely orthodox construction .  but no astronomer ever seriously suspected that pulsars might have planets  anyway .  if a big star collapses down to an incredibly dense neutron star  surely it will gobble up all the odd bits of matter hanging around nearby .  won t it .   perhaps not .  in      matthew bailes announced that he had detected a planet circling the pulsar psr          with the same mass as uranus  and lying at a distance similar to that of venus from the sun .  the known pulsars are much too far away for us to see planets directly     indeed all stars  even the nearest ones  are too far away for us to see planets directly .  however  you can spot a star that has planets by watching it wiggle as it walks .  stars don t sit motionless in space     they generally seem to be heading somewhere  presumably as the result of the gravitational attraction of the rest of the universe  which is lumpy enough to pull different stars in different directions .  most stars move  near enough  in straight lines .  a star with planets  though  is like someone with a dancing partner .  as the planets whirl round the star  the star wobbles from side to side .  that makes its path across the sky slightly wiggly .  now  if a big fat dancer whirls a tiny feather of a partner around  the fat one hardly moves at all  but if the two partners have equal weight  they both revolve round a common centre .  by observing the shape of the wiggles  you can estimate how massive any encircling planets are  and how close to the star their orbits are .   this technique first earned its keep with the discovery of double stars  where the dancing partner is a second star  and the wobbles are fairly pronounced because stars are far more massive than planets .  as instrumentation has become more accurate  ever tinier wobbles can be detected  hence ever tinier dancing partners .  bailes announced that pulsar psr         had a dancing partner whose mass was that of a planet .  he couldn t observe the wiggles directly  but he could observe the slight changes they produced in the timing of the pulses in the signal .  the only puzzling feature was the rotational period of the planet  exactly six earth months .  bit of a coincidence .  it quickly turned out that the supposed wiggles were not caused by a planet going round the pulsar  but by a planet much closer to home     earth .  the instruments were doing the wiggling at this end  not the pulsar at the far end .   scarcely had this startling claim of a pulsar planet been withdrawn  however  when aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery of two more planets  both circling pulsar psr         .  a pulsar solar system with at least two worlds .  the way you wiggle when you have two dancing partners is more complex than the way you do it with one  and it s difficult to mistake such a signal for something generated at the receiving end by the motion of the earth .  so this second discovery seems to be fairly solid  unless there is a way for pulsars to vary their output signals in just such a complex manner without having planets     maybe the radio beam could be a bit wobbly .  we can t go there to find out  so we have to do the best we can from here  and from here it looks good .   so there do exist planets outside our solar system .  but it s the possibility of life that really makes distant planets interesting  and a pulsar planet with all those x rays is definitely not a place for anything that wants to be alive for very long .  but now conventional stars are turning out to have planets  too .  in october      michel mayor and didier queloz found wobbles in the motion of the star    pegasi that were consistent with a planet of about half jupiter s mass .  their observations were confirmed by geoffrey marcy and paul butler  who found evidence for two more planets     one seven times the mass of jupiter orbiting    virginis  and one two or three times jupiter s mass orbiting    ursae majoris .   by      seven such planets had been found .  as we write  about    extrasolar planets have been detected  either by the wobble method  or by observing the light output from a star and seeing whether it changes as an orbiting planet reflects different amounts of its light .  theoretical calculations show that with improved telescopes  this method might even be able to detect how fast the planet is rotating .  even now  new extrasolar planets are being found virtually every week .  the exact number fluctuates because every so often astronomers discover problems with previous measurements that cast doubt on somebody else s favourite new planet  but the general trend is up .  and our nearest sunlike neighbour  epsilon eridani  is now known to possess an encircling dustcloud  perhaps like our sun s oort cloud  thanks to observations made in      by james greaves and colleagues .  we can t see any wobbles  though  so if it has planets  their mass must be less than three times that of jupiter .  a year earlier  david trilling and robert brown used observations of a similar dustcloud round    cancri  which does wobble  to show that it has a planet whose mass is at most   .   jupiters .  this definitely rules out alternative explanations of the unseen companion  for example that it might be a  brown dwarf   a failed star .     although today s telescopes cannot detect an alien planet directly  future telescopes might .  conventional astronomical telescopes use a big  slightly dish shaped mirror to focus incoming light  plus lenses and prisms to pick up the image and send it to what used to be an eyepiece for an astronomer to look down  but then became a photographic plate  and is now likely to be a  charge coupled device      a sensitive electronic light detector     hooked up to a computer .  a single telescope of conventional design would need a very big mirror indeed to spot a planet round another star     a mirror some     yards      m  across .  the biggest mirror in existence today is one tenth that size  and to see any detail on the alien world you d need an even bigger mirror  so none of this is really practicable .   but you don t have to use just one telescope .   a technique known as  interferometry  makes it possible  in principle  to replace a single mirror     yards wide by two much smaller mirrors     yards apart .  both produce images of the same star or planet  and the incoming light waves that form those images are aligned very accurately and combined .  the two mirror system gathers less light than a complete     yard mirror would  but it can resolve the same amount of tiny detail .  and with modern electronics  very small quantities of incoming light can be amplified .  in any case  what you actually do is use dozens of smaller mirrors  together with a lot of clever trickery that keeps them aligned with each other and combines the images that they receive in an effective manner .   radio astronomers use this technique all the time .  the biggest technical problem is keeping the length of the path from the star to its image the same for all of the smaller telescopes  to within an accuracy of one wavelength .  the technique is relatively new in optical astronomy  because the wavelength of visible light is far shorter than that of radio waves  but for visible light the real killer is that it s not worth bothering if your telescopes are on the ground .  the earth s atmosphere is in continual turbulent motion  bending incoming light in unpredictable ways .  even a very powerful ground based telescope will produce a fuzzy image  which is why the hubble space telescope is in orbit round the earth .  its planned successor  the next generation space telescope  will be a million miles away  orbiting the sun  delicately poised at a place called lagrange point l  .  this is a point on the line from the sun to the earth  but further out  where the sun s gravity  the earth s gravity  and the centrifugal force acting on the orbiting telescope all cancel out .  hubble s structure includes a heavy tube which keeps out unwanted light  especially light reflected from our own planet .  it s a lot darker out near l   and that cumbersome tube can be dispensed with  saving launch fuel .  in addition  l  is a lot colder than low earth orbit  and that makes infra red telescopy much more effective .   interferometry uses a widely separated array of small telescopes instead of one big one  and for optical astronomy the array has to be set up in space .  this produces an added advantage  because space is big  or  in more discworldly terms  a place to be big in .  the biggest distance between telescopes in the array is called the baseline .  out in space you can create interferometers with gigantic baselines     radio astronomers have already made one that is bigger than the earth by using one ground based telescope antenna and one in orbit .  both nasa and the european space agency esa have missions on the drawing board for putting prototype optical interferometer arrays      flocks  is a more evocative term     into space .   some time around      nasa will launch space technology    previously named deep space     involving two spacecraft flying   .   miles    km  apart and maintaining station relative to each other to a precision of less than half an inch    cm  .  another nasa venture  the space interferometry mission  will employ three interferometers with a    metre baseline and is tentatively due to launch in      .  and nasa is thinking about a terrestrial planet finder in       which will look not just for planets  but for carbon dioxide  water vapour  ozone  and methane  which could be signs of life     or  at least  of a planet that might be able to support life similar to ours .  life finder  with no specific date  would look more closely .   the european space agency  esa  has similar missions on the drawing board .  smart    consisting of two satellites orbiting in formation  is planned for      .  a more ambitious esa project is darwin  a flotilla of   telescopes that could be in space by      .   the biggest dream of all  though  is nasa s planet imager  pencilled in for      .  a squadron of five spacecraft  each equipped with four optical telescopes  will deploy itself into an interferometer with a baseline of several thousand miles  and start mapping alien planets .  the nearest star is just over four light years away  computer simulations show that    telescopes with a baseline of just    miles      km  can produce images of a planet    light years away that are good enough to spot continents and even moons the size of ours .  with     telescopes and the same baseline  you could look at the earth from    light years away and see hurricanes in its atmosphere .  think what could be done with a thousand mile baseline .   planets outside our solar system do exist  then     and they probably exist in abundance .  that s good news if you re hoping that somewhere out there are alien lifeforms .  the evidence for those  though  is controversial .   mars  of course  is the traditional place where we expect to find life in the solar system     partly because of myths about martian  canals  which astronomers thought they d seen in their telescopes but which turned out to be illusions when we sent spacecraft out there to take a close look  partly because conditions on mars are in some ways similar to those on earth  though generally nastier  and partly because dozens of science fiction books have subliminally prepared us for the existence of martians .  life does show up in nasty places here  finding a foothold in volcanic vents  in deserts  and deep in the earth s rocks .  nevertheless  we ve found no signs of life on mars .   yet .   for a while  some scientists thought we had .  in      nasa announced signs of life on mars .  a meteorite dug up in the antarctic with the code number alh      had been knocked off mars    million years ago by a collision with an asteroid  and plunged to earth        years ago .  when it was sliced open and the interior examined at high magnification we found three possible signs of life .  these were markings like tiny fossil bacteria  crystals containing iron like those made by certain bacteria  and organic molecules resembling some found in fossil bacteria on earth .  it all pointed to  martian bacteria .  not surprisingly  this claim led to a big argument  and the upshot is that all three discoveries are almost certainly not evidence for life at all .  the fossil  bacteria  are much too small and most of them are steps on crystal surfaces that have caused funny shapes to form in the metal coatings used in electron microscopy  the iron bearing crystals can be explained without invoking bacteria at all  and the organic molecules could have got there without the aid of martian life .   however  in      the mars global surveyor did find signs of an ancient ocean on mars .  at some point in the planet s history  huge amounts of water gushed out of the highlands and flowed into the northern lowlands .  it was thought that this water just seeped away or evaporated  but it now turns out that the edges of the northern lowlands are ail at much the same height  like shorelines eroded by an ocean .  the ocean  if it existed  covered a quarter of mars s surface .  if it contained life  there ought to be martian fossils for us to find  dating from that period .   the current favourite for life in the solar system is a surprise  at least to people who don t read science fiction  jupiter s satellite europa .  it s a surprise because europa is exceedingly cold  and covered in thick layers of ice .  however  that s not where the life is suspected to live .  europa is held in jupiter s massive gravitational grasp  and tidal forces warm its interior .  this could mean that the deeper layers of the ice have melted to form a vast underground ocean .  until recently this was pure conjecture  but the evidence for liquid water beneath europa s surface has now become very strong indeed .  it includes the surface geology  gravitational measurements  and the discovery that europa s interior conducts electricity .  this finding  made in      by k .  k .  khurana and others  came from observations of the worldlet s magnetic field made by the space probe galileo  the shape of the magnetic field is unusual  and the only reasonable explanation so far is the existence of an underground ocean whose dissolved salts make it a weak conductor of electricity .  callisto  another of jupiter s moons  has a similar magnetic field  and is now also thought to have an underground ocean .  in the same year  t .  b .  mccord and others observed huge patches of hydrated salts  salts whose molecules contain water  on europa s surface .  this might perhaps be a salty crust deposited by upwelling water from a salty ocean .   there are tentative plans to send out a probe to europa  land it  and drill down to see what s there .  the technical problems are formidable     the ice layer is at least ten miles     km  thick  and the operation would have to be carried out very carefully so as not to disturb or destroy the very thing we re hoping to find  europan organisms .  less invasively  it would be possible to look for tell tale molecules of life in europa s thin atmosphere  and plans are afoot to do this too .  nobody expects to find europan antelopes  or even fishes  but it would be surprising if europa s water based chemistry  apparently an ocean a hundred miles      km  deep  has not produced life .  almost certainly there are sub oceanic  volcanoes  where very hot sulphurous water is vented through the ocean floor .  these provide a marvellous opportunity for complicated chemistry  much like the chemistry that started life on earth .   the least controversial possibility would be an array of simple bacteria like chemical systems forming towers around the hot vents     much as earthly bacteria do in the baltic sea .  more complicated creatures like amoebas and parameciums would be a pleasant surprise  anything beyond that  such as multicellular organisms  would be a bonus .  don t expect plants     there s not enough light that far from the sun  even if it could filter down through the layers of ice .  europan life would have to be powered by chemical energy  as it is around earth s underwater volcanic vents .  don t expect europan lifeforms to look like the ones round our vents  though  they will have evolved in a different chemical environment .   in      brad dalton  an astrogeophysicist   geologist  for other worlds  wondered whether we might have already seen alien life .  europa   s surface is covered with red brown marks  especially along what appear to be cracks in the ice .  dalton discovered that the infrared spectrum of these marks is very similar to that of earthly bacteria that can survive in very cold environments .  in fact  for three species of bacteria the spectrum is closer than that for the most likely alternative explanation of the marks  mineral salts seeping up through the cracks .  europa   s surface is too cold for even these bacteria  but they might thrive in the ocean and somehow be transported to the surface .       fifteen   the dawn of dawn    ponder opened his eyes and looked up into a face out of time .  a mug of tea was thrust towards him .   it had a banana stuck in it .    ah  .  .  .  librarian   said ponder weakly  taking the cup .  he drank  stabbing himself harmlessly in the left eye .  the librarian thought that practically everything could be improved by the addition of soft fruit  but apart from that he was a kindly soul  always ready with a helping hand and a banana .    the wizards had put ponder to sleep on a bench in the storeroom .  dusty items of magical gear were stacked from floor to ceiling .  most of it was broken  and all of it was covered in dust .   ponder sat up and yawned .    what time is it .     ook .     gosh  that late .    as the warm clouds of sleep ebbed  it dawned on ponder that he had left the project entirely in the hands of the senior faculty .  the librarian was impressed at how long the door kept swinging .   most of the main laboratory was empty  except for the pool of light around the project .   the dean s voice said   mappin winterley  .  .  .  that s a nice name .     shutup .     owen houseworthy .     shutup .     william .     shut up  dean .  that s not funny .  it never was funny .   this was the voice of the archchancellor .    just as you say  gertrude .    ponder advanced towards the glowing project .    ah  ponder   said the senior wrangler  stepping in front of it hurriedly .   good to see you looking so        you ve been  .  .  .  doing things  haven t you   said ponder  trying to see around him .    i m sure everything can be mended   said the lecturer in recent runes .    and it s still nearly circular   said the dean   just ask charlie grinder here .  his name s definitely not mustrum ridcully  i know that .     i m warning you  dean .  .  .       what have you done .    ponder looked at his globe .  it was certainly warmer now  and also rather less globular .  there were livid red wounds across one side  and the other hemisphere was mainly one big fiery crater .  it was spinning gently  wobbling as it did so .    we ve saved most of the bits   said the senior wrangler  watching him hopefully   what did you do .     we were only trying to be helpful   said the dean .   gertrude here suggested we make a sun  and          dean .   said ridcully   yes  archchancellor .     i would just like to point out  dean  that it was not a very funny joke to begin with .  it was a pathetic attempt  dean  at dragging a sad laugh out of a simple figure of speech .  only four year olds and people with a serious humour deficiency keep on and on about it .  i just wanted to bring this out into the open  dean  calmly and in a spirit of reconciliation  for your own good  in the hope that you may be made well .  we are all here for you  although i can t imagine what you are here for .   ridcully turned to the horrified ponder .   we made a sun                some suns        muttered the dean .          some suns  yes  but  .  .  .  well  this  falling in circles  business is very difficult  isn t it .  very hard to get the hang of .     you crashed a sun into my world .   said ponder .    some suns   said ridcully .    mine bounced off   said the dean .    and created this rather embarrassingly large hole here   said the archchancellor .   and incidentally knocked a huge lump out of the place .     but at least bits of my sun burned for a long time   said the dean .    yes  but inside the world .  that doesn t count .   ridcully sighed .   yet your machine  mister stibbons  says a sun sixty miles across won t work .  and that s ridiculous .    ponder stared hollow eyed at his world  wobbling around like a crippled duck .    there s no narrativium   he said dully .   it doesn t know what size a sun should be .     ook   said the librarian .    oh dear   said ridcully .   who let him in here .    the librarian was informally banned from the high energy magic building  owing to his inherent tendency to check on what things were by tasting them .  this worked very well in the library  where taste had become a precision reference system  but was less useful in a room occasionally containing bus bars throbbing with several thousand thaums .  the ban was informal  of course  because anyone capable of pulling the dooknob right through an oak door can obviously go where he likes .   the orangutan knuckled over to the dome and tasted it .  the wizards tensed as delicate black fingers twiddled the knobs of the omniscope  bringing into focus the furnace that had exploded yesterday .  it was a tiny point of light now  surrounded by coruscating streamers of glowing gas .   the focus moved in to the glowing ember .    still too big   said ridcully .   nice try  old chap .    the librarian turned towards him  the light of the explosion moving across his face  and ponder held his breath .   it came out in a rush .   someone give me a light .    the globes on his desk rolled off and bounced on the floor as he tried to grab one .  he held it as the senior wrangler obligingly lit a match  and waggled it this way and that .   it ll work .    jolly good .   said ridcully .   what will .     days and nights .   said ponder .   seasons  too  if we do it right .  well done  sir .  i m not sure about the wobble  but you might have got it just right .     that s the kind of thing we do   said ridcully  beaming .   we re the chaps for getting things right  sure enough .  what things did we get right this time .     the spin .     that was my sun that did that   the dean pointed out  smugly .   ponder was almost dancing .  and then  suddenly  he looked grave .    but it all depends on fooling people down there   he said .   and there isn t anyone down there   .  .  hex .    there was a mechanical rattle as hex paid attention .      yes .        is there any way we can get onto the world .        nothing physical may enter the project       i want someone down there to observe things from the surface .        that is possible .  virtually possible       virtually .        but you will need a volunteer .  someone to fool       this is unseen university   said the archchancellor  that should present no problem .        a magical accident had once turned the university   s librarian into an orangutan  a state which he enjoyed sufficiently to threaten  with simple and graphic gestures  anyone who suggested turning him back .  the wizards noticed no difference now .  an orangutan seemed such a natural shape for a librarian .       sixteen   earth and fire    we don t know if the earth is a typical planet .  we don t know how common  aqueous  planets with oceans and continents and atmospheres are .  in our solar system  earth is the only one .  and we d better be careful about phrases like  earthlike planet   because for about half of earth s history it has not been the familiar blue green planet that we see in satellite photos  with its oxygen atmosphere  white clouds  and everything else that we are used to .  in order to get an earthlike planet  in today s sense  you have to start with an unearthlike planet and wait a few billion years .  and what you get is quite different from what  only a few decades ago  we thought the earth was like .   we thought it was a very stable place     that if you could go back to the time when the oceans and continents first separated out  they d have been in the same places they are now .  and we thought that the interior of the earth was pretty simple .   we were wrong .   we know a lot about the surface of the earth  but we still know much less about what s inside it .  we can study the surface by going there  which is usually fairly easy  unless we want to look at the top of everest .  we can also penetrate the ocean depths using vehicles that can protect frail humans against the huge pressures of the deep seas  and we can dig holes down into the ground and send people down those too .  we can get further information about the top few miles of the earth s crust by drilling  but that s just a thin skin  comparatively speaking .  we have to infer what it s like deeper down from indirect observations  of which the most important are shock waves emitted by earthquakes  laboratory experiments  and theory .   the surface of our planet generally seems fairly placid     apart from weather and the sometimes severe effects of the seasons     but there are plenty of volcanoes and earthquakes to remind us that not so far below our feet it s a lot less hospitable .  volcanoes form where the molten rocks inside the earth well up to the surface  often accompanied by massive clouds of gas or ash  all of it emerging under high pressure .  in      mount st helens in washington state  usa blew up like a pressure cooker whose lid had been tied down  and about half of a large mountain simply disappeared .  earthquakes happen when the earth s crustal rocks slide past each other along deep cracks .  later we ll see what drives these two things  but they need to be put into perspective  despite occasional disasters  the surface of the earth has been sufficiently hospitable for life to have evolved and survived for several billion years .   the earth is nearly spherical  having a diameter of       miles         km  at the equator but only       miles         km  from pole to pole .  the slight broadening at the equator is the result of centrifugal forces from the earth s spin  and originally set in when the planet was molten .  the earth is the densest planet in the solar system  with an average density   .   times that of water .  when the earth condensed from the primal dustcloud the chemical elements and compounds that formed it separated into layers  the denser materials sank to the centre of the earth and the lighter ones floated to the top  much as a layer of light oil floats on denser water .   in      the american geophysicist francis birch set out a description of the general structure of our planet which has been modified in only minor ways since .  the inside of the earth is hot  but the pressure there is also very high  the most extreme conditions occur at the centre where the temperature is about        c and the pressure is   million times atmospheric pressure .  heat tends to make rocks and metals melt  but pressure tends to solidify them  so it is the combination of these two conflicting factors that determines whether the materials are liquid or solid .  the centre of the earth is a rather lumpy spherical core  mainly made of iron  with a radius of roughly       miles        km  .  the innermost regions of the core  out to a radius of     miles       km   are solid  but a thick outer layer is molten .  the very top layers of the earth form a thin skin  the crust  which is only a few miles thick .  between crust and core lies the mantle  which is solid  formed from a variety of silicate rocks .  the mantle also divides into an inner layer and an outer layer  with the division occurring at a radius of about       miles        km  .  above this  transition zone  the main rocks are olivine  pyroxine  and garnet  below it their crystal structures become more tightly packed  forming such minerals as perovskite .  the outermost parts of the mantle  and the deeper parts of the crust where the two join  are again molten .   the crust is between   and    miles    and    km  thick  and there s a lot going on there .  those parts of the crust that form the continental land masses are mainly made of granite .  beneath the oceans  the crustal layer is predominately basalt  and this basalt layer continues underneath the continental granite .  so the continents are broad  thin sheets of granite stuck on top of a basalt skin .  from the earth s surface the most evident features of the granite layers are mountains .  the highest ones look big to us  but they rise no more than   miles    km  above sea level  a mere seventh of a per cent of the earth s radius .  the deepest part of the ocean  the mariana trench in the northwest pacific  plunges   miles     km  beneath the waves .  the overall deviation from an ideal sphere  strictly  spheroid  because of the flattening of the poles  is about one third of a per cent     about as irregular as the shallow indentations you find on a basketball  which add to its grip .  our home planet  give or take a bit of squashing  is remarkably round and surprisingly smooth .  gravity made it that way  and it keeps it that way     except that some small but interesting movements in the mantle and the crust add a few wrinkles .   how do we know all this .  mainly because of earthquakes .  when an earthquake hits  the whole earth rings like a bell hit by a hammer .  shockwaves  vibrations emitted by the earthquake  travel through the earth .  they are deflected by transition zones between different kinds of material  such as that between core and mantle  or lower and upper mantle .  they bounce off the earth s crust and head back down again .  there are several kinds of wave  and they travel with different speeds .  so the short sharp shock of an earthquake gives rise to a very complex pattern of waves .  when the waves hit the surface they can be detected and recorded  and recordings made in different places can be compared .  working backwards from these recorded signals  it is possible to deduce a certain amount about the underground geography of our planet .     one consequence of the earth s internal structure is a magnetic field .  a compass needle points roughly north .  the standard  lie to children  is that the earth is a giant magnet .  let s unpack the next layer of explanation .   the earth s magnetic field has long been something of a puzzle since magnets are seldom made out of rock  but once you realize that the earth has a whopping great lump of iron inside it  everything makes much more sense .  the iron doesn t form a  permanent  magnet  like the ones you inexplicably buy to stick plastic pigs and teddy bears on the fridge door  it s more like a dynamo .  in fact it s called the geomagnetic dynamo .  the iron in the core is  as we ve said  mostly molten  except for a slightly lumpy solid bit in the middle .  the liquid part is still heating up     the old explanation of this was that radioactive elements are denser than most of the rest of the earth  and therefore sank to the middle where they became trapped  and their radioactive energy is showing up as heat .  the current theory is quite different  the molten part of the core is heating up because the solid part is cooling down .  the liquid iron that is in contact with the solid core is itself slowly solidifying  and when it does so it loses heat .  that heat has to go somewhere  and it can t just waft away unnoticed as warm air because everything is thousands of miles underground .  so it goes into the molten part of the core and heats it up .   you re probably wondering how the part that is in contact with the solid core can simultaneously be getting cooler  so that it solidifies too  and be getting hotter as a result of that solidification  but what happens is that the hot iron moves away as soon as it s been warmed up .  for an analogy  think about a hot air balloon .  when you heat air  it rises  the reason is that air expands when it gets hot  so becomes less dense  and less dense things float on top of denser things .  a balloon traps the hot air in a huge cloth bag  usually brightly coloured and emblazoned with adverts for banks and estate agents  and floats up along with the air .  now hot iron rises  just as hot air does  and that takes the newly heated iron away from the solid core .  it heads upwards  cooling slowly as it does so  and when it gets to the top it cools down     comparatively speaking     and starts to sink again .  the result is that the earth s core circulates up and down  being heated at the bottom and cooling at the top .  it can t all go up at the same time  so in some regions it s heading up  and in others it s heading back down again .  this kind of heat driven circulation is called convection .   according to physicists  a moving fluid can develop a magnetic field provided three conditions hold .  first  the fluid must be able to conduct electricity     which iron can do fine .  secondly  there has to be at least a tiny magnetic field present to begin with     and there are good reasons to suppose that the earth had a bit of personal magnetism  even early on .  thirdly  something has to twist the fluid  distorting that initial magnetic field  and for the earth this twisting happens by way of coriolis forces  which are like centrifugal forces but a bit more subtle  caused by the earth s rotation on its axis .  roughly speaking  the twisting tangles the original  weak magnetic field like spaghetti being twirled on to a fork  then the magnetism bubbles upwards  trapped in the rising parts of the iron core .  as a result of these motions  the magnetic field becomes a lot stronger .   so  yes  the earth does behave a bit as though it had a huge bar magnet buried inside it  but there s rather more going on than that .  just to paint the picture in a little more detail  there are at least seven other factors that contribute to the earth s magnetic field .  some of the materials of the earth s crust can form permanent magnets .  like a compass needle pointing north  these materials align themselves with the stronger field from the geomagnetic dynamo and reinforce it .  in the upper regions of the atmosphere is a layer of ionized gas     gas bearing an electrical charge .  until satellites were invented  this  ionosphere  was crucial for radio communications  because radio waves bounced back down off the charged gas instead of beaming off into space .  the ionosphere is moving  and moving electricity creates a magnetic field .  about        miles         km  out lies the ring current  a low density region of ionized particles forming a huge torus .  this slightly reduces the strength of the magnetic field .  the next two factors  the magnetopause and the magnetotail  are created by the interaction of the earth s magnetic field with the solar wind     a continual stream of particles outward bound from our hyperactive sun .  the magnetopause is the  bow wave  of the earth s magnetic field as it heads into the solar wind  the magnetotail is the  wake  on the far side of the earth  where the earth s own field streams outwards getting ever more broken up by the solar wind .  the solar wind also causes drag along the direction of the earth s orbit  creating a further kind of motion of magnetic field lines known as field aligned currents .  finally  there are the convective electrojets .  the  northern lights   or aurora borealis  are dramatic  eerie sheets of pale light that waft and shimmer in the northern polar skies  there is a similar display  the aurora australis  near the south pole .  the auroras are generated by two sheets of electrical current that flow from magnetopause to magnetotail  these in turn create magnetic fields  the westward and eastward electrojets .   yes  like a bar magnet     in the sense that an ocean is like a bowl of water .     magnetic materials found in ancient rocks show that every so often     about once every half a million years  but with no sign of regularity     the earth s magnetic field flips polarity  reversing magnetic north and south .  we re not sure exactly why  but mathematical models suggest that the magnetic field can exist in these two orientations  with neither of them being totally stable .  so whichever one it s in  it eventually loses stability and flips to the other one .  the flips are rapid  taking about       years  the periods between flips are about a hundred times as long .   most of the other planets have magnetic fields  and these can be even more complicated and difficult to explain than that of the earth .  we ve still got a lot to learn about planetary magnetism .   one of the most dramatic features of our planet was discovered in      but wasn t accepted by science until the     s  and some of the most compelling evidence was left by those flips in the earth s magnetism .  this is the notion that the continents are not fixed in place  but wander slowly over the surface of the planet .  according to alfred wegener  the german who first publicized the idea  all of today s separate continents were originally part of a single super continent  which he named pangea   all earth   .  pangea existed about     million years ago .   wegener surely wasn t the first person to speculate along such lines  because he got the idea     in part  at least     from the curious similarity between the shapes of the coasts of africa and south america .  on a map the resemblance is striking .  that wasn t wegener s only source of inspiration  however .  he wasn t a geologist  he was a meteorologist  specializing in ancient climates .  why  he wondered  do we nowadays find rocks in regions with cold climates that were clearly laid down in regions with warm climates .  and why  for that matter  do we nowadays find rocks in regions with warm climates that were clearly laid down in regions with cold climates .  for example  remains of ancient glaciers     million years old can still be seen in the sahara desert  and fossil ferns are found in antarctica .  pretty much everyone else thought that the climate must have changed  wegener became convinced that the climate had stayed much the same  give or take the odd ice age  and the continents had shifted .  perhaps they d been driven apart by convection in the mantle     he wasn t sure .   this was considered a crazy idea  it wasn t suggested by a geologist  and it ignored all sorts of inconvenient evidence  and the alleged fit between south american and africa wasn t all that good anyway  and     to top it all     there was no conceivable mechanism for carting continents around .  certainly not convection  which was too weak .  great a tuin may lug a planet around on its back  but that s fantasy  in the real world  there seemed to be no conceivable way for it to happen .   we use the word  conceivable  because a number of very bright and very reputable scientists were busily making one of the subject s worst  and commonest  errors .  they were confusing  i can t see a way for this to happen  with  there is no way for this to happen .   one of them  it pains one of us to admit  was a mathematician  and a brilliant one  but when his calculations told him that the earth s mantle couldn t support forces strong enough to move continents  it didn t occur to him that the theories on which those calculations were based might be wrong .  his name was sir harold jeffreys  and he really should have been more imaginative  because it wasn t just the shapes of the land on either side of the atlantic that fitted .  the geology fitted too  and so did the fossil record .  there is  for example  a fossil beast called mesosaurus .  it lived     million years ago  and is found only in south america and africa .  it couldn t have swum the atlantic  but it could have evolved on pangea and spread to both continents before they drifted apart .   in the     s  however  wegener s ideas became orthodox and the theory of  continental drift  became established .  at a meeting of leading geologists  a ponder stibbons like young man named edward bullard and two colleagues enlisted the aid of a new piece of kit called a computer .  they instructed the machine to find the best fit between africa and south america  and north america  and europe  allowing for a bit of breakage but not too much .  instead of using today s coastline  which was never a very sensible idea but made it possible to claim that the fit wasn t actually that good  they used the contour corresponding to a depth of      feet       m  underwater  whose shape is less likely to have been changed by erosion .  the fit was good  and the geology across the join matched amazingly well .  and even though the people at the conference came out just as divided in their opinions as they d been when they went in  somehow continental drift had become the consensus .   today we have much more evidence  and a fair idea of the mechanism .  down the middle of the atlantic ocean  and elsewhere in other oceans  there runs a ridge     roughly north south and about midway between south america and africa .  volcanic material is welling up along that ridge  and spreading sideways .  it s been spreading for     million years  and it s still doing it today  we can even send deep sea submarines down there to watch .  it s not spreading at speeds humans can see     america moves about three quarters of an inch    cm  further away from africa every year  about the same rate that your fingernails grow     but today s instruments can easily measure such a change .   the most striking evidence for continental drift is magnetic  the rocks on either side bear a curious pattern of magnetic stripes  reversing polarity from north to south and back again  and that pattern is symmetric on either side of the ridge     making it clear that the stripes were frozen in place as the rocks cooled in the earth s magnetic field .  whenever the earth s dynamo flipped polarity  as it does from time to time  the rock immediately adjacent to the ridge line  on either side  got the same new polarity .  as the rocks then spread apart  they took the same patterns of stripes with them .   the surface of the earth is not a solid sphere .  instead  the continents and the ocean beds float on top of large  essentially solid plates  and those plates can be driven apart by upwelling magma .   oh  but mostly by convection in the mantle .  jeffreys didn t know what we now know about how the mantle moves .   there are about a dozen plates  ranging from     miles       km  across to      miles         km   and they twist and turn .  where plate boundaries rub against each other  sticking and slipping and sticking and slipping  you get a lot of earthquakes and volcanoes .  especially along the  pacific rim   the edge of the pacific ocean up along the west coast of chile  central america  the usa  along down past japan  and back round new zealand  which is all the edge of a single gigantic plate .  where plate boundaries collide you get mountain ranges  one plate burrows under the other  lifting it up and crushing and folding its edges .  india was once not part of the main asian continent at all  but came crashing into it  creating the world s highest mountain range  the himalayas .  india hasn t fully stopped even now  and the himalayas are still being pushed up by the force of the impact .       seventeen   suit of spells    a figure was frogmarched through the early morning corridors  surrounded by the senior wizards .  it wore a long white nightshirt  and a nightcap with the word  wizzard  embroidered  inexpertly  on it .  it was unseen university s least qualified but most well travelled member  usually away from something .  and it was in trouble .    this won t hurt a bit   said the senior wrangler .    it s right up your street   said the lecturer in recent runes .    it s on a log and in your face   explained the dean .    that isn t what hex said  is it .   said the senior wrangler  as the sleepy figure was hustled around a corner .    very similar  but what hex said made less sense   said the dean .   they hurried across the lawn and barged through the doors in the high energy magic building .   mustrum ridcully finished filling his pipe  and struck a match on the dome of the project .  then he turned  and smiled .    ah  rincewind   he said .   good of you to come .     i was dragged  sir .     well done .  and i have good news .  i intend to appoint you egregious professor of cruel and unusual geography .  the post is vacant .    rincewind looked past him .  on the far side of the room some of the junior wizards were working in a haze of magic that made it hard to see exactly what it was they were working on  but it looked almost like  .  .  .  some sort of skeleton .    oh   he said .   er  .  .  .  but i m very happy as assistant librarian .  i m getting really good at peeling the bananas .     but the new post offers you room  board and all your laundry done   said the archchancellor .    but i get that already  sir .    ridcully drew leisurely on his pipe and blew out a cloud of blue smoke .    up until now   he said .    oh .  i see .  and you re about to send me somewhere really dangerous  yes .    ridcully beamed .   how did you guess .     it wasn t a guess .    fortunately the dean had been forewarned and had grabbed the back of rincewind s nightshirt  and so he was ready .  the wizard s bedroom slippers skidded uselessly on the tiles as he tried to make for the door .    it s best to let him run for a little while    said the senior wrangler .   it s a nervous reaction .     and the best thing is   said ridcully  to rincewind s back   that although we are sending you to a place of immense danger where no living thing could possibly survive  you will not  in so many words  actually be there .  won t that be nice .    rincewind hesitated .    how many words .     it ll be like being in a  .  .  .  story   said the archchancellor .   or  .  .  .  or a dream  as far as i can understand it .  mister stibbons .  come and explain .     oh  hello  rincewind   said ponder  stepping out of the mist and wiping his hands on a rag .   twelve spells hex has amalgamated for this .  it s an amazing piece of thaumaturgical engineering .  do come and see .    there are creatures which have evolved to live in coral reefs and simply could not survive in the rough  tooth filled wastes of the open sea .  they continue to exist by lurking among the dangerous tentacles of the sea anemone or around the lips of the giant clam and other perilous crevices shunned by all sensible fish .   a university is very much like a coral reef .  it provides calm waters and food particles for delicate yet marvellously constructed organisms that could not possibly survive in the pounding surf of reality  where people ask questions like  is what you do of any use .   and other nonsense .   in fact rincewind in his association with uu had survived dangers that would have stripped a hero to the bone  but he nevertheless believed  despite all the evidence to the contrary  that he was safe in the university .  he would do anything to stay on the roll .   at the moment this involved looking at some sort of skeletal armour made out of smoke while ponder stibbons gabbled incomprehensible words in his ear .  as far as he could understand it  the thing put all your senses somewhere else when you stayed here .  so far  that sounded quite acceptable  since it had always seemed to rincewind that if you had to go a long way away it d be nice to stay at home while you did it  but people seemed a little unclear about where pain fitted in .    we ll send you     that is  your senses     somewhere   said ridcully .    where .   said rincewind .    somewhere amazing   said ponder .   we just want you to tell us what you see .  and then we ll bring you back .     at what point will things go wrong .   said rincewind .    nothing can possibly go wrong .     oh   rincewind sighed .  there was no point in arguing with a statement like that .   could i have some breakfast first .     of course  dear fellow   said ridcully  patting him on the back .   have a hearty meal .     yes  i thought that d probably be the case   said rincewind gloomily .   when he d been taken away  under escort by the dean and a couple of college porters  the wizards clustered around the project .    we ve found a suitably large  sun   sir   said ponder  taking care to annunciate the inverted commas .   we re moving the world now     a very suspicious idea  this   said the archchancellor .   suns go around .  we see it happen every day .  it s not some kind of optical illusion .  this is a bit of a house of cards we re building here .     it s the only one available  sir .     i mean  things fall down because they re heavy  you see .  the thing that causes them to fall down because they re heavy is  in fact  the fact that they re heavy .   heavy  means inclined to fall down .  and  while you can call me mr silly          oh  i wouldn t do that  sir   ponder said  glad that ridcully couldn t see his face .          i somehow feel that a crust of rock floating around on a ball of red hot iron should not be thought of as  solid ground  .     i think  sir  that this universe has a whole parcel of rules that take the place of narrativium   said ponder .   it s  .  .  .  sort of  .  .  .  copying us  as you so perspicaciously pointed out the other day .  it s making the only kind of suns that can work in it  and the only worlds that can exist if you don t have chelonium .     even so  .  .  .  going around a sun   .  .  that s the sort of thing the omnian priests used to teach  you know .  mankind is so insignificant that we just float around on some speck  and all that superstitious stuff .  you know they used to persecute people for saying the turtle existed .  and any fool can see it exists .     yes  sir .  it certainly does .      there were problems  of course .    are you sure it s the right sort of sun .   said ridcully .    you told hex to find one that was  nice and yellow  nice and dull  and not likely to go off bang   sir   said ponder .   it seems to be a pretty average one for this universe .     even so  .  .  .  tens of millions of miles  .  .  .  that s a long way away for our world .     yes  sir .  but we tried some experimental worlds close to and they fell in  and we tried one a bit further out and that s baked like a biscuit  and there s one  .  .  .  well  it s a bit of an armpit  really .  the students have got quite good at making different sorts .  er  .  .  .  we re calling them planets .     a planet  stibbons  is a lump of rock a mere few hundred yards across which gives the night sky a little  oh  i don t know  what s the word  a little je ne sais quoi          these will work  sir  and we ve such a lot of them .  as i said  sir  i ve come to agree with your theory that  within the project  matter is trying to do all by itself what in the real world is done by purpose  probably conveyed via narrativium .     was that my theory .   said ridcully .    oh  yes  sir   said ponder  who was learning the particular survival skills of the academic reef .    it sounds rather a parody to me  but i dare say we will understand the joke in time .  ah  here comes our explorer .   morning  professor   said ridcully .   are you ready .     no   said rincewind .    it s very simple   said ponder  leading the reluctant traveller across the floor .   you can think of this assemblage of spells as a suit of very  very good armour .  things will flicker  and then you ll be  .  .  .  somewhere else .  except you ll really be here  you see .  but everything you see will be somewhere else .  absolutely nothing will hurt you because hex will buffer all extreme sensations and you ll simply receive a gentle analogue of them .  if it s freezing you ll feel rather chilly  if it s boiling you ll feel a little hot .  if a mountain falls on you it ll be a bit of a knock .  time where you re going is moving very fast but hex can slow it down while you are there  hex says that he can probably exert small amounts of force within the project  so you will be able to lift and push things  although it will feel as though you re wearing very large gloves .  but this should not be required because all we want you to do to start with  .  .  .  professor  .  .  .  is tell us what you see .    rincewind looked at the suit .  it was  being largely make up of spells under hex s control  shimmery and insubstantial .  light reflected off it in odd ways .  the helmet was far too large and completely covered the face .    i have three  .  .  .  no  four  .  .  .  no  five questions   he said .    yes .     can i resign .     no .     do i have to understand anything you just told me .     no .     are there any monsters where i m being sent .     no .     are you sure .    yes .     are you totally positive about that .     yes .     i ve just thought of another question   said rincewind .    fire away .     are you really sure .     yes .   snapped ponder .   and even if there were any monsters  it wouldn t matter .     it d matter to me .     no it wouldn t .  i have explained .  if some huge toothed beast came galloping towards you  it d have no effect on you at all .     another question .     yes .     is there a toilet in this suit .     no .     because there will be if a huge toothed beast comes galloping towards me .     in that case  you just say the word and you can come back and use the privy down the hall   said ponder .   now  stop worrying  please .  these gentlemen will help you  er  insert yourself into the thing  and we ll begin  .  .  .    the archchancellor wandered up as the reluctant professor was enveloped in the glittering  not quite there stuff .    a thought occurs  ponder   he said .    yes  sir .     i suppose there s no chance that there is life anywhere in the project .    ponder looked at him in frank astonishment .    absolutely not  sir .  it can t happen .  simple matter is obeying a few rather odd rules .  that s probably enough to get things  .  .  .  spinning and exploding and so on  but there s no possibility that they could cause anything so complex as .  .  .       the bursar  for example .     not even the bursar  sir .     he s not very complicated  though .  if only we could find a parrot that was good at sums  we could pension the old chap off .     no  sir .  there s nothing like the bursar .  not even an ant or a blade of grass .  you might as well try to tune a piano by throwing rocks at it .  life does not turn up out of nowhere  sir .  life is a lot more than just rocks moving in circles .  the one thing we re not going to run into is monsters .      two minutes later rincewind blinked and found  when he opened his eyes  that they were somewhere else .  there was a rather grainy redness in front of them  and he felt rather warm .    i don t think it s working   he said .    you should be seeing a landscape   said ponder  in his ear .    it s all just red .    there was the sound of distant whispering .  then the voice said   sorry .  the aim wasn t very good .  wait a moment and we ll soon have you out of that volcanic vent .    in the hem ponder took the ear trumpet away from his ear .  the other wizards heard it sizzling  as if a very angry insect was trapped therein .    curious language   he said  in mild surprise   well  let s raise him somewhat and let time move on a little  .  .  .    he put the trumpet to his ear and listened .    he says it s pissing down   he announced .       eighteen   air and water    it s certainly a surprise that the rigid rules of physics permit anything as flexible as life  and the wizards can hardly be blamed for not anticipating the possibility that living creatures might come into being on the barren rocks of roundworld .  but down here is not as different from up there as it seems .  before we can talk about life  though  we need to deal with a few more features of our home planet  atmosphere and oceans .  without them  life as we know it could not have arisen  without life as we know it  our oceans and atmosphere would be distinctly different .   the story of the earth s atmosphere is inextricably intertwined with that of its oceans .  indeed  the oceans can reasonably be viewed as just a rather damp  dense layer of the atmosphere .  the oceans and the atmosphere evolved together  exerting strong influences on each other  and even today such an  obviously  atmospheric phenomenon as weather turns out to be closely related to what happens in the oceans .  one of the main recent breakthroughs in weather prediction has been to incorporate the oceans  ability to absorb  transport  and give off heat and moisture .  to some extent  the same point can be made about the solid regions of the earth  which also co evolved with the air and the seas  and also interact with them .  but the link between oceans and atmosphere is stronger .   the earth and its atmosphere condensed together out of the primal gascloud that gave rise to the sun and to the solar system .  as a rough rule of thumb  the denser materials sank to the bottom of the condensing clump of matter that we now inhabit  and the lighter ones floated to the top .  of course there was  and still is  a lot more going on than that  so the earth is not just a series of concentric shells of lighter and lighter matter  but the general distribution of solids  liquids  and gases makes sense if you think about it that way .  and so  as the molten rocks of earth began to cool and solidify  the nascent planet found itself already enveloped in a primordial atmosphere .   it was almost certainly very different from the atmosphere today  which is a mixture of gases  the main ones being the elements nitrogen  oxygen and the inert gas argon  and the compounds carbon dioxide and water  in the form of vapour  .  the primordial atmosphere also differed considerably from the gas cloud out of which it condensed     it wasn t just a representative sample of what was around .  there are several reasons for this .  one is that a solid planet and a gas cloud retain different gases .  another is that a solid planet can generate gases  by chemical or even nuclear reactions  or by other physical processes  which can escape from its interior into its atmosphere .   the early cloud was rich in hydrogen and helium  the lightest of elements .  the speed with which a molecule moves becomes slower as the molecule gets heavier     a molecule with one hundred times the mass moves at about one tenth the speed .  anything that moves faster than the earth s escape velocity  about   miles per second     km sec   can overcome the planet s gravity and disappear into space .  molecules in the atmosphere whose molecular weight     what you get by adding up the atomic weights of the component atoms     is less than about    should therefore disappear into the void .  hydrogen has molecular weight    helium    so neither of these otherwise abundant gases should be expected to hang around .  the most abundant molecules in the primal gas cloud  with molecular weight greater than     are methane  ammonia  water  and neon .  this is similar to what we find today on the gas giants jupiter  saturn  uranus  and neptune  except that they are more massive  so have a greater escape velocity  and can retain lighter gases such as hydrogen and helium as well .  we can t be certain that the earth of   billion years ago possessed a methane ammonia atmosphere  because we don t know exactly how the primal gas cloud condensed  but it is clear that if the ancient earth ever possessed such an atmosphere  it lost nearly all of it .  today there is little methane or ammonia  and what there is has a biological origin .   shortly after the earth was formed  the atmosphere contained very little oxygen .  around   billion years ago  the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere increased to about    .  the most likely cause of this change     though perhaps not the only one     was the evolution of photosynthesis .  at some stage  probably around   billion years ago  bacteria in the oceans evolved the trick of using the energy of sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen .  plants use the same trick today  and they use the same molecules as one of the early bacteria did  chlorophyll .  animals proceed in pretty much the opposite direction  they power themselves by using oxygen to burn food  producing carbon dioxide instead of using it up .  those early photosynthesizing bacteria used the sugar for energy  and multiplied rapidly  but to them the oxygen was just a form of toxic waste  which bubbled up into the atmosphere .  the oxygen level then stayed roughly constant until about     million years ago  when it underwent a rapid increase to the current level of     .   the amount of oxygen in today s atmosphere is far greater than could ever be sustained without the influence of living creatures  which not only produce oxygen in huge quantities but use it up again  in particular locking it up in carbon dioxide .  it is startling how far  out of balance  the atmosphere is  compared to what would happen if life were suddenly removed and only inorganic chemical processes could act .  the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is dynamic  it can change on a timescale that by geological standards is extremely rapid  a matter of centuries rather than millions of years .  for example  if some disaster occurred which killed off all the plants but left all the animals  then the proportion of oxygen would halve in about     years  to the level on mountain peaks in the andes today .  the same goes for the scenario of  nuclear winter  introduced by carl sagan  in which clouds of dust thrown into the atmosphere by a nuclear war stop most of the sunlight from reaching the ground .  in this case  plants may still eke out some kind of existence  but they don t photosynthesize  they do use oxygen  though  and so do the microorganisms that break down dead plants .   the same screening effect could also occur if there were unusual numbers of active volcanoes  or if a big meteorite or comet hit the earth .  when comet shoemaker levy   hit jupiter in       the impact was equivalent to half a million hydrogen bombs .   the  budget  of income and expenditure for oxygen  and the associated but distinct budget for carbon  is still not understood .  this is an enormously important question because it is vital background to the debate about global warming .  human activities  such as electrical power plants  industry  use of cars  or simply going about one s usual business and breathing while one does so  generate carbon dioxide .  carbon dioxide is a  greenhouse gas  which traps incoming sunlight like the glass of a greenhouse .  so if we produce too much carbon dioxide  the planet should warm up .  this would have undesirable consequences  ranging from floods in low lying regions such as bangladesh to big changes in the geographical ranges of insects  which could inflict serious damage on crops .  the question is  do these human activities actually increase the earth s carbon dioxide  or does the planet compensate in some way .  the answer makes the difference between imposing major restrictions on how people in developed  and developing  countries live their lives  and letting them continue along their current paths .  the current consensus is that there are clear  though subtle  signs that human activities do increase the carbon dioxide levels  which is why major international treaties have been signed to reduce carbon dioxide output .   actually taking that action  rather than just promising to do so  may prove to be a different matter altogether .    the difficulties involved in being sure are many .  we don t have good records of past levels of carbon dioxide  so we lack a suitable  benchmark  against which to assess today s levels  although we re beginning to get a clearer picture thanks to ice cores drilled up from the arctic and antarctic  which contain trapped samples of ancient atmospheres .  if  global warming  is under way  it need not show up as an increase in temperature anyway  so the name is a bit silly  .  what it shows up as is climatic disturbance .  so even though the six warmest summers in britain this century have all occurred in the nineties  we can t simply conclude that  it s getting warmer   and hence that global warming is a fact .  the global climate varies wildly anyway     what would it be doing if we weren t here .   a project known as biosphere   attempted to sort out the basic science of oxygen carbon transactions in the global ecosystem by setting up a  closed  ecology     a system with no inputs  beyond sunlight  and no outputs whatsoever .  in form it was like a gigantic futuristic garden centre  with plants  insects  birds  mammals  and people living inside it .  the idea was to keep the ecology working by choosing a design in which everything was recycled .   the project quickly ran into trouble  in order to keep it running  it was necessary to keep adding oxygen .  the investigators therefore assumed that somehow oxygen was being lost .  this turned out to be true  in a way  but for nowhere near as literal a reason .  even though the whole idea was to monitor chemical and other changes in a closed system  the investigators hadn t weighed how much carbon they d introduced at the start .  there were good reasons for the omission     mostly  it s extremely difficult  since you have to estimate carbon content from the wet weight of live plants .  not knowing how much carbon was really there to begin with  they couldn t keep track of what was happening to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide .  however   missing  oxygen ought to show up as increased carbon dioxide  and they could monitor the carbon dioxide level and see that it wasn t going up .   eventually it turned out that the  missing  oxygen wasn t escaping from the building  it was being turned into carbon dioxide .  so why didn t they see increased carbon dioxide levels .  because  unknown to anybody  carbon dioxide was being absorbed by the building s concrete as it  cured  .  every architect knows that this process goes on for ten years or so after concrete has set  but this knowledge is irrelevant to architecture .  the experimental ecologists knew nothing about it at all  because esoteric properties of poured concrete don t normally feature in ecology courses  but to them the knowledge was vital .   behind the unwarranted assumptions that were made about biosphere   was a plausible but irrational belief that because carbon dioxide uses up oxygen when it is formed  then carbon dioxide is opposite to oxygen .  that is  oxygen counts as a credit in the oxygen budget  but carbon dioxide counts as a debit .  so when carbon dioxide disappears from the books  it is interpreted as a debt cancelled  that is  a credit .  actually  however  carbon dioxide contains a positive quantity of oxygen  so when you lose carbon dioxide you lose oxygen too .  but since what you re looking for is an increase in carbon dioxide  you won t notice if some of it is being lost .   the fallacy of this kind of reasoning has far wider importance than the fate of biosphere   .  an important example within the general frame of the carbon oxygen budget is the role of rainforests .  in brazil  the rainforests of the amazon are being destroyed at an alarming rate by bulldozing and burning .  there are many excellent reasons to prevent this continuing     loss of habitat for organisms  production of carbon dioxide from burning trees  destruction of the culture of native indian tribes  and so on .  what is not a good reason  though  is the phrase that is almost inevitably trotted out  to the effect that the rainforests are the  lungs of the planet  .  the image here is that the  civilized  regions    that is  the industrialized ones     are net producers of carbon dioxide .  the pristine rainforest  in contrast  produces a gentle but enormous oxygen breeze  while absorbing the excess carbon dioxide produced by all those nasty people with cars .  it must do  surely .  a forest is full of plants  and plants produce oxygen .   no  they don t .  the net oxygen production of a rainforest is  on average  zero .  trees produce carbon dioxide at night  when they are not photosynthesizing .  they lock up oxygen and carbon into sugars  yes     but when they die  they rot  and release carbon dioxide .  forests can indirectly remove carbon dioxide by removing carbon and locking it up as coal or peat  and by releasing oxygen into the atmosphere .  ironically  that s where a lot of the human production of carbon dioxide comes from     we dig it up and burn it again  using up the same amount of oxygen .   if the theory that oil is the remains of plants from the carboniferous period is true  then our cars are burning up carbon that was once laid down by plants .  even if an alternative theory  growing in popularity  is true  and oil was produced by bacteria  then the problem remains the same .  either way  if you burn a rainforest you add a one off surplus of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere  but you do not also reduce the earth s capacity to generate new oxygen .  if you want to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide permanently  and not just cut short term emissions  the best bet is to build up a big library at home  locking carbon into paper  or put plenty of asphalt on roads .  these don t sound like  green  activities  but they are .  you can cycle on the roads if it makes you feel better .   another important atmospheric component is nitrogen .  it is a lot easier to keep track of the nitrogen budget .  organisms     plants especially  as every gardener knows     need nitrogen for growth  but they can t just absorb it from the air .  it has to be  fixed      that is  combined into compounds that organisms can use .  some of the fixed nitrogen is produced as nitric acid  which rains down after thunderstorms  but most nitrogen fixation is biological .  many simple lifeforms  fix  nitrogen  using it as a component of their own amino acids .  these amino acids can then be used in everybody else s proteins .     the earth s oceans contain a huge quantity of water     about a third of a billion cubic miles    .   billion cubic km  .  how much water there was in the earliest stages of the earth s evolution  and how it was distributed over the surface of the globe  we have little idea  but the existence of fossils from about   .   billion years ago shows that there must have been water around at that time  probably quite a lot .  as we ve already explained  the earth     along with the rest of the solar system  sun included     condensed from a vast cloud of gas and dust  whose main constituent was hydrogen .  hydrogen combines readily with oxygen to form water  but it also combines with carbon to form methane and with nitrogen to form ammonia .   the primitive earth s atmosphere contained a lot of hydrogen and a fair quantity of water vapour  but initially the planet was too hot for liquid water to exist .  as the planet slowly cooled  its surface passed a critical temperature  the boiling point of water .  that temperature was probably not exactly the same as the one at which water boils now  in fact even today it s not one inflexible temperature  because the boiling point of water depends on pressure and other circumstances .  nor was it just a simple matter of the atmosphere s getting colder  its composition also changed because the earth was spouting out gases from its interior through volcanic activity .   a crucial factor was the influence of sunlight  which split some of the atmospheric water vapour into oxygen and hydrogen .  the hydrogen escaped from the earth s relatively weak gravitational field  so the proportion of oxygen got bigger while that of water vapour got smaller .  the effect of this was to increase the temperature at which the water vapour could condense .  so as the temperature of the atmosphere slowly fell  the temperature at which water vapour would condense rose to meet it .  eventually the atmosphere going down passed the boiling point of water going up  and water vapour began to condense into liquid water  .  .  .  and to fall as rain .   it must have absolutely bucketed down .   when the rain hit the hot rocks beneath  it promptly evaporated back into vapour  but as it did so it cooled the rocks .  heat and temperature are not the same .  heat is equivalent to energy  when you heat something  you input extra energy .  temperature is one of the ways in which that energy can be expressed  it is the vibration of molecules .  the faster those vibrations are  the higher the temperature .  ordinarily  the temperature of a substance goes up if you heat it  all the extra heat is expressed as more vibration of the molecules .  however  at transitions from solid to liquid  or liquid to vapour or gas  the extra heat goes into changing the state of the substance  not into making its temperature higher .  so you can throw in a lot of heat and instead of the stuff getting hotter  it changes state     a so called phase transition .  conversely  when a substance cools through a phase transition  it gives off a lot of heat .  so the cooling water vapour put more heat back into the upper atmosphere  from which it could be radiated away into space and lost .  when the hot rocks turned the water back into vapour  the rocks got a lot cooler very suddenly .  in a geologically short space of time  the rocks had cooled below the boiling point of water  and now the falling rain no longer got turned back into vapour     at least  not much of it did .   it may well have rained for a million years .  so it s not surprising that rincewind noticed that it was a bit wet .   thanks to gravity  water goes downhill  so all that rain accumulated in the lowest depressions in the earth s irregular surface .  because the atmosphere had a lot of carbon dioxide in it  those early oceans contained a lot of dissolved carbon dioxide  making the water slightly acidic .  there may have been hydrochloric and sulphuric acids too .  the acid ate away at the surface rocks  causing minerals to dissolve in the oceans  the sea began to get salty .   at first the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere increased slowly  because the effect of incoming sunlight isn t particularly dramatic .  but now life got in on the act  bubbling off oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis .  the oxygen combined with any remaining hydrogen in the atmosphere  whether on its own or combined inside methane  to produce more water .  this also fell as rain  and increased the amount of ocean  leading to more bacteria  more oxygen     and so it continued until the available hydrogen pretty much ran out .   originally it used to be thought that the oceans just kept dissolving the rocks of the continents  accumulating more and more minerals  getting saltier and saltier until the amount of salt reached its current value of about   .    .  the evidence for this is the percentage of salt in the blood of fishes and mammals  which is about    .  in effect  it was believed that fish and mammal blood were  fossilized  ocean .  today we are still often told that we have ancient seas in our blood .  this is probably wrong  but the argument is far from settled .  it is true that our blood is salty  and so is the sea  but there are plenty of ways for biology to adjust salt content .  that    may just be whatever level of salt makes best sense for the creature whose blood it is .  salt     more properly  the ions of sodium and chlorine into which it decomposes     have many biological uses  our nervous systems  for instance  wouldn t work without them .  so while it is entirely believable that evolution took advantage of the existence of salt in the sea  it need not be stuck with the same proportion .  on the other hand  there is good reason to think that cells first evolved as tiny free floating organisms in the oceans  and those early cells weren t sophisticated enough to fight against a difference in salt concentration between their insides and their outsides  so they may well have settled on the same concentration because that was all they could initially manage     and having done so  they were rather stuck with it .   can we decide by taking a more careful look at the oceans .  oceans have ways to lose salt as well as gaining it .  seas can dry out  the dead sea in israel is a famous example .  there are salt mines all over the place  relics of ancient dried up seas .  and just as living creatures     bacteria     took out carbon dioxide  turning it into oxygen and sugar  so they can take out other dissolved minerals too .  calcium  carbon and oxygen go into shells  for instance  which fall to the ocean floor when their owner dies .  the clincher is  .  .  .  time .  the oceans are thought to have reached their current composition  and in particular their current degree of saltiness  about   to   .   billion years ago .  the evidence is the chemical composition of sedimentary rocks     rocks formed from deposits of shells and other hard parts of organisms     which seems not to have changed much in the interim .   though in      paul knauth presented evidence that the early ocean may have been more salty than it is now  with somewhere between   .   to   times as much salt .  his calculations indicate that salt could not have been deposited on the continents until about   .   billion years ago .   simple calculations based on how much material dissolves in rivers and how fast rivers flow show that the entire salt content of the oceans can be supplied from dissolved continental rocks in twelve million years     the twinkling of a geological eye .  if salt had just built up steadily  the oceans would now be far more salt than water so the oceans are not simply sinks for dissolved minerals  one way streets into which minerals flow and get trapped .  they are mineral processing machines .  the geological evidence of the similarity of ancient and modern sedimentary rocks suggests that the inflow and the outflow pretty much balance each other .   so do we have ancient seas in our blood .  in a way .  the proportions of magnesium  calcium  potassium  and sodium are exactly the same as they were in the ancient seas from which our blood may have evolved     but cells seem to prefer a salt concentration of     not    .       nineteen   there is a tide  .  .  .      he s right about the rain   said the senior wrangler  who was at the omniscope .   you ve got clouds again .  and there s lots of volcanoes .     i mmoving him on further  .  .  .  oh .  now he says it s dark and cold and he s got a headache  .  .  .     not very graphic  is it .   said the dean .   he says it s a splitting headache .   hex wrote something .    oh   said ponder  he s under water .  i m sorry about that  i m afraid he s a little hard to position accurately .  we re still not sure what size he should be .  how s this .    the trumpet rattled   he s still under water  but he says he can see the surface .  i think that s as good as we re going to get .  just walk forward .    as one wizard  they turned to watch the suit .  it hung in the air  a few inches above the floor .  as they watched  the figure inside made hesitant walking motions .     it was not a nice day .   it was still raining  although it had slackened off recently  with sporadic outbreaks during the early part of the millennium and scattered showers during the last couple of decades .  now ten thousand rivers were finding their way to the sea .  the light was grey and gave the beach a flat  monochrome  and certainly very damp look .   whole religions have been inspired by the sight of a figure emerging  miraculously  from the sea .  it would be hard to guess at what strange cult might be inspired by the thing now trudging out of the waves  although avoidance of strong drink and certainly of seafood would probably be high on its list of  don ts  .   rincewind looked around .   there was no sand underfoot .  the water sucked at an expanse of rough lava .  there was no seaweed  no seabirds  no little crabs     nothing potentially dangerous at all .    there s not a lot going on   he said .   it s all rather dull .     it ll be dawn in a moment   said bonder s voice in his ear .   we ll be interested to see what you think of it .    strange way of putting it  rincewind thought  as he watched the sun come up .  it was hidden behind the clouds  but a greyish yellow light picked its way across the landscape .    it s all right   he said .   the sky s a dirty colour .  where is this .  llamedos .  hergen .  where aren t there any seashells .  is this high tide .      all the wizards were trying to speak at once .    i can t think of everything  sir .     but everyone knows about tides .     perhaps some mechanism for raising and lowering the sea bed would be acceptable .     if it comes to that  what causes tides here .     can we all please stop shouting .    the babble died down .    good   said ridcully .   over to you  mister stibbons .    stibbons stared at the notes in front of him .    i m  .  .  .  there s  .  .  .  it s a puzzler  sir .  on a round world the sea just sits there .  there s no edge for it to pour off .     it s always been believed that the sea is in some way attracted to the moon   the senior wrangler mused .   you know  .  .  .  the attraction of serene beauty and so on .    dead silence fell .   finally  ponder managed   no one said anything to me about a moon .     you ve got to have a moon   said ridcully .    it should be easy  shouldn t it .   said the dean .   our moon goes around the disc .     but where can we put it .   said ponder .   it s got to be light and dark  we ve got to move it for phases  and it s got to be almost as big as the sun and we know that if you try to make things sun sized here they  well  become suns .     our moon is closer than the sun   said the dean .   that s why we get eclipses .     only about ninety miles   said ponder that s why it s burned black on one side .     dear me  mister stibbons  i m surprised at you   said ridcully .   the damn great sun looks pretty big even though it s a long way away .  put the moon nearer .     we ve still got the big lump that the dean knocked out of the planet   said the senior wrangler .   i made the students park it around the target .     target .   said ponder .    it s the big fat planet with the coloured lines on   said the senior wrangler  i made them bring the whole lot out to the new  er  sun because frankly they were a nuisance where they were .  at least when they re spinning round you know where they re coming from .     are the students still sneaking in here at night to play games .   said ridcully .    i ve put a stop to that   said the dean .   there s too many rocks and snowballs around this sun in any case .  masses of the things .  such a waste .     well  can we get the lost lump here soon .     hex can manipulate time from rincewind s point of view   said ponder .   for us  project time is very fast  .  .  .  we should get it here before the coffee arrives .       can you hear me  rincewind .     yes .  any chance of some lunch .     we re getting you some sandwiches .  now  can you see the sun properly .     it s all very hazy  but yes .     can you tell me what happens if i do  .  .  .  this .    rincewind squinted into the grey sky .  shadows were racing across the landscape .    you re not going to tell me you ve just caused an eclipse of the sun  are you .    rincewind could hear faint cheering in the background .    and you re quite certain it s an eclipse .   said ponder .    what else is it .  a black disc is covering the sun and there s no birdsong .     is it about the right size .     what kind of question is that .     all right  all right .  ah  here are your san     what .  how .  excuse me  .  .  .  now what .   .  .  .    the senior wizards were puzzled again  and demonstrated this by prodding ponder while he was trying to talk .  the wizards were great ones for the prod as a means of getting attention .    you can see there s only one moon   said the senior wrangler  for the third time .    all right  .  .  .  how about this .   said ponder .   let us suppose that in some way this world has got both water that likes moons and water that can t stand moons at any price .  if it s got about the same amount of both  then that at least explains why there seem to be high tides on both sides at once .  i think we can dispose of the invisible moon theory  interesting though it was  dean .     i like that explanation   said ridcully .   it is elegant  mister stibbons .     it s only a guess  sir .     good enough for physics   said ridcully .       twenty   a giant leap for moonkind    humanity has always known the moon is important .  it often comes out at night  which is useful  it changes  in a sky where change is rare  some of us believe our ancestors live there .  that last one might not be capable of experimental verification  but nevertheless humanity in general got it right .  the moon reaches out ghostly tentacles  gravity and light  it may even be our protector .   the wizards are right to worry that they ve forgotten to give roundworld a moon  though as usual they re worried for the wrong reasons .   the moon is a satellite of the earth  we go round the sun  but the moon goes round us .  it s been up there for a long time  and in its quiet way it s been exceedingly busy .  the moon affects people as well as baby turtles .  the main way it affects us is by causing tides .  it may affect us in other  less obvious ways  although many common beliefs about the moon are  to say the least  scientifically controversial .  the female menstrual cycle repeats roughly every four weeks  much the same time that it takes the moon to go round the earth     one month  in fact  a word that comes from  moon  .  in popular belief this numerical similarity is no coincidence  as for example in  the wrong time of the month  .  on the other hand  the moon is the epitome of regularity  as predictable as the date of christmas day  which cannot be said of the menstrual cycle .   lovers  of course  swoon and spoon beneath the moon in june  .  .  .  it is also widely held that people go mad when there is a full moon     or  a more extreme type of madness     those who are suitably afflicted turn into wolves for a night .   the werewolf legend plays a central role in men at arms .  most of the time lance constable angua of the ankh morpork city watch is a well built ash blonde  but when the moon is full she turns into a wolf who can smell colours and rip out people s jugular veins .  but it does play havoc with her private life .   it was always a problem  growing fangs and hair every full moon .  just when she thought she d been lucky before  she d found that few men are happy in a relationship where their partner grows hair and howls .   fortunately corporal carrot is unperturbed by these occasional changes .  he likes a girlfriend who enjoys long walks .   the moon is unusual  and it is quite likely that without it  none of us would be here at all .  not because of the alleged effect on lovers  who find a way moon or no  but because the moon protects the earth from some nasty influences that might have made it difficult for life to have arisen  or at least to have got beyond the most rudimentary forms .  what makes the moon unusual is not that it is a companion to a planet  all of the planets except mercury and venus have moons .  it is remarkable because it is so big in comparison to its parent planet .  only pluto has a satellite     charon  discovered in      by jim christy     that is comparable in relative size to our moon .  it s not stretching things much to say that we live on one half of a double planet .   we know the moon is very different from the earth in all sorts of ways .  its gravity is weaker  so it wouldn t be able to keep an atmosphere for very long  even if it had one  which it doesn t by any sensible use of the term .  the moon s surface is rock and rock dust  with no seas anywhere  water easily escapes too      although in      nasa probes discovered substantial quantities of water ice at the moon s poles  hidden from the warmth of the sun by the permanent shadows of crater walls .  that s good news for future lunar colonies  which could act as bases for the exploration of the solar system .  the moon is a good place to start from  because your spaceship doesn t need much fuel to escape the moon s pull  the earth is of course a bad place to start from  because down here gravity is so much stronger .  how typical of humans to have evolved in the wrong place  .  .  .   how was the moon formed .  did it condense out of the primal dustclouds along with the earth .  did it form separately and get captured later .  are the craters extinct volcanoes  or are they marks made by lumps of rock smashing into the moon .  we know rather more about the moon than we do about most other bodies in the solar system  because we ve been there .  in april       neil armstrong stepped down on to the surface of the moon  fluffed his lines  and made history .  between      and      the united states sent ten apollo missions to the moon and back .  of these  apollos      and    were never intended to land  apollo    was that historic first landing  and apollo    never made it down to the surface  suffering a disastrous explosion early in its flight and turning into an excellent movie .   the rest of apollos       landed  and between them they brought back     lb      kg  of moon rock .  most of it is still stored in the lunar curatorial facility in nasa s johnson space center at clear lake  houston  a lot of it has never been seriously looked at at all  but what has been analysed has taught us a lot about the origins and nature of the moon .   the moon is about a quarter of a million miles          km  from the earth .  it is less dense than the earth  on average  but the moon s density is very similar to that of the earth s mantle  a curious fact that may not be coincidence .  the same side of the moon always faces the earth  though it wobbles a bit .  the dark markings on it are called maria     latin for  seas   but they re not .  they re flattish plains of rock which at one time was molten and flowed across the lunar surface like lava from a volcano .  nearly all of the craters are impact craters  where meteorites have smashed into the moon .  there are lots of them because there s a lot of rocks floating about in space  the moon has no atmosphere to shield it by burning up the rocks through frictional heating  and the moon has no weather to grind them back down again until they disappear .  the earth s atmosphere is a pretty good shield  but once geologists started looking they found remains of     impact craters down here  which is interesting given that a lot of them will have eroded away in the wind and the rain .  but more of that when we get to dinosaurs .   today the moon always turns the same face to the earth  which means that it rotates once round its axis every month  the same time that it takes to revolve around the earth .   if it didn t rotate at all  it would always be pointing in the same direction     not the same direction relative to the earth  but the same direction period .  imagine someone walking round you in a circle but always facing north  say .  then they don t always face you .  in fact  you see all sides of them .   it wasn t always like this .  over hundreds of millions of years  the effect of tides has been to slow down the rotation rates of both earth and moon .  once the moon s rotation became synchronized with its revolutions round the earth  the system stabilized .  the moon also used to be quite a bit closer to the earth  but over long periods of time it has moved further and further out .     between      and      three theories of the formation of the moon came into vogue and out again .  one was that the moon had formed at the same time as the earth when the dustcloud condensed to form the solar system     sun  planets  satellites  the whole ball of wax  .  .  .  or rock  anyway .  this theory  like early theories of the solar system s formation  falls foul of angular momentum .  the earth is spinning too fast  and the moon is revolving too fast  to be consistent with the moon condensing from a dustcloud .   we misled you earlier when we said that the dustcloud theory explained the satellites too .  mostly it does  but not our enigmatic moon .  lies to children  you see     now you re ready for the next layer of complication .    theory two was that the moon is a piece of the earth that broke away  maybe when the earth was still completely molten and spinning rather fast .  that theory bounced into the bin because nobody could find a pkusible way for a spinning molten earth to eject anything that would remotely resemble the moon  even if you waited a bit for things to cool down .   according to theory three  the moon formed elsewhere in the solar system  and was wandering along when it happened to come within the earth s gravitational clutches and couldn t get out again .  this theory was very popular  even though gravitational capture is distinctly tricky to arrange .  it s a bit like trying to throw a golfball into the hole so that it goes round and round just inside the rim .  what usually happens is that it falls to the bottom  collides with the earth  or does what every golfer has experienced to their utter horror  and goes in for a split second before climbing back out again  escapes without being captured  .   the rock samples from apollo missions added to the mystery of the moon s origins .  in some respects  moon rock is astonishingly similar to earth rock .  if they were similar in most respects  this would be evidence for a common origin  and we d have to take another look at the theory that they both condensed from the same dustcloud .  but moon rock doesn t resemble all earth rock  only the mantle .  the current theory  which dates from the early     s  is that the moon was once part of the earth s mantle .  it wasn t ejected as a result of the earth s spin  it was knocked into space about four billion years ago when a giant body  about the size of mars  struck the early earth a glancing blow .  computer calculations show that such an impact can  if conditions are right  strip a large chunk of mantle from the earth  and sort of smear it out into space .  this takes about    minutes  aren t computers good .   .  then the ejected mantle  which is molten  begins to condense into a ring of rocks of various sizes .  some of it forms a big lump  the proto moon  and this quickly sweeps up most of the rest .  what s left doesn t go away so easily  however  but over     million years nearly all of it crashes into either the moon or the earth  because of gravity .   the first simulations to support this theory of the moon   s formation suffered from some problems  in particular  they dated the impact very early in the earth   s formation  in order to get the moon   s angular momentum right .  but if the collision had occurred that early  then the moon would have accumulated a lot of iron from later impacts  just as the earth did .  however  there is little iron on  or in  the moon .  more recent work shows that a rather later impact could also give the moon the correct angular momentum  and avoids this difficult .  however  it predicts that about     of the impacting body would have ended up on the moon .  in order for the moon to resemble earth   s mantle as closely as it does  the impacting body would also have had to resemble the earth   s mantle .   this line of reasoning may be losing the plot  though  because it was that very resemblance that needed explanation in the first place  and gave rise to the giant impact theory of the moon   s formation .  anything that explains why the impactor was like the mantle  such as  it was formed at the same distance from the sun as the earth did    can probably explain why the moon is like the mantle  without an impactor being needed .  maybe both the moon and the earth   s mantle were splashed off something else by an impact .   because earth has weather     especially back then  oh boy  did it have weather then     the resulting impact craters all got eroded away  but because the moon has no weather  the lunar impact craters didn t get eroded away  and a lot of them are still there now .  the great charm of this theory is that it explains many different features of the moon in one go     its similarity to the earth s mantle  the fact that its surface seems to have undergone a sudden and extreme amount of heating about   billion years ago  its craters  its size  its spin     even those sea like maria  released as the proto moon slowly cooled .  the early solar system was a violent place .   in fact  the dean s mis designed sun might have done us some good after all  .  .  .     the moon affects life on earth in at least two or three ways that we know of  probably dozens more that we haven t yet appreciated .   the most obvious effect of the moon on the earth is the tides     a fact that the wizards are stumbling towards .  like most of science  the story of the tides is not entirely straightforward  and only loosely connected to what common sense  left to its own devices  would lead us to expect .  the common sense bit is that the moon s gravity pulls at the earth  and it pulls more strongly on the bit that is closest to the moon .  when that bit is land  nothing much happens  but when it s water     and more than half our planet s surface is ocean     it can pile up .  this explanation is a lie to children  and it doesn t agree with what actually happens .  it leads us to expect that at any given place on earth  high tide occurs when the moon is overhead  or at least at its highest point in the sky .  that would lead to one high tide every day  or  allowing for a little complexity in the earth moon system  one high tide every    hours    minutes .   actually  high tides occur twice a day     hours and    minutes apart .  exactly half the figure .   not only that  the pull of the moon s gravity at the surface of the earth is only one ten millionth of the earth s surface gravity  the pull of the sun is about half that .  even when combined together  these two forces are not strong enough to lift masses of water through heights of up to    feet    m      the biggest tidal movement on earth  occurring in the bay of fundy between nova scotia and new brunswick .   an acceptable explanation of the tides eluded humanity until isaac newton worked out the law of gravity and did the necessary calculations .  his ideas have since been refined and improved  but he had the basics .   for simplicity  ignore everything except the earth and the moon  and assume that the earth is completely made of water .  the watery earth spins on its axis  so it is subjected to centrifugal force and bulges slightly at the equator .  two other forces act on it  the earth s gravity and the moon s .  the shape that the water takes up in response to these forces depends on the fact that water is a fluid .  in normal circumstances  the surface of a standing body of water is horizontal  because if it wasn t  then the fluid on the higher bits would slosh sideways into the lower bits .  the same kind of thing happens when there are extra forces acting  the surface of the water settles at right angles to the net direction of the combined forces .   when you work out the details for the three forces we ve just mentioned  you find that the water forms an ellipsoid  a shape that is close to a sphere but very slightly elongated .  the direction of elongation points towards the moon .  however  the centre of the ellipsoid coincides with the centre of the earth  so the water  piles up  on the side furthest from the moon as well as on the side nearest it .  this change of shape is only partly caused by the moon s gravity  lifting  the water closest to it .  most of the motion  in fact  is sideways rather than upwards .  the sideways forces push more water into some regions of the oceans  and take it away from others .  the total effect is tiny     the surface of the sea rises and falls through a distance of    inches  half a metre  .   the coast  where land meets sea  is what creates the big tidal movements .  most of the water is moving sideways  not up  and its motion is affected by the shape of the coastline .  in some places the water flows into a narrowing funnel  and then it piles up much more than it does elsewhere .  this is what happens in the bay of fundy .  this effect is made even bigger because coastal waters are shallow  so the energy of the moving water gets concentrated into a thinner layer  creating bigger and faster movements .   finally  let s put the sun back .  this has the same kind of effect as the moon  but smaller .  when sun and moon are aligned     either both on the same side of the earth  in which case we see a new moon  or both on opposite sides  full moon      their gravitational pulls reinforce each other  leading to so called  spring tides  in which high tide is higher than normal and low tide is lower .  these have nothing to do with the season spring .  when the sun and moon are at right angles as seen from earth  at half moon  the sun s pull cancels out part of the moon s  leading to  neap tides  with less movement than normal  these presumably have nothing to do with the season neap  .  .  .   .   by putting all these effects together  and keeping good records of past tides  it is possible to predict the times of high and low tide  and the amount of vertical movement  anywhere on earth .   there are similar tidal effects  large  on the earth s atmosphere  and  small  on the planet s land masses .  tidal effects occur on other bodies in the solar system  and beyond .  it is thought that jupiter s moon lo  whose surface is mostly sulphur and which has numerous active volcanoes  is heated by being  squeezed  repeatedly by tidal effects from jupiter .     another effect of the moon on the earth  discovered in the mid    s by jaques laskar  is to stabilize the earth s axis .  the earth spins like a top  and at any given moment there is a line running through the centre of the earth around which everything else rotates .  this is its axis .  the earth s axis is tilted relative to the plane in which the earth orbits the sun  and this tilt is what causes the seasons .  sometimes the north pole is closer to the sun than the south pole is  and six months later it s the other way round .  when the northern end of the axis is tilted towards the sun  more sunlight falls on the northern half of the planet than on the southern half  so the north gets summer and the south gets winter .  six months later  when the axis points the other way relative to the sun  the reverse applies .   over longer periods of time  the axis changes direction .  just as a top wobbles when it spins  so does the earth  and over        years its axis completes one full circle of wobble .  at every stage  however  the axis is tilted at the same angle        away from the perpendicular to the orbital plane .  this motion is called precession  and it has a small effect on the timing of the seasons     they slowly shift by a total of one year in        .  harmless  basically .  however  the axes of most other planets do something far more drastic  they change their angle to the orbital plane .  mars  for example  probably changes this angle by      over a period of       million years .  this has a dramatic effect on climate .   suppose that a planet s axis is at right angles to the orbital plane .  then there are no seasonal variations at all  but everywhere except the poles there is a day night cycle  with equal amounts of day and night .  now tilt the axis a little  seasonal variations appear  and the days are longer in summer and shorter in winter .  suppose that the axis tilts       so that at some instant the north pole  say  points directly at the sun .  half a year later  the south pole points at the sun .  at either pole  there is a  day  of half a year followed by a  night  of half a year .  the seasons coincide with the day night cycle .  regions of the planet bake in high heat for half a year  then freeze for the other half .  although life can survive in such circumstances  it may be harder for it to get going in the first place  and it may be more vulnerable to extremes of climate  vulcanism  or meterorite impacts .   the earth s axis can change its angle of tilt over very long periods of time  much longer than the        year cycle of precession  but even over hundreds of millions of years the angle doesn t change much .  why .  because  as laskar discovered when he did the calculations  the moon helps keep the earth s axis steady .  so it is at least conceivable that life on earth owes quite a lot to the calming influence of its sister world  however much it may madden us individually .   a third influence of the moon was discovered in       a clear association between tides and the rate of growth of trees .  ernst z  rcher and maria giulia cantiani measured the diameters of young spruce trees grown in containers in the dark .  over periods of several days the diameters changed in step with the tides .  the scientists interpret this as an effect of the moon s gravity on the transport of water within the tree .  it can t be variations in moonlight  which would perhaps affect photosynthesis  because the trees were grown in darkness .  but the effect may be similar to one that occurs with creatures that live on the seashore .  because they evolved to live there  they have to respond to the tides  and evolution sometimes achieves this by creating an internal dynamic that runs in step with the tides .  if you remove the creatures to the laboratory  this internal dynamic makes them continue to  follow  the tides .   the moon has been important in another way .  the babylonians and greeks knew that the moon is a sphere  the phases are obvious  and there is also a slight wobble which means that  over time  humans see rather more than one half of the moon s surface .  there it was  hanging in the sky     a big ball  not a disc like the sun  and a hint that perhaps  big balls in space  is a much better way of thinking about the earth and its neighbours than  lights in the sky  .   all this is a long way from lance constable angua     even a long way from the female menstrual cycle .  but it shows how much we are creatures of the universe .  things up there really do affect us down here  every day of our lives .       moreover  until the last few decades of human history  most women did not cycle .  nearly all the time  they were either pregnant or lactating .  and for the great apes  the cycle is a week or so longer than for humans  and for gibbons it   s shorter .  so it looks as though the relation with the moon is coincidental .       twenty one   the light you see the dark by    there was no dark .  this came as such a shock to ponder stibbons that he made hex look again .  there had to be dark  surely .  otherwise  what was there for the light to show up against .   eventually  he reported this lack to the other wizards .    there should be lots of dark and there isn t   he said flatly .  there s just light and  .  .  .  no light .  and it s a pretty strange light  too .     in what way .   said the archchancellor .    well  sir  as you know   there s ordinary light  which travels at about the same speed as sound  .   .   .      that s right .  you ve only got to watch shadows across a landscape to realize that .     quite  sir  .  .  .  and then there s meta light  which doesn t really travel at all because it is already everywhere .     otherwise we wouldn t even be able to see darkness   said the senior wrangler .    exactly .  but the project universe has just got the one sort of light .  hex thinks it moves at hundreds of thousands of miles a second .     what use is that .     er  .   .   .  in this universe  that s as fast as you can go .     that s nonsense  because        ridcully began  but ponder held up a hand .  he had not been looking forward to this one .    please  archchancellor .  it s doing the best it can .  just trust me on this one .  please .  yes  i can see all the reasons why it s impossible .  but  in there  it seems to work .  hex has written pages of stuff about it  if anyone s interested .  just don t ask me about any of it .  please  gentlemen .  it s all supposed to be logical but you ll find your brain squeaking around until the ends point out of your ears .    he placed his hands together and tried to look wise .    it really is almost as if the project is aping the real universe          ook .     i beg your pardon   said ponder .   a figure of speech .    the librarian nodded at him and knuckled his way across the floor .  the wizards watched him carefully .    you really believe that that thing   said the dean  pointing   with its moon hating water and worlds that go around suns          as far as i can see from this   interrupted the senior wrangler  who d been reading hex s write out on the more complex physics of the project   if you were travelling in a cart at the speed of light  and threw a ball ahead of you  .  .  .   he turned over the page  read on silently for a moment  creased his brows  turned the page over to see if any enlightenment was to be found on the other side  and went on   .  .  .  your twin brother would  .  .  .  be fifty years older than you when you got home  .  .  .  i think .     twins are the same age   said the dean  coldly .   that s why they are twins .     look at the world we re working on  sir   said ponder .   it could be thought of as two turtle shells tied together .  it s got no top and bottom but if you think of it as two worlds  bent around  with one sun and moon doing the work of two  .  .  .  it s similar .    he fried in their gaze .    in a way  anyway   he said .   unnoticed by the others  the bursar picked up the write out on the physics of the roundworld universe .  after making himself a paper hat out of the title page  he began to read  .  .  .       a phrase meaning  i   m not sure you know this .         twenty two   things that aren t    light has a speed     so why not dark .   it s a reasonable question .  let s see where it leads .   in the     s a biological supply company advertised a device for scientists who used microscopes .  in order to see things under a microscope  it s often a good idea to make a very thin slice of whatever it is you re going to look at .  then you put the slice on a glass slide  stick it under the microscope lens  and peer in at the other end to see what it looks like .  how do you make the slice .  not like slicing bread .  the thing you want to cut     let s assume it s a piece of liver for the sake of argument  is too floppy to be sliced on its own .   come to think of it  so is a lot of bread .   you have to hold the liver firmly while you re cutting it  so you embed it in a block of wax .  then you use a gadget called a microtome  something like a miniature bacon slicer  to cut off a series of very thin slices .  you drop them on the surface of warm water  stick some on to a microscope slide  dissolve away the wax  and prepare the slide for viewing .  simple  .   .   .   but the device that the company was selling wasn t a microtome  it was something to keep the wax block cool while the microtome was slicing it  so that the heat generated by the friction would not make the wax difficult to slice and damage delicate details of the specimen .   their solution to this problem was a large concave  dish shaped  mirror .  you were supposed to build a little pile of ice cubes and  focus the cold  on to your specimen .   perhaps you don t see anything remarkable here .  in that case you probably speak of the  spread of ignorance   and draw the curtains in the evening to  keep the cold out      and the darkness .    in discworld  such things make sense .  lots of things are real in discworld while being mere abstractions in ours .  death  for example .  and dark .  on discworld you can worry about the speed of dark  and how it can get out of the way of the light that is ploughing into it at     mph .   in our world such a concept is called a  privative      an absence of something .  and in our world  privatives don t have their own existence .  knowledge does exist  but ignorance doesn t  heat and light exist  but cold and darkness don t .  not as things .   we can see the archchancellor looking puzzled  and we realize that here is something that runs quite deep in the human psyche .  yes  you can freeze to death  and  cold  is a good word for describing the absence of heat .  without privatives  we would end up talking like the pod people from the planet zog .  but we run into trouble  though  if we forget that we re using them as an easy shorthand .   in our world there are plenty of borderline cases .  is  drunk  or  sober  the privative .  in discworld you can get  knurd   which is as far on the other side of sober as drunk is on the inebriated side   but on planet earth there s no such thing .  by and large  we think we know which member of such a pairing has an existence  and which is merely an absence .   we vote for  sober  as the privative .  it is the absence of drink  and     usually     the normal state of a person .   in fact that normal state is only called sobriety when the subject of drink is at hand .  there s nothing strange about this .   cold  is the normal state of the universe  after all  even though as a thing it does not exist .  er  .  .  .  we re not going to get past you on this one  are we  archchancellor .    thinking is required if our language isn t to fool us .  however  as  focusing the cold  shows  we sometimes don t stop to think .   we ve done it before .  at the start of the book  we mentioned phlogiston  considered by early chemists to be the substance that made things burn .  it must do  you could see the phlogiston coming out as flames  for goodness  sake .  gradually  however  clues that supported the opposite view accumulated .  things weigh more after they ve burned than they did before  for instance  so phlogiston seemed to have negative weight .  you may think this is wrong  incidentally  surely the ash left by a burnt log weighs a lot less than the log  otherwise nobody would bother having bonfires .  but a lot of that log goes up in smoke  and the smoke weighs quite a bit  it rises not because it s lighter than air but because it s hot .  and even if it were lighter than air  air has weight  too .  and as well as the smoke  there s steam  and all sorts of other junk .  if you burn a lump of wood  and collect all the liquids  gases  and solids that result  the final total weighs more than the wood .   where does the extra weight come from .  well  if you take the trouble to weigh the air that surrounds the burning wood  you ll find that it ends up lighter than it was .   it s not so easy to do both of these weighings while keeping track of what came from where     think about it .  but the chemists found ways to achieve this .   so it looks as if something gets taken out of the air  and once you re realized that s what s going on  it s not hard to find out what it is .  of course  it s oxygen .  burnt wood gains oxygen  it doesn t lose phlogiston .   this all makes far more sense  and it also explains why phlogiston wasn t such a silly idea .  negative oxygen  oxygen that ought to be present but isn t  behaves just as nicely as positive oxygen in all the balancing equations that chemists used to check the validity of their theories .  so much phlogiston moving from a to b has exactly the same effect on observations as the same amount of oxygen moving from b to a .  so phlogiston behaved just like a real thing     with that embarrassing exception that when your measurements became accurate enough to detect the tiny amounts involved  phlogiston weighed less than nothing .  phlogiston was a privative .   a difficult but stubborn feature of human thinking is involved in all this  it s known as  reifying   making real .  imagining that because we have a word for something  then there must exist a  thing  that corresponds to the word .  what about  bravery  and  cowardice  .  or  tunnel  .  indeed  what about  hole  .   many scientific concepts refer to things that are not real in the everyday sense that they correspond to objects .  for instance   gravity  sounds like an explanation of planetary motion  and you vaguely wonder what it would look like if you found some  but actually it is only a word for an inverse square law attractive relationship .  or more recently  thanks to einstein  for a tendency of objects not to move in straight lines  which we can reify as  curved space  .   for that matter  what about  space  .  is that a thing  or an absence .    debt  and  overdraft  are very familiar privatives  and the thinking problems they cause are quite difficult .  after all  your overdraft pays your bank manager s salary  doesn t it .  so how can it fail to be real .  today s derivatives market buys and sells debts and promises as if they were real     and it reifies them as words and numbers on pieces of paper  or digits in a computer s memory .  the more you think about it  the more amazing the everyday world of human beings becomes  most of it doesn t actually exist at all .   some years ago  at a science fiction convention held in the hague  four writers who made lots of money from their books sat in front of an audience of mostly impecunious fans to explain how they d made huge income from their books  as if any of them really knew  .  each of them said that  money isn t important   and the fans became quite rude at this perfectly accurate statement .  it was necessary to point out that money is like air or love     unimportant if you ve got enough of it  but desperately important if you haven t .   dickens recognized this  in david copperfield mr micawber remarks  annual income twenty pounds  annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six  result happiness .  annual income twenty pounds  annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six  result misery .    there s no symmetry between having money and not having it     but the discussion had gone off the rails because everyone had assumed that there was  so that  having money  was the opposite of  having no money  .  if you must find an opposite  then  having money  is opposite to  being in debt  .  in that case   rich  is like  knurd  .  in any event  making the comparison between money  love  and air lowered the debating temperature considerably .  air isn t important if you ve got it  only if you haven t  the same goes for money .   vacuum is an interesting privative .  cut me own throat dibbler could sell vacuum on a stick .  vacuum in the right place is valuable .   many people on earth sell cold on a stick .   discworld does a marvellous job of revealing the woolly thinking behind our assumptions about absence  because in discworld privatives really do exist .  the dark light joke in discworld is silly enough that everyone gets the point     we hope .  other discworld uses of privatives  however  are more subtle .  the most dramatic  of course  is death  many people s favourite discworld character  who speaks in capital letters .  death is a seven foot tall skeleton  with tiny points of light in his eye sockets .  he carries a scythe with a blade so thin that it s transparent  and he has a flying horse called binky .  when death appears to olerve  king of sto lat  in mort  it takes the king a few moments to catch up on current events      who the hell are you .   said the king .   what are you doing here .  eh .  guards .  i deman .  .  .      the insistent message from his eyes finally battered through to his brain .  mort  was impressed .  king olerve had held on to his throne for many years and  even when dead  knew how to behave .    oh   he said .   i see .  i didn t expect to see you so soon .    your majesty  said death  bowing  few do .   the king looked around .  it was quiet and dim in this shadow world  but outside there seemed to be a lot of excitement .    that s me down there  is it .    i m afraid so  sire .    clean job .  crossbow  was it .      our earthly fears about death have led to some of our strangest reifi cations .  inventing the concept  death  is giving a name to a process     dying     as if it s a  thing  .  then  of course  we endow the thing with a whole suite of properties  whose care is known only to the priests .  that thing turns up in many guises .  it may appear as the  soul   a thing that must leave the body when it turns it from a live body into a dead one .  it is curious that the strongest believers in the soul tend to be people who denigrate material things  yet they then turn their own philosophy on its head by insisting that when an evident process     life     comes to an end  there has to be a thing that continues .  no .  when a process stops  it s no longer  there  .  when you stop beating an egg  there isn t some pseudo material essence of eggbeater that passes on to something else .  you just aren t turning the handle any more .   another  thing  that arises from the assumption that death exists is whatever must be instituted in the egg embryo foetus in order to turn it into a proper human being  who can die when required .  note that in human myth and discworld reality it is the soulless ones  vampires and their ilk  who cannot die .  long before ancient egypt and the death god anubis  priests have made capital out of this verbal confusion .  on discworld  it s entirely proper to have  unreal  things  like dark  or like the tooth fairy in hogfather  which play their part in the plot .   but it s a very strange idea indeed on planet earth .   yet it may be part of some process that makes us human beings .  as death points out in hogfather  humans seem to need to project a kind of interior decoration on to the universe  so that they spend much of the time in a world of their own making .  we seem     at least  at the moment     to need these things .  concepts like gods  truth  and soul appear to exist only in so far as humans consider them to do so  although elephants are known to get uneasy and puzzled upon finding elephant bones in the wild     whether this is because of some dim concept of the big savannah in the sky or merely because it s manifestly not a good idea to stay in a place where elephants get killed is unknown  .  but they work some magic for us .  they add narrativium to our culture .  they bring pain  hope  despair  and comfort .  they wind up our elastic .  good or bad  they ve made us into people .   we wonder if the users thought that that cold focusing mirror worked some magic for them .  we can think of several ways in which it might appear to .  and some very clever friends of ours are persuaded that souls might exist  too .  nearly everything is a process on some level .  to a physicist  matter is a process carried out by a quantum wave function .  and quantum wave functions exist only when the person you re arguing with asserts that they don t     so maybe souls exist in the same way .   in this area  we have to admit the science doesn t know everything .  science is based on not knowing everything .  but it does know some things .       and if so  congratulations .  you are a human being  thinking narratively .       light on the disc travels at about the same speed as sound .  this does not appear to cause problems .       and a terrible thing it is  akin to a state of horrible depression .  hence the affliction of captain vimes in guards .  guards .  who needs a couple of drinks simply to become sober .       well     most people .        desperate  is another privative     it means  no hope  .       death   s apprentice     well  he   d have to train a successor .  not in case he dies  so he can retire .  which he does  temporarily  in reaper man .       indeed  it is a  fundamental constant  of the discworld universe that things exist because they   re believed in .        truth  is a privative in the same way that  sober  is     until you invent lies  you don   t know what the truth is .  nature appears to  otherwise animals would not have invested so much effort on very effective camouflage .       twenty three   no possibility of life    it was difficult eating sandwiches that you couldn t see .  rincewind was aware that back in the real world the librarian was handing them to him  and he had to take it on trust that they were going to be cheese and chutney .  as it turned out  he detected a hint of banana  too .     the wizards were shocked .  it s terrible to find that you can t do what you like with your own universe .    so we can t just magic life into the project .   said the dean .   tin afraid not  sir   said ponder .   we have quite a lot of control over things  but only in a very subtle way .  i have gone into this    i don t call moving huge worlds very subtle   said the dean .    in project terms  even moving the moon into place took a hundred thousand years   said ponder .   time prefers to move faster in there .  it s amazing what you can move if you give it a little push for that long .     but we ve done so many things          just moved things around  sir .     seems a shame to have made a world and there s no one to live on it   said the senior wrangler .    when i was small  i had a model farmyard   said the bursar  looking up from his reading .    thank you  bursar .  very interesting   said the archchancellor .   all right  let s play by the rules .  what do you have to move around to get people .     well  .  .  .  bits of other people  my father told me   said the dean .    bad taste there  dean .     many religions start with dust   said the senior wrangler .   and then you bring it alive in some way .     that s pretty hard even with magic   said the archchancellor .   and we can t use magic .     up in nothingfjord they believe that all life was created when the god noddi cut off his  .  .  .  unmentionables and hurled them at the sun  who was his father   said the senior wrangler .    what  you mean his  .  .  .  underwear .   said the lecturer in recent runes  who could be a bit slow .    first of all we can t physically exist inside the project  secondly that sort of thing is unhygienic  and thirdly i doubt very much if you ll find a volunteer   said the archchancellor sharply .   anyway  we re men of magic .  that is superstition .     can we make weather  then .   said the dean .    i think hex can let us do that   said ponder .   weather is only pushing stuff around .     so we can aim lightning at anyone we don t like .     but there isn t anyone on the world  whether we like them or not   said ponder wearily .   that s the point .     and while the dean can make enemies anywhere  i think that  ah  roundworld would test even his powers   said ridcully .    thank you  archchancellor    happy to oblige  dean .    hex s keyboard clattered .  the quill pen began to write .   it began       i don t think you are going to believe this        thunderstorms tore the air apart  far out to sea .   the air blinked .  the storm was gone .  the shoreline looked different .    hey  what happened .   said rincewind .    everything all right .   said ponder stibbons in his ear .    what happened just then .     we ve moved you forward in time a little   said ponder the tone of his voice suggested that he dreaded being asked why .    why .   said rincewind .    you ll laugh when i tell you this  .  .  .     oh  good .  i like a laugh .     hex says he s detecting life all round you .  can you see anything .    rincewind looked around warily .  the sea was sucking at the shore  which had a bit of sand on it now .  scum rolled in the waves .    no   he said .    good .  you see  there can t be any life where you are   ponder went on .    where am i exactly .     er  .  .  .  a sort of magical world with no one in it but yourself      oh  you mean the sort everyone lives in   said rincewind bitterly .  he glanced at the sea again  just in case .    but if you wouldn t mind having a look  .  .  .   ponder went on .    for this life that can t possibly exist .     well  you are the professor of cruel and unusual geography .     it s the cruel and unusual geography that s bothering me   said rincewind .   incidentally  have you looked at the sea lately .  it s blue .     well .  the sea is blue .     really .      the omniscope was once again the centre of attention .    everyone knows the sea is blue   said the dean .   ask anyone .     that s right   said ridcully .   however  while everyone knows the sea is blue  what everyone usually sees is a sea that s grey or dark green .  not this colour .  this is virulent .     i d say turquoise   said the senior wrangler .    i used to have a shirt that colour   said the bursar .    i thought it might be copper salts in the water   said ponder stibbons .   but it isn t .    the archchancellor picked up hex s latest write out .  it read       out of cheese error       not helpful   he muttered .    thank goodness he s still operating the project   said ponder  joining him .   i think he s got confused .     it s not his job to be confused   said ridcully .   we don t need a machine for being confused .  we re entirely capable of confusin  ourselves .  it is a human achievement  confusion  and right at this minute i feel i am winning a prize .  you  mister stibbons  said there was no possibility of life turnin  up inside the project .    ponder waved his hands frantically .   there s no way that it can .  life isn t like rocks and water .  life is special .    the breath of gods  that sort of thing .   said ridcully .    not gods as such  obviously  but .  .  .       i suppose from the point of view of rocks  rocks are special   said ridcully  still reading hex s output .    no  sir .  rocks don t have a point of view .      rincewind lifted up a shard of rock  very carefully  ready to drop it immediately at the merest suggestion of tooth or claw .    this is silly   he said .   there s nothing here .     nothing .   said ponder  inside the helmet .    some of the rocks have got all kind of yuk on them  if that s your idea of a good time .     yuk .     you know  .  .  .  gunge .     hex seems to be suggesting now that whatever is showing up is  and is not  life   said ponder  a man whose interest in slime was limited .    that s very cheering .     there seems to be a particular concentration not far from you  .  .  .  we re just going to move you so that you can have a look at it .  .  .    rincewind s head swam .  a moment later  the rest of his body wanted to join it .  he was underwater .    don t worry   said ponder   because although you re at a very great depth  the pressure can t possibly hurt you .     good .     and the boiling water should feel merely tepid .     fine .     and the terrible upflow of poisonous minerals can t harm you because of course you re not really there .   so  all in all  i m laughing   said rincewind gloomily  peering at the dim glow ahead of him .    it s gods  definitely   said the archchancellor .   gods have turned up while our back was turned .  there can be no other explanation .     then they seem rather unambitious   sniffed the senior wrangler .   i mean  you d expect humans  wouldn t you .  not  .  .  .  blobs you can t see .  they re not going to bow down and worship anyone  are they .     not where they are   said ridcully .   the planet s full of cracks .  you shouldn t get fire under water .  that s against nature .     everywhere you look  little blobs   said the senior wrangler .   everywhere .     blobs   said the lecturer in recent runes .   can they pray .  can they build temples .  can they wage holy war on less enlightened blobs .    ponder shook his head sadly .  hex s results were quite clear .  nothing solid could cross the barrier into roundworld .  it was possible  with enough thaumic effort  to exert tiny pressures  but that was all .  of course  you could speculate that thought might get in there  but if that was the case the wizards were thinking some very dull thoughts indeed .   blobs  wasn t really a good word for what were currently floating in the warm seas and dribbling over the rocks .  it had far too many overtones of feverish gaiety and excitement .    they re not even moving   said ridcully .   just bobbing about .     blobbing about  haha   said the senior wrangler .    could we  .  .  .  help them in some way .   said the lecturer in recent runes .   you know  .  .  .  to become better blobs .  i fear we have some responsibility .     they may be as good as blobs get   said ridcully .   what s up with that rincewind fellow .    they turned .  in its circle of smoke  the suited figure was making frantic running motions .    do you think  on reflection  that it might not have good idea to miniaturize his image in roundworld .   said ridcully .    it was the only way we could get him into that little rock pool hex wanted us to look at  sir   said ponder .   he doesn t have to be any particular size .  size is relative .     is that why he keeps calling out for his mother .    ponder went over to the circle and rubbed out a few important runes .  rincewind collapsed on the floor .    what idiot put me in there .   he said .   ye gods  it s awful .  the size of some of those things .     they re actually tiny   said ponder  helping him up .    not when you are smaller than them .     my dear chap  they can t possibly hurt you .  you have nothing to fear but fear itself      oh  is that so .  what help is that .  you think that makes it better .  well  let me tell you  some of that fear can be pretty big and nasty          calm down  calm down .       next time i want to be big  understand .     did they try to communicate with you in any way .     they just flailed away with great big whiskers .  it was worse than watching wizards arguing .     yes  i doubt if they are very intelligent .     well  nor are the rock pool creatures .    tin just wondering   said ponder  wishing he had a beard to stroke thoughtfully   if perhaps they might  .  .  .  improve with keeping  .  .  .        twenty four   despite which  .  .  .     that blue in the roundworld sea isn t a chemical     well  not in the usual  simple chemical  sense of the word .  it s a mass of bacteria  called cyanobacteria .  another name for them is  blue green algae   which is wonderfully confusing .  modern so called blue green algae are usually red or brown  but the ancient ones probably were blue green .  and blue green algae are really bacteria  whereas most other algae have cells with a nucleus and so are not bacteria .  the blue green colour comes from chlorophyll  but of a different kind from that in plants  together with yellow orange chemicals called carotenoids .   bacteria appeared on earth at least   .   billion years ago  only a few hundred million years after the earth cooled to the point at which living creatures could survive on it .  we know this because of strange layered structures found in sedimentary rocks .  the layers can be flat and bumpy  they can form huge branched pillars  or they can be highly convoluted like the leaves in a cabbage .  some deposits are half a mile thick and spread for hundreds of miles .  most date from   billion years ago  but those from warrawoona in australia are   .   billion years old .   to begin with  nobody knew what these deposits were  in the     s and     s they were revealed as traces of communities of bacteria  especially cyanobacteria .   cyanobacteria collect together in shallow water to form huge  floating mats  like felt .  they secrete a sticky gel as protection against ultraviolet light  and this causes sediment to stick to the mats .  when the layer of sediment gets so thick that it blocks out the light  the bacteria form a new layer  and so on .  when the layers fossilize they turn into stromatolites  which look rather like big cushions .   the wizards haven t been expecting life .  roundworld runs on rules  but life doesn t     or so they think .  the wizards see a sharp discontinuity between life and non life .  this is the problem of expecting becomings to have boundaries     of imagining that it ought to be easy to class all objects into either the category  alive  or the category  dead  .  but that s not possible  even ignoring the flow of time  in which  alive  can become  dead      and vice versa .  a  dead  leaf is no longer part of a living tree  but it may well have a few revivable cells .   mitochondria  now the part of a cell that generates its chemical energy  once used to be independent organisms .  is a virus alive .  without a bacterial host it can t reproduce  but neither can dna copy itself without a cell s chemical machinery .   we used to build  simple  chemical models of living processes  in the hope that a sufficiently complex network of chemistry could  take off      become self referential  self copying     by itself .  there was the concept of the  primal soup   lots of simple chemicals dissolved in the oceans  bumping into each other at random  and just occasionally forming something more complicated .  it turns out that this isn t quite the way to do it .  you don t have to work hard to make real world chemistry complex  that s the default .  it s easy to make complicated chemicals .  the world is full of them .  the problem is to keep that complexity organized .   what counts as life .  every biologist used to have to learn a list of properties  ability to reproduce  sensitivity to its environment  utilization of energy  and the like .  we have moved on .   autopoeisis      the ability to make chemicals and structures related to one s own reproduction     is not a bad definition  except that modern life has evolved away from those early necessities .  today s biologists prefer to sidestep the issue and define life as a property of the dna molecule  but this begs the deeper question of life as a general type of process .  it may be that we re now defining life in the same way that  science fiction  is defined     it s what we re pointing at when we use the term .    the idea that life could somehow be self starting is still controversial to many people .  nevertheless  it turns out that finding plausible routes to life is easy .  there must be at least thirty of them .   it s hard to decide which  if any  was the actual route taken  because later lifeforms have destroyed nearly all the evidence .  this may not matter much  if life hadn t taken the route that it did  it could easily have taken one of the others  or one of the hundred we haven t thought of yet .   one possible route from the inorganic world to life  suggested by graham cairns smith  is clay .  clay can form complicated microscopic structures  and it often  copies  an existing structure by adding an extra layer to it  which then falls off and becomes the starting point of a new structure .  carbon compounds can stick on to clay surfaces  where they can act as catalysts for the formation of complex molecules of the kind we see in living creatures     proteins  even dna itself .  so today s organisms may have hitched an evolutionary ride on clay .   an alternative is g  nther w  chtersh  user s suggestion that pyrite  a compound of iron and sulphur  could have provided an energy source suitable for bacteria .  even today we find bacteria miles underground  and near volcanic vents at the bottom of the oceans  which power themselves by iron sulphur reactions .  these are the source of the  upflow of poisonous minerals  noticed by rincewind .  it s entirely conceivable that life started in similar environments .   a potential problem with volcanic vents  though  is that every so often they get blocked  and another one breaks out somewhere else .  how could the organisms get themselves safely across the intervening cold water .  in      kevin speer realized that the earth s rotation causes the rising plumes of hot water from vents to spin  forming a kind of underwater hot tornado that moves through the deep ocean .  organisms could hitch a ride on these .  some might make it to another vent .  many would not  but that doesn t matter     all that would be required would be enough survivors .   it is interesting to note that back in the cretaceous  when the seas were a lot warmer than now  these hot plumes could even have risen to the ocean s surface  where they may have caused  hyper canes      like hurricanes but with a windspeed close to that of sound .  these would have caused major climatic upheavals on a planet which  as we shall see  it not the moderately peaceful place we tend to believe it is .     bacteria belong to the grade of organisms known as prokaryotes .  they are often said to be  single celled   but many single celled creatures are far more complex and very different from bacteria .  bacteria are not true cells  but something simpler  they have no cell wall and no nucleus .  true cells  and creatures both single celled and many celled  came later  and are called eukaryotes .  they probably arose when several different prokaryotes joined forces to their mutual benefit     a trick known as symbiosis .  the first fossil eukaryotes are singe celled  like amoebas  and appear about   billion years ago .  the first fossils of many celled creatures are algae from   billion years ago  .  .  .  maybe even as old as   .   billion years .   this was the story as scientists understood it up until       animals like arthropods and other complex beasts came into being a mere     million years ago  and that until about     million years ago the only creatures were very strange indeed     quite unlike most of what s around today .   these creatures are known as ediacarans  after a place in australia where the first fossils were found .   they could grow to half a metre or more  but as far as can be told from the fossil record  seem not to have had any internal organs or external orifices like a mouth or an anus  they may have survived by digesting symbiotic bacteria in their selves  or by some other process we can only guess at  .  some were flattened  and clustered together in quilts .  we have no idea whether the ediacarans were our distant ancestors  or whether they were a dead end  a lifestyle doomed to failure .  no matter  they were around then  and as far as anyone knew  not much else was .  there are hints of fossil wormcasts  though  and some very recent fossils look like  .  .  .  but we re getting ahead of the story .  the point is that nearly all ediacaran life was apparently unrelated to what came later .   about     million years ago the pre cambrian ediacarans were succeeded by the creatures of the cambrian era .  for the first ten million years  these beasties were also pretty weird  leaving behind fragments of spines and spikes which presumably are the remains of prototype skeletons that hadn t yet joined up .  at that point  nature suddenly learned how to do joined up skeletons  and much else  this was the time known as the cambrian explosion .  twenty million years later virtually every body plan found in modern animals was already in existence  everything afterwards was mere tinkering .   the real innovation of the cambrian explosion  though  was less obvious than joined up skeletons or tusks or shells or limbs .  it was a new kind of body plan .  diploblasts were overtaken by triploblasts  .  .  .   sorry  archchancellor .  we mean that creatures began to put another layer between themselves and the universe .  ediacarans and modern jellyfish are diploblasts     two layered creatures .  they have an inside and an outside  like a thick paper bag .  three layered creatures like us and practically everything else around are called triploblasts .  we have an inner  an outer  and a within .   the within was the big leap forward  or at least the big slither .  within you can put the things you need to protect  like internal organs .  in one sense  you are not part of the environment any more     there is a you as well .  and  like someone who now has a piece of property of their very own  you can begin to make improvements .   this is a lie to children  but as lies go it is a good one .   triploblasts played a crucial role in evolution  precisely because they did have internal organs  and in particular they could ingest food and excrete it .  their excreta became a major resource for other creatures  to get an interestingly complicated world  it is vitally important that shit happens .   but where did all those triploblasts come from .  were they an offshoot of the ediacarans .  or did they come from something else that didn t leave fossils .   it s hard to see how they could have come from ediacarans .  yes  an extra layer of tissue might have appeared  but as well as that extra layer you need a lot of organization to exploit it .  that organization has to come from somewhere .  moreover  there were these occasional tantalizing traces of what might have been pre cambrian triploblasts  fossils not of worms  which would have clinched it  but of things that might have been trails made by worms in wet mud .   and then again  might not .   in february       we found out .   the discovery depended upon where     and in this case how     you look for fossils .  one way for fossils to form is by petrification .  there is a poorly known type of petrification that can happen very fast     within a few days .  the soft parts of a dead organism are replaced by calcium phosphate .  unfortunately for palaeontologists  this process works only for organisms that are about a tenth of an inch    mm  long .  still  some interesting things are that tiny .  from about      onwards scientists found wonderfully preserved specimens of tiny ancient arthropods     creatures like centipedes with many segments .  in      they found fossilized balls of cells from embryos     early stages in the development of an organism     and it is thought that these come from embryonic triploblasts .  however  all of these creatures must have come after the ediacarans .  but in      shuhai xiao  yun zhang  and andrew knoll discovered fossilized embryos in chinese rock that is     million years old     smack in the middle of the ediacaran era .  and those embryos were triploblasts .   forty million years before the cambrian explosion  there were triploblasts on earth  living right alongside those enigmatic ediacarans .   we are triploblasts .  somewhere in the pre cambrian  surrounded by mouthless  organless ediacarans  we came into our inheritance .     it used to be thought that life was a delicate  highly unusual phenomenon  difficult to create  easy to destroy .  but everywhere we look on earth we find living creatures  often in environments that we would have expected to be impossibly hostile .  it s beginning to look as if life is an extremely robust phenomenon  liable to turn up almost anywhere that s remotely suitable .  what is it about life that makes it so persistent .   earlier we talked about two ways to get off the earth  a rocket and a space elevator .  a rocket is a thing that gets used up  but a space elevator is a process that continues .  a space elevator requires a huge initial investment  but once you ve got it  going up and down is essentially free .  a functioning space elevator seems to contradict all the usual rules of economics  which look at individual transactions and try to set a rational price  instead of asking whether the concept of a price might be eliminated altogether .  it also seems to contradict the law of conservation of energy  the physicist s way of saying that you can t get something for nothing .  but  as we ve seen  you can     by exploiting the new resources that become available once you get your space elevator up and running .   there is an analogy between space elevators and life .  life seems to contradict the usual rules of chemistry and physics  especially the rule known as the second law of thermodynamics  which says that things can t spontaneously get more complicated .  life does this because  like the space elevator  it has lifted itself to a new level of operation  where it can gain access to things and processes that were previously out of the question .  reproduction  in particular  is a wonderful method of getting round the difficulties of manufacturing a really complicated thing .  just build one that manufactures more of itself .  the first one may be incredibly difficult     but all the rest come with no added effort .   what is the elevator for life .  let s try to be general here  and look at the common features of all the different proposals for  the  origin of life .  the main one seems to be the novel chemistry that can occur in small volumes adjacent to active surfaces .  this is a long way from today s complex organisms     it s even a long way from today s bacteria  which are distinctly more complicated than their ancient predecessors .  they have to be  to survive in a more complicated world .  those active surfaces could be in underwater volcanic vents .  or hot rocks deep underground .  or they could be seashores .  imagine layers of complicated  because that s easy  but disorganized  ditto  molecular gunge on rocks which are wetted by the tides and irradiated by the sun .  anything in there that happens to produce a tiny  space elevator  establishes a new baseline for further change .  for example  photosynthesis is a space elevator in this sense .  once some bit of gunge has got it  that gunge can make use of the sun s energy instead of its own  churning out sugars in a steady stream .  so perhaps  the  origin of life was a whole series of tiny  space elevators  that led  step by step  to organized but ever more complex chemistry .       everyone knows what science fiction is     until you start asking questions like  is a book set five years in the future automatically sf .  is it sf just because it   s set on another world  or is it simply fantasy with nuts and bolts on the outside .  it is sf if the author thinks it isn   t .  does it have to be set in the future .  does the presence of doug mcclure mean that a movie is sf  or merely that the men in rubber monster suits quotient is going to be high .  one of the best sf books ever written was the late roy lewis   s the evolution man  there is no technology in it more sophisticated than a bow  it   s set in the far past  the characters are barely more than ape men     but it is science fiction  nonetheless .       they were fortunate  given the names of some places in australia  that they ended up merely sounding like a minor star trek species .       twenty five   unnatural selection    the librarian knuckled swiftly through the outer regions of the university s library  although terms like  outer  were hardly relevant in a library so deeply immersed in l space .   it is known that knowledge is power  and power is energy  and energy is matter  and matter is mass  and therefore large accumulations of knowledge distort time and space .  this is why all bookshops look alike  and why all second hand bookshops seem so much bigger on the inside     and why all libraries  everywhere  are connected .  only the innermost circle of librarians know this  and take care to guard the secret .  civilization would not survive for long if it was generally known that a wrong turn in the stacks would lead into the library of alexandria just as the invaders were looking for the matches  or that a tiny patch of floor in the reference section is shared with the library in braseneck college where dr whitbury proved that gods cannot possibly exist  just before that rather unfortunate thunderstorm .   the librarian was saying  ook ook  to himself under his breath  in the same way that a slightly distracted person searches aimlessly around the room saying  scissors  scissors  in the hope that this will cause them to re materialize .  in fact he was saying  evolution  evolution  .  he d been sent to find a good book on it .   he had a very complicated reference card in his mouth .   the wizards of uu knew all about evolution .  it was a self evident fact .  you took some wolves  and by careful unnatural selection over the generations you got dogs of all shapes and sizes .  you took some sour crab apple trees and  by means of a stepladder  a fine paintbrush and a lot of patience  you got huge juicy apples .  you took some rather scruffy desert horses and  with effort and a good stock book  you got a winner .  evolution was a demonstration of narrativium in action .  things improved .  even the human race was evolving  by means of education and other benefits of civilization  it had began with rather bad mannered people in caves  and it had now produced the faculty of unseen university  beyond which it was probably impossible to evolve further .   of course  there were people who occasionally advanced more radical ideas  but they were like the people who thought the world really was round or that aliens were interested in the contents of their underwear .   unnatural selection was a fact  but the wizards knew  they knew  that you couldn t start off with bananas and get fish .   the librarian glanced at the card  and took a few surprising turnings .  there was the occasional burst of noise on the other side of the shelves  rapidly changing as though someone was playing with handfuls of sound  and a flickering in the air .  someone talking was replaced with the absorbent silence of empty rooms was replaced with the crackling of flame and displaced by laughter  .  .  .   eventually  after much walking and climbing  the librarian was faced with a blank wall of books .  he stepped up to them with librarianic confidence and they melted away in front of him .   he was in some sort of study .  it was book lined  although with rather fewer than the librarian would have expected to find in such an important node of l space .  perhaps there was just the one book  .  .  .  and there it was  giving out l radiation at a strength the librarian had seldom encountered outside the seriously magical books in the locked cellars of unseen university .  it was a book and father of books  the progenitor of a whole race that would flutter down the centuries  .  .  .   it was also  unfortunately  still being written .   the author  pen still in hand  was staring at the librarian as if he d seen a ghost .   with the exception of his bald head and a beard that even a wizard would envy  he looked very  very much like the librarian .    my goodness  .  .  .     ook .   the librarian had not expected to be seen .  the writer must have something very pertinent on his mind .    what manner of shade are you  .  .  .   .     ook .     a hand reached out  tremulously .  feeling that something was expected of him  the librarian reached out as well  and the tips of the fingers touched .   the author blinked .    tell me  then   he said   is man an ape  or is he an angel .    the librarian knew this one .    ook   he said  which meant  ape is best  because you don t have to fly and you re allowed sex  unless you work at unseen university  worst luck .   then he backed away hurriedly  ooking apologetic noises about the minor error in the spacetime coordinates  and knuckled off through the interstices of l space and grabbed the first book he found that had the word  evolution  in the title .   the bearded man went on to write an even more amazing book .  if only he had thought to use the word  ascent  there might not have been all that unpleasantness .   but  there again  perhaps not .     hex let itself absorb more of the future  .  .  .  call it  .  .  .  knowledge .  words were so difficult .  everything was context .  there was too much to learn .  it was like trying to understand a giant machine when you didn t understand a screwdriver .   sometimes hex thought it was picking up fragmentary instructions .  and  further away  much further away  there were little disjointed phrases in the soup of concepts which made sense but did not seem to be sensible .  some of them arrived unbidden .   even as hex pondered this  another one arrived and offered an opportunity to make      while you sit on your butt .  .  .  .  .  he considered this unlikely .     the title brought back by the librarian was the young person s guide to evolution .   the archchancellor turned the pages carefully .  they were well illustrated .  the librarian knew his wizards .    and this is a good book on evolution .   said the archchancellor .    ook .     well  it makes no sense to me   said the archchancellor .   i mean t say  what the hell is this picture all about .    it showed  on the left  a rather hunched up  ape like figure .  as it crossed the page  it gradually arose and grew considerably less hairy until it was striding confidently towards the edge of the page  perhaps pleased that it had essayed this perilous journey without at any time showing its genitals .    looks like me when i m getting up in the mornings   said the dean  who was reading over his shoulder .    where d the hair go .   ridcully demanded .    well  some people shave   said the dean .    this is a very strange book   said ridcully  looking accusingly at the librarian  who kept quiet because in fact he was a little worried .  he rather suspected he might have altered history  or at least a history  and on his flight back to the safety of uu he d seized the first book that looked as though it might be suitable for people with a very high iq but a mental age of about ten .  it had been in an empty byway  far off his usual planes of exploration  and there had been very small red chairs in it .    oh  i get it .  this is a fairy story   said ridcully .   frogs turnin  into princes  that kind of thing .  see here  .  .  .  there s something like our blobs  and then these fishes  and then it s a  .  .  .  a newt  and then it s a big dragony type of thing and  hah  then it s a mouse  then here s an ape  and then it s a man .  this sort of thing happens all the time out in the really rural areas  you know  where some of the witches can be quite vindictive .     the omnians believe something like this  you know   said the senior wrangler .   om started off making simple things like snakes  they say  and worked his way up to man .     as if life was like modelling clay .   said ridcully  who was not a patient man with religion .   you start out with simple things and then progress to elephants and birds which don t stand up properly when you put them down .  we ve met the god of evolution  gentlemen  .  .  .  remember .  natural evolution merely improves a species .  it can t change anything .    his finger stabbed at the next page in the brightly coloured book .    gentlemen  this is merely some sort of book of magic  possibly about the morphic bounce hypothesis .   look at this .   the picture showed a very large lizard followed by a big red arrow  followed by a bird .   lizards don t turn into birds .  if they did  why have we still got lizards .  things can t decide for themselves what shape they re going to be .  ain t that so  bursar .    the bursar nodded happily .  he was halfway through hex s write out of the theoretical physics of the project universe and  so far  had understood every word .  he was particular happy with the limitations of light speed .  it made absolute sense .   he took a crayon and wrote in the margin   assuming the universe to be a negatively curved non paramidean manifold     which is more or less obvious     you could deduce its topology by observing the same galaxies in several different directions .   he thought for a moment  and added   some travel will be involved .    of course  he was a natural mathematician  and one thing a natural mathematician wants to do is get away from actual damn sums as quickly as possible and slide into those bright sunny uplands where everything is explained by letters in a foreign alphabet  and no one shouts very much .  this was even better than that .  the hard to digest idea that there were dozens of dimensions rolled up where you couldn t see them was sheer jelly and ice cream to a man who saw lots of things no one else saw .       twenty six   the descent of darwin    the wizards met the god of evolution in the last continent .  he made things the way a god ought to     amazin  piece of work   said ridcully  emerging from the elephant .   very good wheels .  you paint these bits before assembly  do you .     the god of evolution builds creatures piece by piece  like a butcher in reverse .  he likes worms and snakes because they re very easy     you can roll them out like a child with modelling clay .  but once the god of evolution has made a species  can it change .  it does on discworld  because the god runs around making hurried adjustments  .   .   .  but how does it work without such divine intervention .   all societies that have domestic animals  be they hunting dogs or edible pigs  know that living creatures can undergo gradual changes in form from one generation to the next .  human intervention  in the form of  unnatural selection   can breed long thin dogs to go down holes and big fat pigs that provide more bacon per trotter .   the wizards know this  and so did the victorians .  until the nineteenth century  though  nobody seems to have realized that a very similar process might explain the remarkable diversity of life on earth  from bacteria to bactrians  from oranges to orangutans .   they didn t appreciate that possibility for two reasons .  when you bred dogs  what you got was a different kind of dog     not a banana or a fish .  and breeding animals was the purest kind of magic  if a human being wanted a long thin dog  and if they started from short fat ones  and if they knew how the trick worked  if  so to speak  they cast the right  spells   then they would get a long thin dog .  bananas  long and thin though they might be  were not a good starting point .  organisms couldn t change species  and they only changed form within their own species because people wanted them to .   around       two people independently began to wonder whether nature might play a similar game  but on a much longer timescale and in a much grander manner     and without any sense of purpose or goal  which had been the flaw in previous musings along similar lines  .  they considered a self propelled magic   natural  selection as opposed to selection by people .  one of them was alfred wallace  the other     far better known today     was charles darwin .  darwin spent years travelling the world .  from      to      he was hired as ship s naturalist aboard hms beagle  and his job was to observe plants and animals and note down what he saw .  in a letter of      he says that while on the beagle he believed in  the permanence of species   but on his return home in      he began to think about the deeper meaning of what he had seen  and realized that  many facts indicated the common descent of species  .  by this he meant that species that are different now probably came from ancestors that once belonged to the same species .  species must be able to change .  that wasn t an entirely new idea  but he also came up with an effective mechanism for such changes  and that was new .   meanwhile wallace was studying the flora and fauna of brazil and the east indies  and comparing what he saw in the two regions  and was coming to similar conclusions     and much the same explanation .  by      darwin was still mulling over his ideas  contemplating a grand publication of everything he wanted to say about the subject  while wallace was getting ready to publish a short article containing the main idea .  being a true english gentleman  wallace warned darwin of his intentions so that darwin could publish something first  and darwin rapidly penned a short paper for the linnaean society  followed a year later by a book  the origin of species     a big book  but still not on the majestic scale that darwin had originally intended .  wallace s paper appeared in the same journal shortly afterwards  but both papers were officially  presented  to the society at the same meeting .   what was the initial reaction to these two earth shattering articles .  in his annual report for that year  the president of the society  thomas bell  wrote that  the year has not  indeed  been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize  so to speak  the department of science in which they occur .   however  this perception quickly changed as the sheer enormity of darwin s and wallace s theory began to sink in  and they took a lot of stick from mustrum ridcully s spiritual brethren for daring to come up with a plausible alternative to biblical creation .  what was this epoch making alternative .  an idea so simple that everybody else had missed it .  thomas huxley is said to have remarked  on reading origin   how extremely stupid not to have thought of that .    this is the idea .  you don t need a human being to push animals into new forms  they can do it to themselves     more precisely  to each other .  this was the mechanism of natural selection .  herbert spencer  who did the important journalistic job of interpreting darwin s theory to the masses  coined the phrase   survival of the fittest  to describe it .  the phrase had the advantage of convincing everybody that they understood what darwin was saying  and it had the disadvantage of convincing everybody that they understood what darwin was saying .  it was a classic lie to children  and it deceives many critics of evolution to this day  causing them to aim at a long disowned target  besides giving a spurious  scientific  background to some extremely stupid and unpleasant political theories .   starting from an enormous range of observations of many species of plants and animals  darwin had become convinced that organisms could change of their own accord  so much so that they could even     over very long periods     change so much that they gave rise to new species .   imagine a lot of creatures of the same species .  they are in competition for resources  such as food     competing with each other  and with animals of other species .  now suppose that by random chance  one or more of these animals has offspring that are better at winning the competition .  then those animals are more likely to survive for long enough to produce the next generation  and the next generation is also better at winning .  in contrast  if one or more of these animals has offspring that are worse at winning the competition  then those animals are less likely to produce a succeeding generation     and even if they somehow do  that next generation is still worse at winning .  clearly even a tiny advantage will  over many generations  lead to a population composed almost entirely of the new high powered winners .  in fact  the effect of any advantage grows like compound interest  so it doesn t take all that long .   natural selection sounds like a very straightforward idea  but words like  competition  and  win  are loaded .  it s easy to get the wrong impression of just how subtle evolution must be .  when a baby bird falls out of the nest and gets gobbled up by a passing cat  it is easy to see the battle for survival as being fought between bird and cat .  but if that is the competition  then cats are clear winners     so why haven t birds evolved away altogether .  why aren t there just cats .   because cats and birds long ago came  unwittingly  to a mutual accommodation in which both can survive .  if birds could breed unchecked  there would soon be far too many birds for their food supply to support them .  a female starling  for instance  lays about    eggs in her life .  if they all survived  and this continued  the starling population would multiply by eight every generation        babies for every two parents .  such  exponential  growth is amazingly rapid  by the   th generation a sphere the size of the solar system would be occupied entirely by starlings  instead of by pigeons  which appears to be its natural destiny  .   the only  growth rate  for the population that works is for each breeding pair of adult starlings to produce  on average  exactly one breeding pair of adult starlings .  replacement  but no more     and no less .  anything more than replacement  and the population explodes  anything less  and it eventually dies out .  so of those    eggs  an average of    must not survive to breed .  and that s where the cat comes in  along with all the other things that make it tough to be a bird  especially a young one .  in a way  the cats are doing the birds a favour     collectively  though maybe not as individuals .   it depends if you re one of the two that survive to breed or the    that don t .    rather more obviously  the birds are doing the cats a favour     cat food literally drops out of the skies  manna from heaven .  so what stops it getting out of hand is that if a group of greedy cats happens to evolve somewhere  they rapidly eat themselves out of existence again .  the more restrained cats next door survive to breed  and quickly take over the vacated territory .  so those cats that eat just enough birds to maintain their food supply will win a competition against the greedy cats .  cats and birds aren t competing because they re not playing the same game .  the real competitions are between cats and other cats  and between birds and other birds .  this may seem a wasteful process  but it isn t .  a female starling has no trouble laying her    eggs .  life is reproductive     it makes reasonably close  though not exact  copies of itself  in quantity  and  cheaply  .  evolution can easily  try out  many different possibilities  and discard those that don t work .  and that s an astonishingly effective way to home in on what does work .   as huxley said  it s such an obvious idea .  it caused so much trouble from religionists because it takes the gloss off one of their favourite arguments  the argument from design .  living creatures seem so perfectly put together that surely they must have been designed     and if so  there must have been a designer .  darwinism made it clear that a process of random  purposeless variation trimmed by self induced selection can achieve equally impressive results  so there can be the semblance of design without any designer .   there are plenty of details to darwinism that still aren t understood  as with all science  but most of the obvious ways of trying to shoot it down have been answered effectively .  the classic example     still routinely trotted out by creationists and others even though darwin himself had a pretty good answer     is the evolution of the eye .  the human eye is a complex structure  and all of its components have to fit together to a high degree of accuracy  or it won t work .  if we claim that such a complex structure has evolved  we must accept that it evolved gradually .  it can t all have come into being at once .  but if so  then at every stage along the evolutionary track the still evolving proto eye must offer some kind of survival advantage to the creature that possesses it .  how can this happen .  the question is often asked in the form  what use is half an eye .    to which you are expected to conclude  nothing   followed by a rapid conversion to some religion or other .   nothing  is a reasonable answer  but to the wrong question .  there are lots of ways to get to an eye gradually that do not require it to be assembled piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle .  evolution does not build creatures piece by piece like the god of evolution in the last continent .  darwin himself pointed out that in creatures alive in his day you could find all kinds of light sensitive organs  starting with patches of skin  then increasing in complexity  light gathering power  and ability to detect fine detail  right up to structures as sophisticated as the human eye .  there is a continuum of eyelike organs in the living world  and every creature gains an advantage by having its own type of light sensing device  in comparison to similar creatures that have a slightly less effective device of a similar kind .   in      daniel nilsson and susanne pelger used a computer to see what would happen to a mathematical model of a light sensing surface if it was allowed to change in small  random  biologically feasible ways  with only those changes that improved its sensitivity to light being retained .  they found that within         generations     an evolutionary blink of an eye     that flat surface gradually changed into a recognizable eye  complete with a lens .  the lens even bent light differently in different places  just like our eye and unlike normal spectacle lenses .  at every tiny step along the way  a creature with the improved  eye  would be better than those with the old version .   at no stage was there ever  half an eye  .  there were just light sensing things that got better at it .     since the     s  we have been in possession of a new and central piece of the evolutionary jigsaw  one that darwin would have given his right arm to know about .  this is the physical     more precisely  chemical     nature of whatever it is that ensures that characteristics of organisms can change and be passed from one generation to the next .   you know the word  gene .   you know the molecule  dna .   you even know how it works  dna carries the genome  which is a chemical  blueprint  for an organism .  it uses the genetic code to turn dna into proteins .   and  probably  a lot of what you know is lies to children .   just as  survival of the fittest  captured the imaginations of the victorians  so  dna  has captured the imaginations of today s public .  however  imaginations thrive best if they are left free to roam  they grow tired and feeble in captivity .  captive imaginations do breed quite effectively  because they are protected from the terrible predator known as thought .   dna has two striking properties  which play a significant role in the complex chemistry of life  it can encode information  and that information can be copied .   other molecules process the dna information  for example by making proteins according to recipes encoded in dna .   from this point of view a living organism is a kind of molecular computer .  of course there s much more to life than that  but dna is central to any discussion of life on earth .  dna is life s most important molecular level  space elevator      a platform from which life can launch itself into higher realms .   the complexity of living creatures arises not because they are made from some special kind of matter     the now discredited  vitalist  theory     but because their matter is organized in an exceedingly intricate fashion .  dna does a lot of the routine  bookkeeping  that keeps living creatures organized .  every cell of  nearly  every living organism contains its  genome      a kind of code message written in dna  which gives that organism a lot of hints about how to behave at the molecular level .   exceptions are various viruses  on the boundary between life and non life  which use a slightly different code .    this is why it was possible to clone dolly the sheep     to take an ordinary cell from an adult sheep and make it grow into another sheep .  the trick actually requires three adult sheep .  first  there s the one from which you take the cell  call her  dolly s mum  .  then you persuade the cell s nucleus to forget that it came from an adult and to think that it s back in the egg  and then you implant it into an egg from a second sheep   egg donor   .  then you put the egg into the uterus of the third sheep   surrogate mum   so that it can grow into a normal lamb .   dolly is often said to be a perfect copy of dolly s mum  but that s not completely true .  for a start  certain parts of dolly s dna come not from dolly s mum  but from egg donor .  and even if that slight difference had been fixed  dolly could still differ in many ways from her  mother   because sheep dna is not a complete list of instructions for  how to build a sheep  .  dna is more like a recipe     and it assumes you already know how to set up your kitchen .  so the recipe doesn t say  put the mixture in a greased pan and place in an oven set to      f   for instance  it says  put the mixture in the oven  and assumes that you know it needs to go in a pan and that the oven should be set to a standard temperature .  in particular  sheep dna leaves out the vital instruction  put the mixture inside a sheep   but that s the only place  as yet  where you can turn a fertilized sheep egg into a lamb .  so even surrogate mum played a considerable role in determining what happened when the dna recipe for dolly was  obeyed  .   many biologists think that this is a minor objection     after all  egg donor and surrogate mum work the way they do because their dna contains the information that makes them do it .  but things that aren t in any organism s dna may be essential for the reproductive cycle .  a good example occurs in yeast  a plant that can turn sugar into alcohol and give off carbon dioxide .  the entire dna code for one species of yeast is now known .  thousands of experimentalists have played genetic games with yeast  then spun the beasties in a centrifuge to separate the dna  from which they can work out the code .  when you do this  you leave a scummy residue in the bottom of the test tube  but since it s not dna  you know it can t be important for genetics  and you throw it away .  and so they all did  until in      one geneticist asked a stupid question .  if it s not dna  what s it for .  what s in that scummy residue  anyway .   the answer was simple  and baffling .  prions .  lots and lots of them .   a prion is a smallish protein molecule that can act as a catalyst for the formation of more protein molecules just like itself .  unlike dna  it doesn t do this by replication .  instead  it needs a supply of proteins that are almost like itself  but not quite     the right atoms  in the right order  but folded into the wrong shape .  the prion attaches itself to such a protein  jiggles it around a bit  and nudges it into the same shape as the prion .  so now you ve got more prions  and the process speeds up .   prions are molecular preachers  they make more of themselves by converting the heathen  not by splitting into identical twins .  the most notorious prion is the one that is believed to be the cause of bse   mad cow disease  .  the protein that gets converted happens to be a key component of the cow s brain  which is why infected cows lose coordination  stagger around  foam at the mouth  and look crazy .  what does yeast want prions for .  without prions  yeast can t reproduce .  the protein making instructions in its dna sometimes make a protein that is folded into the wrong shape .  when a yeast cell divides  it copies its dna to each half  but it shares the prions  which can be topped up by converting other proteins  .  so here s a case where  even on the molecular level  an organism s dna does not specify everything about that organism .   there s a lot about the dna code system that we don t understand  but one part that we do is the  genetic code  .  some segments of dna are recipes for proteins .  in fact  they come very close to being exact blueprints for proteins  because they list the precise components of the protein and they list them in exactly the right order .  proteins are made from a catalogue of fairly tiny molecules known as amino acids .  for most organisms  humans included  the catalogue contains exactly    amino acids .  if you string lots of amino acids together in a row  and let them fold up into a relatively compact tangle  you get a protein .  the one thing the dna doesn t list is how to fold the resulting molecule up  but usually it folds the right way of its own accord .  occasionally  when it doesn t  there are more servant molecules to nudge it into the right shape .  just such a servant molecule  rejoicing in the name hsp    is turning molecular genetics upside down even as we write .  hsp    insists  that proteins fold into the orthodox shape  even if there are a few mutations in the dna that codes for those proteins .  when the organism is  stressed   diverting hsp   to other functions  these cryptic mutations suddenly get expressed     the proteins acquire the unorthodox shape that goes along with their mutated dna codes .  in effect  this says that you can trigger a genetic change by non genetic means .   segments of dna that code for working proteins are called genes .  segments that don t rejoice in a variety of names .  some of them code for proteins that control when a given gene  switches on   that is  starts to make proteins  these are known as regulatory  or homeotic  genes .  some bits are colloquially called  junk dna   a scientific term meaning  we don t know what these bits are for  .  some literally minded scientists read this as  they re not for anything   thereby getting the horse of nature neatly aligned with the rear end of the cart of human understanding .  most likely they are a mix of different things  dna that used to have some function way back in evolution but currently does not  and might possibly be revived if  say  an ancient parasite reappeared   dna that controls how genes switch their protein manufacturing on and off  dna that controls those  and so on .  some may actually be genuine junk .  and some  so the joke goes  may encode a message like  it was me  i m god  i existed all along  ha ha .      evolutionary processes do not always direct themselves along paths that are neatly comprehensible to humans .  this doesn t mean darwin was wrong  it means that even when he s right  there may be a surprising absence of narrativium  so that a  story  that makes perfect sense to evolution may not make sense to humans .  we suspect that a lot of what you find in living organisms is like that     offering a small advantage at every stage of its evolution  but an advantage in such a complex game is that we can t tell a convincing story about why it s an advantage .  to show just how bizarre evolutionary processes can be  even in comparatively simple circumstances  we must look not to animals or plants  but to electronic circuits .   since      an engineer named adrian thompson has been evolving circuits .  the basic technique  known as  genetic algorithms   is quite widely used in computer science .  an algorithm is a specific program  or recipe  to solve a given problem .  one way to find algorithms for really tough problems is to  cross breed  them and apply natural selection .  by  cross breed  we mean  mix parts of one algorithm with parts of the other  .  biologists call this  recombination  and each sexual organism     like you     recombines its parents  chromosomes in just this manner .  such a technique  or its result  is called a genetic algorithm .  when the method works  it works brilliantly  its main disadvantage is that you can t always give a sensible explanation of how the resulting algorithm accomplishes whatever it does .  more of that in a moment  first we must discuss the electronics .   thompson wondered what would happen if you used the genetic algorithm approach on an electronic circuit .  decide on some task  randomly cross breed circuits that might or might not solve it  keep the ones that do better than the rest  and repeat for as many generations as it takes .   most electronic engineers  thinking about such a project  will quickly realize that it s silly to use genuine circuits .  instead  you can simulate the circuits on a computer  since you know exactly how a circuit behaves  and do the whole job more quickly and more cheaply in simulation .  thompson mistrusted this line of argument  though  maybe real circuits  knew  something that a simulation would miss .   he decided on a task  to distinguish between two input signals of different frequencies    kilohertz and    kilohertz     that is  signals that made      vibrations per second and        vibrations per second .  think of them as sound  a low tone and a high tone .  the circuit should accept the tone as input signal  process it in some manner to be determined by its eventual structure  and produce an output signal .  for the high tone  the circuit should output a steady zero volts     that is  no output at all     and for the low tone  the circuit should output a steady five volts .   actually  these properties were not specified at the start  any two different steady signals would have been acceptable .  but that s how it ended up .    it would take forever to build thousands of trial circuits by hand  so he employed a  field programmable gate array  .  this is a microchip that contains a number of very tiny transistorized  logic cells      mildly intelligent switches  so to speak     whose connections can be changed by loading new instructions into the chip s configuration memory .   those instructions are analogous to an organism s dna code  and can be cross bred .  that s what thompson did .  he started with an array of one hundred logic cells  and used a computer to randomly generate a population of fifty instruction codes .  the computer loaded each set into the array  fed in the two tones  looked at the outputs  and tried to find some feature that might help in evolving a decent circuit .  to begin with  that feature was anything that didn t look totally random .  the  fittest  individual in the first generation produced a steady five volt output no matter which tone it heard .  the least fit instruction codes were then killed off  deleted   the fit ones were bred  copied and recombined   and the process was repeated .   what s most interesting about the experiment is not the details  but how the system homed in on a solution     and the remarkable nature of that solution .  by the    th generation  the fittest circuit produced outputs that were pretty much the same as the inputs  two waveforms of different frequencies .  the same effect could have been obtained with no circuit at all  just a bare wire .  the desired steady output signals were not yet in prospect .   by the    th generation  the output for the low tone was steady  but the high tone still produced a variable output signal .  it took until generation      for the circuit to give approximately steady  and different  signals for the two tones  only by generation      did the odd glitch get ironed out  after which point little further evolution occurred .   the strangest thing about the eventual solution was its structure .  no human engineer would ever have invented it .  indeed no human engineer would have been able to find a solution with a mere     logic cells .  the human engineer s solution  though  would have been comprehensible     we would be able to tell a convincing  story  about why it worked .  for example  it would include a  clock      a circuit that ticks at a constant rate .  that would give a baseline to compare the other frequencies against .  but you can t make a clock with     logic cells .  the evolutionary solution didn t bother with a clock .  instead  it routed the input signal through a complicated series of loops .  these presumably generated time delayed and otherwise processed versions of the signals  which eventually were combined to produce the steady outputs .  presumably .  thompson described how it functioned like this   really  i don t have the faintest idea how it works .    amazingly  further study of the final solution showed that only    of its     logic cells were actually needed .  the rest could be removed from the circuit without affecting its behaviour .  at first it looked as if five other logic cells could be removed     they were not connected electrically to the rest  nor to the input or output .  however  if these were removed  the circuit ceased to work .  presumably these cells reacted to physical properties of the rest of the circuit other than electrical current  magnetic fields  say .  whatever the reason  thompson s hunch that a real silicon circuit would have more tricks up its sleeve than a computer simulation turned out to be absolutely right .   the technological justification for thompson s work is the possibility of evolving highly efficient circuits .  but the message for basic evolutionary theory is also important .  in effect  it tells us that evolution has no need for narrativium .  an evolved solution may  work  without it being at all clear how it does whatever it does .  it may not follow any  design principle  that makes sense to human beings .  instead  it can follow the emergent logic of ant country  which can t be captured in a simple story .   of course  evolution may sometimes hit on  designed  solutions  as happens for the eye .  sometimes it hits on solutions that do have a narrative  but we fail to appreciate the story .  stick insects look like sticks  and their eggs look like seeds .  there is a kind of discworld logic to this  since seeds are the  eggs  of sticks  and prior to the theory of evolution taking hold the victorians approved of this  logic  because it looked like god being consistent .  the early evolutionists didn t see it that way  and they worried about it  but they worried a lot more when they found that some stick insect eggs looked like little snails .  it seemed silly for anything to resemble the favourite food of nearly everything else .  in fact  it seemed to be a flat contradiction to the evolutionary story .  the puzzle was solved only in       after forest fires in australia .  when new plant shoots came up out of the ashes  they were covered in baby stick insects .  ants had carried the  seeds   and the  baby snails   down into their subterranean nests  thinking they were the real thing .  being safely underground  the stick insect eggs escaped the fires .  in fact  baby stick insects look  and run  just like ants  this should have been a clue  but nobody made the connection .   and sometimes evolution s solution has no narrative structure .  to test darwin s theories thoroughly  we should be looking for evolved systems that don t conform to a simple narrative description  as well as for ones that do .  many of the brain s sensory systems may well be like this .  the first few layers of the visual cortex  for example  perform generalized functions like detecting edges  but we have no idea how lower layers work  and that may well be because they don t conform to any design principles that we currently can recognize .  our sense of smell seems to be  organized  along very strange lines  not at all as clearly structured as the visual cortex  and it too may be lacking any element of design .   more importantly  genes may well be like this .  biologists habitually talk of  the function of a gene      what it does .  the unspoken assumption is that it does only one thing  or a small list of things .  this is pure magic  the gene as a spell .  it is conceived as being a spell in the same sense that  cold start  in a car is .  but a lot of genes may not do anything that can be summed up in a simple story .  the job they evolved to do is  build an organism   and they evolved as a team  like thompson s circuits .  when evolution turns up solutions of this kind  conventional reductionism is not much help in understanding those solutions .  you can list neural connections till the cows come home  but you won t understand how the cows  visual systems distinguish a cowshed from a bull .       the quantity of bacon per trotter is on average slightly more than one quarter of the amount per head .       twenty seven   we need more blobs    rincewind was finding  now that he was back at what appeared to be his real size  that he was coming to enjoy this world after all .  it was so marvellously dull .   every so often he d be moved forward a few tens of millions of years .  the sea levels would change .  there seemed to be more land around  speckled with volcanoes .  sand was turning up on the edge of the sea .  yet the sheer vast ringing silence dominated everything .  oh  there d be storms  and at night there were brilliant meteor showers that practically hissed across the sky  but these only underlined the absent symphony of life .   he was rather pleased with  symphony of life  .    mr stibbons .   he said .    yes .   said ponder s voice in his helmet .    there seem to be a lot of comets about .     yes  they seem to go with roundworld systems .  is this a problem .     aren t they going to crash into this world .    rincewind heard the muted sounds of debate in the background  and then ponder said   the archchancellor says snowballs don t hurt .     oh .  good .     we re going to move you on a few million years now .  ready .       millions and millions of years of dullness   said the senior wrangler .    there are more blobs today   said ponder .    oh  good .  we need more blobs .    there was a yell from rincewind .  the wizards rushed to the omniscope .    good heavens   said the dean .   is that a higher lifeform .     i think   said ponder   that seat cushions have inherited the world .      they lay in the warm shallow water .  they were dark green .  they were reassuringly dull .   but the other things weren t .   blobs drifted over the sea like giant eyeballs  black  purple  and green .  the water itself was covered with them .  a scum of them rolled in the surf .  the aerial ones bobbed only a few inches above the waves  thick as fog  overshadowing one another in their fight for height .    have you ever seen anything like that .   said the senior wranger .    not legally   said the dean .  a blob burst .  audio reception on the omniscope was not good  but the sound was  in short  phut .  the stricken thing disappeared into the sea  and the floating blobs closed in over it .    get rincewind to try to communicate with them   said ridcully .    what have blobs got to talk about  sir .   said ponder  besides  they re not making any noise .  i don t think phut counts .     they re various colours   said the lecturer in recent runes .   perhaps they communicate by changing colour .  like those sea creatures        he snapped his fingers as an aid to memory .    lobsters .   the dean supplied .    really .   said the senior wrangler .   i didn t know they did that .     oh yes   said ridcully .   red means  help .       no  i think the lecturer in recent runes is referring to squid   said ponder  who knew that this sort of thing could go on for a long time .  he added hurriedly   i ll tell rincewind to give it a try .      rincewind  apparently knee deep in blobs  said   what do you mean .     well  .  .  .  could you get embarrassed  perhaps .     no  but i m getting angry .     that might work  if you get red enough .  they ll think you want help .     do you know there s something else here besides blobs .    some of the blobs trailed strands in the faint breeze blowing across the beach .  when they tangled up on a blob gasbag  which put some stress on the line  the little blob on the end let go its grip on a rock  the line gradually shortened  and the gasbag bobbed onwards with its new passenger .   rincewind saw them on a number of blobs .  the blobs did not look healthy .    predators   ponder told him .    i m on a beach with predators .     if it really worries you  try not to look blobby .  we ll keep an eye on them .  er  .  .  .  the faculty is of the opinion that intelligence is most likely to arise in creatures that eat lots of things .     why .     probably because they eat lots of things .  we ll try a few big jumps in time  all right .     i suppose so .    the world flickered  .  .  .    blobs .     .  .  . flickered .  .  .    the sea s a lot further away .  there s a few floating blobs .  more black blobs this time .     .  .  .  flickered  .  .  .    well out at sea  great rafts of purple blobs  some blobs in the air .     .  .  . flickered  .  .  .    great steaming piles of onions .     what .   said ponder .    i knew it .  i just knew it .  this whole damn place was just lulling me into a false sense of security .     what s happening .     it s a snowball .  the whole world s a giant snowball .        wizards seldom bothered to look things up if they could reach an answer by bickering at cross purposes .       twenty eight   the iceberg cometh    the earth has been a giant snowball on many occasions .  it was a snowball   .   billion years ago    .   billion years ago  and   billion years ago .  it was a really cold snowball     million years ago  and this was followed by a series of global cold snaps that lasted until     million years ago .  it reverted to snowball mode     million years ago  and has been that way on and off for most of the last    million years .  ice has played a significant part in the story of life .  just how significant a part  we are now beginning to appreciate .   we first began to realize this when we found evidence of the most recent snowball .  about one and a half million years ago  round about the time that humans began to become the dominant species on earth  the planet got very cold .  the old name for this period was the ice age .  we don t call it that any more because it wasn t one age  we talk of  glacial interglacial cycles  .  is there a connection .  did the cold climate drive the naked ape to evolve enough intelligence to kill other animals and use their fur to keep warm .  to discover and use fire .   this used to be a popular theory .  it s possible .  probably not  though  there are too many holes in the logic .  but a much earlier  and much more severe  ice age very nearly put a stop to the whole of that  life  nonsense .  and  ironically  its failure to do so may have unleashed the full diversity of life as we now know it .     thanks to the pioneering insights of louis agassiz  victorian scientists knew that the earth had once been a lot colder than it is now  because they could see the evidence all around them  in the form of the shapes of valleys .  in many parts of the world today you can find glaciers     huge  rivers  of ice  which flow  very slowly  under the pressure of new ice forming further uphill .  glaciers carry large quantities of rock  and they gouge and grind their way along  forming valleys whose cross section is shaped like a smooth u .  all over europe  indeed over much of the world  there are identical valleys     but no sign of ice for hundreds or thousands of miles .  the victorian geologists pieced together a picture that was a bit worrying in some ways  but reassuring overall .  about   .   million years back  at the start of the pleistocene era  the earth suddenly became colder .  the ice caps at the poles advanced  thanks to a rapid buildup of snow  and gouged out those u shaped valleys .  then the ice retreated again .  four times in all  it was thought  the ice had advanced and retreated  with much of europe being buried under a layer of ice several miles thick .   still  there was no need to worry  the geologists said .  we seemed to be safe and snug in the middle of a warm period  with no prospect of being buried under miles of ice for quite some time  .  .  .   the picture is no longer so comfortable .  indeed  some people think that the greatest threat to humanity is not global warming  but an incipient ice age .  how ironic  and how undeserved  if our pollution of the planet cancels out a natural disaster .   as usual  the main reason we now know a lot more is that new kinds of observation became possible  propped up by new theories to explain what it is that they measure and why we can be reasonably sure that they do .  these new methods range from clever methods for dating old rocks to studies of the proportions of different isotopes in cores drilled from ancient ice  backed up by ocean drilling to study the layers of sediment deposited on the sea floor .  warm seas sustain different living creatures  whose death deposits different sediment  so there is a link from sediments to climate .   all of these methods reinforce each other  and lead to very much the same picture .  every so often the earth begins to cool  becoming          c colder near the poles and    c colder elsewhere .  then it suddenly warms up  possibly becoming    c warmer than the current norm .  in between big fluctuations  there are smaller ones   mini ice ages  .  the typical gap between a decent sized ice age and the next is around        years  often less     nothing like the comfortable         years of  interglacial  expected by the victorians .  the most worrying finding of all is that periods of high temperatures     that is  like we get now     seldom lasted more than        years .   the last major glaciation ended        years ago .   wrap up well  folks .     what caused the ice ages .  it turns out that the earth isn t quite as nice a planet as we like to think  and its orbit round the sun isn t quite as stable and repetitive as we usually assume .  the currently accepted theory was devised in      by a serbian called milutin milankovitch .  in broad terms  the earth goes round the sun in an ellipse  almost a circle  but there are three features of the earth s motion that change .  one is the amount through which the earth s axis tilts     about      at the moment  but varying slightly in a cycle that lasts roughly        years .  another is a change in the position of earth s closest approach to the sun  which varies in a        year cycle .  the third is a variation in the eccentricity of the earth s orbit     how oval it is     whose period is around         years .  putting all three cycles together  it is possible to calculate the changes in heat received from the sun .  these calculations agree with the known variations in the earth s temperature  and it seems particularly likely that the earth s warming up after ice ages is due to increased warmth from the sun  thanks to these three astronomical cycles .   it may seem unsurprising that when the earth receives more heat from the sun  it warms up  and when it doesn t  it cools down  but not all of the heat that reaches the upper atmosphere gets down to the ground .  it can be reflected by clouds  and even if it gets to ground level it can be reflected from the oceans and from snow and ice .  it is thought that during ice ages  this reflection causes the earth to lose more heat than it would otherwise do  so ice ages automatically make themselves worse .  we get kicked out of them when the incoming heat from the sun is so great that the ice starts to melt despite the lost heat .  or maybe the ice gets dirty  or  .  .  .  it s not so clear that we get kicked into an ice age when less of the sun s warmth reaches the earth     indeed the slide into an ice age is usually more gradual than the climb back out of it .   all of which makes one wonder whether global warming caused by gases excreted from animals might be partly responsible .  when gases such as carbon dioxide and methane build up in the atmosphere  they cause the famous  greenhouse effect   trapping more sunlight than usual  hence more heat .  right now  most scientists have become convinced  the earth s supply of  greenhouse gases  is growing faster than it would otherwise do thanks to human activities such as farming  burning rainforests to clear land   driving cars  burning coal and oil for electricity  and farming again  cows produce a lot of methane  grass goes in one end and methane emerges at the other  .  and how could we forget the carbon dioxide breathed out by people .  one person is equivalent to half a car  maybe more .   maybe in the past there were vast civilizations of which we now know nothing  all traces having vanished     except for their effect on the global temperature .  maybe the earth seethed with vast herds of cattle  buffalo  elephants busily excreting methane .  but most scientists think that climate change results from variations in five different factors  the sun s output of radiant heat  the earth s orbit  the composition of the atmosphere  the amount of dust produced by volcanoes  and levels of land and oceans resulting from movement of the earth s crust .  we can t yet put together a really coherent picture in which the measurements match the theory as closely as we d like  but one thing that is becoming clear is that the earth s climate has more than one  equilibrium  state .  it stays in or near one such state for a while  then switches comparatively rapidly to another  and so on .   the original idea was that one state was a warm climate  like the one we have now  and the other was a cold  ice age  one .  in      didier paillard refined this idea to a three state model  interglacial  warm   mild glacial  coldish   and glacial  very cold  .  a drop in heat received from the sun below some critical threshold  caused by those astronomical cycles  triggers a switch from warm to coldish .  when the resulting ice builds up sufficiently  it reflects so much of the sun s heat that this triggers another switch from coldish to very cold .  but when the sun s heat finally builds up again to another threshold value  thanks once more to the three astronomical cycles  then the climate switches back to warm .  this model fits observations deduced from the amount of oxygen     a radioactive isotope of oxygen  in geological deposits .     finally  some drama .  about     million years ago there was an ice age so severe that it very nearly killed off all of the surface life on earth .  this  big freeze  lasted for between    and    million years  the ice reached the equator  and it seems that the seas froze to a depth of half a mile    km  or more .  according to the  snowball earth  theory  ice covered the entire earth at this time .  however  if ice really covered the whole earth  it should have done more damage than the fossil record indicates .   and that s not the only problem .  one key piece of evidence for the big freeze is a layer of sedimentary rock that formed just after the glaciers melted and left huge quantities of debris .  this layer contains less carbon     in proportion to ordinary carbon     than normal .  marine photosynthesis converts carbon    into carbon dioxide more readily than it does carbon     so an excess of carbon     is left behind in seawater and in the layers of sediment in it that later turn to rock .  so a low ratio of carbon    to carbon    indicates low biological activity .   the scientist s task is to find ways to try to disprove things that seem to make sense .  in       martin kennedy and nicholas christie blick measured this ratio for sediments that formed during the alleged big freeze .  if the world was miles deep in ice  the ratio ought to be low .  but in fact it was high     in africa  australia  and north america .  this suggests that the global ecosystem was going strong at that time .   computer models of the climate system show that the oceans strongly resist freezing over completely  too .   like many attractive scientific theories  snowball earth is not at all clear cut  and further research will be needed to find out who is right .  maybe earth wasn t a really solid snowball after all .  or maybe  as schrag responded  there were patches of open water big enough to change the carbon chemistry of the ocean as it absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide .  maybe the earth s axis tilted a lot more than astronomers are willing to concede  and the poles lost their ice while equatorial regions gained it .  or perhaps continental drift was more rapid at that time than we think  and we ve mapped out the extent of the ice incorrectly .  whatever the details  though  it was a spectacularly icy world .   although the big freeze came close to wiping out ail surface life  it may indirectly have created a lot of today s biodiversity .  the big shift from single celled creatures to multi celled ones also happened     million years ago .  it is plausible that the big freeze cleared away a lot of the single celled lifeforms and opened up new possibilities for multi celled life  culminating in the cambrian explosion     million years ago .  mass extinctions are typically succeeded by sudden bursts of diversity  in which life reverts from being a  professional  at the evolutionary game to being an  amateur  .  it then takes a while for the less able amateurs to be eliminated     and until they are  all sorts of strange strategies for making a living can temporarily thrive .  the succession of icy periods that followed the big freeze could only have assisted this process .   however  it may have been the other way round .  the invention of the anus by triploblasts may have changed the ecology of the seas .  faeces would have dropped to the sea bed  where bacteria could specialize in breaking them down .  other organisms could then become filter feeders  living on those bacteria  perhaps sending their larvae up into the plankton for dispersal  as modern filter feeders do .  several new ways of life depended on this primeval composting system .  and it s possible that the successful return of phosphorus and nitrogen into the marine cycles led to an explosion of algae  which reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide  cut back on the greenhouse effect  and triggered the big freeze .   fortunately for us  the big freeze wasn t quite long enough  or cold enough  to kill off everything .   bacteria in volcanic vents on the ocean floor and in the earth s crust would have survived no matter what  but evolution would have been set back a long  long way .   so when the earth warmed  life exploded into a fresh  competition free world .  paradoxically  a major reason why we are here today may be that we very nearly weren t .  our entire evolutionary history is full of these good news bad news scenarios  where life leaps forward joyously over the bodies of the fallen  .  .  .   rincewind can be forgiven for feeling that roundworld has it in for him .  life has suffered from many different kinds of natural disaster .  here are two more .  in the permian triassic extinction of     million years ago      of all species died within the space of a few hundred thousand years .   william hobster and mordeckai magaritz think this happened because they suffocated .  carbon isotopes show that a lot of coal and shale oxidized in the run up to the extinction  probably because of a fall in sea level  which exposed more land .  the result was a lot more carbon dioxide and a lot less oxygen  which was reduced to half today s level .  land species were especially badly affected .   another global extinction  though less severe  occurred    million years ago  the palaeocene eocene boundary .  in cores of sediment drilled from the antarctic  james kennett and lowell stott discovered evidence of the sudden death of a lot of marine species .  it seemed that trillions of tons  tonnes  of methane had burst from the ocean  sending temperatures through the roof  methane being a powerful greenhouse gas .  jenny dickens suggested that the methane was released from deposits of methane hydrates in permafrost and on the seabed .  methane hydrates are a crystal lattice of water enclosing methane gas  they are created when bacteria in mud release the gas and it becomes trapped .   coincidentally  one of the main results of the palaeocene eocene extinction was a burst of evolutionary diversity  leading in particular to the higher primates     and us .  whether something is a disaster depends on your point of view .  rocks may not have a point of view  as ponder stibbons pointed out  but we certainly do .       to the best of our knowledge  based on deduction from the available evidence .  certainly it was a big extinction     far bigger than the one that killed off  or helped to kill off  the dinosaurs .  we remember the dinosaur one because they   ve had such good pr people .       twenty nine   going for a paddle    i think it looks more like a hogswatchnight ornament   said the senior wrangler later  as the wizards took a pre dinner drink and stared into the omniscope at the glittering white world .   quite pretty  really .     bang go the blobs   said ponder stibbons .    phut   said the dean  cheerfully .   more sherry  archchancellor .     perhaps some instability in the sun  .  .  .   ponder mused .    made by unskilled labour   said archchancellor ridcully .   bound to happen sooner or later .  and then it s nothing but frozen death  the tea time of the gods and an eternity of cold .     sniffleheim   said the dean  who d got to the sherry ahead of everyone else .    according to hex  the air of the planet has changed   said ponder .    a bit academic now  isn t it .   said the senior wrangler .    ah  i ve got an idea .   said the dean  beaming .   we can get hex to reverse the thaumic flow in the cthonic matrix of the optimized bi direction octagonate  can t we .     well  that s the opinion of four glasses of sherry   said the archchancellor briskly  to break the ensuing silence .   however  if i may express a preference  something that isn t complete gibberish would be more welcome next time  please .  so  mister stibbons  is this the end of the world .     and if it is   said the senior wrangler   are we going to have a lot of heroes turning up .     what are you talking about  man .   said ridcully .    well  the dean seems to think we re like gods  and a great many mythologies suggest that when heroes die they go to feast forever in the halls of the gods   said the senior wrangler .   i just need to know if i should alert the kitchens  that s all .     they re only blobs   said ridcully .   what can they do that s heroic .     i don t know  .  .  .  stealing something from the gods is a very classical way   the senior wrangler mused .    are you saying we should check our pockets .   said the archchancellor .    well  i haven t seen my penknife lately   said the senior wranger .   it was just a thought  anyway .    ridcully slapped the despondent stibbons on the back .    chin up  lad .   he roared .   it was a wonderful effort .  admittedly the outcome was a lot of blobs with the intelligence of pea soup  but you shouldn t let utter hopeless failure get you down .     we never do   said the dean .     it was after breakfast next day when ponder stibbons wandered into the high energy magic building .  a scene of desolation met his eye .  there were cups and plates everywhere .  paper littered the floor .  forgotten cigarettes had etched their charred trails on the edge of desks .  a half eaten sardine  cheese and blackcurrant pizza  untouched for days  was inching its way to safety .   sighing  he picked up a broom  and went over the tray containing hex s overnight write out .   it seemed a lot fuller than he would have expected .      not just blobs     there s all sorts of stuff .  some of it s wiggling  .  .  .     is that a plant or is it an animal .     i msure it s a plant .     isn t it .  .  .  walking  .  .  .  rather fast .     i don t know .  i ve never seen a plant walking before .    the wizardery of uu was filtering back in the building as the news got around .  the senior members of the faculty were clustered around the omniscope  explaining to one another  now that the impossible had happened  that of course it had been inevitable .    all those cracks under the sea   said the dean .   and the volcanoes  of course .  heat s bound to build up over time .     that doesn t explain all the different shapes  though   said the senior wrangler .   i mean  the whole sea looks like somebody had just turned over a very big stone .     i suppose the blobs had time to consider their future when they were under the ice   said the dean .   it suppose you could think of it as a very long winter evening .     i vote for lavatories   said the lecturer in recent runes .    well  i m sure we all do   said ridcully .   but why at this point .     i mean that the blobs were  .  .  .  you know  .  .  .  excusing themselves for millions and millions of years  then you re get a lot of  er  manure  .  .  .  the lecturer ventured .    a shitload   said the dean .    dean .  really .     sorry  archchancellor .      .  .  .  and we know dunghills absolutely teem with life  .  .  .   the lecturer went on .    they used to think that rubbish heaps actually generated rats   said ridcully .   of course  that was just a superstition .  it s really seagulls .  but you saying life is  as it were  advancing by eating dead men s shoes .  or blobs  in this case .  not shoes  of course  because they didn t have any feet .  and wouldn t have been bright enough to invent shoes even if they did .  and even if they had been  they couldn t have done .  because there was  at that time  nothing from which shoes might be made .  but apart from that  the metaphor stands .     there still are blobs in there   said the dean .   there s just lots of other things  too .     any of it lookin  intelligent .   said ridcully .    i mnot certain how we d spot that at this stage  .  .  .     simple .  is anything killing something it doesn t intend to eat .    they stared into the teeming broth .    bit hard to define intentions  really   said the dean  after a while .    well  does anything look as if it is about to become intelligent .    they watched again .    that thing like two spiders joined together .   said the senior wrangler after a while .   it looks very thoughtful .     i think it looks very dead .     look  i can see how we can settle this whole evolution business once and for all   said ridcully  turning away .   mister stibbons  can hex use the omniscope to see if anything changes into anything else .     over a moderately sized area  i think he probably can  sir .     get it to pay attention to the land   said the dean .   is there anything happening on the land .     there s a certain greenishness  sir .  seaweed with attitude  really .     that s where the interesting stuff will happen  mark my words .  i don t know what this universe is using for narrativium  but land s where we ll see any intelligent life .     how do you define intelligence .   said ridcully .   in the long term  i mean .     universities are a good sign   said the dean  to general approval .    you don t think that perhaps fire and the wheel might be more universally indicative .   said ponder carefully .    not if you live in the water   said the senior wrangler .   the sea s the place here  i ll be bound .  on this world practically nothing happens on the land .     but in the water everything s eating each other .     then i ll look forward to seeing what happens to the last one served   said the senior wrangler .    no  when it comes to universities  the land s the place   said the dean .   paper won t last five minutes under water .  wouldn t you say so  librarian .    the librarian was still staring into the omniscope .    ook   he said .    what s that he said .   said ridcully .    he said  i think the senior wrangler might be right    said ponder  going over to the omniscope .   oh  .  .  .  look at this  .  .  .      the creature had at least four eyes and ten tentacles .  it was using some of the tentacles to manoeuvre a slab of rock against another slab .    it s building a bookcase .   said ridcully .    or possibly a crude rock shelter   said ponder stibbons .    there we are  then   said the senior wrangler .   personal property .  once something is yours  of course you want to improve it .  the first step on the road to progress .     i m not sure it s got actual legs   said ponder .    the first slither  then   said the senior wrangler  as the rock slipped from the creatures tentacles .   we should help it   he added firmly .   after all  it wouldn t be here if it wasn t for us .     hold on  hold on   said the lecturer in recent runes .   it s only making a shelter .  i mean  the bower bird builds intricate nests  doesn t it .  and the clock cuckoo even builds a clock for its mate  and no one says they re intelligent as such .     obviously not   said the dean .   they never get the numerals right  the clocks fall apart after a few months  and they generally lose two hours a day .  that doesn t sound like intelligence to me .     what are you suggesting  runes .   said ridcully .    why don t we send young rincewind down again in that virtu ally there suit .  with a trowel  perhaps  and an illustrated manual on basic construction .     would they be able to see him .     er  .  .  .  gentlemen  .  .  .   said ponder  who had been letting the eye of the omniscope drift further into the shallows .    i don t see why not   said ridcully .    er  .  .  .  there s a  .  .  .  there s  .  .  .     it s one thing to push planets around over millions of years  but at this level we couldn t even give our builder down there a heavy pat on the back   said the dean .   even if we knew which part of him was his back .     er  .  .  .  something s paddling  sir .  something s going for a paddle  sir .    it was probably the strangest cry of warning since the famous  should the reactor have gone that colour .   the wizards clustered around the omniscope .   something had gone for a paddle .  it had hundreds of little legs .       thirty   universals and parochials    chance may have played a greater role than we imagine in ensuring our presence on the earth .  not only aren t we the pinnacle of evolution  it s conceivable that we very nearly didn t appear at all .  on the other hand  if life had wandered off the particular evolutionary track that led to us  it might well have blundered into something similar instead .  intelligent crabs  for example .  or very brainy net weaving jellyfish .   we have no idea how many promising species got wiped out by a sudden drought  a collapse of some vital resource  a meteorite strike  or a collision with a comet .  all we have is a record of those species that happen to have left fossils .  when we look at the fossil record  we start to see a vague pattern  a tendency towards increasing complexity .  and many of the most important evolutionary innovations seem to have been associated with major catastrophes       when we look at today s organisms  some of them seem very simple while others seem more complex .  a cockroach looks a lot simpler than an elephant .  so we are liable to think of a cockroach as being  primitive  and an elephant as  advanced   or we may talk of  lower  and  higher  organisms .  we also remember that life has evolved  and that today s complex organisms must have had simpler ancestors  and unless we are very careful we think of today s  primitive  organisms as being typical of the ancestors of today s complex organisms .  we are told that humans evolved from something that looked more like an ape  and we conclude that chimpanzees are more primitive  in an evolutionary sense  than we are .   when we do this  we confuse two different things .  one is a kind of catalogue by complexity of today s organisms .  the other is a catalogue by time of today s organisms  yesterday s ancestors  the day before s ancestors of ancestors  and so on .  although today s cockroach may be primitive in the sense that it is simpler than an elephant  it is not primitive in the sense of being an ancient ancestral organism .  it can t be  it s today s cockroach  a dynamic go ahead cockroach that is ready to face the challenges of the new millennium .   although ancient fossil cockroaches have the same appearance as modern ones  they operated against a different backgrounds .  what you needed to be a viable cockroach in the cretaceous was probably rather different from what you need to be a viable cockroach today .  in particular  the dna of a cretaceous cockroach was probably significantly different from the dna of a modern cockroach .  your genes have to run very fast in order for your body to stand still .     the general picture of evolution that theorists have homed in on resembles a branching tree  with time rising like the sap from the trunk at the bottom  four billion years in the past  to the tips of the topmost twigs  the present .  each bough  branch  or twig represents a species  and all branches point upwards .  this  tree of life  picture is faithful to one key feature of evolution     once a branch has split  it doesn t join up again .  species diverge  but they can t merge .    however  the tree image is misleading in several respects .  there is  for instance  no relation between the thickness of a branch and the size of the corresponding population     the thick trunk at the bottom may represent fewer organisms  or less total organic mass  than the twig at the top .   think about the human twig  .  .  .   the way branches split may also be misleading  it implies a kind of long term continuity of species  even when new ones appear  because on a tree the new branches grow gradually out of the old ones .  darwin thought that speciation     the formation of new species     is generally gradual  but he may have been wrong .  the theory of  punctuated equilibrium  of stephen jay gould and niles eldredge maintains the contrary  speciation is sudden .  in fact there are excellent mathematical reasons for expecting speciation to have elements of both     sometimes sudden  sometimes gradual .   another problem with the tree of life image is that many of its branches are missing     many species go unrepresented in the fossil record .  the most misleading feature of all is the way humans get placed right at the top .  for psychological reasons we equate height with importance  as in the phrase  your royal highness    and we rather like the idea that we re the most important creature on the planet .  however  the height of a species in the tree of life indicates when it flourished  so every modern organism  be it a cockroach  a bee  a tapeworm  or a cow  is just as exalted as we are .   gould  in wonderful life  objected to the  tree  image for other reasons  and he based his objections on a remarkable series of fossils preserved in a layer of rock known as the burgess shale .  these fossils  which date from the start of the cambrian era   are the remains of soft bodied creatures living on mud banks at the base of an algal reef  which became trapped under a mudslide .  very few fossils of soft bodied creatures exist  because normally only the harder parts survive fossilization .  however  the significance of the burgess shale fossils went unrecognized from their discovery by charles walcott in       until harry whittington took a closer look at them in      .  the organisms were all squashed flat  and it was virtually impossible to recognize what shape they d been while alive .  then simon conway morris teased the squished layers apart  and reconstructed the original forms using a computer     and the strange secret of the burgess shale was revealed to the world .   until that point  palaeontologists had classified the burgess shale organisms into various conventional types     worms  arthropods  whatever .  but now it became clear that most of those assignments were mistaken .  we knew  for example  just four conventional types of arthropod  trilobites  now extinct   chelicerates  spiders  scorpions   crustaceans  crabs  shrimp   and uniramians  insects and others  .  the burgess shale contains representatives of all of these     but it also contains twenty other radically different types .  in that one mudslide  preserved in layers of shale like pressed flowers in the pages of a book  we find more diversity than in the whole of life today .   musing on this amazing discovery  gould realized that most branches of the tree of life that grew from the burgess beasts must have  snapped off  by way of extinction .  long ago     of those    arthropod body plans disappeared from the face of the earth .  the grim reaper was pruning the tree of life  and being heavy handed with the shears .  so gould suggested that a better image than a tree would be something like scrubland .  here and there  bushes  of species sprouted from the primal ground level .  most  however  ceased to grow  and were pruned to a standstill hundreds of millions of years ago .  other bushes grew to tall shrubs before stopping  .  .  .  and one tall tree made it right up to the present day .  or maybe we ve reconstructed it incorrectly  amalgamating several different trees into one .   this new image changes our view of human evolution .  one animal in the burgess shale  named pikaia  is a chordate .  this is the group that evolved into all of today s animals that have a spinal cord  including fishes  amphibians  reptiles  birds  and mammals .  pikaia is our distant ancestor .  another creature in the burgess shale  nectocaris  has an arthropod like front end but a chordate back  and it has left no surviving progeny .  yet they both shared the same environment  and neither is more obviously  fit  to survive than the other .  indeed  if one had been less evolutionarily fit  it would almost certainly have died out long before the fossils were formed .  so what determined which branch survived and which didn t .  gould s suggestion was  chance .   the burgess shale formed on a major geological boundary  at the end of the precambrian era and the start of the palaeozoic .  the early part of the palaeozoic is known as the cambrian period  and it is a time of enormous biological diversity     the  cambrian explosion  .  the earth s creatures were recovering from the mass extinction of the ediacarans  and evolution took the opportunity to play new games  because for a while it didn t matter much if it played them badly .  the  selection pressure  on new body plans was small because life hadn t fully recovered from the big die back .  in these circumstances  said gould  what survives and what does not is mostly a matter of luck     mudslide or no mudslide  dry climate or wet .  if you were to re run evolution past this point  it s quite likely that totally different organisms would survive  different branches of the tree of life would be snipped off .   second time round  it could easily be our branch that got pruned .     this vision of evolution as a  contingent  process  one with a lot of random chance involved  has a certain appeal .  it is a very strong way to make the point that humans are not the pinnacle of creation  not the purpose of the whole enterprise .   how could we be  if a few random glitches could have swept us from the board altogether .  however  gould rather overplayed his hand  and he backed off a bit in subsequent writings  .  one minor problem is that more recent reconstructions of the burgess shale beasts suggests that their diversity may have been somewhat overrated     though they were still very diverse .   but the main hole in the argument is convergence .  evolution settles on solutions to problems of survival  and often the range of solutions is small .  our present world is littered with examples of  convergent evolution   in which creatures have very similar forms but very different evolutionary histories .  the shark and the dolphin  for instance  have the same streamlined shape  pointed snout  and triangular dorsal fin .  but the shark is a fish and the dolphin is a mammal .   we can divide features of organisms into two broad classes  universals and parochials .  universals are general solutions to survival problems     methods that are widely applicable and which evolved independently on several occasions .  wings  for instance  are universals for flight  they evolved separately in insects  birds  bats  even flying fish .  parochials happen by accident  and there s no reason for them to be repeated .  our foodway crosses our airway  leading to lots of coughs and splutters when  something goes down the wrong way  .  this isn t a universal  we have it because it so happened that our distant ancestor who first crawled out of the ocean had it .  it s not even a terribly sensible arrangement     it just works well enough for its flaws not to count against us when combined with everything else that makes us human .  its deficiencies were tolerated from the first fish out of water  through amphibians and dinosaurs  to modern birds  and from amphibians through mammal like reptiles to mammals like us .  because evolution can t easily  un evolve  major features of body plans  we re stuck with it .   if our distant ancestors had got themselves killed off by accident  would anything like us still be around .  it seems very unlikely that creatures exactly like us would have turned up  because a lot of what makes us tick is parochials .  but intelligence looks like a clear case of a universal     cephalopods evolved intelligence independently of mammals  and anyway  intelligence is such a generic trick .  so it seems likely that some other form of intelligent life would have evolved instead  though not necessarily adhering to the same timetable .  on an alternative earth  intelligent crabs might invent a fantasy world shaped like a shallow bowl that rides on six sponges on the back of a giant sea urchin .  three of them could at this very moment be writing the science of dishworld .   sorry .  but it is true .  but for a fall of rock here  a tidal pattern there  we wouldn t have been us .  the interesting thing is that we almost certainly would have been something else .       there   s a silly reason for this  and a sensible one .  the silly reason is that species are usually defined to be different if they don   t interbreed .  if two separate species don   t interbreed  it   s difficult to put them back together again .  the sensible one is that evolution occurs by random mutations     changes to the dna code     followed by selection .  once a change has occurred  it   s unlikely for it to be undone by further random mutations .  it   s like driving along country roads at random  reaching some particular place  and then continuing at random .  what you don   t expect is to reverse your previous path and end up back where you started .       according to the most recent dating methods  the cambrian began     million years ago .  the burgess shale was deposited about         million years ago .       in the words of discworld   s god of evolution   the purpose of the whole thing is to be the whole thing .         thirty one   great leap sideways    rincewind was in his new office  filing rocks .  he d worked out quite a good system  based on size  shape  colour and twenty seven other qualities including whether or not he felt that it was a friendly sort of rock .   with careful attention to cross referencing  he reckoned that dealing with just those rocks in this room would take him at least three quiet  blessed years .   and he was therefore surprised to find himself picked up bodily and virtually carried towards the high energy magic building holding  in one hand  a hard square light grey rock and  in the other hand  a rock that appeared to be well disposed to people .    is this yours .   roared ridcully  stepping side to reveal the omniscope .   the luggage was now bobbing contently a few metres offshore .    er  .  .  .   said rincewind .   sort of mine .     so how did it get there .       er  .  .  .  it s probably looking for me   said rincewind .   sometimes it loses track .     but that s another universe .   said the dean .    sorry .     can you call it back .     good heavens  no .  if i could call it back  i d send it away .     sapient pearwood is meta magical and will track its owner absolutely anywhere in time and space   said ponder .    yes  but not this bit .   said ridcully .    i don t recall  not this bit  ever being recorded as a valid subset of  time and space   sir   said ponder .   in fact   not this bit  has never even been accepted as a valid part of any magical invocation  ever since the late funnit the foregetful tried to use it as a last minute addition to his famously successful spell to destroy the entire tree he was sitting in .     the luggage may consist of a subset of at least n dimensions which may co exist with any other set of  n dimensions   said the bursar .    don t pay any attention  stibbons   said ridcully wearily .   he s been spouting this stuff ever since he tried to understand hex s write out .  it s completely gibberish .  what s    n     then  old chap .     umpt   said the bursar .    ah  imaginary numbers again   said the dean .   that s the one he says should come between three and four .     there isn t a number between three and four   said ridcully .    he imagines there is   said the dean .    could we get inside the luggage in order to physically go into the project universe .   said ponder .    you could try   said rincewind .   i personally would rather saw my own nose off .     ah .  really .     but the thought occurs   said ridcully   that we can use it to bring things back .  eh .    down under the warm water  the strange creature s stone structure collapsed for the umpteenth time .     a week went past .  on tuesday a left over snowball collided with the planet  causing considerable vexation to the wizards and destroying an entire species of net weaving jellyfish of which the senior wrangler had professed great hopes .  but at least the luggage could be used to bring back any specimens stupid enough to swim into something sitting underwater with its lid open  and this included practically everything in the sea at the moment .   life in the round world seemed to possess a quality so prevalent that the wizards even discussed the idea that it was some conceptual element  which was perhaps trying to fill the gap left by the nonexistent deitygen .    however   ridcully announced   bloodimindium is not a good name .     perhaps if we change the accent slightly   said the lecturer in recent runes .   blod di min dium  do you think .     they ve certainly got a lot of it  whatever we call it   said the dean .   it s not a world to let a complete catastrophe get it down .    things turned up .  shellfish suddenly seemed very popular  a theory gaining ground was that the world itself was generating them in some sort of automatic way .    obviously  if you have too many rabbits  you need to invent foxes   said the dean  at one of the regular meetings .   if you ve got fish  and you want phosphates  you need seabirds .     that only works if you have narrativium   said ponder  we ve got no evidence  sir  that anything on the planet has any concept of causality .  things just live and die .    and then  on thursday  the senior wrangler spotted a fish .  a real  swimming fish .    there you are   he said triumphantly .   the seas are the natural home of life .  look at the land .  it s just rubbish  quite frankly .     but the sea s not getting anywhere   said ridcully .   look at those tentacled shellfish you were trying to educate yesterday .  even if you so much as made a sudden movement they just squirted ink at you and swam away .     no  no  they were trying to communicate   the senior wrangler insisted .   ink is a natural medium  after all .  don t you get the impression that everything is striving .  look at them .  you can see them thinking  can t you .    there were a couple of the things in a tank behind him  peering out of their big spiral shells .  the senior wrangler had the idea that they could be taught simple tasks  which they would then pass on to the other ammonites .  they were turning out to be rather a disappointment .  they might be good at thinking  ran the general view  but they were pants at actually doing anything about it .    that s because here s no point in being able to think if you haven t got much to think about   said the dean .   damn all to think about in the sea .  tide comes in  tide goes out  everything s damp  end of philosophical discourse .     now these are the chaps   he went on  strolling along to another tank .  the luggage had been quite good as a collector  provided the specimens didn t appear to be threatening rincewind .    hmph   sniffed the senior wrangler .   underwater woodlice .     but there s a lot of them   said the dean .   and they have legs .  i ve seen them on the seashore .     by accident .  and they haven t got anything to use as hands .     ah  well  i m glad you ve pointed that out  .  .  .   said the dean  walking along to the next aquarium .   it contained crabs .   the senior wrangler had to admit that crabs looked a good contender for highest lifeform status .  hex had located some on the other side of the world that were moving along very well indeed  with small underwater cities guarded by carefully transplanted sea anemones and what appeared to be shellfish farms .  they had even invented a primitive form of warfare and had built statues  of sand and spit  apparently to famous crabs who had fallen in the struggle .   the wizards went and had another look fifty thousand years later  after coffee .  to the dean s glee  population pressure had forced the crabs on to the land as well .  the architecture hadn t improved  but there were now seaweed farms in the lagoons  and some apparently more stupid crabs had been enslaved for transport purposes and use in inter clan campaigns .  several large rafts with crudely woven sails were moored in one lagoon  and swarming with crabs .  it seemed that crabkind was planning a great leap sideways .  .    not quite there yet   said ridcully .   but definitely very promising  dean .     you see  water s too easy   said the dean .   your food floats by  there s not much in the way of weather  there s nothing to kick against .  .  .  mark my words  the land is the place for building a bit of backbone  .  .  .    there was a clatter from hex  and the field of vision of the omniscope was pulled back rapidly until the world was just a marble floating in space .    oh dear   said the archchancellor  pointing to a trail of gas   incoming .    the wizards watched gloomily as a large part of one hemisphere became a cauldron of steam and fire .    is this going to happen every time .   said the dean  as the smoke died away and spread out across the seas .    i blame the over large sun and all those planets   said ridcully .    and you fellows should have cleared out the snowballs .  sooner or later  they fall in .     it d just be nice for a species to make a go of things for five minutes without being frozen solid or broiled   said the senior wrangler .    that s life   said ridcully .    but not for long   said the senior wrangler .   there was a whimper from behind them .   rincewind hung in the air  the outline of the virtually there suit shimmering around him .    what s up with him .   said ridcully .    er  .  .  .  i asked him to investigate the crab civilization  sir .     the one the comet just landed on .     yes  sir .  a billion tons of rock have just evaporated around him  sir .     it couldn t have hurt him  though  could it .     probably made him jump  sir .        thirty two   don   t look up    the wizards have been convinced all along that a planet is not really a good place to put living creatures .  a nice  flat disc  with an attendant turtle who can deal with any inbound rocks before they can wreak havoc  makes much more sense .   it looks increasingly as if they re right .  the more we learn about the history of our planet  and the greater universe in which it resides  the more we have to admit that the wizards have a point .  not about the shape of our world  but about how dangerously exposed it is without a turtle .  the universe is riddled with flying rocks and awash with radiation  most of it is either close to absolute zero or hot enough to make a hydrogen bomb seem like a nice  comfortable bonfire .  yet  somehow  life managed to gain a hold on at least one planet  and to retain that hold for four billion years     despite everything that the universe threw at it .   often literally .   and despite every kind of nasty that the planet itself managed to concoct .   there are two ways to interpret this .   one is that life is incredibly fragile  and that earth is one of the few places where the conditions necessary for life managed to hold together long enough for life to develop  diversify  and thrive .  at any moment some disaster could undo all that good work and wipe the face of the planet clean of living creatures .  the crab civilisation is fictitious  of course  but it s in our story to make two important points .  first  that there has been plenty of time for lifeforms at least as intelligent as us to evolve on earth  second  that if they had done  they could easily have left no trace of their existence .  oh  and third .  .  .  that there are plenty of ways in which they could have come to a sticky end .  so we ve been incredibly lucky to avoid going the way of the crab civilisation .  on millions of other apparently suitable worlds  life was not so lucky  it either never got started  or something wiped it out .  life is a rarity  earth may be the only place in the entire universe where that fragile miracle happened .   the other is that life is incredibly robust  and that the conditions on earth are sufficient for life to arise  but by no means necessary .  just because things worked out in a particular way here  it would be a mistake to conclude that the same events must happen everywhere else .  an important implication of evolution is that life automatically adapts itself to whichever environment happens to be available .  boiling water at the bottom of the ocean .  just what extremophile bacteria need .  two miles down in the rocks .  super     it s nice and warm down there  and there s plenty sulphur and iron to provide energy .  thank providence there s none of that poisonous oxygen  terrible stuff  violently reactive  immensely destructive .  nothing could survive in an oxygen atmosphere  .  .  .   both points of view have their advocates  and both have a certain amount going for them .  until we get to other worlds and find out what s there  there will be plenty of room for disagreement and debate .  and  perhaps  a synthesis .  already both viewpoints agree that however life arose here  earth was no garden of eden .  our planet is by no means the ideal habitat for life .  in order for living creatures to survive  evolution has had to solve a lot of difficult problems  and adapt to hostile conditions .   you may not realise just how hostile .  but think of the common disasters  fires  hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  volcanoes  tidal waves  floods  droughts  .  .  .  too much rain and we re up to our necks in water  too little and our crops won t grow and we starve .   but those are feeble compared to the big disasters .     we tend to think of the history of life on earth as the smooth growth of a single great evolutionary tree .  but that image is getting very long in the tooth .  the history of life is more like a jungle than a tree  and most of the plants in the jungle were strangled  squashed  or suffocated before they took even the first step on the road to maturity .  and however that jungle grew  there was nothing smooth about it .   true  there was a very long time when there were only  blobs  in the seas  and we might think of that period as a fairly featureless trunk of the tree .  as far as the blobs were concerned  life probably was pretty uneventful     but only because they didn t notice what was happening to the planet .  they were largely unaffected by a whole succession of events that would have been cosmic catastrophes for later  more complex life .   there were certainly a few pretty big impacts at the beginning of life on the planet that didn t put them out of business  such as it was .  and snowball earth     if in fact it ever happened     can t have been easy .  but despite all these obstacles  or even because of them  life slowly changed  evolved and diversified as the eukaryotes learned to live in an oxygen atmosphere .   that should have been a disaster .  the very composition of the atmosphere changed  and all the biochemical tricks that had evolved to suit the available range of gases became obsolete .  worse  the gas polluting the air was oxygen  an appallingly reactive substance .  think of what would happen today if the atmosphere started to be taken over by fluorine .  some of the nastiest  most explosive substances are fluorine compounds .  but oxygen is just as bad  if not worse  think of fires  think of rust  think of decay .   the eukaryote cell triumphed over oxygen  and subverted it .  oxygen s negative characteristics were turned into positive ones .  so effective was this evolutionary revolution that the deadly  poisonous pollutant became essential for  most  life .  deprive a human  a dog  or a fish of its oxygen  and it dies very quickly .  water  food  .  .  .  those it can do without  for a time .  but oxygen .  you ll survive for a few minutes at most  maybe half an hour if you re a whale .   the oxygen trick was so good that it took over .  eukaryote life radiated     diversified rapidly     in the seas  inventing entire new kinds of ecologies .  with that diversification as a springboard  life came out on land .  the advantage of moving to the land was that it opened up an entire range of new habitats  new ways of making a living .  so many new kinds of living organism could thrive .  one disadvantage  though  was that living on land made life much more vulnerable to astronomical insults .  living on land produced many more complicated kinds of plants and animals  able to protect themselves against small local changes  like hot sunshine  or snow .  but  ironically  that very complication made them much more vulnerable to big problems     like stones falling from the sky .   we all know about the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs  .  .  .  and that fits .  dinosaurs were wonderfully effective as long as the environment remained suitable  but they were not at all well adapted to the sudden changes that the impact created .  but bacteria hardly noticed .  if anything  it was a good time for them  they got a lot of extra food for a few hundred years  as the corpses decayed  and then went back to the old boring routine .   we ll say a bit more about the     million year reign of the dinosaurs and their friends soon  and indeed about what killed them off .  but we need to give you some context first .  simple forms of life can put up with a lot  and did .  and they changed the planet  or at least its outer skin  by putting in feedback loops that made it less liable to change .   they started gaia .  this is the name that james lovelock gave in      to the concept of the earth as a complex living system     metaphorically  an organism in its own right .  the idea has been romanticised into the earth being a kind of earth mother  but what do you expect when you attach the name of a goddess to your new scientific concept .  stripped of the romantic frills  the point is that our planet acts as a single system  and it has evolved mechanisms that keep it functioning effectively .  this development is a consequence of innumerable subsystems     organisms  ecologies     evolving mechanisms that keep them functioning effectively .  if every member of a team gets better at playing their role within the team  then the team as a whole improves too .     complexity is a double edged sword .  more complex forms of life find that the ordinary problems of living on a planet are more and more under control  .  .  .  except for those confounded problems from outside  like meteorites  which can be disastrous .   the moon  mercury  mars  and various satellites are covered in circular craters  some large  some small .  nearly all of those craters  we now know  result from the impact of a big lump of rock or ice or a bit of both .  a few are volcanic .  not so long ago most were thought to be caused by volcanoes  but that turned out to be wrong .   several planets  among them the earth  do not show obvious signs of impacts .  is that because nothing hit them .  no .  an atmosphere helps  smaller bodies burn up before they hit the ground .  it s the closest to a protector turtle that we get .  but bigger rocks can still get through the defences .  the main reason why some planets show no clear signs of impacts is because those planets have weather  like the earth  which erodes the craters until they disappear  or episodes of massive vulcanism  like venus  which resurfaces the planet  or are gas to begin with  like jupiter and saturn  and don t show permanent marks .   in quebec there is a lake called manicouagan .  you can t miss it on a map  look near     n      w .  it s circular  and it s big     miles     km  in diameter .  it is the weathered remains of a gigantic crater that formed     million years ago when a rock two or three miles     km  across collided with the earth .  there is a central peak made from rock that melted in the heat that the impact generated and then solidified  more molten rock flowed across the floor of the crater and still can be found today .  the lake fills a ring shaped valley that glaciers carved out of soft rock that originally formed the crater walls  and was eroded away and collapsed .   also in canada is the sudbury impact structure  the largest on the planet .  it is     miles      km  across and   .    billion years old  and the rock that made it was about    miles    km  in diameter  and the energy released in the impact was equivalent to one quadrillion tons of tnt  or about ten million really big hydrogen bombs .  in vredefort  south africa there is another impact structure of a similar size  formed   .    billion years ago .  these may not remain the record holders  an even bigger impact structure  about iwice the size  is suspected to exist in the amirante basin of the indian ocean .  altogether  more than     impact structures     remnants of craters     have been found on the earth s land masses  and many areas have not yet been thoroughly surveyed .  more than half the earth s surface is ocean  and incoming rocks should hit pretty much at random  so the total number is probably closer to     .   these are all fairly ancient craters  but there is no good reason to believe that such impacts could not happen again .  big impacts are rarer than small ones  because big lumps of rock are rarer than small ones .  impacts the size of sudbury or vredefort should happen about once every billion years .   it should not be a surprise that when such impacts finally did arrive  about two billion years ago  two of them came along together .   since nothing that size has happened for two billion years  it might seems that we are overdue for another one  but that kind of reasoning is a statistical fallacy .  rare  isolated events usually obey the so called  poisson distribution  of probabilities  and one feature of this distribution is that it  has no memory  .  at any time  whether two major impacts have just happened  or none have happened for ages  the average time to the next one is always the same     in this case  a billion years .   it could be a few decades  mind you .  but it couldn t be tomorrow  or even next year  because we would have spotted such a body coming by now .   the most recent well known impact on earth was the tunguska meteorite  which exploded   miles   km  above siberia in       causing an explosion that felled trees for more than thirty miles     km  around .  craters  or other evidence of even more recent impacts have been found .  a double crater in the saudi arabian desert may be only a few centuries old .     where do all these rocks  and other junk  like ice  come from .  who or what is throwing them at us .   first  some terminology .  when you look into the night sky and see a  shooting star   a glowing streak  that s a meteor .  it s not a star  of course  it s a lump of cosmic debris that has hit the earth s atmosphere at high speed and is burning up because of friction .  the debris itself is called a meteoroid  and any part that remains when it has hit is called a meteorite .  for convenience  though  we ll generally use the word  meteorite  for all of these .  but we thought we ought to show you that we could have been pedantic if we d wanted to .   some of these bodies are mostly rock  and some are mostly ice .  and some are a bit of both .  wherever they come from  it s not the earth .  at least  not directly .  a few may have been splashed off the earth by a previous impact and then come back down the next time we ran into them .  however they got up there  that s clearly where they are coming from .  what s up there .  the rest of the universe .  the closest bit is our own solar system .  so that has to be the most likely culprit .  and there s no question that it has a lot of ammunition .   earlier  we described the solar system as being rather chaotic  nine planets and a few moons with some quite interesting real estate .  we mentioned that there was quite a lot left over after these larger bodies were accounted for .  there were relatively small lumps of actual rock in the asteroid belt  but nearly all the  loose change   after the sun and planets had been paid for out of the solar nebula  was lumps of dirty ice .   the biggest collection of these is the oort cloud  a vast  very thinly spread mass that lives outside the solar system  proper      that is  further out than pluto  or neptune when pluto gets inside the orbit of neptune  which can happen  .  in      jan hendrik oort proposed that the source of most of the comets we see from earth must be some such cloud  and got it named after him .  the main evidence we have for its existence is that comets with very long thin orbits  which are common  must have come from somewhere .  the bodies in the oort cloud range from pebble sized up to lumps perhaps as big as pluto .   these comet materials are the usual source of the meteorites we pick up and put into museums  after most of their substance has burnt up in the atmosphere .  we re beginning to get an idea of how big the oort cloud could be .  its mass is about a tenth that of jupiter  and it extends way outside pluto s orbit  perhaps as far as   light years     two thirds of the way to the nearest star .  this spreads i he material though a volume millions of times as great the volume inside pluto s orbit  our actual planetary solar system .  so the  cloud  is so rarefied that if you went there  you probably wouldn t see anything .   the gravitational pull of the sun is tiny at those distances  and the dirty ice lumps barely move along their orbital paths  which are probably close to circles .  to the extent that the ice lumps have orbits  and don t just drift slowly about  they take millions of years to go once round the sun .  but the universe doesn t let them keep doing that without interference .  oort called his cloud  a garden  gently raked by stellar perturbations  .  as nearer stars  and the pull of the whole galaxy  interact with the sun s pull  many of these lumps are pulled away from their normal paths .   it turns out that the disturbances need not be as gentle as oort supposed .  about once every    million years a star passes through the oort cloud  and havoc ensues .  since the     s another source of big disturbances has been recognised  giant molecular clouds .  these are huge accumulations of cold hydrogen  where stars and solar systems are born .  their masses can be a million times that of the sun .  they don t have to come anywhere near us to shake ice lumps out of their sedate near circular orbits in the oort cloud .   such disturbances can cause lumps of ice to drift in towards the solar system .  at that point  they become comets .  some probably drift outwards too  but we re not so concerned with those .  and comets are the main  but not the only  source of cosmic junk in earth s backyard .   about a thousand meteoroids bigger than a football hit earth s atmosphere each day  together with countless millions of smaller ones .  and as time passes  we receive some big and some bigger  with the occasional dinosaur killer .  how often do we expect to see such a big one .  about once every hundred million years .   there is much more of this kind of junk in the solar system than we used to think  and it rains down on our planet constantly .  every year  we sweep up about        tones  tonnes  of it .  nearly all of the debris falling on earth is little bits  mostly somewhat dried out icy dirt from the tails of comets .  debris of this kind follows the comet s orbit  marking it out like a gravel path .  when the earth s orbit takes it through this cometary junkheap  some of the gravel burns up in the atmosphere  and we see spectacular light shows  meteor showers .  these arrive on particular dates each year as the earth passes through that debris .  for example the leonids can be seen in november  and the perseids in august .   there is a bit of a mystery about the geminid meteor showers  which come in december  though .  they seem to be associated with a  defunct  comet whose perihelion  closest approach to the sun  is out by pluto s orbit .  and that brings us to another source of impactors  the kuiper belt  which is the bit of the oort cloud not very far outside pluto .  in fact  pluto and its satellite charon are now thought not to be a  real  planet and moon  but only the biggest lump in the kuiper belt .  these lumps travel in genuine quasi elliptical orbits  and may be the source of some of the regular comets with shorter orbital periods     like halley s comet  which returns every    years or so .   as well as comets  the asteroids also send rocks our way .  jupiter s gravitational field is strong enough to disturb the asteroids  especially those in certain  resonant  orbits  with periods that are a simple fraction of jupiter s    one third or two fifths  say .  of the      or so known asteroids  about one in twenty has an orbit that comes close to that of the earth  or even crosses it .  all of those that cross are potential impactors .  asteroids whose orbits approach the sun to within a distance of   .   times the radius of the earth s orbit are said to be earth approaching asteroids  or amors .  the best known of these is eros .  asteroids whose orbits overlap the earth s are called apollos .  more than     amors and apollos are known .  more worrying are atens  which are amors too small to be detected easily but still big enough to cause tremendous damage .  most of these probably started out in the main asteroid belt  but were disturbed by jupiter so that they crossed the orbit of mars  and were then further disturbed by mars .   this leaves us with two opposite ways to view jupiter     perhaps complementary ways .  this largest planet has been proposed as the saviour of earth s life forms on countless occasions  its enormous gravity picking up nearly all of the in falling rocks and icy lumps     as it did comet shoemaker levy   in      .  but it has also been shown to shake the asteroid belt about  possibly causing that dinosaur killer  if it was actually an asteroid  to hit the earth .   the message is that a basketball left on a billiard table has a fairly interesting life .  velikovsky  who proposed a wild theory in the fifties that made the solar system look very much like a snooker table in biblical times  with mars moving substantially closer to the earth and venus turning from a comet into a planet  wasn t very wrong in principle .   only in every single detail .     here s something else to worry about .  out there in the milky way galaxy there s a lot of stars .  occasionally one goes nova  rarely supernova  as they explode .  there is a sphere of very active radiation leaving such stars .  if one went off in our vicinity  up to twenty light years away  say  all higher forms on earth would be sterilised  at least .  the bacteria  especially those deep in the earth s crust  would survive .  they probably wouldn t notice a thing .  wait a few billion years  .  .  .  higher lifeforms could exist in abundance once more .   more worrying still are gamma ray bursters .  gamma rays are very short wavelength electromagnetic radiation  such as x rays .  when astronomers managed to develop instruments that could detect such radiation  and put them into satellites  they discovered that two or three times per day the earth is illuminated by an intense burst of gamma rays coming from somewhere out in space .  these gamma ray bursts seem to be extremely energetic  there is good evidence that the source of one of them was    billion light years away .  even a supernova would not be visible from that distance  so gamma ray bursts have to be caused by something really serious .   what .  that s a mystery     perhaps the biggest mystery in today s astronomy .  the best bet is a collision between neutron stars .  imagine a binary star     two stars  orbiting their common centre of mass .  suppose they are both neutron stars .  as time passes  they lose energy and fall in towards each other .  if you wait long enough  they will come so close together that they collide .  this  by the way  is likely to be a very messy business  not at all as simple as two tennis balls sticking together and rounding off .  they probably break up and reform .  so far  all the gamma ray bursters we ve seen are a long  long distance away .  but one could light up anywhere .  if a pair of neutron stars collapsed on to each other within a hundred light years of earth  life might survive in the deep seas and the deepest rocks  but the rest of our planet would be dead .   and we wouldn t even see it coming .   asteroids and comets give you a bit of notice .  we have the capability  given a year s run up time  to tackle small earth crossing asteroids now .  we can see them coming and plot their arrival .  but gamma rays are electromagnetic  they travel at the speed of light .  they could be on their way now  we couldn t know .  as soon as we did know  we and our technology would be dead .     even our own sun is not trustworthy .  the nuclear reactions that make stars burn also make them change  as elements are created or used up  or just reach some critical level that triggers new kinds of reactions .  most stars follow the same series of changes  called the main sequence .   when the sun first arrives on the main sequence  it is just like our sun  with a surface temperature of about       degrees kelvin  a light output of about     septillion watts  and a composition of     hydrogen      helium  and    everything else .  it stays on the main sequence for ten billion years  until nearly all of its hydrogen has been fused into helium .  at that point  its core starts to contract  and becomes degenerate     consisting of closely packed neutrons .  outside the core there remains a shell of hydrogen  which continues to undergo nuclear reactions  which cause the outer layers of the star to expand and cool .  the star becomes a red giant  between    and     times as big .   the radius of the sun now is roughly         miles          km  .  at this stage its surface will probably be somewhere between the orbits of mercury and venus  and the earth will already be in serious trouble .  but there is more to come .  as the core heats  it ignites a nuclear reaction that turns helium into carbon     the very reaction that allegedly is responsible for the existence of carbon based lifeforms like us .  this  helium flash  happens very quickly  on astronomical timescales  and it destroys the degeneracy of the core .  now the core can once more sustain nuclear reactions  but now it burns helium .  the outer layers of the star shrink  and become hotter .   when the helium in the core is used up  the star again burns its nuclear material in two shells  an inner one that burns helium to make carbon  and an outer one that converts hydrogen to helium .  the outer layers expand again  and the star becomes a red giant for the second time .  now the outer layers start to blow away  exposing the hot core .  the star loses layer upon layer of its material  and shrinks .  finally  the outer layers are all gone  and the core once more becomes degenerate .  the star has become a white dwarf .   our sun has about   .   billion years left on the main sequence  then  kerblooie .  red giant  and earth becomes a cinder or even gets gobbled up completely .  but don t lose any sleep over it .  the typical lifetime of a species is   million years .  we ll be long gone .     planets are not comfortable .  even when life has made its own bed  nice oxygenated atmosphere with an ozone layer to keep out the nasty ultra violet  nice ooze in the bottom of the oceans  nice long relaxation times for the thermal atmospheric oscillators   there are still plenty of things the universe can throw at a planet that can still make it a bit fragile .  if not kill it altogether .   which brings us back to our original question .  is life fragile  and have we been extraordinarily lucky .  or is it robust  and therefore common .  is life so adaptable that it can handle virtually anything that the universe sends its way .   until we can explore other worlds and see what kinds of life  if any  are present  anything we say here has to be speculative .  the big difficulty is an  anthropic principle  point .  suppose that life is incredibly rare  and that on most worlds it never really gets going  or doesn t last long  because of all the disasters lying in wait .  nonetheless  there s a lot of galaxies out there  each having billions or even trillions of stars .  even if the chances of survival are very  very small  occasionally one planet will get lucky .  some proportion of planets must get lucky  that s how probability works .   because life on this world has survived  we are therefore one of the lucky ones .  it then becomes completely irrelevant how small our chances were .  we are not representative .  the probability that we survived is certainty  because we did .  so we cannot reason  from our existence  that the chance of survival has to be fairly large .  whether it is large or small  we are here .  so this is a case where the anthropist can legitimately frighten us .  perhaps all planets do get life and  if they re allowed enough time  even extelligent life on a few .  but we really could be the only one who s survived to ask the question .   on the other hand  .  .  .  the very diversity of nasty things that the universe has up its sleeve argues for the adaptability and versatility of life .  life on earth does not look like a bunch of lucky survivors .  it looks like a bunch of tough guys who have overcome every obstacle put in their way .  sure  they took casualties  sometimes severe  but as long as a few survive the battle  pretty soon the planet is covered with life again  because life reproduces     fast .  whatever the disaster  it bounces back .   so far  anyway .       thirty three   the future is newt    hex was thinking hard again .  running the little universe was taking much less time than it had expected .  it more or less ran itself now  in fact .  the gravity operated without much attention  rainclouds formed with no major interference and rained every day .  balls went around one another .   hex didn t think it was a shame about the crabs going .  hex hadn t thought it was marvellous that the crabs had turned up .  hex thought about the crabs as something that had happened .  but it had been interesting to eavesdrop on crabbity     the way the crabs named themselves  thought about the universe  in terms of crabs   had legends of the great crab clearly visible in the moon  passed on in curious marks the thoughts of great crabs  and wrote down poetry about the nobility and frailty of crab life  being totally accurate  as it turned out  on this last point .   hex wondered  if you have life  then intelligence will arise somewhere .  if you have intelligence  then extelligence will arise somewhere .  if it doesn t  intelligence hasn t got much to be intelligent about .  it was the difference between one little oceanic crustacean and an entire wall of chalk .   the machine also wondered if it should pass on these insights to the wizards  especially since they actually lived in one of the world s more interesting outcrops of extelligence .  but hex knew that its creators were infinitely cleverer than it was .  and great masters of disguise  obviously .     the lecturer in recent runes had designed a creature .    really  all we need is a basic limpet or whelk  to begin with   he said  as they looked at the blackboard .   we bring it back here where proper magic works  try a few growth spells  and then let nature take its course .  and  since these extinctions seem to be wiping out everything  it ll gradually become the dominant feature .     what s the scale again .   said ridcully  critically .    about two miles to the tip of the cone   said the lecturer .   about four miles across the base .     not very mobile  then   said the dean .    the weight of the shell will certainly hamper it  but i imagine it should be able to move its own length in a year  perhaps two .     what ll it eat  then .     everything else .     such as .  .  .     everything .  i d advise suction holes around the base here so that it can filter seawater for useful things like plankton .     plankton being     .     oh  whales  shoals of fish and so on .    the wizards looked long and hard at the huge cone shaped object .    intelligence .   said ridcully .    what for .   said the lecturer in recent runes .    ah .     it will withstand anything except a direct hit with a comet  and i estimate it ll have a lifespan of about         years .     and then it ll die .   said ridcully .    yes .  i estimate it will  by then  take it twenty four hours and one second to absorb enough food to last it for twenty four hours .     so after that it will be dead .     yes .     will it know .     probably not .     back to the drawing board  senior lecturer .      ponder sighed .    it s no good ducking   he said .   that won t help .  we re paying special attention to comets .  we ll let you know in plenty of time .     you ve got no idea what it was like .   said rincewind  creeping along the beach .   and the noise .     have you seen the luggage .     it certainly made my ears ring  i can tell you .     and the luggage .     what .  oh  .  .  .  gone .  have you looked at that side of the planet .  there s a whole new set of mountain ranges .    the wizards had let time run forward for a while after the strike .  it made such a depressing mess of everything .  now  drawing on its bottomless reserves of bloodimindium  life was returning in strength .  crabs were already back although  here  at least  they didn t seem inclined to make even simple structures .  perhaps something in their souls told them it d be a waste of time in the long run .   rincewind mentally crossed them off the list .  look for signs of intelligence  the archchancellor had said .  as far as rincewind was concerned  anything really intelligent would be keeping out of the way of the wizards .  if you saw a wizard looking at you  rincewind would advise  then you should walk into a tree or say  dur .   .   all along the beaches  and out below the surf  everything was acting with commendable stupidity .   a soft sound made him look down .  he d almost stepped on a fish .   it was some way from the water line  and squirming across the mud towards a pool of brackish water .   a kind man by nature  rincewind picked it up gingerly and carried it back to the sea .  it flopped around in the shallows for a while and then  to his amazement  inched its way back on to the mud .   he put it back again  in deeper water this time .   thirty seconds kter  it was back on the beach .   rincewind crouched down  as the thing wiggled determinedly onwards .    would it help to talk to someone .   he said .   i mean  you ve got a good life out there in the sea  no sense in throwing it all away  is there .  there s always a silver lining if you know where to look .  okay  okay  life s a beach .  and you re a pretty ugly fish .  but  you know  beauty is only sk    scale deep  and          what s happening .   said ponder s voice in his ear .    i was talking to this fish   said rincewind .    why .     it keeps coming out of the water .  it seems to want to go for whatever is the opposite of a paddle .     well .     you told me to keep a look out for anything interesting .     the consensus here is that fish aren t interesting   said ponder .   fish are dull .     i can see bigger fish in the shallows   said rincewind .  terhaps it s trying to keep away from them .     rincewind  fish are designed for living in water that s why they re fish .  go and find some crabs .  and put the poor freakish thing back in the sea  for goodness  sake .       perhaps a rethink is in order here   said ridcully .    about the newts   said ponder .    newts is going far too far   said the dean .   i ve seen more shapely things in the privy .     i want the person who put the newts on this continent to own up right now   said ridcully .    no one could   said the senior wrangler .   no one s seen the luggage since the last comet .  we couldn t get anything in there .     i know  because i had a tank of thaumically treated whelks all ready to go   said the lecturer in recent runes .   and what  pray  am i supposed to do with them .     some sort of chowder would appear to be in order   said the dean .    evolution makes things better   said ridcully .   it can t make them different .  all right  some rather dull amphibians seem to have turned up .  but  and this is important  those fish rincewind reported are still around .  now  if they were going to turn into things with legs  why are they still here .     tadpoles are fish   said the bursar .    but a tadpole knows it s going to be a frog   said ridcully patiently .   there s no narrativium on this world .  that fish couldn t be saying to itself  ah  a new life beckons on dry land  walking around on things i haven t yet got a name for .    no  either the planet is somehow generating new life  or we re back to the old  hidden gods  theory .     it s all gone wrong  you know   said the dean .   it s the bloodi mindium .  even gods couldn t control this place .  once there s life  there s complete and utter chaos .  remember that book the librarian brought back .  it s a complete fantasy .  nothing seems to happen like that at all .  everything just does what it likes .     progress is being made   said ponder .    big amphibians .   sneered the senior wrangler .   and things were going so well in the sea .  remember those jellyfish that made nets .  and the crabs even had a flourishing land civilization .  they had practically got a culture .     they ate captured enemies alive   said the lecturer in recent runes  patiently .    well .  .  .  yes .  but with a certain amount of etiquette  at least   the senior wrangler admitted .   and in front of their sand statue of the great big crab .  they were obviously attempting to control their world .  and what good did it do them .  a million tons of white hot ice smack between the eyestalks .  it s so upsetting .     perhaps they should have eaten more enemies   said the dean .    perhaps sooner or later the planet will get the message   said ridcully .    time for the giant whelks  perhaps .   said the lecturer in recent runes  hopefully .    big newts is what we ve got right now   said ridcully .  he glanced at the dean and senior wrangler .  ridcully hadn t maintained his position atop the boiling heap of uu wizardry without a little political savvy .   and newts  gentlemen  might be the way to go .  amphibians .  at home in the water and on land .  the best of both worlds  i fancy .    the two wizards exchanged sheepish glances .    well  .  .  .  i suppose  .  .  .   said the senior wrangler .    could be   the dean said grudgingly .   could be .     there we are then   said ridcully happily .   the future is newt .        thirty four   nine times out of ten    there s no narrativium on this world .    let s take a step away from the unfolding ancestral tale of the fish that came out from the sea and look at a more philosophical issue .   the wizards are puzzled .  on discworld  things happen because narrative imperative makes them happen .  there is no choice about ends  only about means .  the lecturer in recent runes is trying to make a sustainable lifeform happen .  he thinks that the obstacle to sustainability is the fragility of life     so the only way he can see to achieve this is the two mile limpet  proof against everything the sky can drop on it .   it never occurs to him that lifeforms might achieve sustainability by other  less direct methods  despite the evidence of his eyes that suggests that a dogged tenacity appears to allow life to arise in the most inhospitable environment  effectively re creating itself over and over again .  the wizards are torn between evidence that a planet is the last place you d choose to create life  and evidence that life doesn t agree .   on discworld  it is clearly recognized that million to one chances happen nine times out of ten .   the reason is that every discworld character lives out a story  and the demands of the story determine how their lives unfold .  if a million to one chance is required to keep that story on track  then that s what will happen  appalling odds notwithstanding .  on discworld  abstractions generally show up as things  so there is even a thing     narrativium     that ensures that everybody obeys the narrative imperative .  another personification of the abstract  death  also makes sure that each individual s story comes to an end exactly when it s supposed to .  even if a character tries to behave contrary to the story in which they find themselves  narrativium makes sure that the end result is consistent with the story anyway .   what s puzzling the wizards is that our world isn t like that  .  .  .   or is it .   after all  people live on our world too  and it s people that drive stories .   as case in point  a story about people who drive .  the setting is jerez grand prix circuit  last race of the         formula one motor racing season  .  .  .  ace driver michael schumacher is one championship point ahead of arch rival jacques villeneuve .  villeneuve s team mate heinz harold frentzen may well play a crucial tactical role .  the drivers are competing for  pole position  on the starting grid  which goes to whoever produces the fastest lap in the qualifying sessions .  so what happens .  unprecedentedly  villeneuve  schumacher  and frentzen all lap in   minute    .     seconds  the same time to a thousandth of a second .  an amazing coincidence .   well   coincidence  it surely was     the lap times coincided .  but was it truly amazing .   questions like this arise in science  too  and they re important .  how significant is a statistical cluster of leukaemia cases near a nuclear installation .  does a strong correlation between lung cancer and having a smoker in the family really indicate that secondary smoking is dangerous .  are sexually abnormal fish a sign of oestrogen like chemicals in our water supply .   a case in point .  it is said that     of the children of israeli fighter pilots are girls .  what is it about the life of a fighter pilot that produces such a predominance of daughters .  could an answer lead to a breakthrough in choosing the sex of your children .  or is it just a statistical freak .  it s not so easy to decide .  gut feelings are worse than useless  because human beings have a rather poor intuition for random events .  many people believe that lottery numbers that have so far been neglected are more likely to come up in future .  but the lottery machine has no  memory      its future is independent of its past .  those coloured plastic balls do not know how often they have come up in previous draws  and they have no tendency to compensate for past imbalances .   our intuition goes even further astray when it comes to coincidences .  you go to the swimming baths  and the guy behind the counter pulls a key at random from a drawer .  you arrive in the changing room and are relieved to find that very few lockers are in use  .  .  .  and then it turns out that three people have been given lockers next to yours  and it s all  sorry .   and banging locker doors together .  or you are in hawaii  for the only time in your life  .  .  .  and you bump into the hungarian you worked with at harvard .  or you re on honeymoon camping in a remote part of ireland  .  .  .  and you and your new wife meet your head of department and his new wife  walking the other way along an otherwise deserted beach .  all of these have happened to jack .     why do we find coincidences so striking .  because we expect random events to be evenly distributed  so statistical clumps surprise us .  we think that a  typical  lottery draw is something like                       but that                 is far less likely .  actually  these two sets of numbers have exactly the same probability  which for the uk lottery is    in            .  a typical lottery draw often includes several numbers close together  because sequences of six random numbers between   and    are more likely to be clumpy than not .   how do we know this .  probability theorists tackle such questions using  sample spaces      their name for what we earlier called a  phase space   a conceptual  space  that organizes all the possibilities .  a sample space contains not just the event that concerns us  but all possible alternatives .  if we are rolling a die  for instance  then the sample space is                  .  for the lottery  the sample space is the set of all sequences of six different numbers between   and    .  a numerical value is assigned to each event in the sample space  called its  probability   and this corresponds to how likely that event is to happen .  for fair dice each value is equally likely  with a probability of     .  ditto for the lottery  but now with a probability of              .   we can use a sample space approach to get a ball park estimate of how amazing the formula one coincidence was .  top drivers all lap at very nearly the same speed  so the three fastest times can easily fall inside the same tenth of a second period .  at intervals of a thousandth of a second  there are one hundred possible lap times for each to  choose  from  this list determines the sample space  the probability of the coincidence turns out to be one chance in ten thousand .  unlikely enough to be striking  but not so unlikely that we ought to feel amazed .   estimates like this help to explain astounding coincidences reported in newspapers  such as a bridge player getting a  perfect hand      all thirteen cards in one suit .  the number of games of bridge played every week worldwide is huge     so huge that every few weeks the actual events explore the entire sample space .  so occasionally a perfect hand actually does turn up     with the frequency that its small but non zero probability predicts .  the probability of all four players getting a perfect hand at the same time  though  is so micoscopic that even if every planet in the galaxy had a billion inhabitants  all playing bridge every day for a billion years  you wouldn t expect it to happen .   nevertheless  every so often the newspapers report a four way perfect hand .  the sensible conclusion is not that a miracle happened  but that something changed the odds .  possibly the players got close to a four way perfect hand  and the tale grew in the telling  so that when the journalist arrived with a photographer  another kind of narrative imperative ensured that their story fitted what the journalist had been told .  possibly they deliberately cheated to get their names in the papers .  scientists  especially  tend to underestimate the propensity of people to lie .  more than one scientist has been fooled into accepting apparent evidence of extrasensory perception or other  supernatural  events  which can actually be traced to deliberate trickery .   many other apparent coincidences  on close investigation  slither into a grey area in which trickery is strongly suspected  but may never be proved     either because sufficient evidence is unobtainable  or because it s not worth the trouble .  another way to be fooled about a coincidence is to be unaware of hidden constraints that limit the sample space .  that  perfect hand  could perhaps be explained by the way bridge players often shuffle cards for the next deal  which can be summed up as  poorly .  if a pack of cards is arranged so that the top four cards consist of one from each suit  and thereafter every fourth card is in the same suit  then you can cut  but not shuffle  admittedly  the pack as many times as you like  and it will deal out a four way perfect hand .  at the end of a game  the cards lie on the table in a fairly ordered manner  not a random one     so it s not so surprising if they possess a degree of structure after they ve been picked up .   so even with a mathematically tidy example like bridge  the choice of the  right  sample space is not entirely straightforward .  the actual sample space is  packs of cards of the kind that bridge players habitually assemble after concluding a game   not  all possible packs of cards  .  that changes the odds .   unfortunately  statisticians tend to work with the  obvious  sample space .  for that question about israeli fighter pilots  for instance  they would naturally take the sample space to be all children of israeli fighter pilots .  but that might well be the wrong choice  as the next tale illustrates .   according to scandinavian folklore  king olaf of norway was in dispute with the king of sweden about ownership of an island  and they agreed to throw dice for it  two dice  highest total wins .  the swedish king threw a double six .   you may as well give up now   he declared in triumph .  undeterred  olaf threw the dice  .  .  .  one turned up six  .  .  .  the other split in half  one face showing a six and the other a one .   thirteen  i win   said olaf .     something similar occurs in the colour of magic  where several gods are playing dice to decide certain events on the discworld     the lady nodded slightly .  she picked up the dice cup and held it steady as a rock  yet all the gods could hear the three cubes rattling about inside .  and then she sent them bouncing across the table .   a six .  a three .  a five .   something was happening to the five  however .  battered by the chance collision of several billion molecules  the die flipped onto a point  spun gently and came down a seven .   blind lo picked up the cube and counted the sides .    come on   he said wearily .   play fair .      nature s sample space is often bigger than a conventional statistician would expect .  sample spaces are a human way to model reality  they do not capture all of it .  and when it comes to estimating significance  a different choice of sample space can completely change our estimates of probabilities .  the reason for this is an extremely important factor      selective reporting   which is a type of narra tivium in action .  this factor tends to be ignored in most conventional statistics .  that perfect hand at bridge  for instance  is far more likely to make it to the local or even national press than an imperfect one .  how often do you see the headline bridge player gets entirely ordinary hand  for instance .  the human brain is an irrepressible pattern seeking device  and it seizes on certain events that it considers significant  whether or not they really are .  in so doing  it ignores all the  neighbouring  events that would help it judge how likely or unlikely the perceived coincidence actually is .   selective reporting affects the significance of those formula one times .  if it hadn t been them  maybe the tennis scores in the us open would have contained some unusual pattern  or the football results  or the golf  .  .  .  any one of those would have been reported  too  but none of the failed coincidences  the ones that didn t happen  would have hit the headlines .  formula one drivers record different lap times  .  .  .  if we include just ten major sporting events in our list of would be s that weren t  that one in ten thousand chance comes down to only one in a thousand .     having understood this  let s go back to the israeli fighter pilots .  conventional statistics would set up the obvious sample space  assign probabilities to boy and girl children  and calculate the chance of getting     girls in a purely random trial .  if this were less than one in a hundred  say  then the data would be declared  significant at the     level  .  but this analysis ignores selective reporting .  why did we look at the sexes of israeli fighter pilots  children in the first place .  because our attention had already been drawn to a clump .  if instead the clump had been the heights of the children of israeli aircraft manufacturers  or the musical abilities of the wives of israeli air traffic controllers  then our clump seeking brains would again have drawn the fact to our attention .  so our computation of the significance level tacitly excludes many other factors that didn t clump     making it fallacious .   the human brain filters vast quantities of data  seeking things that appear unusual  and only then does it send out a conscious signal  wow .  look at that .  the wider we cast our pattern seeking net  the more likely it is to catch a clump .  for this reason  it s illegitimate to include the data that brought the clump to our attention as part of the evidence that the same clump is unusual .  it would be like sorting through a pack of cards until you found the ace of spades  putting it on the table  and then claiming miraculous powers that unerringly accomplish a feat whose probability is one in    .   exactly this error was made in early experiments on extra sensory perception .  thousands of subjects were asked to guess cards from a special pack of five symbols .  anyone whose success rate was above average was invited back  while the others were sent home .  after this had gone on for several weeks  the survivors all had an amazing record of success .  then these  good guessers  were tested some more .  strangely  as time went on  their success rate slowly dropped back towards the average  as if their powers were  running down  .  actually  that effect wasn t strange at all .  it happened because the initial high scores were included in the running total .  if they had been omitted  then the scoring rate would have dropped  immediately  to near average .   so it is with the fighter pilots .  the curious figures that drew researchers  attention to these particular effects may well have been the result of selective reporting  or selective attention .  if so  then we can make a simple prediction   from now on  the figures will revert to fifty fifty .   if this prediction fails  and if the results instead confirm the bias that revealed the clump  then the new data can be considered significant  and a significance level can sensibly be assigned by the usual methods .  but the smart money is on a fifty fifty split .     the alleged decline in the human sperm count may be an example of selective reporting .  the story  widely repeated in the press  is that over the past    years the human sperm count for  normal  men has halved .  we don t mean selective reporting by the people who published the first evidence     they took pains to avoid all the sources of bias that they could think of .  the  selective reporting  was done by researchers who had contrary evidence but didn t publish it because they thought it must be wrong  by journal referees who accepted papers that confirmed a decline more often than they accepted those that didn t  and by the press     who strung together a whole pile of sex related defects in various parts of the animal kingdom into a single seamless story  unaware that each individual instance has an entirely reasonable explanation that has nothing to do with falling sperm counts and often nothing to do with sex .   sexual abnormalities in fish near sewer outlets  for instance  are probably due to excess nitrites  which all fish breeders know cause abnormalities of all kinds     and not to oestrogen like compounds in the water  which would bolster the  sperm count  story .  current data from fertility clinics  by the way  show no signs of a decline .   humans add narrativium to their world .  they insist in interpreting the universe as if it s telling a story .  this leads them to focus on facts that fit the story  while ignoring those that don t .  but we mustn t let the coincidence  the clump  choose the sample space     when we do that  we re ignoring the surrounding space of near coincidences .   jack and ian managed to test this theory on a trip to sweden .  on the plane  jack predicted that a coincidence would happen at stockholm airport     for reasons of selective reporting .  if they looked hard enough  they d find one .  they got to the bus stop outside the terminal  and no coincidences had occurred .  but they couldn t find the right bus  so jack went back to the enquiries desk .  as he waited  someone came up next to him     stefano  a mathematician who normally occupied the office next door to jack s .  prediction confirmed .  but what was really needed was evidence of a near coincidence     one that hadn t happened  but could have been selectively reported if it had .  for instance  if some other acquaintance had shown up at exactly the same time  but on the wrong day  or at the wrong airport  they d never have noticed .  near coincidences  by definition  are hard to observe  .  .  .  but not impossible .  ian happened to mention all of the above to his friend ted  who was visiting soon after .   stockholm .   said ted   when .   ian told him .   which hotel .   ian told him .   funny  i was staying there one day later than you .   had the trip been one day later  the  coincidental  encounter with stefano wouldn t have happened     but the one with ted would .   what we must not do  then  is to look back at past events and find significance in the inevitable few that look odd .  that is the way of the pyramidologists and the tea leaf readers .  every pattern of raindrops on the pavement is unique .  we re not saying that if one such patterns happens to spell your name  this is not to be wondered at  but if your name had been written on the pavement in beijing during the ming dynasty  at midnight  nobody would have noticed .  we should not look at past history when assessing significance  we should look at all the other things that might have happened instead .   every event is unique .  until we place that event in a category  we can t work out which background to view it against .  until we choose a background  we can t estimate the event s probability .  if we consider the sample space of all possible dna codes  for instance  then we can calculate the probability of a human being having exactly your dna code     which is vanishingly small .  but it would be silly to conclude that it is impossible for you to exist .       indeed  it is a fundamental part of story telling .  if the hero did not overcome huge odds  what would be the point .       possibly he was holding a large axe at the time .       thirty five   still bloody lizards     the future is lizard   said ridcully .   obviously .   it was a few days later .  the omniscope was focused on a mound of leaves and rotting vegetation a little way from the banks of the river .  there was a large depression hanging over the senior wrangler  and the dean had a black eye .  the war between land and sea had just entered a terminal stage .    little portable seas   said ponder .   you know  i never thought of them like that .     an egg is an egg  however you look at it   said ridcully .   look  you two  i don t want to see a scuffle like that again  d you hear .   the senior wrangler dabbed at his bleeding nose .   he goaded be   he said .   id s still osuns  howeber you look at id .    a private ocean full of food   said ponder  still entranced .   hidden in a heap of .  .  .  well  compost .  which heats up .  that s like having private sunshine .    the little lizard like creatures that had hatched from the eggs in the mound slithered and slid down the bank into the water  bright eyed and hopeful .  the first few were instantly snapped up by a large male lying in wait among the weeds .    however  the mothers still have something to learn about postnatal care   said ridcully .   i wonder if they ll have time to learn .  and how did they know how to do this .  who s telling them .      the wizards were depressed again .  most days started that way now .  creatures seemed to turn up in the world randomly  and certainly not according to any pictures in a book .  if things were changing into other things  and no one had seen that happen yet  why were the original things still the original things .  if the land was so great  why were any fish left in the sea .   the air breathing fishes that rincewind had seen still seemed to be around  lurking in swamps and muddy beaches .  things changed  but still stayed the same .   and if there was any truth at all in ponder s tentative theory that things did change into other things  it led to the depressing thought that  well  the world was filling up with quitters  creatures which    instead of staying where they were  and really making a go of life in the ocean or the swamp or wherever     were running away to lurk in some niche and grow legs .  the kind of fish that d come out of water was  frankly  a disgrace to the species .  it kept coughing all the time  like someone who d just given up smoking .   and there was no purpose  ridcully kept saying .  life was on land .  according to the book  there should be some big lizards .  but nothing seemed to be making much of an effort .  the moment anything felt safe  it stopped bothering .   rincewind  currently relaxing on a rock  rather liked it .  there were large animals snuffling around in the greenery near the rock he was sitting on  in general shape and appearance  they looked like a small skinny hippopotamus designed in the dark by a complete amateur .  they were hairy .  they coughed  too .   things that were doing sufficiently beetle like things for him to think of them as beetles ambled across the ground .   ponder had told him the continents were moving again  so he kept a firm grip on his rock just in case .   best of all  nothing seemed to be thinking .  rincewind was convinced that no good came of that sort of thing .   the last few weeks of discworld time had been instructive .  the wizards had tentatively identified several dozen embryo civilizations  or at least creatures that seemed to be concerned about more than simply where their next meal was coming from .  and where were they now .  there was a squid one  hex said  out in the really deep cold water .  apart from that  ice or fire or both at once came to the thinkers and the stupid alike .  there was probably some kind of moral involved .   the air shimmered  and half a dozen ghostly figures appeared in front of him .   there were  in pale shadowy colours  the wizards .  silvery lines flickered across their bodies and  periodically  they flickered .    now  remember   said ponder stibbons  and his voice sounded muffled   you are in fact still in the high energy magic building .  if you walk slowly hex will try to adjust your feet to local ground level .  you ll have a limited ability to move things  although hex will do the actual work          can we eat .   said the senior wrangler .    no  sir .  your mouth isn t here .     well  then  what am i talking out of .     could be anyone s guess  sir   said ponder diplomatically .   we can hear you because our ears are in the hem  and you can hear the sounds made here because hex is presenting you with an analogue of them .  don t worry about it .  it ll seem quite natural after a while .    the ghost of the dean kicked at the soil .  a fraction of a second later  a little heap of earth splashed up .    amazing .   he said  happily .    excuse me .   said rincewind .   they turned .    oh  rincewind   said ridcully  as one might say  oh dear  it s raining  .   it s you .     yes  sir .     mister stibbons here s found a way of getting hex to operate more than one virtually there suit  d you see .  so we thought we d come down and smell the roses .     not for several hundred million years  sir   said ponder .    dull  isn t it   said the lecturer in recent runes  looking around .   not a lot going on .  lots of life  but it s just hanging around .    ridcully rubbed his hands together .    well  we re going to liven it up   he said .   we re going to move things forward fast while we re here .  a few prods in the right place  that s what these creatures need .     the time travelling is not much fun   said rincewind .   you tend to end up under a volcano or at the bottom of the sea .     we shall see   said ridcully firmly .   i ve had enough of this .   look at those damn sloppy things over there .   he cupped his hands and shouted   life in the sea not good enough for you  eh .  skiving off  eh .  got a note from your mother  have you .   he lowered his hands .   all right  mister stibbons  .  .  .  tell hex to take us forward  oh  fifty million years     hang on  what was that .    thunder rolled around the horizon .    probably just another snowball landing   said rincewind morosely .   there s generally one around just when things are settled .  it was in the sea  i expect .  stand by for the tidal wave .   he nodded at the browsing creatures  who had glanced up briefly .    the dean thinks all this hammering from rocks is making the life on this world very resilient   said ridcully .    well  that s certainly a point of view   said rincewind .   but in a little while a wave the size of the university is going to wash this beach on to the top of those mountains over there .  then i expect the local volcanoes will all let go  .  .  .  again  .  .  .  so stand by for a country sized sea of lava coming the other way .  after that there ll probably be outbreaks of rain that you could use to etch copper  followed by a bit of a cold spell for a few years and some fog you could cut up in lumps .   he sniffed .   that which does not kill you can give you a really bad headache .    he glanced at the sky .  strange lightning was flickering between the clouds  and now there was a glow on the horizon .    damn   he said  in the same tone of voice .   this is going to be one of the times when the atmosphere catches fire .  i hate it when that happens .    ridcully gave him a long blank look  and then said   mister stibbons .     archchancellor .     make that seventy thousand years  will you .  and  er  .  .  .  right now  if you would be so good .    the wizard vanished .   all the insects stopped buzzing in the bushes .   the hairy lizards carried on placidly eating the leaves .  then  something made them look up      the sun jerked across the sky  became very briefly a reddish yellow band across a twilight hemisphere  and then the world was simply a grey mist .  below rincewind s feet it was quite dark  and above him it was almost white .  around him  the greyness flickered .    is this what it always looks like .   said the dean .    something has to stand still for a couple of thousand years before you see it at all   said rincewind .    i thought it would be more exciting         the light flickered  and sun exploded into the sky  the wizards saw waves around them for a moment  and then there was darkness .    i told you   said rincewind .   we re under water .     the land sank under all the volcanoes .   said ridcully .    probably just moved away   said rincewind .   there s a lot of that sort of thing down here .    they rose above the surface as hex adjusted to the new conditions .  a landmass was smeared on the horizon  under a bank of cloud .    see .   said rincewind .   it s a pain .  time travel always means you end up walking .     hex  move us to the nearest land  please .  inland about ten miles   said ponder .    you mean i could have just asked .   said rincewind .   all this time  i needn t have been walking .     oh  yes .    the landscape blurred for a second .    you could have said   said rincewind accusingly  as they were rushed past  and sometimes through  a forest of giant ferns .   the view stabilized .  the wizard had been through to the edge of the forest .  low growing shrubs stretched away towards more ferns .    not much about   said ridcully  leaning against a trunk .   can i smoke my pipe here  stibbons .     since technically you ll be smoking in the high energy building  yes  sir .    rincewind apparently struck a match on the tree trunk .   amazing   he said .    that s odd  sir   said ponder .   i didn t think there would be any proper trees yet .     well  here they are   said ridcully .   and i can see at least another three more  .  .  .    rincewind had already started to run .  the fact that nothing can harm you is no reason for not being scared .  an expert can always find a reason for being scared .   the fact that the nearest trunk had toenails was a good one .   from among the ferns above  a large head appeared on the end of too much neck .    ah   said ridcully calmly .   still bloody lizards  i see .        thirty six   running from dinosaurs    walking with dinosaurs was a very popular television series in the uk in            and it was equally popular on us television soon afterwards .  it portrayed dozens of kinds of dinosaur  all beautifully realised as computer animations in the most intimate detail .  and it told us things like  these doofersaurs were herbivorous  and they were brightly coloured to break up their outline  as protection against predation by thingumosaurs .  they were monogamous  rearing their well protected offspring by living in caves and permitting the children only very restricted access to computer games .    all this from just two fossil bones     one for each beast .   walking with dinosaurs was the latest in a series of popularisations of dinosaurs  from h . g .  wells s outline of history and arthur conan doyle s the lost world to walt disney s fantasia and michael crichton s jurassic park .  dinosaurs are redolent with mana  they ooze charisma .  they are the pr person s wildest dream .  what gives dinosaurs such potency .   the psychologist helen haste has taken over from palaeontologist beverley halstead the theme of dinosaurs as icons of power and sex in our civilised myth making .  both have shown that by mythologising them into such potent symbols  we have made it very difficult to work out what it must really have been like when dinosaurs walked the earth .  our mental images of dinosaurs carry a lot of excess baggage  and it s hard to get away from the lies to  children involved in those images .   we ll do our best  nonetheless .  whatever it was like  we re sure that running from dinosaurs is a more apt image .   we have a good idea of what it wasn t like .  we ve all seen the standard filmic shot of dinosaur  ecology   and it wasn t like that .  the camera homes in on some archaic looking trees  and we discover a clearing with a lake and some enormous vegetarian reptiles .  a few little birdy creatures get into the picture doing their little birdy things  there are pterodactyls flying about  .  .  .  then there s a great roar  and a tyrannosaur comes crashing in from stage left .  he  nobody can believe it s a  she  as portrayed  we have to be informed of that in the jurassic park sequel  jumps on to a brontosaur or a hadrosaur or whatever  and wrestles it to the ground .  or he has a great teeth against horns fight with a triceratops  or some other armoured vegetarian like the stegosaur in disney s fantasia .   in the natural history books of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  the drawings always show these creatures in mortal combat  too  labelled  for example  ideal scene of the middle oolitic period   .  wells s outline of history was atypical in this regard  the drawings and plates showed the animals simply going about their business  without the drama .   what was it really like .     for a start  there wasn t an  it  .  dinosaurs  and other great reptiles  had nearly two hundred million years of being the most interesting  most important     well  the biggest  at least     land animals  and they re invaded the sea and even produced the largest flying creatures that have ever been .  dinosaurs began  about two hundred and forty million years ago  with a single species .  the earliest descendants of which we have fossils are the herbivore pisanosaurus  about three feet  lm  long  and eoraptor  a predator of similar size  which date from about     million years ago .   by     million years ago the dinosaurs had diversified considerably .  there were big sprawling amphibians  heavily built and three or four feet long  as well as a great variety of little ones looking more like big salamanders .  there were the synapsid reptiles  which were bigger and held up by sturdy legs  some had great bony sails on their backs  some of them were vegetarians as big as donkeys  some were carnivores as big as hyaenas .  there were many kinds of more active dog sized beasties .   their therapsid descendants would be the mammals  ancestors  little guys called morganucodontids  which we talk about later .  these were small beasties  because most of the action by then was dinosaur .  for     million years  between     and    million years ago  any land animal more than three feet   m  long was a dinosaur .   among these mammal like reptiles in the forests were a few active predators the size of kangaroos and wallabies .  these unprepossessing creatures were the earliest dinosaurs .  you wouldn t have marked them out as having a great future  they were just part of the land fauna that came out of the dark wet carboniferous forests and began to make a living in the drier permian era .  if you had walked about in those forests you would probably have seen some of these beasts  they were rather slow and stupid  and perhaps they would have attacked you in a rather leisurely  crocodilian way .  they weren t as bright as crocodiles  though  nor as quick .   at least as important as the dinosaurs was something far less filmic  soil .  by then  soil had developed much of its complex ecosystem  at least fifty interacting species of bacteria  several very different kinds of fungi  insects  worms  protozoans during the carboniferous .  soil had become a great basis for land plant growth .  these forests were not starved  like the modern rainforests with their six inches of soil and no net oxygen production .  oh  no .  the coal that we burn for heat and power was deposited in the carboniferous  and every ton of coal that was deposited by the forests released more than twice its weight of oxygen into the air .  just as each ton of coal we burn now uses that much oxygen to make carbon dioxide again .   in those days  plants grew fast  like modern herbs  but many of them grew big  as well .  these plants didn t have woody trunks  they were like great tree ferns  and the creatures that fed on them made a big input into the terrestrial ecology .  until grass really took over  well after the demise of the dinosaurs  and made savannah and pampas the vegetable basis of the great herds of mammalian herbivores  this thick soiled forest was the nutritional basis of all land fauna .  and the ancient land fauna diversified in these forests  at their edges and in the swamps that they so often became .   there were several early monitor lizard like carnivores in the late carboniferous and early permian  and their relatives came down to us as the lizards and the snakes .  but to get a better idea of what these early reptiles really looked like  and behaved like  you should look at the tuatara  a genuine  living fossil  from the islands off new zealand s coast .  you can probably find it in your local zoo .  it s slow  it s stupid  and any modern iguana or monitor can run rings round it  partly because it s adapted to colder climes   but it s a warning not to use any geckos or pythons or goannas you have known to inform yourself about early permian lizards .   slow it may have been  but this lineage became extremely diverse .  its adaptive radiation  its explosive evolutionary diversification  simply swamped the other reptiles  turtles and mammal like creatures .  the early reptiles produced several kinds of marine lizards  of which plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs were biggest and the most famous .  however  another reptile lineage had slid back into the seas in the early permian  creatures called mesosaurs that were related to turtles and probably lived on plankton that they sieved from the water  like manv whales do now .  the plesiosaurs  particularly some rather nasty short necked crocodile like ones called pliosaurs  were worthy opponents of the big sharks  and probably fed on mesosaurs .  but the most successful marine reptiles  as fully adapted to marine life as whales and dolphins are now  were the ichthyosaurs .  they flourished long before the famous dinosaurs on land  reaching their peak of size in the triassic  as far in the past of the tyrannosaur as he was in our past .  a length of    feet    m  was common  and occasionally they reached    feet    m  .   they were trumped in the seas by a later branch of the lizard lineage  the so called fish lizards or mosasaurs  which took over the seas just when the big brontosaurs and allosaurs were taking over the land .  some of them were only a foot    cm  long  a few stretched to forty feet    m  .  but all those films you ve seen showing ichthyosaurs in the seas  tvrannosaurs on land are scientifically as  in accurate as one million years bc with raquel welch being chased by dinosaurian monsters  the flintstone family with their tame dinosaurs powering household gadgets  or hamlet with a pc .   it s quite difficult to get the span of geological time to make sense .  in his book in search of deep time  henry gee does an excellent job of reminding us just how flimsy the  fossil record  is .  a few bones here  a few others five thousand miles away and ten million years later  from these we attempt to tell a story of evolutionary ancestry .  it s like claiming to have reconstructed human history from one flint flake and a half eaten hamburger .  well  not as coherent as that  actually .   it s more difficult still to put the range of creatures up against the tapestry of evolutionary time to get some idea of what the dinosaurian earth might have been like .  take sharks .  there have been shark like sharks since way before there were any reptiles  there have been those odd looking horseshoe crabs for longer .  coelacanth fishes have been grubbing about in the dark depths off the continental shelves while the dinosaurs came and went .  it s not surprising  perhaps  that yeasts and other fungi  bacteria of several modern kinds  have been around for more than a thousand million years .  we don t expect  blobs  to notice the passage of time .  but coelacanths and sharks and tuataras are vertebrates     you d think they d be a bit progressive  evolving and changing into  .  .  .  whatever .  but they didn t  they just kept on doing their own thing .   sharks have eaten mesosaurs  have been annoyed by plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs and cautious about pliosaurs  have eaten little mosasaurs and been eaten by big ones .  there were ammonites in their seas  and belemnites and all kinds of other shelled octopuses .  then  when the big reptiles went  and all the ammonites and their friends disappeared  the sharks had the top levels of the marine food chains to themselves for tens of thousands of years .  then the mammals produced dolphins  killer whales  big whales  .  .  .  and the sharks just went on being sharks .   why didn t sharks change .  they have wonderful immune systems  which we re just beginning to understand  they don t get bacterial infections or  apparently  cancers .  perhaps they are not made ill by viruses  either .  though they do have lots of wormy and flukey parasites .  are today s sharky superfish the newest  latest model sharks .  or did the ancient ones also have marvellous immunity to disease .  was that their trick .  was that what brought them unchanged  in outward appearance at least  through such a long span of time .     since we can t answer those questions  yet  let s move to one that we can answer .  what was happening on land as the permian became the triassic .  well  for a start  the biggest mass extinction of all      million years ago .  the number of species on earth dropped by about     .  only    survived .  we re talking big species here  nobody knows what happened to bacteria or even protozoa  to nematode worms  or to rotifers .  except that a lot of protozoa have mineral shells  and got fossilised as the white cliffs of dover  and rotifers have tiny hard jaws of characteristic shapes that a few hardy fossil hunters collect .  so we can check these out  and they give a similar picture .   the precise cause of this mass extinction is debatable .  there may have been collusion between a comet impact and massive volcanic activity  as we describe shortly .  in any event  the early dinosaurs     and mammal like reptiles and turtles  even ichthyosaurs and early plesiosaurs  but not mesosaurs      lived through it .  they were among the lucky    .  whatever the disaster was  it seemed great for them  it gave them just the open ecological spaces that they needed to radiate wildly .  the triassic seas were just us full of reptiles as today s seas are full of mammals  and they stayed that way right up to the early cretaceous .  those ocean reptiles had largely vanished before tyrannosaurus appeared  though .   why were the reptiles so successful as sea creatures .  there s a persuasive biological explanation for this invasion of the seas by land animals .  the story starts in the sea  moves on to land  and reverts to the sea again .   creatures that live in the seas experience very little gravity  if any  even heavily armoured creatures like crabs produce forms that swim .  in fact their muscles are for swimming  or for closing jaws on other creatures  or for sudden escapes .  but as the descendants of these creatures came out on land  they experienced real problems  they sagged and flopped .  compare a salamander with its sprawled out legs  which cannot support its weight  with a lizard of the same size that has strong enough muscles and bones to run .   the tuatara still sprawls  .  the frog s trick  one jump at a time  is much less effective than really well designed legs  strong limb girdles  an effective bellows system around the lungs to supply the muscles with oxygen  and a four chambered heart to keep the aerated and depleted blood apart     all the tricks that make a monitor lizard such a good predator .   when you ve achieved all these  then feeding on the seashore  or even in the sea like today s marine iguanas on the galapagos  becomes really easy .  instead of having muscles and respiratory systems that are just adequate for marine life  you ve got the supercharged version that terrestrial gravity required of your ancestors .  going back into the sea is now a very viable option  only sharks and octopuses are any match for previously terrestrial lineages .  so the ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs  like today s dolphins and whales  but less so because mammals had become warm blooded too while they were on land  found that living in the sea was easy .   until they evolved further and became their own best enemies  of course  after they had radiated into hundreds of species .  the reptile eating pliosaurs were like today s killer whales  whose main diet is other whales .   meanwhile  several rather different lineages of triassic land reptiles  somewhat prematurely called archosaurs   ruling reptiles    had evolved really good limb girdles  of several patterns .  two very different lineages   bird hipped  and  lizard hipped   went on to produce all those great big dinosaurs .  the lizardy lot evolved into gigantic herbivores like diplodocus and brontosaurs  now  alas  named apatosaurs   thunder lizard  was so much more appropriate  and gigantic carnivores like the allosaurs and the tyrannosaurs .  these all arrived at least sixty million years later  though  the early archosaurs were as far in the past of tyrannosaurs as we are in their future .   the bird hipped lot eventually produced those spectacularly armoured beasts that make such good film shots when tyrannosaurs are fighting them  ankylosaurs with spikes on a knobby tail  like that spiky ball on a chain that the villain wields in chivalric films  stegosaurs with bony plates  spikes down their backs  triceratops with the bony frill and three horns .   filmmakers always seem to make almost purposeful mistakes  the innumerable eight year old boys who ve learned all the lovely names could correct them .  it s a pity that that otherwise lovely fight in disney s fantasia  accompanied by stravinsky s rite of spring  is between a tyrannosaur and stegosaur .  it couldn t have happened  they weren t contemporary .  and the stegosaur never had the ankylosaur s tail armour  either .  the late cretaceous landscape  with the few very big dinosaurs that lived then  was doubtless an impressive scene  but the film producers  version is no more accurate than fantasia .   this is hardly a surprise  after all  hollywood has been wrong about so many other things .  scientists don t always fare better .  right now  palaeontologists believe that tyrannosaurs were scavengers  not predators .  we ll stick our necks out and dispute that conclusion .  yes  tyrannosaurs may not have been fearsome predators  hunters  .  .  .  but if they weren t  that doesn t make scavenging the only option .  they probably did something that we can t imagine instead .  we simply can t see these animals as enormous vultures  with their tiny front feet scrabbling at a decaying corpse and that great head hidden in the abdomen of a dead sauropod like diplodocus .  we d run away from them  whatever the scientists are saying now .   on the rincewind principle  you understand .  just in case .   other archosaurs went on to produce crocodiles and pterodactyls  and perhaps the birds     or these may have arisen from the same stock as those deinonychids made familiar by jurassic park  namely velociraptor and its ilk .  these probably were intelligent creatures  agile carnivores much like their portrayal in jurassic park .  we d certainly run away from them .     there are a few puzzles that biologists keep puzzling at  like whether some of the big dinosaurs were warm blooded .  and why everything was so damned big in the cretaceous .  the biggest teleost  bony  fish that there has ever been lived in cretaceous seas  it was as big as today s whale shark .  and dinosaurs flew  too .  there are lots of fossil pterosaurs like pteranodon with eight yard   m  wingspreads  bigger than any of today s birds  and there are a couple of fossils of quetzalcoatlus with wingspreads twice as big .  that s bigger than the fighter planes of world war ii  like spitfires .  we have no idea how these creatures lived  but there s no doubt that they existed .   unless you believe in planetary engineers with a sense of humour  as in strata  .  .  .   this is where we should warn you about the most tempting way of thinking about these ancient creatures  and how we get it wrong all the time .  gee s in search of deep time takes us to task  showing how all of our pretty guesses about evolutionary scenarios     however well they seem to be based in the fossil record     are simply wrong  impossible .   a classical mistake is the way we habitually think about that fish that came out of the water  whose descendants were the land vertebrates .  we imagine it flopping out on the beach  and rincewind encouraging it to go back into the water  with its developing lungs and its evolving legs  .  .  .  no .  it had fairly well developed legs while it was still living an underwater life  with internal gills like any perfectly respectable fish .  it must have done  or it wouldn t have worked .   we have little idea what its legs were for at that stage  though  certainly not for walking on land .  but there s no question that these hands that we re typing with are the descendants of those fishy legs  .  .  .  just as our cough is a legacy of that fish s crossover of its airway and foodway .  it s the pictures in our heads  of what we suppose happened  that are mistaken .  they are lies to children that we can t correct yet .  but humans definitely evolved from a fish  and it had legs .  it just didn t use them to walk along the beach .   another interestingly wrong lie to children about evolution concerns the origin of birds .  when those lovely archaeopteryx fossils were found in the solenhofen limestone  so well preserved that the feather imprints could be clearly seen     and the teeth and the claw digits on the wings     it was clear that we had found the halfway stage between a reptile and a bird .  it was a super missing link .   think about that for a moment  how can you find a missing link .  oops .   archaeopteryx had a long tail like a lizard  and no keel in its chest for strong flight muscles .  were it not for the feathers  it would have been classified as a small pseudosuchian dinosaur like ornithomimus  bird mimic  .  in the late jurassic there were many little dinosaurs with bird like features  and some really well developed diving bird fossils had been found in early cretaceous rocks from about fifteen million years later .  these were real birds  called ichthyornis  and they had already lost their flight abilities  reduced their wings to  very bird like  vestiges .   so archaeopteryx was a bit  late   and in the      s zoologists thought that it probably represented a primitive reptile bird lineage hanging on  perhaps contemporary with much more bird like creatures .  that s another scenario that doesn t make sense now .  many bird like dinosaurs have been found recently  fossils from south america and  especially  caudipteryx and protoarchaeopteryx from china  and these make the problems worse .   they have feathers  but they didn t fly .  they have no wings  but they have arms with hands  sometimes with only two digits .   so what were feathers  for  .   feathers are really remarkably complicated .  they re not at all like the scales of lizards and snakes  and it s not easy to invent an evolutionary route by which feathers  or hairs  come to that  can have developed from scales .  some biologists who haven t looked at feathers very carefully have imagined scales growing rather like the stage witch s fingernails  so that they stick out like a pangolin s scales .   that s that silly mammalian tree climbing anteater that looks like a big pine cone .    feathers aren t like that  though .  they develop as cylinders  you can see baby feathers  called pin feathers  on a plucked chicken from the supermarket .  the scales on birds  legs are respectable reptilian scales  perhaps surprisingly  no modern birds have structures that are halfway between feathers and scales  even though their remote ancestors had scales all over .  probably  .  .  .  we can t be sure from those very old fossils .  scales are  and probably were in those ancestors  patches of keratin very like fingernails  sometimes they overlap like roof tiles .  feathers are cylinders sitting in follicles  deep pits in the skin .  about a millimetre up from their deep end  they have a ring of dividing cells  called the collar  which produce the cylinder by growing it outwards .  as the products move up the follicle  they turn all the cells  productivity into making keratin  the protein of horn  nails  hair and feathers .  and the cylinder wall becomes horny in a strange pattern .   the side of the feather facing backwards on the bird produces creases that pass around on both sides of the cylinder toward the front facing side  diving into the follicle so that they are almost parallel with the length of the cylinder .  they don t quite meet  and the tissue between their deep ends will become the stalk of the feather .  the other side splits open  and the barbs of the feather   between the creases   unfurl to make the feather vane .  they are much longer than the cylinder s circumference  so a narrow pin feather can generate a feather with a broad vane .   not a bit like a scale .  and far more complicated .  evolution had to work hard to come up with feathers .   and they must have evolved for a good reason  because lots of dinosaurs had feathers in various versions .  some were like down feathers  others more like paintbrushes or feather dusters .  they could have evolved for warmth .  adult velociraptors and young tyrannosaurs may have been covered in down  like baby chicks .  palaeontologist mark norell says that  we have as much evidence that velociraptors had feathers as we do that neanderthals had hair  .  but other scientists disagree .   perhaps feathers were sexual ornaments .  more likely  we haven t yet thought of whatever function they had .   so much for stories that  some reptiles got feathers and became birds  .     there s a very general problem here  and it s the problem the wizards are having all the time .  the overall pattern of evolution  of the birds say  or of tyrannosaurs  looks very sensible .  but at a deep level  deeper than the  common sense story  that the wizards are trying to use for roundworld  we don t understand it .  we have stories to explain it  all right  but that isn t what understanding means .   in fact  we re not altogether sure what it does mean  in a scientific sense .  we know that apparently quite ordinary historical events  come to pieces  when you try to analyse them from several directions .  john f .  kennedy s assassination is a perfect example  the bullets seem to have come from different directions  and there doesn t appear to be one consistent story that means we can  understand  what happened .  we can describe the events  but the underlying causalities  like the physicists  quantum theory and relativity theory  don t match up .   evolution doesn t just happen to one creature at a time .  the entire ecosystem evolves  and as it does so  new tricks may become worth using  for a limited period of time and in a limited region of geography .  a few of those tricks turn out to have useful effects that    ire quite different from the  reason  why they evolved to begin with  and those effects may continue to be worth having long after i lie original reason for their appearance has ceased to apply .   it s not surprising  in that frame  that historical events as far back as the origin of feathers  or of birds  don t make detailed sense either .  that s why we can t imagine what it was like in the late cretaceous .  walking with dinosaurs was beautifully made and based on up to date science  but ultimately it was unconvincing .  the need to tell a story distorted what was actually known  and mixed it up with guesswork and wishful thinking .   you can t be sure what colour an animal s skin was when all you ve got is fossil bones .  and assuming it was a bit like something vaguely similar that s alive today is cheating  not science .   anything televisual was automatically preferred to some more mundane scenario .  so we got a dinosaur soap  with everything over dramatised .   so we can t imagine ourselves walking with dinosaurs .  neither  to be fair  can we imagine ourselves running from them .  we simply can t understand what it was like to be there  much as we d like to believe we can .  still  what can you expect from a slightly brainy ape .  we can give ourselves an excuse  an evolutionary one  and it s this  we re only halfway from australopithecus  lucy  to human .  it s not surprising that we keep finding limits to what our brains can comprehend .  neither is it surprising that our mental models won t fit together to offer a convincing understanding of past events .  we re not smart enough .  yet .   wait another million years .  then we ll show you .       some pterodactyls were sparrow sized  and their wings could have carried them easily  but pteranodons can t have taken off from the sea surface  or climbed up cliffs to hang glide .  although quetzalcoatlus has been modelled  and flown as a radio controlled glider  that doesn t tell us how it lived .  was there perhaps aerial plankton for it to eat .       though some palaeontologists think that such creatures were not feathered dinosaurs  but flightless birds .  according to john ruben  caudipteryx was merely  a cretaceous turkey  so to speak  .       thirty seven   i said  don   t look up .     ponder was working the rules again .  now they read     the rules    things fall apart  but centres hold    everything moves in curves    you get balls    big balls tell space to bend    there are no turtles anywhere   after this one he d added except ordinary ones     life turns up everywhere it can    life turns up everywhere it can t    there is something like narrativium    there may be something called bloodimindium  see rule        .  .  .     he stopped to think .  behind him  a very large lizard killed and ate a slightly smaller one .  ponder didn t bother to turn around .  they d been watching lizards for more than a hundred million years  all day  in fact  and even the dean was giving up on them .    too well adapted   he said .   no pressure on them  you see     they re certainly very dull   said ridcully .   interesting colours  though .     brain the size of a walnut and some of them think with their backsides   said the senior wrangler .    your type of people  dean   said ridcully .    i shall choose to ignore that  archchancellor   said the dean coldly .    you ve been interfering again  haven t you   ridcully went on .   i saw you pushing some of the small lizards out of that tree .     well  you ve got to admit that they look a bit like birds   said the dean .    and did they learn to fly .     not in so many words  no .  not horizontally .     eat  fight  mate and die   said the lecturer in recent runes .   even the crabs were better than this .  even the blobs made an effort .  when they come to write the history of this world  this is the page everyone will skip .  terribly dull lizards  they ll be called .  you mark my words .     they have stayed around for a hundred million years  sir   said rincewind  who felt he had to stand up for non achievers .    and what have they done .  is there a single line of poetry .  a building of any sort .  a piece of simple artwork .     they ve just not died  sir .     not dying out is some kind of achievement  is it .   said the lecturer in recent runes .    best kind there is  sir .     pah .   said the dean .   all they prove is that species go soft when there s nothing happening .  it s nice and warm  there s plenty to eat  .  .  .  it s just the sea without water .  a few periods of vulcanism or a medium sized comet would soon have them sitting up straight and paying attention .    the air shimmered and ponder stibbons appeared .    we have intelligence  gentlemen   he said .    i know   said the dean .    i mean  the omniscope has found signs of developing intelligence .  twice  sir .      the herd was big .  it was made up of large  almost hemispherical creatures  with faces that had all the incisive cogitation of a cow .   much smaller creatures were trotting along at the edges .  they were dark  scrawny and warbled to one another almost without cease .   they also carried pointed sticks .    well  .  .  .   ridcully began  dismissively .    they re herding them  sir .   said ponder .    but wolves chase sheep  .  .  .     not with pointy sticks  sir .  and look there  .  .  .    one of the beasts was towing a crude travois  covered with leaves .  several herders were lying on it .  they were pale around the muzzles .    are they sick  d you think .   said the dean .    just old  sir .     why d they want to slow themselves down with a lot of old people .    ponder dared a short pause before answering .    they re the library  sir .  i suppose .  they can remember things .  places to hunt  good waterholes  that sort of thing .  and that means they must have some sort of language .     it s a start  i suppose   said ridcully .    start  sir .  they ve nearly done it all .   ponder put his hand to his ear .   oh  .  .  .  and hex says there s more  sir .  er  .  .  .  different .     how different .     in the sea again  sir     aha   said the senior wrangler .   in fact on the sea was more accurate  he had to admit .  the colony they found stretched for miles  linking a chain of small rocky islands and sandbanks as beads on a chain of tethered driftwood and rafts of floating seaweed .   the creatures inhabiting it were another type of lizard .  still extremely dull  the wizards considered  compared to some of the others .  they weren t even an interesting colour and they had hardly any spikes .  but they were  .  .  .  busy creatures .    that seaweed  .  .  .  does it look sort of regular to you .   said the lecturer in recent runes  as they drifted over a crude wall .  they re not farming  are they .     i think  .  .  .   ponder looked down .  the water washed over the wall of rocks .   it s a big cage for fish .  the whole lagoon .  er  .  .  .  i think they ve built the walls like that so the tide lets the fish come in and then they re stuck when it goes down .    lizards turned their heads as the semi transparent men floated past  but seemed to treat them as no more than passing shadows .    they re harnessing the power of the sea .   said ridcully .   that s clever .    lizards were diving at the far side of the lagoon .  some were busy around rock pools on one of the lower islands .  small lizards swam in the shallows .  along one stretch of driftwood walkways  strips of seaweed were drying in the breeze .  and over everything was a yip yipping of conversation .  and it was conversation  ponder decided .  animals didn t wait for other animals to finish .  nor did wizards  of course  but they were a breed apart .   a little way away  a lizard was carefully painting the skin of another lizard  using a twig and some pigments in half shells .  the one doing the painting was wearing a necklace of different shells  ponder realized .    tools   he murmured .   symbols .  abstract thought .  things of value  .  .  .  is this a civilization  or are we merely tribal at the moment .       where s the sun .   said the senior wrangler .   it s always so hazy  and it s hard to get used to directions here .  wherever you point  it s at the back of your own head .    rincewind pointed towards the horizon  where there was a red glow behind the clouds .    i call it widdershins   he said .   just like at home .     ah .  the sun sets widdershins .     no .  it doesn t do anything   said rincewind .   it stays where it is .  the horizon comes up .     but it doesn t fall on us .     it tries to  but the other horizon drags us away before it happens .     the more time i spend on this globe  the more i feel i should be holding on to something   the dean muttered .    and the light isn t reflected around the world .   said the senior wrangler .   it is at home .  it s always very beautiful  the glow that comes up through the waterfall .     no   said rincewind .   it just gets dark  unless the moon is up .     and there s still just the one sun  isn t there .   said the senior wrangler  a man with something on his mind .    yes .     we didn t add another one .     no .     so  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  what is that light over there .    as one wizard  they turned towards the opposite horizon .    whoops   said the dean  as the distant thunder died away and lights streamed high across the sky .   the lizards had heard it too .  ponder looked around .  they were lining the walkways  watching the horizon with all the intelligent interest of a thinking creature wondering what the future may hold .  .  .    let s get back to the high energy magic building before the boiling rain  shall we .   said ridcully .   this really is too depressing .        thirty eight   the death of dinosaurs    life turns up everywhere it can .   life turns up everywhere it can t .   and just when it seems to have got itself going really comfortably  with a sustainable lifestyle and gradual progress towards higher things  along comes a major catastrophe and sets it back twenty million years .  yet  paradoxically  those same disasters also pave the way to radically new lifeforms  .  .  .   it s all rather confusing .   life is resilient  but any particular species may not be .  life is constantly devising new tricks .  the one with eggs is brilliant  provide the developing embryo with its own personal life support machine .  inside  the environment is tailored to the needs of that species     and what s outside doesn t matter much  because there s a barrier to keep it out .   life is adaptable .  it changes the rules of its own game .  as soon as eggs make their appearance  the stage is set for the evolution of egg eaters  .  .  .   life is diverse .  the more players there are  the more ways there are to make a living by taking in each others  washing .   life is repetitious .  when it finds a trick that works  it churns out thousands of variations on the same basic theme .  the great biologist john  j . b . s .   haldane was once asked what question he would like to pose to god  and replied that he d like to know why he has such an inordinate fondness for beetles .    there are a third of a million beetle species today     far more than in any other plant or animal group .  in      brian farrell came up with a possible answer to haldane s query .  beetles appeared about     million years ago  but the number of species didn t explode until about     million years ago .  that happens to be just when flowering plants came into existence .  the  phase space  available for organisms suddenly acquired a new dimension     a new resource became available for exploitation .  the beetles were beautifully poised to take advantage by eating the new plants  especially their leaves .  it used to be thought that flowering plants and pollinating insects drove each other to wilder and wilder diversity  but that s not true .  however  it is true for beetles .  nearly half of today s beetle species are leaf eaters .  it s still an effective tactic .     sometimes natural disasters don t just eliminate a species or two .  the fossil record contains a number of  mass extinctions  in which a substantial proportion of all life on earth disappeared .  the best known mass extinction is the death of the dinosaurs     million years ago .   in order not to mislead you  we should point out at once that there is no scientific evidence for the existence of any dinosaur civilization  no matter what events are going on in the roundworld project .  but .  .  .  whenever a scientist says  there is no scientific evidence for   there are three important questions you should ask     especially if it s a government scientist .  these are   is there any evidence against .    has anyone looked .    and  if they did  would they expect to find anything .     the answers here are  no    no   and  no  .  deep time hides a lot  especially when it s assisted by continental movement  the bulldozing ice sheets  volcanic action and the occasional doomed asteroid .  there are few surviving human artefacts more than ten thousand years old  and if we died out today  the only evidence of our civilization that might survive for a million years would be a few dead probes in deep space and various bits of debris on the moon .  sixty five million .  not a chance .  so although a dinosaurian civilization is pure fantasy     or  rather  pure speculation     we can t rule it out absolutely .  as for dinosaurs who were sufficiently advanced to use tools  herd other dinosaurs  .  .  .  well  deep time would wash over them without a ripple .   dinosaurs are always among the most popular exhibits at museums .  they remind us that the world wasn t always like it is now  and they remind us that humans have been on this planet for a very short time  geologically speaking .  basically  dinosaurs are ancient lizards .  the ones whose bones we all go to gawp at in museums are rather big lizards  but many were much smaller .  the name means  terrible lizard   and anyone who watched jurassic park will understand why .   an italian fossil collector who watched the spielberg movie suddenly realized that a perplexing fossil  filed away for years in his basement  might well be a bit of a dinosaur .  he then sent it to a nearby university  where it was found not just to be a dinosaur  but a new species .  it was a young therapod     small flesh eating dinosaurs that are the closest relatives of birds .  interestingly  it didn t have any feathers .  a story straight out of the movies  narrative imperative at work in our own world  .  .  .  traceable  as always  to selective reporting .  how many fossil hunters owned a bit of dinosaur bone but didn t make the connection after seeing the movie .   in the human mind  dinosaurs resonate with myths about dragons  common to many cultures and many times  and many miles of suggestions have appeared to explain how the dragon thoughts in our minds have come down to us  over millions of years of evolution  from real dinosaur images and fears in the minds of our ancient ancestors .  however  those ancestors must have been very ancient  for those of our ancestors that overlapped the dinosaurs were probably tiny shrewlike creatures that lived in holes and ate insects .  after more than a hundred million years of success  the dinosaurs all died out     million years ago  and the evidence is that their demise was sudden .  did proto shrews have nightmares about dinosaurs  all that time ago .  could such nightmares have survived    million years of natural selection .  in particular  do shrews today have nightmares about fire breathing dragons  or is it just us .  it seems likely that the dragon myth comes from other  less literal  tendencies of that dark  history laden organ that we call the human mind .   dinosaurs exert a timeless fascination  especially for children .  dinosaurs are genuine monsters  they actually existed     and some of them  the ones we all know about  were gigantic .  they are also safely dead .   many small children  even if they are resistant to the standard reading materials in school  can reel off a long list of dinosaur names .   velociraptor  was not notable among them before jurassic park  but it is now .  those of us who still have an affection for the brontosaur often need to be reminded that for silly reasons science has deemed that henceforth that sinuous swamp dwelling giant must be renamed the apatosaur .   so attuned are we to the dinosaurs that the drama of their sudden disappearance has captured our imaginations more than any other bit of pakeontology .  even our own origins attract less media attention .   what about the sudden demise .   for a start  quite a few scientists have disputed that it ever was sudden .  the fossil record implicates the end of the cretaceous period     million years ago  as  d day  .  this was also the start of the so called tertiary period  or age of mammals  so the end of the dinosaurs is usually called the k t boundary      k  because germans spell cretaceous with a k .  but if we assume that the end of the cretaceous was  when it happened   then many species seemed to have anticipated their end by vanishing from the fossil record five to ten million years earlier .  did amorous dinosaurs  perhaps  say to each other  it s just not worth going through with this reproduction business  dear  we re all going to be wiped out in ten million years .   .  no .  so why the fuzzy fade out over millions of years .  there are good statistical reasons why we might not be able to locate fossils right up to the end  even if the species concerned were still alive .   to set the remark in context  how many specimens of tyrannosaurus rex  the most famous dinosaur of all  do you think that the world s universities and museums have between them .  not copies  but originals  dug from the rock by palaeontologists .  hundreds  .  .  .  surely .   no .  until jurassic park  there were precisely three  and the times when those particular animals lived have a spread of five million years .  three more fossilized t .  rexes have been found since  because jurassic park gave dinosaurs a lot of favourable publicity  making it possible to drum up enough money to go out and find some more .  with that rate of success  the chance of a future race finding any fossil humanoids  over the whole period of our and our ancestors  existence  would be negligible .  so if some species had survived on earth for a five million year period  it is entirely likely that no fossils of it will have been found     especially if it lived on dry land  where fossils seldom form .  this may suggest that the fossil record isn t much use  but quite the contrary applies .  every fossil that we find is proof positive that the corresponding species did actually exist  moreover  we can get a pretty accurate impression of the grand flow of life from an incomplete sample .  one lizard fossil is enough to establish the presence of lizards     even if we ve found only one species out of the ten thousand that were around .   bearing this in mind  though  we can easily see that even if the death of the dinosaurs was extremely sudden  then the fossil record might easily give a different impression .  suppose that fossils of a given species turn up randomly about every five million years .  sometimes they re like buses  and three come along at once     that is  within a million years of each other .  other times  they re also like buses  you wait all day  ten million years  and don t see any at all .  during the ten million year run up to the k t boundary  you find random fossils .  for some species  the last one you find is from    million years ago  for others it s from    million years ago .  for a few  by chance  it s from    million years ago .  so you seem to see a gradual fade out .   unfortunately  you d see much the same if there really had been a gradual fade out .  how can you tell the difference .  you should look at species whose fossils are far more common .  if the demise was a sudden one  those ought to show a sharper cut off .  species that live wholly or partially in water get fossilized more often  so the best way to time the k t mass extinction is to look at fossils of marine species .  wise scientists therefore mostly ignore the dinosaur drama and fiddle around with tiny snails and other undramatic species instead .  when they do  they find that ichthyosaurs also died out about then  as did the last of the ammonites  and many other marine groups .  so something sudden and dramatic really did happen at the actual boundary  but there may well have been a succession of other events just before it too .     what kind of drama .  an important clue comes from deposits of iridium  a rare metal in the earth s crust .  iridium is distinctly more common in some meteorites  particularly those from the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter so if you find an unusually rich deposit of iridium on earth  then it may well have come from an impacting meteorite .   in      the nobel winning physicist luis alvarez was musing along such lines  and he and his geologist son walter alvarez discovered a layer of clay that contains a hundred times as much iridium as normal .  it was laid down right at the k t boundary  and it can be found over the whole of the earth s land mass .  the alvarezes interpreted this discovery as a strong hint that a meteorite impact caused the k t extinction .  the total amount of iridium in the layer is estimated to be around         tons  tonnes   which is about the amount you d expect to find in a meteorite   miles     km  across .  if a meteorite that size were to hit the earth  travelling at a typical    miles per second     kps   it would leave an impact crater    miles     km  in diameter .  the blast would have been equivalent to thousands of hydrogen bombs  it would have thrown enormous quantities of dust into the atmosphere  blanking out sunlight for years  and if it happened to hit the ocean     a better than       chance     it would cause huge tidal waves and a short lived burst of superheated steam .  plants would die  large plant eating dinosaurs would run out of food and die too  carnivorous dinosaurs would quickly follow .  insects would on the whole fare a little better  as would insect eaters .   much evidence has accumulated that the chicxulub crater  a buried rock formation in the yucatan region of southern mexico  is the remnant of this impact .  crystals of shocked  quartz were spread far and wide from the impact site  the biggest ones are found near the crater  and smaller ones are found half way round the world .  in      a piece of the actual meteorite  a tenth of an inch    .   mm  across  was found in the north pacific ocean by frank kyte .  the fragment looks like part of an asteroid     ruling out a possible alternative  a comet  which might also create a similar crater .  according to a .  shukolyukov and g . w .  lugmair  the proportions of chromium isotopes in k t sediment confirm that view .  and andrew smith and charlotte jeffery have found that mass die backs of sea urchins which occurred at the k t boundary were worst in the regions around central america  where we think the meteorite came down .   although the evidence for an impact is strong  and has grown considerably over the twenty years since the alvarezes first advanced their meteorite strike theory  a strongly dissenting group of palaeontologists has looked to terrestrial events  not dramatic astronomical interference  to explain the k t extinction .  there was certainly a rapid series of climatic changes at the end of the cretaceous  with very drastic changes of sea level as ice caps grew or melted .  there is also good evidence that some seas  perhaps all  lost their oxygen based ecology to become vast  stinking  black  anaerobic sinks .  the fossil evidence for this consists of black iron and sulphur rich lines in sediments .  the most dramatic terrestrial events were undoubtedly associated with the vulcanism which resulted in the so called deccan traps  huge geological deposits of lava .  the whole of asia seems to have been covered with volcanoes  and they produced enough lava that it would have formed a layer    yards     m  thick if it had been spread over the whole continent .  such extensive vulcanism would have had enormous effects on the atmosphere  carbon dioxide emissions that warmed the atmosphere by the greenhouse effect  sulphur compounds resulting in terrible acid rain and freshwater pollution over the entire planet  and tiny rock particles blocking sunlight and causing  nuclear winters  for decades at a time .  could the volcanoes that formed the deccan traps have killed the dinosaurs  instead of a meteorite .  much depends on the timing .   our preferred theory  not because there is good independent evidence for it but because it would explain so much  and because it has a moral  is that the two causes are linked .  the chicxulub crater is very nearly opposite the deccan traps  on the other side of the planet .  perhaps volcanic activity in asia began some millions of years before the k t boundary  causing occasional ecological crises for the larger animals but nothing really final then the meteorite hit  causing shockwaves which passed right through the earth and converged  focused as if by a lens on just that fragile region of the planet s crust .   a similar effect happened on mercury  where a gigantic impact crater called the caloris basin is directly opposite  weird terrain  caused by focused shockwaves .    there would then have been a gigantic  synchronized burst of volcanism     on top of all the events of the collision  which would have been pretty bad on their own .  the combination could have polished off innumerable animal species .  in support of this idea  it should be said that another geological deposit  the siberian traps  contains ten times as much lava as the deccan system  and it so happens that the siberian traps were kid down at the time of another mass extinction  the great permian extinction  which we mentioned earlier .  to pile on further evidence  some geologists believe they have found another meteorite impact site in modern australia  which in permian times was opposite to siberia .   is there any evidence for this suggestion .  in       dallas abbott and ann isley analysed impact events to see whether they coincided with volcanic  superplumes   where large amounts of liquid rock well up from the earth   s mantle .  a superplume is thought to be responsible for the hawaiian island chain  for instance  whose relics stretch across half the pacific ocean .  the likely explanation is that as the continents drifted  the pacific plate moved  so that the superplume welled up in what seem to be different places .  however  very recent observations suggest that superplumes can move  too .  the deccan and siberian traps were also probably caused by superplumes .   the result of the analysis is that impacts and superplumes occur together far more often than they would if their association is due to chance .  that suggests that impacts can make superplumes bigger  or more likely .   it   s hard to see how superplumes could make impacts more likely  except by attracting invading aliens who are heavily into volcanism .   however  thanks to continental drift  it is not certain that the deccan traps were in fact on the exact far side of the earth from chicxulub at the time when the k t meteorite hit .  so we can   t yet be sure that the meteorite really did trigger massive volcanic activity .   the moral of this tale is that we should not look for  the  cause of the dinosaur extinction .  it is very rare for there to be just one cause of a natural event  unlike scientific experiments which are specially set up to reveal unique explanations .   on discworld  not only does death come for humans  scythe in hand  but diminutive sub deaths come for other animals     for example the death of rats in soul music  from whom a single  typical quote will suffice   squeak .    the death of dinosaurs would have been something to see  with volcanoes in one hand and an asteroid in the other  trailing a cloak of ice  .  .  .   they were wonderfully cinematic reptiles  weren t they .  trust the wizards to get it wrong .     there is another lesson to be learned from our emphasis on the demise of the dinosaurs .  many other large and or dramatic reptiles died out at the end of the cretaceous  notably the plesiosaurs  famous as a possible  explanation  of the mythical loch ness monster   the ichthyosaurs  enormous fish shaped predators  reptilian whales and dolphins   the pterosaurs  strange flying forms  of which the pterodactyls appear in all the dinosaur films and are labelled  wrongly  dinosaurs   and especially the mosasaurs  .   .   mosasaurs .   what were they .  they were as dramatic as the dinosaurs  but they weren t dinosaurs .  they didn t have as good a pr firm  though  because few non specialists have heard of them .  they are popularly known as fish lizards  not as good a name as  terrible lizard   and it describes them well .  some were nearly as fish like as ichthyosaurs  or dolphins  some were rather crocodile like  some were fifty foot predators like the great white shark  some were just a couple of feet long and fed on baby ammonites and other common molluscs .  they lasted a good twenty million years  and for much of that time they seem to have been the dominant marine predators .  yet most people meet the word in stories about dinosaurs  assume that the mosasaur was a not very interesting kind of dinosaur  and promptly forget them .   the other really strange thing about the k t extinction     probably not a  thing  in any meaningful sense  because in this context a thing would be an equation of unknowns  whereas what we have is a diversity of related puzzles     is which creatures survived it .  in the sea  the ammonites all died out  as did the other shelled forms like belemnites     unrolled ammonites     but the nautilus came through  as did the cuttlefish  squids  and octopuses .  amazingly the crocodiles  which to our eyes are about as dinosaur like as you can get without actually being one  survived the k t event with little loss of diversity .  and those little dinosaurs called  birds  came through pretty well unscathed .   there s a story here that we need to tell  quickly .  not so long ago  the idea that birds are the living remnants of the dinosaurs was new  controversial  and therefore a hot topic .  then it rapidly turned into the prevailing wisdom .  new fossil discoveries  however  have shown conclusively that the major families of modern birds diverged  in an evolutionary sense  long before the k t event .  so they aren t remnants of the dinosaurs that otherwise died     they got out early by ceasing to be dinosaurs at all .      myths  not least jurassic park itself  have suggested that dinosaurs are not  really  extinct at all .  they survive  or so semi fact semi fiction accounts lead us to believe  in lost world south american valleys  on uninhabited islands  in the depths of loch ness  on other planets  or more mystically as dna preserved inside bloodsucking insects trapped and encased in amber .  alas  almost certainly not .  in particular   ancient dna  reportedly extracted from insects fossilized in amber comes from modern contaminants  not prehistoric organisms     at least if the amber is more than a hundred thousand years old .   significantly  no one has made a film bringing back dodos  moas  pygmy elephants  or mosasaurs     only dinosaurs and hitler are popular for the reawakening myth .  both at the same time would be a good trick .   dinosaurs are the ultimate icon for an evolutionary fact which we generally ignore  and definitely find uncomfortable to think about  nearly all species that have ever existed are extinct .  as soon as we realize that  we are forced to look at conservation of animal species in new ways .  does it really matter that the lesser spotted pogo bird is down to its last hundred specimens  or that a hundred species of tree snail on a pacific island have been eaten out of existence by predators introduced by human activity .  some issues  like the importation of nile perch into lake victoria in order to improve the game fishing     which has resulted in the loss of many hundreds of fascinating  cichlid  fish species     are regretted even by the people responsible  if only because the new lake ecosystem seems to be much less productive .  everyone  except purveyors of bizarre ancient  medicines   their even more foolish customers  and some unreconstructed barbarians  seems to agree that the loss of magnificent creatures like the great whales  elephants  rhinos and of course plants like ginkgoes and sequoias would be a tragedy .  nevertheless  we persist in reducing the diversity of species in ecosystems all around the planet  losing many species of beetles and bacteria with hardly any regrets .   from the point of view of the majority of humans  there are  good  species  unimportant species  and  bad  species like smallpox and mosquitoes  which we would clearly be better off without .  unless you take an extreme view on the  rights  of all living creatures to a continued existence  you find yourself having to pass judgment about which species should be conserved .  and if you do take such an extreme view  you ve got a real problem trying to preserve the rights of cheetahs and those of their prey  such as gazelles .  on the other hand  if you take the task of passing judgment seriously  you can t just assume that  say  mosquitoes are bad and should be eliminated .  ecosystems are dynamic  and the loss of a species in one place may cause unexpected trouble elsewhere .  you have to examine the unintended consequences of your methods as well as the intended ones .  when worldwide efforts were made to eradicate mosquitoes  with the aim of getting rid of malaria  the preferred route was mass sprayings of the insecticide ddt .  for a time this appeared to be working  but the result in the medium term was to destroy all manner of beneficial insects and other creatures  and to produce resistant strains of mosquitoes which if anything were worse than their predecessors .  ddt is now banned worldwide     which unfortunately doesn t stop some people continuing to use it .   in the past  the environment was a context for us     we evolved to suit it .  now we ve become a context for the environment     we change it to suit us .  we need to learn how to do that  but going back to some imaginary golden age in which primitive humans allegedly lived in harmony with nature isn t the answer .  it may not be politically correct to say so  but most primitive humans did as much environmental damage as their puny technology would allow .  when humans came to the americas from siberia  by way of alaska  they slaughtered their way right down to the tip of south america in a few tens of thousands of years  wiping out dozens of species     giant tree sloths and mastodons  ancient elephants  like mammoths but different   for example .   some scientists have disagreed with this interpretation  claiming that humans could never have made that great an impact .  in       to test that claim  john alroy simulated the effect of hunting in computer models of    north american species .  it turned out that extinctions were virtually unavoidable  especially for the larger animals .  even highly incompetent hunters would have wiped them out .  the simulations correctly  postdicted  the fate of    of the    species  which adds credibility to their conclusions .   whodunit .    new scientist asked  offering its own suggestion   mr sapiens in the americas with a large axe .     there have been many similar examples of ecological devastation wrought by  primitive  humans .  the anasazi indians in the southern part of today s usa cut down forests to build their cliff dwellings  creating some of the most arid areas of the united states .  the maoris killed off the moas .  modern humans may be even more destructive  but there are more of us and technology can amplify our actions .  nevertheless  by the time humans were able to articulate the term  natural environment   there wasn t one .  we had changed the face of continents  in ways big and small .   to live in harmony with nature  we must know how to sing the same song as nature .  to do that  we must understand nature .  good intentions aren t enough .  science might be  if we use it wisely .       readers of the discworld book the last continent will recall that  by an amazing coincidence  beetles were something of a passion for the god of evolution .       rincewind would add some more    is it safe .     are you sure .     are you absolutely sure .        a worse case is what used to be called eohippus  the dawn horse     a beautiful  poetic name for the animal that formed the main stem of the horse s family tree .  it is now called hyracotherium  because somewhat earlier somebody had given that name to a creature that they thought was a relative of the hyrax  represented by a single fossil shoulder blade .  then it turned out that the bone was actually part of an eohippus .  unfortunately  whoever officially names a species first must get priority  so now the dawn horse has a silly  unpoetic name that commemorates a mistake .   we lost  brontosaurus      thunder lizard     for a similar reason .  thunder lizard  .  .  .  what a marvellous name .   apatosaurus  .  it probably means  gravitationally challenged lizard  .   the moral of this tale is that when learned committees of elderly scientists meet to discuss an exceptional issue they can always be trusted to make a completely ridiculous decision .  quite unlike the wizards of unseen university  naturally .       lots of ammonite species died out      million years before the k t boundary  so it looks as if their extinction genuinely was gradual .  but whatever it was that happened at the k t boundary finished them off .       thirty nine   backsliders    gloom had settled over the wizards .  some of them had even refused a third helping at dinner .    it s not as if they were very advanced   said the dean  in an attempt to cheer everyone up .   they weren t even using metal .  and their writing was frankly nothing but pictograms .     why doesn t that sort of this thing happen here .   said the senior wrangler  merely toying with his trifle .    well  there have been historical examples of mass extinction   said ponder .    yes  but only as a result of argumentative wizardry .  that s quite different .  you don t expect rocks to drop out of the sky .     you don t expect them to stay up   said ridcully .   in a proper universe  the turtle snaps up most of them and the elephants get the rest .  protects the world .  y know  it seems to me that the most sensible thing any intelligent lifeform could do on that little world would be to get off it .     nowhere to go   said ponder .    nonsense .  there s a big moon .  and there s other balls floating around this star .     all too hot  too cold  or completely without atmosphere   said ponder .    people would just have to make their own entertainment .  anyway  .  .  .  there s plenty of other suns  isn t there .     all far too far away .  it would take  .  .  .  well  lifetimes to get there .     yes  but being extinct takes forever .    ponder sighed .   you d set out not even knowing if there s a world you could live on  sir   he said .    yes  but you d be leavin  one that you d know you couldn t   said ridcully calmly .   not for any length of time  anyway .     there are new lifeforms turning up  sir .  i went and checked before dinner .     tell that to the lizards   sighed the senior wrangler .    any of the new ones any good .   said ridcully .    they re  .  .  .  more fluffy  sir .    doin  anything interesting .     eating leaves  mainly   said ponder .   there are some much more realistic trees now .     billions of years of history and we ve got a better tree   sighed the senior wrangler .    no  no  that s got to be a step in the right direction   said ridcully  thoughtfully .    oh .  how so .     you can make paper out of trees .      the wizards stared into the omniscope .    oh  how nice   said the lecturer in recent runes .   ice again .  it s a long time since we ve had a really big freeze .     well  look at the universe   said the dean .   it s mainly freezing cold with small patches of boiling hot .  the planet s only doing what it knows .     you know  we re certainly learning a lot from this project   said ridcully .   but it s mainly that we should be grateful we re living on a proper world .      a few million years passed  as they do .   the dean was on the beach and almost in tears .  the other wizards appeared nearby and wandered over to see what the fuss was about .   rincewind was waist deep in water  apparently struggling with a medium sized dog .    that s right   the dean shouted .   turn it round .  use a stick if you have to .     what the thunder is going on here .   said ricully .    look at them .   said the dean  beside himself with rage .   backsliders .  caught them trying to return to the ocean .    ridcully glanced at one of the creatures  which was lying in the shallows and chewing on a crab .    didn t catch them soon enough  did you   he said .   they ve got webbed paws .     there s been too much of this sort of thing lately .   snapped the dean .  he waved his finger at one of the creatures  who watched it carefully in case it turned out to be a fish .    what would your ancestors say  my friend  if they saw you rushing into the water just because times are a bit tough on land .   he said .    er  .  .  .    welcome back  .   suggested rincewind  trying to avoid the snapping jaws .    long time no sea  .   said the senior wrangler  cheerfully .   the creature begged  uncertainly .    oh  go on  if you must   said the dean .   fish  fish  fish  .  .  .  you ll turn into a fish one of these days .     y know  going back to the sea might not be a bad idea   said ridcully  as they strolled away along the beach .   beaches are edges .  you always get interestin  stuff on the edge .  look at those lizards we saw on the islands .  their world was all edges .     yes  but giving up the land to just go swimming around in the water .  i don t call that evolution .     but if you go on land where you have to grow a decent brain and some cunning and a bit of muscle in order to get anything done  and then you go back to see the sea where the fish have never had to think about anything very much  you could really  er  kick butt .     do fish have     .     all right  all right .  i meant  in a manner of speaking .  it was just a thought  anyway .   uncharacteristically  the archchancellor frowned .    back to the sea   he said .   well  you can t blame them .        forty   mammals on the make    after the dinosaurs came the mammals      not exactly .   mammals constitute the most obvious class of animal alive on earth today .  when we say  animal  in ordinary conversation  we re mostly referring to mammals     cats  dogs  elephants  cows  mice  rabbits  whatever .  there are about       species of mammals  and they are astonishingly diverse in shape  size  and behaviour .  the largest mammal  the blue whale  lives in the ocean and looks like a fish but isn t  it can weigh     tons          kg  .  the smallest mammals  various species of shrew  live in holes in the ground and weigh about an ounce     g  .  roughly in the middle come humans which  paradoxically  have specialized in being generalists .  we are the most intelligent of the mammals     sometimes .   the main distinguishing feature of mammals is that when they are young their mother feeds them on milk  produced by special glands .  other features that  nearly  all mammals have in common include their ears  specifically the three tiny bones in the middle ear known as the anvil  stirrup  and hammer  which send sound to the eardrum  hair  except on adult whales   and the diaphragm  which separates the heart and lungs from the rest of the internal organs .  virtually all mammals bear live young  the exceptions are the duckbilled platypus and the echidna  which lay eggs .  another curious feature is that mammalian red blood cells lack a nucleus  whereas the red cells of all other vertebrates possess a nucleus .  all is this is evidence for a lengthy common evolutionary history  subject to a few unusual events of which the most significant was the early separation of australia from the rest of gondwanaland .  modern studies of mammalian dna confirm that basically we are all one big happy family .   when the dinosaurs died out  the mammals had a field day .  released from dinosaurian thrall  they could occupy environmental niches that  only a few million years before  would merely have presented a dinosaur with an easy meal .  it seems likely that the current diversity of mammals has a lot to do with the suddenness with which they came into their kingdom     for a while  almost any lifestyle was good enough to make a living .  however  it would be wrong to imagine that the mammals came into existence to fill the gaps left by the vanished dinosaurs .  mammals had coexisted with dinosaurs for at least     million years .   harry jerison has suggested that before the dinosaurs became really dominant  many mammals were able to make their living in daylight  and they evolved good eyesight to do so .  as the dinosaurs became a bigger and bigger problem  the mammals adopted a lower profile  mostly staying hidden undergound during the day .  if you re a nocturnal animal  you rely on a really good sense of hearing  so evolutionary pressures then equipped the mammals with excellent ears     including those three little bones .  however  they retained their eyesight .  so when the mammals again dared to venture out into the daylight  they had good eyesight and good hearing .  the combination gave them a substantial advantage over most remaining competitors .   mammals evolved from an order of triassic reptiles known as therapsids     small  quick moving hunters  mostly  though some were herbivores .  compared to other reptiles  the therapsids were not especially impressive  but their low profile lifestyle led  in stages  to the distinctive features of mammals .  a diaphragm leads to more efficient breathing  useful if you need to run fast .  it also lets the young animals continue to breathe while mother is feeding them her milk     changes to animals  co evolve  as a whole suite of cooperative attributes  not one at a time .  hair keeps you warm  and the warmer you are  the faster all your bodily parts can move  .  .  .  and so on .   all this makes it difficult to decide when the mammal like reptilian ancestors of the therapsids became reptile like mammals  .  .  .  but  as we ve said  humans have problems with becomings .  there was no such point  instead  there was a mostly gradual  but occasionally bumpy  transition .   the earliest fossils that can definitely be identified as mammals come from     million years ago     creatures rejoicing in the name  morganucodontids  .  these were shrews  probably nocturnal  probably insect eaters  probably egg layers .  darwin s detractors objected to having apes as their ancestors  heaven knows what they would have thought about bug eating egg laying shrews .  but there s good news too  if you re of that turn of mind  because morganucodontids were brainy .  not especially brainy for a shrew  but brainy compared to the reptiles from which they evolved .  admittedly  this was largely because the therapsids were as thick as two short  .  .  .  er  slices of tree fern  but it was a start .   how do we know that these early shrews were true mammals .  one of the bits of an animal that survives as a fossil far more often than any other bit is the tooth .  this is why palaeontologists use teeth  above all else  to identify species of long dead animals .  there are plenty of species for which the sole evidence is a tooth or two .  fortunately  you can tell a lot about an animal by its teeth .  on the whole  the bigger the tooth is  the bigger the animal  an elephant s tooth today is a lot bigger than an entire mouse  so whatever animal it came from  it couldn t be mouse sized .  if you can find a jawbone  a whole array of teeth  all the better .  the shape of a tooth tells us a lot about what the animal ate     grinding teeth are for plants  slicing teeth are for meat .  the arrangement of teeth in a jawbone tells us a lot more .  the morganucodontids made a major breakthrough in tooth design  teeth that interlocked when the jaws were brought together  very effective at cutting bits off meat or insects .  they also paid a heavy price for their teeth  one that we still pay today .  reptiles continually produce new teeth  as old ones wear down  they get replaced .  we produce just two set of teeth  milk teeth as children and the real thing as adults .  when our adult teeth wear out  the only replacements available are artificial .  blame the morganucodontids for this  if you want to take advantage of precisely interlocking teeth  you have to maintain that precision  which is impractical if you keep discarding teeth and growing new ones .  so they grew only two sets of teeth  and we have to do likewise .   from this we can deduce more .  with only two sets of teeth  the morganucodontids had to have some special trick for feeding their young  something different from the reptiles with their continuous succession of teeth .  there isn t room for a full set of adult teeth in a baby shrew  and if teeth only come in two stages  you can t add the odd one every so often as the jaw grows bigger .  the easy solution is to have babies with no teeth at all  to start with .  but what can they then eat .  something nutritious and easily digested     milk .  so we think that milk production evolved before those high precision interlocking teeth .  this is one reason why the morganucodontids are definitely placed among the mammals .   amazing what you can learn from a few teeth .     as they prospered and diversified  mammals evolved into two main types  placental mammals  where the mother carries the young in her uterus  and marsupials  where she carries them in a pouch .  the marsupial that springs most readily to mind is the kangaroo     possibly because it springs most readily to almost anything  as for example in the last continent      and  .  .  .  what s kangaroo for  you are needed for a quest of the utmost importance  .   said rincewind  with guileful innocence .    you know  it s funny you should ask that         the sandals barely moved .  rincewind rose from them like a man leaving the starting blocks  and when he landed his feet were already making running movements in the air .   after a while the kangaroo came alongside and accompanied him in a series of easy bounds .    why are you running away without even listening to what i have to say .    i ve had long experience of being me   panted rincewind .   i know what s going to happen .  i m going to be dragged into things that shouldn t concern me .  and you re just a hallucination caused by rich food on an empty stomach  so don t try to stop me .     stop you .   said the kangaroo .   when you re heading in the right direction .      australia alone has over a hundred species of marsupials     in fact most native australian mammals are marsupials .  another seventy or so are found in the same general region     tasmania  new guinea  timor  sulawesi  various smaller neighbouring islands .  the rest are opossums and some diminutive ratlike creatures  mainly in south america  though ranging into central america and for one species of opossum right up into canada .   it looks as though placental mammals generally win out against marsupials  but the difference isn t so great  and if there aren t any competing placental mammals then marsupials do very well indeed .  there are even some close parallels between marsupials and pla centals     a good example is the koala  bear   which isn t a true bear but looks like an unusually cuddly one .   most marsupials resemble  parallel  placentals  a very curious case is the thylacine  otherwise known as the tasmanian tiger or tasmanian wolf  which is distinctly wolflike and has a striped rear .  the thylacine was officially declared extinct in       but there are persistent reports of occasional sightings  and suitable habitat still exists  so don t be surprised if the thylacine makes a comeback .  national park ranger charlie beasley reported watching one for two minutes in tasmania in      .  similar sightings have been reported from queensland s sunshine coast since       if these sightings are genuine  they are probably of thylacines whose recent ancestors escaped from zoos .   why such a concentration of marsupials in australia .  the fossil record makes it clear that marsupials originated in the americas     most probably north america  but that s not so certain .  placentals arose in what is now asia  but was then linked to the other continents  so they spread into europe and the americas .  before placental mammals really got going in the americas  marsupials migrated to australia by way of antarctica  which in those days wasn t the frozen wasteland it is now .  australia was already moving away from south america  but hadn t yet gone all that far  and neither had antarctica  so presumably the migration involved  island hopping   or taking advantage of land bridges that temporarily rose from the ocean .  by    million years ago     oddly enough  the time that the dinosaurs died out  though that s probably not significant     australia was well separated from the other continents  antarctica included  and australian evolution was pretty much on its own .   in the absence of serious competition  the marsupials thrived     just as ground birds did in new zealand  and for the same reason .  but back in the americas and elsewhere  the superior placental mammals ousted the marsupials almost completely .   until a few years ago it was assumed that the placentals never made it to australia at all     except for the very late arrival of rodents and bats from south east asia about    million years ago  and subsequent human introduction of species like dogs and rabbits .  this theory was demolished when mike archer found a single fossil tooth at a place called tingamarra .  the tooth is from a placental mammal  and it is    million years old .   from the form of the tooth it is clear that this mammal had hooves .   did a lot of placental mammals accompany the marsupials on their migration down under .  or was it just a few .  either way  why did the placentals die out and the marsupials thrive .   we have no idea .   early marsupials probably lived in trees  to judge by their forepaws .  early placentals probably lived on the ground  especially in burrows .  this difference in habitat allowed them to coexist for a long time .  marsupial extinctions in the americas were helped along by humans  who found marsupials especially easy to kill .   in australia  about               years ago  there were sudden extinctions of genyornis  the heaviest bird ever  and of the marsupial equivalent of a lion .  again  evidence suggest that humans were responsible  but the theory was hotly disputed because it was difficult to date the events accurately .  and  we suspect  because many people wish to believe that all  primitive  humans lived in exquisite harmony with their environment .  in      linda ayliffe and richard roberts used how accurate dating methods to find out when    species  found as fossils at    separate sites  disappeared .  they all went extinct        years ago     just after the aborigines  the first humans to reach australia  arrived .   later arrivals were no better .  when european settlers turned up  from      onwards  they very nearly wiped out numerous marsupial species .     the evolutionary history of the placenta .  mammals is controversial and has not been mapped out in detail .  an early branch of the family tree was the sloths  anteaters  and armadillos     all animals that look  primitive   even though there s no earthly reason why they should  because today s sloths  anteaters  and armadillos have evolved just as much as today s everything else s  having survived over the same period .   mammals really got going during the early tertiary period  about    to    million years ago .  the climate then was mild  with deciduous forests at both poles .  it looks as if whatever killed the dinosaurs also changed the climate  so that in particular it was much more rainy than it had been during dinosaur times  and the rainfall was distributed more evenly throughout the year  instead of all coming at once in a rainy season .  tropical forests covered much of the planet  but they were mainly inhabited by tiny tree dwelling mammals .  no big carnivores  not even big plant eaters  .  .  .  no leopards  no deer  no elephants .  it took the mammals several million years to evolve bigger bodies .  possibly the forests were much denser than they had been when there were dinosaurs around  because there weren t any big animals to trample paths through them .  if so  there was less incentive for a big animal to evolve  because it wouldn t be able to move easily through the forest .   once mammalian diversity started to get going  it exploded .  there were tigerlike animals and hippolike animals and giant weasels .  by modern standards  though  they were all a bit lumpish and cumbersome     nothing as graceful as the slim boned creatures that came later  such as gazelles .   by    million years ago  antarctica had reverted to being an icecap  and the world was cooling .  mammalian evolution had settled down  and what changes did occur were relatively small .  there were bear dogs and giraffe rhinoceroses and pigs the size of cows  llamas and camels and sylphlike deer  and a rabbit with hooves .  by    million years ago  the climate was warming up again .  antarctica had separated from south america  making big changes to the flow of ocean currents  now cold water could go round and round the south pole indefinitely .  the sea level fell as water got locked up in ice at the poles  with more land exposed and less ocean the climate became more extreme  because land temperatures can change more quickly than sea ones .  falling sea levels opened up land bridges between previously isolated continents  isolated ecologies started to mix up as animals migrated along the new connections .  and round about this time  the evolution of some mammals took an unusual turn .  a u turn .   they went back to the sea .   the land animals had originally come out of the sea     despite the wizards  best efforts to stop them .  now a few mammals decided they d be better off going back there .  the wizards consider such a tactic to be a spineless piece of backsliding  giving up and going back home .  even to us it looks like a retrograde step  almost counter evolutionary  if it was such a good idea to come out of the oceans in the first place  how could it be worthwhile to go back again .  but the evolutionary game is played against a changing background  and the oceans had changed .  in particular  the available food had changed .  so in the mid eocene we find the earliest fossils of whales  such as the sixty foot     m  long basilosaurus  which had a pair of tiny legs at the base of its long tail .  we ve found fossils of its ancestors  and they really did look like small dogs .   the mediterranean sea was dammed  africa came into contact with europe  and creatures previously confined to africa spread into europe  among them elephants     and apes .  horses evolved  as did true cats  such as the famous sabre toothed tiger  .  by five million years ago  most of today s mammals were represented in recognizable form  and the climate had become similar to today s .   the scene was set for the evolution of humans .   not that it had all been set up in order to lead to us  you appreciate .  our early ancestors just happened to be in a position to take advantage of the world as it then was .  they did so .     we can trace the ancestry of modern mammals     indeed all living creatures that still exist today     by mapping out changes in their dna .  the rate at which dna mutates     acquires random errors in its code     leads to a  dna clock  that can be used to estimate the timing of past events .  when this technique was first discovered  it was widely hailed as a precise and therefore uncontroversial way to resolve difficult questions about which animals  ancestors were more closely related to what .  it is now becoming clear that precision alone cannot provide definitive answers to such questions .   the issue of interpretation     what does this result mean .      can still be controversial  even if the result itself can be made precise .  for example  s .  blair hedges and sudhir kumar have applied the dna clock to     genes in     species of modern vertebrates  rhinos  elephants  rabbits  and so on .  their results suggest that many of these lineages were around at least     million years ago  coexisting with the dinosaurs  though no doubt the early elephant and rhino ancestors were rather small .  the fossil record agrees that there were mammals then  but not those .  the molecular biologists claim that the fossil record must be misleading  palaeontologists are convinced that the dna clock sometimes ticks faster and sometimes ticks slower .  the debate continues     but for what it s worth  our money is on the palaeontologists .   one big surprise about mammal dna is how much of it there is .  you might expect a sophisticated creature like a mammal to be  hard to build  and therefore require more dna  just as the blueprint for a jumbo jet has to be more complicated than that for a kite .   not so .   mammals have less dna     shorter genomes     than many apparently simpler animals  for example frogs and newts .   there s a good reason for this apparent paradox  and it illuminates the difference between dna and a blueprint .  dna is more like a recipe     and a recipe that makes a lot of assumptions about what else you have in your kitchen  so that none of that needs to be spelled out in the recipe book .  in essence  the kitchen for mammals has a really well controlled oven  capable of ensuring nice  even cooking temperature  so a whole lot of tricks about what to do if the temperature changes need not be mentioned .   in the frog kitchen  on the other hand  the temperature goes up and down depending on the time of day and the weather  so the recipe has to deal with all contingencies  requiring more dna code .  by  kitchen  here we mean the environment in which the embryonic animal has to develop .  for a frog  the kitchen is a pond .  for a mammal  the kitchen is mother .   mammals evolved good temperature control     unlike the reptiles  they are warm blooded  but what matters is not so much being warm  as being controllable .  frog dna is full of genes for making lots of different enzymes  together with instructions along the lines of  use enzyme a if the temperature is lower than    c  use b if the temperature is between    c and     c  use c if the temperature is between     c and     c  .  .  .   mammal dna just says  use enzyme x   knowing that mother will take care of temperature variations .  frog dna is a rocket  mammal dna is a space elevator .   how did this change take place .  perhaps when mammals first evolved  their dna gained extra instructions  but after temperature control evolved  a lot of the dna became redundant  and it either got dumped or got subverted to other uses .  on the other hand  we have no idea what the dna of early mammals actually looked like     maybe it was all shorter in those days  maybe today s frogs and newts have much more extensive recipes than ancient ones .  but on balance it seems more likely that mammals just eliminated a lot of surplus instructions .   modern technology uses the same trick .  because the machinery that makes today s consumer goods is extremely precise and accurate  those goods can be simpler than they were in the past .  a soft drinks can  for example  is little more than a piece of aluminium that has been formed into a cylinder  with another flat bit on top to act as a lid  a weak line for the tab to tear along  and a ring  or nowadays a lever  attached to the tab .  it replaces the bottle  which consisted of two or more bits of moulded glass  welded  together  a metal cap  and a slice of cork .  the simplicity of the can comes at a price  very careful control of the forming process .   there are many scientists who insist that an organism s dna determines everything about it     even though it manifestly does not     and they argue that the mother s temperature control system is included in her dna recipe .  this may well be true  but even if it is   this organism s  dna has somehow migrated to another organism  mother  not her offspring  .  as soon as two generations are involved in implementing the genetic blueprint  a gap opens up into which things can be inserted that are not genetic at all .  we ve already mentioned several  for example prions in the reproduction of yeast .     our mammalian ancestry may even be responsible for one of the more bizarre modern myths  persistent tales of people being abducted by aliens .  ufologists allege that one american in twenty now claims to have undergone such an experience  but they would  wouldn t they .   .  if true  this figure is a remarkable and not very happy comment either on the critical faculties of that great nation or on the habits of an unknown spacefaring species .   as it happens  the figure is bogus .  it originates in a roper poll of       which revealed that one american in fifty had undergone such an experience .  but as joel best pointed out in his book damned lies and statistics in       the number of people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens was actually zero .  the pollsters  worried a direct question about aliens would put people off  used five  symptoms  of abduction instead .  anyone who scored sufficiently highly on those symptoms was deemed to have undergone an abduction experience .   the questions were things like  have you ever woken up paralysed with the sense of some strange presence in the room .   this sensation is typical of  sleep paralysis   the most obvious rational explanation of abduction experiences  which we describe shortly .  so really the roper poll was a survey about sleep paralysis .  only the researchers thought that it had anything to do with alien abduction .  the subjects had more sense .   be that as it may  a lot of people are convinced that strange aliens  usually with big black eyes and pear shaped heads like the ones in close encounters of the third kind  landed a ufo near them  loaded them on board  and took them for a flight round the solar system while carrying out weird experiments  often of a sexual nature  on them .  after which they were calmly returned to the very spot from which they had been abducted  as if absolutely nothing had happened .   the first thing to say is that without doubt many of these experiences are false .  ian once did a radio broadcast which included a woman who had undergone a convincing experience of being abducted     except that she knew she hadn t really been  because her family told her she d been asleep beside the fire the whole time .  jack once met a woman who claimed that the aliens abducted her and took away her baby .  so he asked a question that nobody else had thought to ask  the woman included   were you pregnant .     no .    the point is that to the victims  the experience felt real .  even though logic told them it couldn t have happened  they either didn t apply the logic  or they did but still remembered the experience vividly .  we deduce that the human mind sometimes has vivid memories that do not correspond to real events .  of course we must also observe that just because some alien abductions aren t real  that doesn t imply they all aren t .  however  if we can find a sensible mechanism for otherwise reasonable people believing that they really were carted off in a ufo  then the burden of proof shifts dramatically and evidence of abduction stronger than sincere expressions of belief becomes necessary .   reports of alien abductions are not new .  back in the middle ages  however  they would have been either flights on witches  broomsticks or encounters with fabulous creatures like the succubus  a demon in a woman s body who allegedly had sex with men while they slept .  the witches of discworld employ broomsticks for transport only .  the sex bit doesn t appeal to them at all     except for nanny ogg  of course .   folk tales of succubi and their like can be found worldwide .  in newfoundland people tell of an ancient hag sitting on their chests at night  and in vietnam they speak of the  grey ghost  .  what seems to be going on is some common mental pattern  overlaid with cultural influences .  that s why abductions by witches riding broomsticks have gone out of vogue  but abductions by aliens riding ufos are flavour of the decade .   susan blackmore thinks that all of these experiences are  and were  caused by sleep paralysis .  this is a feature of the mind that prevents sleeping people from moving their limbs as they would if they were acting out their dreams .  such a  mental switch  is important for any animal that dreams  you don t really want to go sleepwalking out of your cosy burrow and straight down a predator s throat .  plenty of mammals dream     most of us have seen a cat or dog asleep with its legs twitching  and the evidence from recordings of the brain s electrical activity is that the animals are engaged in something that closely resembles the brain activity of a dreaming human .  we can t be sure whether cats have visual dreams like we do  but sleep and dreaming take place in primitive parts of the brain  so they probably go back a long way in our evolutionary history .  at any rate  if the sleep paralysis system malfunctions  people who are partially awake may undergo sleep paralysis .  experiments show that in such cases they typically get a strong impression that  somebody is there  .   this feature of the human mind may go back to the time  just after the meteorite hit  when the nocturnal mammals suddenly awoke in a world without dinosaurs .  their senses of hearing and sight  previously separate from each other because they had evolved at very different periods and in very different circumstances  would have become linked together .  when their ears heard something strange  their visual sense would kick in and make them feel that they could see what was causing it .  we inherited this tendency  but we interpret it in terms of the current culture  bogeymen  witches  maybe even dragons a few centuries ago  aliens with big black eyes today .  the sexual link is straightforward  too  dreams about sex are very common anyway .   oh  yes  one more thing  since we ve all watched close encounters  we know exactly what an alien must look like  .  .  .  just as everyone used to know that witches soared through the air on a broomstick .  so our visual system knows what shape it should give to whatever it sees when we get that funny feeling that something is haunting us .  and flying saucers have come on nicely  too  from being the rivet studded things that were all the rage in galactic circles in the early fifties .   stories of people seeing ghosts may well have the same explanation .  you ve read the tales  you know what a ghost ought to look like  maybe you watched ghostbusters or a stephen king movie   and you re trying to sit up all night in the haunted house .  you re thinking about ghosts  about headless horsemen and elizabethan ladies who walk through walls and go transparent  and then you start to doze off because it s   am and you ve been up all night .  .  .  the sleep paralysis circuit glitches  .  .  .  aaaaagh .       ok  if you insist     our favoured line here is  hairy  .  but hairs don   t fossilize  so how can you tell .  if you have hair  you need grooming .  all over the body .  this requires flexible backbones  and you can tell how flexible they are from the shape of the vertebrae .  which do fossilize .   sometimes scientists can be very ingenious .   evolution crossed that line about     million years ago .       how many recipe books do you have that tell you to boil water  but never specify the altitude at which this should be done .  it matters  higher up  water boils at lower temperatures .       forty one   don t play god    the archchancellor was rather quiet over tea .   eventually he said   can we stop this project  ponder .     er  .  .  .  are you sure  sir .     well  what is it achieving .  i mean  really .  y know  i thought  all you had to do is get a world working  and before you could say  creation  there d be some creature who d stand up  getting a grip on its surroundings  gaze with a certain amount of intelligence and awe at the infinite sky and say             .  .  . that thing s getting bigger  i wonder if it s going to hit us   said rincewind .    rincewind  that remark was extremely cynical and accurate .     sorry  archchancellor .    bonder s lips were moving quietly as he worked things out .    we could start running it down  yes .  the thaumic reactor hasn t been putting so much into it in the last week .  we ve nearly used up the fuel .     really .     the squash court will have a rather high thaumic index  sir  so whoever goes in to pull the switch will suffer a certain amount of         there was the sound of something spinning .  the wizards looked at rincewind s chair  which finally fell over on to the flagstones .  of its former occupant there was no sign  although there was the distant sound of a slamming door .   the dean sniffed .    strange behaviour   he said .    i suggest we give it one more day of our time   said ridcully .   i was hoping we might create a world  gentlemen  but instead it s clear to me that any life in this universe has to get used to living in  .  .  .  in some kind of huge celestial snow globe .  fire and ice  ice and fire .  gentlemen  round worlds are intrinsically flawed .  if there s any hidden gods on ours  they re pretty damn well hidden .     the omnians say  don t play god .  he always wins    said the senior wrangler .    i dare say   said ridcully  so  .  .  .  one more day  gentlemen .  and then we can get on with something sensible .      the red sun rose quickly over the parched veldt .  the apes stirred in their cave  which was little more than a rocky overhang  and saw the big black rectangle looming over them .   the dean tapped it with his pointer   do try to pay attention today  will you .   he turned and chalked rapidly across the blackboard .   here we have r  .  .  .  o  .  .  .  c  .  .  .  k  rock .  can anyone tell me what you do with it .  anyone .  anyone .  look  stop doing that  will you .   he tried to hit an ape with his virtual pointer  and then flung it away in disgust .  it vanished .    filthy little devils   he muttered .    not getting anywhere  dean .   said ridcully  appearing beside him .    no  archchancellor .  i ve tried to explain to them that they ve probably got just a few million years  and that s pretty hard to do in sign language  let me tell you .  but the only word they know is s e x  and they don t waste time spelling it  oh no .  for this i skipped breakfast .     never mind .  let s see how the senior wrangler s getting on .     they re just bad copies of humans  if you ask me         the wizards vanished .   one of the apes knuckled over to the blackboard  and watched it disappear from view as hex completed the spell .   he hadn t the faintest idea what had been happening  but he had been impressed by the stick that had been waved about .  that seemed to have gone now .  that didn t worry the ape  which knew about things vanishing     often  these days  a member of the clan would vanish overnight  with a lot of snarling in the shadows .   there was probably something you could do with a stick  he thought .  hopefully  it might involve sex .   he poked around in the debris and found not a stick but a dried up thighbone  which had a sufficiently stick like shape .   he rattled it on the ground a few times .  it didn t do anything much .  then he reluctantly decided it would probably be impossible to mate with at the moment  and hurled it high into the air .   it rose  turning over and over .   when it fell  it knocked him unconscious .     the senior wrangler was sitting under a virtually there beach umbrella when the other wizards arrived .  he looked as downcast as the dean .   a group of apes was playing in the surf .    worse than the lizards   he said .   they had some style  at least .  when this lot pick up anything  they try to see if they can eat it .  what s the point of that .     well  i suppose they can find out if it s edible   said ridcully .    but they just mess about   said the senior wrangler .   oh  no  .  .  .  here we go again  .  .  .    there was a raucous shrieking as the tribe rushed out of the waves and swung up into the nearby mangrove trees .  a shadow sped beyond the surf and headed back into the blue water  to an unregarded chorus of simian catcalls and mangrove seeds .    oh yes  and they like throwing things   said the senior wrangler .    seafood is good for the brain  my granny always said   said ridcully .    this lot couldn t eat too much of it  then .  yell  throw things  and prod stuff to see what it does  that s the extent of their capabilities .  oh  why didn t we discover the lizards earlier .  they had class .       wouldn t have stopped the snowball   said ridcully .    no .  you were right  archchancellor .  it s so pointless .    the three wizards stood looking gloomily out to sea .  in the middle distance  dolphins stitched their way across the water .    should be coming up to coffee time   said the dean  to break the silence .    good thinking  that man .    rincewind was wandering in the next bay  staring at the cliffs .  oh  things were killed off on the discworld  but .  .  .  well .  .  .  sensibly .  there were floods  fires and  of course  heroes .  there was nothing like a hero for a species whose number was up .  but at least some actual thought went into it .   the cliff was a series of horizontal lines .  they represented ancient surfaces  some of which rincewind had virtually walked on .  and in many of them were the bones of ancient creatures  turned into stone by a process rincewind did not understand and rather distrusted .  life had some how come out of the rocks of this world  and here you could see it going back .  there were whole layers of rock made out of life  millions of years of little skeletons .  faced with a natural wonder on that scale  you could only be overawed by the sheer chasms of time or else try to find someone to complain to .   a few rocks fell out  halfway up the cliff .  a couple of small legs waved uncertainly in the strata  and then the luggage tumbled out  slid down the pile of debris at the foot of the cliff  and landed on its lid .   rincewind watched it struggle for a while  sighed  and pushed it the right way up .  at least some things didn t change .       forty two   anthill inside    you know what s going to happen to the apes     they re going to turn into us .   but why do we have them playing in the surf .  because it s fun .  yes  .  .  .  but more significantly  because the seashore is central to one of the two main theories about how our ape ancestors acquired big brains .  the other  more orthodox theory places the evolution of the big brain out on the african savannahs  and we know that some of our ancestors lived on the savannahs because we ve found fossils .  unfortunately  seashores aren t a good place to leave fossils .  you often find them there  but that s because they were deposited when the area wasn t a seashore at all  and the sea has subsequently eroded the rocks to expose the fossils .  in the absence of direct evidence of this kind  the surfing apes theory has to take second place  .  .  .  but it does explain our brains rather neatly  whereas the savannah theory rather sidesteps this issue .     our closest living relatives are two species of chimpanzee  the standard boisterous  zoo  chimp pan troglodytes and its more slender cousin the bonobo  or pygmy  chimp pan paniscus .  bonobos live in very inaccessible parts of zaire  and weren t recognized as a separate species of chimpanzee until      .  we can to some extent unravel the past evolutionary history of the great apes by comparing their dna sequences .  human dna differs from the dna of either chimpanzee by a mere   .        that is  we have    .    of our dna sequences in common with theirs .   it is interesting to speculate on what the victorians would have made of this .   the two species of chimpanzee have dna that differs by only   .    .  gorillas differ from us  and from both chimps  by   .    .  for orangutans  the difference from us is   .    .   these differences may seem small  but you can pack an awful lot into a small percentage of an ape genome .  a big chunk of what we have in common must surely consist of  subroutines  that organize basic features of vertebrate and mammalian architecture  tell us how to be an ape  and tell us how to deal with things we ve all got     like hair  fingers  internal organs  blood  .  .  .  the mistake is to imagine that everything that makes us human and not a chimpanzee must live in that other   .    of  special  dna     but dna doesn t work that way .  for example  some of the genes in that   .    of the genome may organize the other    .    in a completely new way .  if you look at the computer code for a wordprocessor and a spreadsheet  you ll find they have an awful lot in common     routines for reading the keyboard  printing to the screen  searching for a given text string  changing fonts to italic  responding to a click on the mouse  .  .  .  but this doesn t mean that the only distinction between a spreadsheet and a wordprocessor lies in the relatively few routines that are different .   since evolution involves changes to dna  we can use the sizes of those differences to estimate when various ape species diverged from each other .  this method was introduced by charles sibley and jon ahlquist in       and while it needs to be interpreted with caution  it works well here .   a convenient unit of time for such discussions is the  grandfather   which we define to be    years .  it s a good human length  being about the age difference between the child and the grandparent who says  when i was young  .  .  .   and passes on a sense of history .  in these terms  christ lived    grandfathers ago  and the babylonians go back about     grandfathers .  that s not a lot of grandads  passing down through recorded human history recollections like   .  .  .  we never had any of this modern cuneiform when i was a lad  .  .  .   and   .  .  .  bronze was good enough for me  .  human time is not very deep .  we ve just been good at packing a lot into it .   dna studies indicate that the two chimp species diverged about        grandfathers ago     three million years .  humans and chimps diverged        grandfathers earlier     so a chain of only         grandfathers unites you and your chimplike ancestor .  who was also  we hasten to point out  a modern chimpanzee s manlike ancestor .  humans and gorillas diverged         grandfathers ago  humans and orangutans diverged         grandfathers ago .  so among these animals  we are most closely related to a chimpanzee  and least closely related to the orangutan .  this conclusion is borne out by physical appearance and habits  too .  bonobos really like sex .   if those times seem rather short for all the necessary evolutionary changes  bear two things in mind .  first  that they were estimated by using a realistic rate for dna mutations  second  that according to nilsson and pelger an entire eye can evolve in a mere       grandfathers     and lots of different changes can  should  and did evolve in parallel .   the most striking feature of humans is the size of our brains  bigger  in comparison to body weight  than any other animal .  strikingly bigger .  a detailed story of what makes us human must be extraordinarily complicated  but it s clear that big  powerful brains were the main invention that made it all possible .  so we now have two obvious questions to think about   why did we evolve big brains .   and  how did we evolve big brains .    the standard theory addresses the  why  .  it maintains that we evolved out on the savannahs  surrounded by lots of big predators     lions  leopards  hyenas     and without much cover .  we had to become smart in order to survive .  rincewind would instantly see one flaw in this theory   if we were so smart  why did we stay on the savannahs  surrounded by lots of big predators .   but  as we ve said  it fits the fossil evidence .  the unorthodox theory addresses the  how  .  big brains need lots of brain cells  and brain cells need lots of chemicals known as  essential fatty acids  .  we have to get these from our food     we can t build them ourselves from anything simpler     and they re in short supply out on the savannahs .  however  as michael crawford and david marsh pointed out in       they are abundant in seafood .   nine years earlier elaine morgan had developed alister hardy s theory of the  aquatic ape   we evolved not on the savannahs  but on the seashore .  the theory fits a number of human peculiarities  we like water  newborn babies can swim   we have a funny pattern of hair on our bodies  and we walk upright .  go to any mediterranean resort and you see at once that an awful lot of naked apes think that the seashore is the place to hang out .   whether the aquatic ape story of human origins will displace the  savannah  theory remains to be seen  but the savannah story is in trouble from a very different direction .  phillip tobias was challenged not the fossil record  but its interpretation .  he asked a question so simple that it seems to have eluded most other workers in the field .  yes  many areas where fossils of apelike human ancestors have been found are savannahs now .  but were they savannahs then .  when our distant great great     grandparents got themselves fossilised    .   million years ago  could the vegetation have been different from what it is today .   given that the whole point is that the animals definitely were different     our ancestors  not us     it is a little surprising that this question seems no to have occurred to anyone earlier .  unfortunately  science is often like that .  people specialise .  experts on prehistoric apes may not be very interested in botany .   it turns out that sterkfontein  one the places where fossil apes supporting the savannah theory are found  wasn   t a savannah back then at all .  fossil pollen suggested it was a wooded area  and fossilised lianas clinched it .  other areas of south africa and ethiopia  where the famous  lucy  was found  show that these areas were forests when the apes lived there .  the  killer ape of the savannahs   says tobias  is nonsense .   and there may be some new evidence in favour of watery origins for humanity  though not necessarily the full blooded aquatic ape .  a common feature of fossil hominid sites is that they are all near water .  this makes sense  because homo sapiens needs to drink a lot  and sweats and urinates a lot .  if we had evolved on savannahs  we would have annoyed the hell out of all the other animals there with our incessant peeing .  and it looks like we were excellent swimmers at least a million years ago .  there is evidence of human migrations to islands such as flores  separated from bali by a deep underwater valley .  even allowing for the lower sea levels in the past  the new arrivals must have swum or rafted or otherwise made their way across at least    miles of open water .   we may not have been the aquatic ape  but we surely were the damp forest ape .  just as bonobos  one of our two closest living relatives  are today .     brains are fascinating .  they are the physical vehicle for minds  which are even more interesting .  minds are  or  at least  give their owners the vivid impression that they are  conscious  and they have  or  at least  give their owners the vivid impression that they have  free will .  minds operate in a world of  qualia      vivid sense impressions like red  hot  sexy .  qualia aren t abstractions  they are  feelings  .  we all know what it s like to experience them .  science has no idea what makes them the way they are .   brains  though  .  .  .  we can make progress on brains .  on one level  brains are a kind of computational device .  their most obvious physical components are nerve cells  arranged in complicated networks .  mathematicians have studied such networks  and they find that what networks do is to carry out interesting processes .  give them an input and they will produce an output .  allow their interconnections to evolve by selecting for specific associations of input and output     such as responding to an image of a banana but not to an image of a dead rat     and pretty soon you ve got a really effective banana detector .   what makes the human brain unique  as far as we can tell  is that it has become recursive .  as well as detecting a banana  it can think about detecting a banana .  it can think thoughts about its own thought processes .  it is a pattern recognition device that has turned its attention to its own patterns .  this ability is what lies behind human intelligence .  it probably underpins consciousness  too  one of the patterns that the pattern recognition device has learned to recognize is itself .  it has become  self aware  .   as a result  brains operate on at least two levels .  on a reductionist level they are networks of nerve cells sending each other incredibly complex but ultimately meaningless messages     like ants scurrying around inside an anthill .  on another level  they are an integrated self     the anthill as a personality in its own right .  douglas hofstadter s g  del  escher  bach includes a sequence where aunt hillary  who is an anthill     use the american pronunciation of  aunt   has a meeting with dr anteater .  when dr anteater arrives  the ants go into a panic     they change their actions .  to aunt hillary  who operates on the emergent level  this change represents the knowledge that dr anteater has arrived .  she is entirely happy to watch dr anteater consuming a meal of  her  ants .  ants are a virtually inexhaustible resource  she can always breed new ones to take the place of the ones that got eaten .   the link between the ants and hillary s  anthilligence  is emergent     felicitously  it .  operates across what we have termed  ant country  .  the same action means one thing for the ants  but something quite different  and transcendent  for hillary .  replace hillary by yourself     your self  the  you  that you feel is experiencing your thoughts     and ants by brain cells  and you re contemplating the connection between mind and brain .   now you ve gone self referential .     neural networks are what the brain is built from  but there s more to evolving a brain than just assembling big neural nets .  brains operate in terms of high level  modules      a module for running  another for recognizing danger  another for putting the whole animal on the alert  and so on .  each such module is an emergent feature of a complex neural network  and it wasn t designed  it evolved .  millions of years of evolution trained those modules to respond instantly and exquisitely .   the modules aren t separate .  they share nerve cells  they overlap  they re not necessarily a well defined region in the brain     any more than  vodafone  is a well defined region of the telephone network .  according to daniel dennett  they are like a collection of demons  operating by  pandemonium  .  they all shout  and at any given instant  whoever shouts loudest wins  quite a lot of the internet has borrowed this design  .   modern humanity has built a culture around those modules     an idea that we ll explore later     and in so doing has subverted them to new purposes .  the module for spotting lions has become  in part  a module for reading discworld books .  the module for sensing bodily movement has  in part  turned into one for doing certain kinds of mathematics  those parts of mechanics where a physical  feel  for the problem may well be precisely that .  our culture has rebuilt our minds  and our minds have in turn rebuilt our culture  over and over again  in each generation .   such a radical restructuring must have simpler precursors .  a key step towards the human mind was the invention of the nest .  before there were nests  baby organisms could carry out only very limited experiments in behaviour .  if every time you try out a new game you get gobbled up by a python  novelty will not carry a premium .  in the comfort and relative safety of the nest  however  the error part of trial and error is no longer automatically fatal .  nests let you play  and play lets you explore the phase space of possible behaviours and find new  sometimes useful  strategies .  further along the same path lies the family  the pack  and the tribe  with certain shared behaviours and mutual protection .  meerkats  a kind of mongoose  have an intricate tribal structure  and take turns doing the dangerous  because more exposed  job of lookout .   humans have turned such tactics into a global strategy  adults devote huge amounts of time  energy  food  and money to the task of bringing up their children .  intelligence is both a consequence of this brilliantly successful strategy  and a cause .     the dean would be well advised to take this link between family life and intelligence into account .  he s trying to educate the apes by the direct route  r  .  .  .  o  .  .  .  c  .  .  .  k  .  .  .   but all they have on their tiny minds is s e x .  many school teachers will sympathize  .  .  .  but if only he realized that sexual bonding is a major factor in humanoid family life  and family life engenders intelligence   .  .   bonobos are the perfect model for the dean s sex mad apes .  they are promiscuous in the extreme  making use of sex where we would be content with a smile and a wave or a gentlemanly handshake .  female bonobos have serial sex with dozens of males  or with females  almost in passing  the males do likewise .  adults engage in sexual activities with children  too .  it all seems very casual .  it helps bond the tribe .  for them it seems to work fine .   ordinary chimps are promiscuous by the standards of orthodox human morality  though probably no more than many humans are .  pairs of males and females will disappear together for a few days  and then form new partnerships  .  .  .  humans generally mate for life  a term meaning  until we get fed up   and one reason is the enormous amount of effort that a human couple must put into raising the kids .  sex helps to cement the parental relationship  encouraging each parent to trust the other .  this  . may be why  even in an allegedly sexually relaxed age  most people see extramarital flings as a form of betrayal     and why  despite that  the erring partner is more often than not allowed back into the family fold .   it s not surprising that we have sex on the brain  our brains have been moulded by sex .  the dean should let sex take its course  for intelligence will surely follow  .  .  .  you just have to think on the scale of deep time .  there s no rush .       to find out how  see the science of discworld ii  the globe       forty three   ook  a space odyssey    rincewind sat in a corner of the high energy magic building .  it was deserted at the moment .  news had got around that the project was really being ended this time  and wizards had drifted away to lunch .   the round world spun in its protective globe and also  by means of a physics only a wizard might understand  in a space that was infinite only on the inside .    poor old bloody place   he said  to the world in general .   never really stood a chance  did you .     ook .    it was a small grunt  from the other side of the huge room .  rincewind wandered over  and found the librarian peering into the omniscope .    oh  they ve got sticks now   said rincewind  looking down at a ragged party of apes .   and a lot of good it ll do them  too .     ook .     the lizards had sharp shells on the end of theirs  and are they around today .  i don t think so .  and the crabs were doing well .  even the blobs were trying to make a go of things .  there were some bear sort of things that looked promising .  doesn t matter .  one winter the snow doesn t melt  next thing there s a two mile wall of ice laminating you to the bedrock .  or there s a funny light in the sky and then you re trying to breathe burning water .   he shook his head wearily .   nice place  though .  nice colours .  particularly good horizons  once you get used to them .  lots of dullness  punctuated by short periods of death .     ook .   said the librarian .    well  maybe they do look a bit like you   said rincewind .   most of the lizards looked a bit like the bursar .  maybe it s just coincidence .  everything has to look like something  after all .  as above  so below .    in the omniscope  some distance behind the ape clan  something lean and powerful was tracking them in the long grass .    eeek .    the librarian thumped on the desk .    sorry .  it s not up to me .   live and let live   you know that s always been my motto .  well   let me live   really  but that s almost the same thing .    hands waving wildly over his head  which only happened when he was really in a hurry  the librarian ran out of the room .   rincewind caught him up as he entered the main building  and then trotted along after him as the ape wound his way through the university s less salubrious regions  the realm of broom cupboards  old storerooms and the studies of the very much lesser members of staff .  even using all the shortcuts  it still took quite a while to reach the office of the egregious professor of cruel and unusual geography  with the name  rincewind  written on it in chalk .   the orangutan flung the door back and knuckled purposefully towards the big stack of boxes .    er  .  .  .  that s the rock collection   said rincewind .   er  .  .  .  i was filing them  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  they belong to the university  i really don t think you should be throwing them out like that .  .  .       ook .    the librarian straightened up  bearing aloft a couple of large rocks that rincewind recognized as noduley  sharp  brittle  unfriendly rocks .    er  .  .  .  why are you  .  .  .   rincewind began .   the librarian walked across to the luggage and gave it a kick .  the lid opened obediently  and the rocks were thrown inside .  the ape went back for more flints .    er  .  .  .   said rincewind  but left it at that .  this did not seem to be a time to raise objections .   he had to run after the librarian and the luggage all the way back to the high energy magic building .  by the time he got there  the ape was pounding heavily on one of hex s keyboards .   rincewind tried again .    er  .  .  .  should you be  .  .  .    he was interrupted by the rattle of the machine s writing device .   it spelled out      new suit parameters accepted      on the far side of the room  where the skeletal virtually there suits flicked on the verge of non existence  one changed shape .  the shoulders widened .  the arms grew longer .  the legs shortened         adjustment complete .  on you it looks good      rincewind backed away as the librarian  cradling a large flint nodule in each arm  stepped in the magic circle and began to shimmer as the suit enclosed him .  the new parameters definitely made it look more solid       you re not going to interfere  are you .   said rincewind .    ook .     no  no  that s fine  fine  no problem at all   said rincewind .  it is never wise to argue with an ape holding a rock .   it s about time someone did .    the librarian flickered  and became a ghost in the air .   rincewind stood alone in the empty room  whistling nervously .  in its alcove  hex began to sparkle  as it always did when it was trying to allow a wizard to interact with the project .    blast .   said rincewind at last  striding over to the suits .   he s bound to muck it up  .  .  .      lightning fried the evening sky  turning it purple and pink .   above the little hollow in the cliff  where the tribe clustered and flinched  a sleek black shadow moved like an extension of the night .  it wasn t hurrying .  dinner wasn t going anywhere .  when the lightning faded its eyes gleamed for a while .   something grabbed its tail .  it spun around  snarling  and a fist extended on the end of a very long arm hit it right between the eyes  lifting it off the ledge .   it landed heavily on the ground  jerked for a moment  and lay still .   the ape horde scattered around the rocks  screaming  and then stopped to look back .   the big cat didn t move .   another bolt of lighting hit the ground nearby  and a dead tree exploded into flame .  against the violet corona of the storm  red in the light of the burning tree  a huge figure stood holding a large stone in the crook of each arm .   as rincewind said  it was a vision you were unlikely to forget .     rincewind couldn t eat here .  well  not in the usual  definitive way .  he thought he could probably manipulate lumps of food into his mouth  but since the food would technically remain in a different universe to his  he was afraid it might drop straight through him  to general embarrassment and the puzzlement of spectators .   besides  he didn t feel like flame grilled leopard .   the librarian had been working furiously .  he d turned the area into a boot camp for people who were barely upright and wouldn t know what to do with a boot anyway .  the apemen had taken to fire quite quickly  after a few misdirected attempts to eat it or have sex with it  and several of them had progressed to setting fire to themselves .   they d learned cookery  too  initially on one another .   rincewind sighed .  he d seen species come  and he d seen them go  and this one could only have been put on the world for entertainment value .  they had the same approach to life as clowns  with the same touch of cheerful viciousness .   the librarian had progressed to lessons in flint knapping  using the flints brought in via the luggage .  they d certainly picked up the idea of hitting rocks against other rocks  or anything else in range .  sharp edges intrigued them .   finally rincewind wandered over to the librarian and tapped him on the shoulder .    we ve been here all day   he said .   we d better get back .    the orangutan nodded  and stood up .   ook .     you think it ll work .     ook .    rincewind looked back at the apemen .  one of them was industriously hacking at the corpse of the cat again .    really .  but they re just like  .  .  .  hairy parrots .     eek ook .     well  .  .  .  yes .  that s true .   rincewind took a final look at the horde .  two of them were squabbling over the meat .  monkey see  monkey do  .  .  .    i m glad it was you who said that   he said .     less than a discworld second had passed by the time they returned .  by the time they looked in the omniscope  several fires were already visible on the night side of the world .   the librarian looked pleased .   oook   he said .   progress means smoke .  but rincewind was not entirely convinced .  most of the fires were forests .       forty four   extel outside    progress means smoke  .  .  .  the human race has certainly made a lot of progress over the years  then .  how did we do that .  because we re intelligent  we ve got brains .  minds  even .  but other creatures are intelligent     dolphins  especially .  and all they seem to do is enjoy themselves in the sea .  what have we got that they haven t .   many discussions of the mind treat it essentially as a question about the architecture of the brain .  the viewpoint is that this determines what brains can do  and then the various things that we associate with minds     the difficult problems of free will  consciousness and intelligence     come out of neurophysiology .  that s one approach .  the other common one is to view the problem through the eyes of a social scientist or an anthropologist .  from this viewpoint the mind s capabilities are pretty much taken as  given   and the main questions are how human culture builds on those capabilities to create minds able to think original thoughts  feel emotions  have concepts like love and beauty  and so on .  it may seem that between them these two approaches pretty much cover the territory .  link them  and you have a complete answer to the question of mind .   however  neurophysiology and culture aren t independent  they are  complicit  .  by this we mean that they have evolved together  each changing the other repeatedly  and their mutual coevolution built on the unpredictable results of that ongoing interaction .  the view of culture building on  and changing  brains is incomplete  because brains also build on  and change  culture .  the concept of complicity captures this recursive  mutual influence .   we call the brain s internal capabilities  intelligence  .  it is convenient to give a similar name to all of the external influences  cultural or otherwise  that affect the evolution of the brain  and with it  the mind .  we shall call these influences extelligence  a term that hex has picked up thanks to once and future computing .  mind is not just intelligence plus extelligence     its inside and outside  so to speak .  instead  mind is a feedback loop in which intelligence influences extelligence  extelligence influences intelligence  and the combination transcends the capabilities of both .     intelligence is the ability of the brain to process information .  but intelligence is only part of what is needed to make a mind .  and even intelligence is unlikely to evolve in isolation .   culture is basically a collection of interacting minds .  without individual minds you can t have a culture .  the converse is perhaps less obvious  but equally true  without a shared culture  the human mind cannot evolve .  the reason is that there is nothing in the environment of the evolving mind that can drive it towards self complication     becoming more sophisticated     unless that brain has something else fairly sophisticated to interact with .  and the main sophisticated thing around to interact with is minds of other people .  so the evolution of intelligence and that of extelligence are inextricably linked  and complicity between them is inevitable .   in the world around us are things that we  or other human beings  have created     things which play a similar role to intelligence but sit outside us .  they are things like libraries  books  and the internet     which from the viewpoint of exteiligence would be better named the  extranet  .  the discworld concept of  l space      library space  is similar  it s all one thing .  these influences  sources not just of information but of meaning  are  cultural capital  .  they are things that people put out into the culture  which can then sit there  or even reproduce  or interact in a way that individuals can t control .   the old artificial intelligence question   can we create an intelligent machine .   viewed the machine as a once off object in its own right .  the problem  people assumed  was to get the machine s architecture right  and then program intelligent behaviour into it .   but that s probably the wrong approach .  of course  it is certainly conceivable that the collective extelligence of all the human beings interacting with that machine could put a mind into it     and in particular endow it with intelligence .  but it seems much more likely that  unless you had a whole community of machines interacting with each other and evolving  providing the requisite extelligence too  then you wouldn t be actually able to structure the ant country of the neural connections of the machine in a way that could generate a mind .  so the story of the mind is one of complicity and emergence .  indeed  mind is one of the great examples of complicity .   the internal story of the development of the mind can be summed up as a series of steps in which the key  player  is the nerve cell a nerve cell is an extended object that can send signals from one place to another once you ve got nerve cells you can have networks of nerve cells  and once you ve got networks  then a whole pile of stuff comes along free of charge .  for example  there is an area of complexity theory called  emergent computation  .  it turns out that when you evolve a network     randomly chosen networks  arbitrary networks  not constructed with specific purposes     they do things .  they do something  which may or may not seem meaningful  they do whatever it is that that network does .  but you can often look at what that network does  and spot emergent features .  you discover that even though its architecture was random  it evolved the ability to compute things .  it carries out algorithmic processes  or something close to algorithmic processes  .  the ability to do calculations  computations  algorithms seems to come free of charge once you ve invented devices that send signals from one place to another and react to those signals to send new signals .  if you allow evolution you don t have to work hard to create the ability to do some kind of processing .   once you ve got that facility  it s a relatively short step to the ability to do specific kinds of processing that happen to be useful     that happen to offer survival value .  all you need is the standard darwinian selection procedure .  anything that s got that ability survives  anything that hasn t  doesn t .  the ability to process incoming information in ways that extract an interesting feature of the outside world  react to it  and thereby make it easier to evade a predator or to spot food  gets reinforced .  the brain s internal architecture comes from a phase space of possible structures  and evolution selects from that phase space .  put those two together and you can evolve structures in the brain that have specific functions .  the brain s surroundings certainly influence the development of the brain .     do animals have minds .  they do to some extent  depending on the animal .  even simple animals can have surprisingly sophisticated mental abilities .  one of the most surprising is a funny creature called a mantis shrimp .   it s like the shrimps you put inside a sandwich and eat  except that it s about   inches     cm  long and it s more complex .  you can keep a mantis shrimp in a tank  as part of a miniature marine ecology .  if you do  you ll find that mantis shrimps cause havoc .  they tend to destroy things     but they also build things .  one thing they love building is tunnels  which they then live in .  the mantis shrimp is a bit of an architect  and it decorates the front of its tunnel with bits and pieces of things     especially bits and pieces of what it has just killed .  hunting trophies .  it doesn t like to have just one tunnel     it s discovered that if you have one tunnel with one entrance  that s more correctly known as a  trap  .  so it likes to have a back entrance too     and more .  by the time it s been in the tank for about two months  it s riddled the entire tank with tunnels  and you find it sticking its head out at one end or the other without seeing it pass between .   years ago  jack used to have a mantis shrimp called dougal .   jack and his students discovered that they could set dougal puzzles .  they would feed it shrimps and it would come out and grab the shrimp .  then they would put the shrimp inside a plastic container with a lid and after a little while dougal would like to take the lid off the container and eat the shrimp .  and then they put an elastic band around the container to hold the lid on  and dougal would learn to take the band off and open the container and eat the shrimp .  and after a while if they stuck a shrimp in on its own  you could almost see the mantis shrimp coming out and looking disappointed   they haven t set me a puzzle  this is no fun  i don t want to play this game .   and it would take a long look at the shrimp and then go back into its tunnel without grabbing it .   although we can think of no way to prove this  everyone got the strong impression that the shrimp was developing a little bit of a mind .  its brain had the potential to do so  and humans had provided it with the kind of context that would help it develop that potential .  wild mantis shrimps don t go out and play with elastic bands  because those aren t part of their environment  but if you give them that kind of stimulus  you change them .  because we ve got minds  we also have the capacity to create a little bit of mind in a lot of other creatures .     mind is a process  or a network of processes  going on inside the brain .  it needs a certain amount of interaction with other minds in order to get anywhere .  there isn t an evolutionary feedback loop that would train an incipient mind and make it develop unless it was getting somewhere .  so where does such a loop occur .  human beings are part of a reproductive system     there are a lot of us  and we keep breeding new ones .  in consequence  a large part of the environment of any human being is other human beings .  in many ways this is the most important part of our environment  the part we respond to most deeply .  we have all sorts of cultural systems  such as education  that exploit exactly this feature of our environment to develop the kind of mind that fits into the existing culture and helps to propagate it .  so the context for an individual mind  as it evolves  is not that mind     it s lots of other minds .  there is a com plicit feedback loop between the entire collection of minds  and that of each individual .   human beings have taken this process to such an extreme that part of that feedback loop has escaped from our control and is now outside us .  in a sense  it has a mind of its own .  this is extelligence  and we can t do without it .  a lot of what makes us human is not passed on genetically     it is passed on culturally .  it is passed on by the tribe  it is passed on through rituals  by teaching  by things that link brain to brain  mind to mind .  your genetics may make it possible for you to do this  it may make you better or worse at it than others  but genes don t actually encode the information that gets passed on .  this process is the  make a human being kit  .  each culture has devised a technique for putting into the minds of the next generation what it is that will make them put it into the minds of the generation after that     a recursive system that keeps the culture going .  lies to children often feature prominently .   we are running into problems doing this today  because old style tribal cultures  even national cultures  are becoming intermingled with an international culture .  this leads to clashes between what used to be separate cultures  triggering their breakdown .  go into any city in the world and you see adverts for coca cola .  global commerce has put things into various cultures that are different from what they would have developed of their own accord .  coca cola does not have a huge influence on the make a human being kit  though  so it s acceptable to most cultures .  on the whole  you don t find religious fundamentalists complaining about the existence of a coca cola bottling factory in their country  well  you do  but generally because it s just a way of saying  usa out .    however  if some fast food chain in islamic or jewish countries was trying to sell porkburgers  there d be plenty of protests .   extelligence has become so powerful and so influential that nowadays one generation s culture may be radically different from the previous generation s culture .  second generation immigrants often have an even worse problem  a culture clash .  they ve grown up in the  new  country  and they ve absorbed how that country works .  they speak the language far more fluently than their parents ever can  but they ve still got to please their parents .  when they re at home  they have to behave in the manner of their original culture .  but when they re at school  they have to live in the new culture .  this makes them feel distinctly uncomfortable  and that can break the cultural feedback loop .  once the loop is broken  parts of the culture cease to be transmitted to the next generation  they drop out of the make a human being kit .   in this sense  extelligence is out of our control .  it escaped our control when it became reproductive  extelligence being used to copy  bits of  extelligence .   the key step was the invention of printing .  prior to written language  extelligence was passed on by word of mouth .  it still lived in people s minds  it was what the wise men and women of the village  the old people  knew .  and all the while extelligence resided in human memories  it couldn t grow  because one person can remember only so much .  when you could write things down  extelligence expanded a bit  but there is only so much that you can write down by hand .  and it can t spread very far .  so mostly you get things like the egyptian monuments     the history of some particular ruler  his greatest battles  excerpts from the book of the dead  .  .  .   another important but apparently mundane function of writing in human society is taxes  accounts  keeping track of property .  these sound dull compared with the list of battles  but a growing society needs something better than an old man s memory of  who owns what  and  who paid how much  .  the list was a great invention .   with printing came the possibility of disseminating information far more widely  and in quantity .  within a few years of printing becoming established in europe there were fifty million books in existence  which means more books than people .  printing was a very slow procedure in those days  but nonetheless there were lots of printing presses  and you could sell whatever you printed  so there were plenty of pressures that encouraged printing to flourish .  and then complicity really set in  because what s on a piece of paper can come back and bite you in the ankle .  the rulers started putting constitutional rights and obligations down on paper  to protect their own position  once it s down on paper that the king has certain rights and obligations  then the paper can always be referred to later  and used as an argument .   but what the kings didn t realize  to start with  is that when they put their rights and obligations down on paper  they were implicitly constraining their own actions .  the citizens could read what was on the paper too .  they could tell if their king was suddenly assuming rights or obligations that were not on the piece of paper .  the whole effect of law on human society started to change when you could write the law down  and anyone who could read could see what the kw was .  this didn t mean that the kings always obeyed the kw  of course  but it meant that when they disobeyed it  everyone knew what they were doing .  that had a big effect on the structure of human society .  one minor aspect of it is that we always appear to be nervous of people who write things down  .  .  .   at that point  extelligence and intelligence began to interact complicitly .  once an interaction becomes complicit  there s no way for an individual to control it .  you can push things out into the extelligence  but you can t predict what influence they will have .  what s out there is growing in a way that may be mediated by human beings  but     for example     the people printing books were largely printing them independently of their contents .  early on  anything in print would sell .   all words had power .  but written words had a lot more .  they still do .     so far we ve talked as if extelligence is a single unified external thing .  in some sense it is  but what is actually important is the interface between extelligence and the individual .  this is a very personal feedback loop  we meet selections from extelligence through our parents  the books we read  the teachers who teach us  and so on .  this is how the make a human being kit works  this is why we have cultural diversity .  if we all responded to the same pool of extelligence in exactly the same way  we would all be the same .  the whole system would suddenly become a kind of monoculture rather than a multiculture .   human extelligence is currently going through a period of massive expansion .  much more is becoming possible .  your interface to extelligence used to be very predictable  your parents  teachers  relatives  friends  village  tribe .  that allowed clusters of particular kinds of subculture to flourish  to some extent independently of the other subcultures  because you never got to hear about the others .  their world view was always filtered before it got to you .  in whit  lain banks describes a strange scottish religious sect  and children who grow up in this sect .  even though some members of the sect are interacting with the outside world  the only important influences on them are what s going on within the sect .  even by the end of the story the character who has gone into the outside world and interacted with it in all sorts of ways has one idea in mind and one only     to become the leader of the sect and to continue propagating the sect s views .  this behaviour is typical of human clusters     until extelligence intervenes .   today s extelligence doesn t have a single world view  like a sect does .  it doesn t really have a world view at all .  extelligence is becoming  multiplex   a concept introduced by the science fiction writer samuel r .  delany in the novel empire star .  simplex minds have a single world view and know exactly what everyone ought to do .  complex minds recognize the existence of different world views .  multiplex ones wonder how useful a specific world view actually is in a world of conflicting paradigms  but find a way to operate despite that .   anyone who wants to can get on the internet and construct a webpage about ufos  telling everybody who accesses that page that ufos exist  they re out there in space  they come down to earth  they abduct people  they steal their babies  .  .  .  they do all these things and it s absolutely definite  because it s on the web .   a prominent astronomer was giving a talk about life on other planets and the possibility of aliens .  he made out the scientific case that somewhere out in the galaxy intelligent aliens might exist .  at that point a member of the audience put his hand up and said  we know they exist  it s all over the internet .    on the other hand  you can access another page on the internet and get a completely different view .  on the internet  the full diversity of views is  or at least can be represented .  it is quite democratic  the views of the stupid and credulous carry as much weight as the views of those who can read without moving their lips .  if you think that the holocaust didn t actually happen  and you can shout loud enough  and you can design a good web page  then you can be in there slugging it out with other people who believe that recorded history should have some kind of connection with reality .   we are having to cope with multiplexity .  we re grappling with the problem right now  it s why global politics has suddenly become a lot more complicated than it used to be .  answers are in short supply  but one thing seems clear  rigid cultural fundamentalism isn t going to get us anywhere .       there was a television programme called the magic roundabout .  one of the characters was a dog called dougal  which looked a bit like a hairbrush .  mantis shrimps have the same general form  though not with hair .       forty five   the bleat goes on    extelligence bloomed  faster than hex could create extra space in which to apprehend it .  it reached the seas and spread out across the continents  left the surface of the world  spun webs across the sky  reached the moon  .  .  .  and went further  as intelligence sought things to be intelligent about .   extelligence learned .  among many other things  it learned to fear .     the hem filled up again as the wizards returned  unsteadily  from lunch .    ah  rincewind   said the archchancellor .   we re looking for a volunteer to go into the squash court and shut down the reactor  and we ve found you .  well done .     is it dangerous .   said rincewind .    that depends on how you define dangerous   said ridcully .    er  .  .  .  liable to cause pain and an imminent cessation of respiration   suggested rincewind .   a high risk of agony  a possible deficit of arms and legs  a terminal shortness of breath         ridcully and ponder went into a huddle .  rincewind heard them whispering .  then the archchancellor turned  beaming .    we ve decided to come to a new definition   he said .   it is  not as dangerous as many other things  .  i beg you pardon  .  .  .   he leaned over as ponder whispered urgently in his ear .   correction   not as dangerous as some other things  .  there .  i think that s clear .     well  yes  you mean  .  .  .  not as dangerous as some of the most dangerous things in the universe .     yes  indeed .  and among them  rincewind  would be your refusal to go .   the archchancellor walked over to the omniscope .   oh  another ice age   he went on .   well  that is a surprise .    rincewind glanced at the librarian  who shrugged .  only a few tens of thousands of years could have passed down there .  the apes probably never knew what squashed them .   there was a lengthy rattle from hex s write out .  ponder walked over to read it .    er  .  .  .  archchancellor .  hex says he s found advanced intelligence on the planet .     intelligent life .  down there .  but the place is a snowball again .     er  .  .  .  not life  sir .  not exactly .     hang on  what s this .   said the dean .   there was  thin as a thread  a ring around the world .  spaced at regular distances were tiny dots  like beads  and from them more tiny lines descended towards the surface .   so did the wizards .     wind howled across the tundra .  the ice was only a few hundred miles away  even here at the equator .   the wizards faded into existence  and looked around them .    what the hell happened here .   said ridcully .   the landscape was a welter of scars and pits .  roads were visible where they had buckled up through the snow  and there were the ruins of what could only have been buildings .  but half the horizon was filled with what looked very much like an etiolated version of one of the giant shellfish proposed by the lecturer in recent runes .  it must have been several miles across at the base  and extended upwards beyond the limit of vision .    did any of you do this .   said ridcully accusingly .    oh  come on   said the dean .   we don t even know what it is .    beyond the tangle of broken roadways the snow blew across deep trenches gouged out of the ground .  desolation reigned .   ponder pointed towards the huge pyramid .    whatever we re looking for  it s in there   he said .     the first thing the wizards noticed was the mournful bleating noise .  it came and went in a regular way  on off  on off  and seemed to fill the entire structure .   the wizards wandered onwards  occasionally getting hex to move them to different places .  nothing  they agreed  made much sense .  the building was mostly full of roadways and loading docks  interspersed with massive pillars .  it creaked  too  like an old galleon .  they could hear the groaning noises  echoing far above .  occasionally  the ground trembled .   it was clear that important things happened in the centre .  there were tubes  hundreds of feet high .  the wizards recognized cranes  and failed to recognize huge engines of unknown purpose .  cables thick as a house rose into the darkness above .   frost sparkled off everything .   still the bleat went on .    look   said ponder .   red words flashed on and off  high in the air .     a l a a m    the dean spelled out .   i wonder why it s doing that .  they seem to have invented magic  whoever they are .  getting letters to flash like that is quite difficult to do .    ponder disappeared for a moment  and then came back .    hex feels that this is a dumb waiter   he said .   er  .  .  .  you know  .  .  .  for lifting things to another level .     going where .   said ridcully .    er  .  .  .  up  sir .  into that  .  .  .  necklace around the world .  hex has been speaking to the intelligence here .  it s a sort of hex  sir .  and it s nearly dead .     that s a shame   said ridcully he sniffed .   where s everyone gone  then .     er  .  .  .  they made huge  .  .  .  sort of .  .  .  big metal balls to live in .  i know it sounds stupid  sir .  but they ve gone .  because of the ice .  and there was a comet  too .  not very big .  but it scared everyone .  they built the  .  .  .  the beanstalk things  and then they  .  .  .  er  .  .  .  mined metal out of floating rocks  and  .  .  .  they left .     where ve they gone .     the  .  .  .  intelligence isn t sure .  it s forgotten .  it says it s forgotten a lot .     oh  i understand   said the dean  who d been trying to follow this   everyone s climbed up a great big beanstalk .     er  .  .  .  sort of  dean   said ponder  in his diplomatic voice .   in a manner of speaking .     certainly messed the place up before they went   said ridcully .   rincewind had been watching a rat scuttle away into the debris  but the words sunk in and exploded in his head .    messed up .   he growled .   how .     say again .   said ridcully .    did you see the weather report for this world .   said rincewind  waving his hands in the air .   two miles of ice  followed by a light shower of rocks  with outbreaks of choking fog for the next thousand years .  there will be widespread vulcanism as half a continent s worth of magma lets go  followed by a period of mountain building .  and that s normal .     yes  well          oh  yes  there are some nice quiet periods  everything settles down  and then     whammo .     there s no need to get so excited          i ve been here .   said rincewind .   this is how this place works .  and now  please  you tell me how  i mean how  can anything living on this world possibly mess it up .  i mean  compared to what happens anyway .   he paused  and gulped air .   i mean  don t get me wrong  if you pick the right time  yes  sure  it s a great world for a holiday  ten thousand years  even a few million if you re lucky with the weather but  good grief  it s just not a serious proposition for anything long term .  it s a great place to grow up on  but you wouldn t want to live here .  if any thing s got off  the best of luck to them .    he waved a finger at the rat  who was watching them suspiciously .  underneath them  the ground trembled again .    see him .   he said .   we know what s going to happen .  in a million years or so his kids are going to be saying  wow  what a great world the big rat made for us .  or it ll be the turn of the jellyfish  or something that s still bobbing around under the sea that we don t even know about yet .  there s no future here .  no  that s wrong  .  .  .  i mean there s always a future  but it belongs to someone else .  you know what chalk s made of here .  dead animals .  the actual rock is made of dead animals .  there were some  .  .  .    even in his overheated state  he paused .  it probably wasn t a good idea to remind people about the apes .  a vague  suspicious guilt was nudging him .    there were these creatures   he said   and they were using limestone caves .  limestone s made from ancient blobs  i saw it being made  like snow in the water  .  .  .  and these creatures are living in the bones of their ancestors .  really .  this place  .  .  .  this place is a kaleidoscope .  you smash it up  wait a moment  and there s another pretty pattern .  and another one .  and another o  .  .  .  he stopped .  and sagged .   could i have a glass of water  please .     that was a very  .  .  .  interesting speech   said ponder .    a point of view  certainly   said ridcully .   the other wizards had  however  lost interest .  they usually did  if the speeches were not given by them .    shall i tell you something else .   said rincewind  a little more calmly .   this world is an anvil .  everything here is between a rock and a hard place .  every single thing on it is the descendant of creatures that have survived everything the world could throw at them .  i just hope they never get angry  .  .  .    the senior wrangler and the dean had ambled towards a huge cylinder .  the word  maetnans  was painted in large black letters on the side .    hey  you chaps .   the dean shouted .   there s something talking in here  .  .  .    the inside of the cylinder reminded the wizards of a lighthouse .  there was a spiral staircase  shaped cupboards lined the walls .  lights glowed dimly  whole constellations of them .  certainly the builders of this thing had discovered magic .   the  a l a a m  word still blinked on and off in the air .    i wish that wretched thing would stop   said the senior wrangler .   the light vanished .  the sound stopped .    they ve probably invented demons   said the dean airily .   listen  .  .  .  hello .    a pleasant female voice said   elevator unstable .     oh  magic   said ridcully flatly .   well  we know how to deal with magic .  we want to go up in the magic box  voice .     do we .   said ponder   anything better than staying in this gloomy place   said ridcully .   it d be quite an interestin  experience  too .  we ll take one last look the world and then  well  .  .  .  frankly  that s it .     instability rising   said the voice .  it did not sound worried by the news .    what did it say .   said the dean .   sounded like name of a place     very good  very good   said ridcully  now let s be going shall we .    the pattern of lights moved .  then the voice said  as if it d been thinking it over   emerjansi override .    the door slid shut .  the cylinder jerked .  shortly afterwards  some pleasant music started  and didn t really get on anyone s nerves for several minutes .   the rat watched the thing rise up the cables in the centre of the pyramid .   the ground shook again .     slowly  the web around the world came apart .   ice walls had attacked some of the cable moorings on the ground  but instability was already there  working inexorably as it had done for the past few weeks  turning little movements into big movements .   slowly  one cable broke free from its pyramid  glowing red hot as it was jerked through the atmosphere  flailing across the sky .   around the curve of the world  the others danced and groaned .  .  .   when the end finally came  it took only a day .  the lines folded around the centre of the world  writhing incandescently across hundreds of miles of snow .  the necklace tore apart far above .  some bits drifted away .  others spun gently towards the surface  to impact hours later .   a ring of fire burned for a while around the equator .   and then the cold returned .   as the wizards said  it would all be the same in a hundred million years  time .  but it would be different tomorrow .     in the deserted high energy building  hex turned the omniscope outwards  homing in on signs of the strange new life .   it found comet cores  strung on cables thousands of miles long .  there were dozens of these trains  many millions of miles from the frozen world  accelerating into the abyss between the stars .   lights twinkled on their surfaces .  the extelligence inside appeared to be travelling hopefully .     a yellow cylinder tumbled gently across the darkness .   it was empty .       forty six   ways to leave your planet    rincewind s impassioned speech has a point .  if you think he s overstating his case  and that the earth is really an idyllic place to live  bear in mind that he s been on our planet a lot longer than we have  and he s seen a lot that we ve missed  because we experience the world on a much shorter timescale than the wizards have done .  we think the planet s a great place .  we grew up here .  we were made for it  and it s just right for us  .  .  .  at the moment .   tell that to the dinosaurs .   you can t  can you .  that s the point .   we re not suggesting that you sell up everything and start building a lifeboat .  but even the united states congress is beginning to wonder just how safe our planet really is  and politicians are not usually known for taking long term views .  the sight of shoemaker levy   smashing into jupiter raised a few political eyebrows .  tentative schemes are afoot to set up a defence system against incoming comets and asteroids .  spotting them early enough is the trick .  find them quickly  and a modest little rocket motor can save our planetary bacon .   it is in many ways amazing that life on earth has survived everything that the universe has so far thrown at it .  evolution runs on deep time     less than a hundred million years hardly counts .  life is extremely resilient  but individual species are not .  they last a few million years and then they become obsolete .  life persists by changing     by being a series of opening chapters .  but  being human  we d like to see our own story turn into at least a blockbuster dekalogy .   we can take small comfort in one thing .  although right now we don t worry enough about incoming disaster from up there  we do worry a lot about home grown disaster down here  nuclear warfare  biological warfare  global warming  pollution  overpopulation  destruction of habitat  burning of the rainforests  and so on .  however  there s no danger that human actions will wipe out the planet .  compared to what nature has already done  and will do again  our activities barely show up .  one large meteorite packs more explosive power than all human wars put together  a hypothetical world war iii included .  one ice age changes the climate more than a civilization s worth of carbon dioxide from car exhausts .  as for something like the deccan traps  .  .  .  you wouldn t want to know how nasty the atmosphere could become .   no  we can t destroy the earth .  we can destroy ourselves .   no one would care .  the cockroaches and the rats will come back  or if the worst comes to the worst the bacteria miles below ground will start to write a new opening chapter in the book of life .  someone else will read it .   if we really deserve the name homo sapiens  then we can do at least two things to improve our chances .  first  we can learn to manage our impact on the environment .  the fact that nature deals the occasional death blow doesn t hand us an excuse to imitate it .  we invented ethics .  our environment is sufficiently buffeted by various forces that the last thing it needs is humanity throwing extra spanners in the works .  at the most selfish level  we might be buying ourselves some time .   we could use that time to put some of our eggs in another basket .   one of the great dreams of humanity has been to visit other worlds .  it s starting to look as though this might be a very good idea     not just for fun and profit  but for survival .   we d better say right now that none of this is science fiction .  or  rather  yes  it is science fiction  it s the very stuff of science fiction  because some of the best science fiction writers  you don t see their stuff on tv  have been dealing with it for many decades .  but that does not mean it s not real .  ices ages happen .  big  big rocks come screaming out of the sky  and you need rather more than bruce willis flying the space shuttle as if it was the millennium falcon to stop them .   our urge to explore the universe may be just another case of monkey curiosity  but there seems to be a deep impulse that urges us to find new lands to map and new worlds to conquer .  maybe there s an inbuilt urge to spread out     one leopard can t eat all of you if you spread out .   it is an urge that has driven us into every corner and crevice of our own planet  from the ice floes of the arctic to the deserts of namibia  from the depths of the mariana trench to the peak of everest .  most of us incline to rincewind s view of a comfortable lifestyle and much prefer to stay at home  but a few are too restless to be happy anywhere for very long .  the combination is a powerful one  and it has shaped our species into something very unusual  with collective capabilities beyond the understanding of any individual .  we may not always use that combination wisely  but without it we would be greatly diminished .  and it s offering a real opportunity .   even a dream can work miracles .  when columbus  re  discovered america  and europe found out that it existed  he was looking for a new route to the indies .  he had convinced himself     on grounds that most scholars at the time found totally spurious     that the earth was considerably smaller than was generally thought .  he calculated that a relatively short voyage westward  from africa  would lead to japan and india .  the scholars were right  columbus was wrong     but it is columbus that we remember  because he made the world smaller .  he had the courage to set sail into an empty sea  sustained only by the belief that there was something important on the other side .   at least we can see where we ought to go .  columbus had to back a hunch .     a dirty great saturn v rocket with a tiny apollo capsule on top was the first practical method for getting out of the earth s gravity well altogether .  by this we don t mean that the earth s gravitational pull becomes zero if you go far enough away  which is a common misconception  we mean that if you go fast enough  then the earth s gravity can never pull you back down .  celestial mechanics operates in the phase space of distance and velocity  its  landscape  involves speeds as well as lengths .  only when we understood enough about gravity and dynamics to appreciate this point did we stand any chance of making technology like apollo work .   you can see this clearly from earlier suggestions     which were imaginative  in an earthbound sort of way     but fantastic and impractical  at least on roundworld .  in      bishop john wilkins listed four possible ways to leave the ground  enlist the aid of spirits or angels  get a lift from birds  fasten wings to your body  or build a flying chariot .  if we wanted to be charitable  we could interpret the last two as aircraft and rockets  but wilkins was clearly unaware that the earth s atmosphere doesn t extend all the way to the moon .  a sixteenth century engraving by hans schauffelein depicts alexander the great carried into space by two griffins     no noticeable improvement .  bernard zamagna conceived of an aerial boat  and others suggested the use of balloons .   every age fantasized about technology that already existed .  in jules verne s from the earth to the moon of      the journey was accomplished by firing a space capsule from a huge gun in florida  its      sequel around the moon involved a series of such capsules  forming a space train .  verne got florida right     he knew that the earth s spin produces centrifugal force  which helps the capsule to leave the planet more easily  and he knew that this force was greatest at the equator .  since the protagonists in his book were american  florida was the best bet .  when nasa started launching rockets  it came to the same conclusion  and the space facility at cape canaveral was born .   big guns have deficiencies  such as a tendency to laminate passengers to the floor because of rapid acceleration  but modern technology does make it possible to avoid this by applying the acceleration gradually .  rockets are more practical from the engineering point of view .  in      robert goddard invented the liquid fuel rocket .  the first one rose to the dizzy height of    feet     .   m  .  rockets have come a long way since then  taking men to the moon and instruments to the edge of the solar system .  and they are much better rockets .  even so  there s something  .  .  .  inelegant about heading off the planet on a giant disposable firework .   until recently  there has been a general assumption that the energy to get into space has to be carried with the craft .  however  we already have the beginnings of one way to get off the earth that keeps the power source firmly on the ground .  this is laser propulsion  in which a powerful beam of coherent light is aimed at a solid object and literally pushes it along .  it takes a lot of power  but prototypes invented by leik myrabo have already been tested at the high energy laser system test facility at white sands .  in november      a small projectile reached a height of    feet    m  in   .   seconds  by december this had been improved to    feet     m  in   .   seconds .  this may not sound impressive  but compare with goddard s first rocket .  the method involves spinning the projectile at      revolutions per minute to achieve gyroscopic stability .  then    laser pulses per second are directed towards a specially shaped cavity  heating the air beneath the craft and creating a pressure wave of thousands of atmospheres with temperatures up to          kelvin     and that s what propels the projectile .  at higher altitudes the air becomes very thin  and a similar craft would need an onboard fuel source .  fuel would be pumped into the cavity to be vapourized by the laser a megawatt laser could lift a   pound    kg  craft into orbit .   it is also a very powerful weapon      another possibility is power beaming .  it is possible to  beam  electromagnetic power from the ground in the form of microwaves .  this isn t just fantasy  in      dick dickinson and william brown beamed    kilowatts of power     enough for thirty electric fires     over a distance of one mile .  james benford and myrabo have suggested launching a spacecraft using millimetre range microwaves which are not attenuated by the atmosphere .  this is a variation on the laser method and would use the same kind of projectile .   both of these methods rely on a lot of raw power  betraying traces of the basic engineering assumption that getting into space needs a lot of energy to overcome the earth s gravity .  they do have the advantage that the raw power is just sitting on the planet  the       megawatt power station your laser launcher would require could generate for the national grid when a launch wasn t going on .   a method of greater subtlety is the bolas  first proposed in the     s .  traditionally  a bolas is a hunting device made by tying three weights to strings and then tying the ends of the strings together .  when thrown  it spins  pulling the weights apart  until the strings hit the target  at which point the weights spiral rapidly inwards and deal a killing blow .  the same sort of device could be set up in a vertical plane above the equator  a bit like a giant ferris wheel with only three spokes .  on the ends of the spokes would be pressurized cabins .  the lowest part of the bolas s swing would be somewhere in the lower atmosphere  the top part way out in space .  you would fly up in an aircraft  transfer to the first passing cabin  and be whisked skywards .  the biggest obstacle to making such a machine is the cable  which has to be stronger than any known material     but carbon fibre is well on the way to combining enough strength with enough lightness .  friction with the atmosphere would gradually slow the bolas s rotation down  but that could be compensated for using solar power arrays up in space .   the most celebrated device of this type  however  is the space elevator .  we discussed this in the opening chapter  both as a serious technological idea and as a metaphor  here we give a few more details .  in essence  the space elevator starts out as a satellite in geosynchronous orbit .  then you drop a cable from it to the ground  and the rest is a matter of building a suitable cabin and  again  finding suitable material for the cable .  you get the material up there using rockets or a whole cascade of bolases  and once you ve got a small cable you can haul up the stuff for the bigger one  .  you only need to do all this once  so the cost is irrelevant over the longer term .   as we emphasized at the start of the book  once there is as much traffic is coming down as is going up  getting off the ground is essentially free and requires zero energy .  at that point you build your interplanetary spacecraft up in space  using raw materials from the moon or the asteroid belt .  so the space elevator gives you a new place to start from     which is why we ve used it as a metaphor for processes like life .   the idea of a space elevator was originated by the leningrad engineer y . n .  artsutanov in       in an article in pravda .  he called it a  heavenly funicular  and calculated that it could lift        tons per day into orbit .  the idea came to the attention of western scientists in       thanks to john isaacs  hugh bradner  and george backus .  these scientists weren t interested in getting into space  they were oceanographers     the only people seriously interested in hanging things on long cables .  except that they wanted to hang them down into the ocean bottoms  not up into space .  the oceanographers were unaware of the earlier russian work  but artsutanov s anticipation quickly became known to western scientists too .  the astronaut and artist alexei leonov published a painting of a space elevator in action in      .   such a simple but mostly impractical idea is likely to occur to lots of people  but wouldn t become widely known because it s not practical with current or near future technology  and that means that it will be re invented independently by many people .  in      the science fiction author arthur c .  clarke considered suspending a lower satellite by cable from a geosynchronous one  as a way to increase the number of effectively geosynchronous satellites for communication purposes .  later he realized that the same method would lead to the space elevator  an idea that he developed in his novel the fountains of paradise .  in      a . r .  collar and j . w .  flower also considered suspending a lower satellite by cable from a geosynchronous one and in      jerome pearson suggested an  orbital tower  that was essentially the same idea .   you can  of course  suspend more than one cable  once you ve got one space elevator you can lift everything else that you need into space at low cost  so why not go the whole hog .  charles sheffield s the web between the worlds envisages a whole ring of space elevators round the equator .  this is what the wizards have found .  ironically  because human civilization has taken such a short time to develop  on evolutionary timescales  the wizards missed us  .  .  .   is the space elevator anything other than a wild fantasy .  could one really be built in the near future .  in      two nasa teams carried out feasibility studies  and both concluded that the space elevator is technologically possible .  just .  david smitherman  who led one team  reckons in could be in place by      .   the main problem is the cable .  the tension in the cable is lowest near the ground  and highest at the top  because each section of cable has to support only the weight of cable below it .  so the cable should be made thin at the bottom  and thicker towards the top .  the big question is  which material has enough tensile strength .  steel won   t do  a steel cable   inches     cm  wide at the bottom would have to be   .   trillion miles    trillion km  across at the top .   this is an engineer   s way of saying  don   t use steel   it   s too heavy and the stress goes up extremely fast as the cable gets longer .   kevlar would be more practical  the top would then need to be only      metres across     just over a mile wide .  but even this is not practical enough .   for the size to be acceptable  the cable   s tensile strength needs to be at least    .   gigapascals        times stronger than steel and    times stronger than kevlar .  such materials do exist  the best known is the carbon nanotube  a molecule of carbon shaped like a hollow cylinder and related to the famous molecule buckminsterfullerene  which is made from    atoms of carbon and is shaped like a soccer ball .  the tensile strength of a carbon nanotube is at least     gigapascals  more than twice as strong as necessary .  the only snag is  that right now the longest carbon nanotubes we can make extend for only a few millionth of a metre .  but if that could be increased to   millimetres  then the nanotubes could be embedded in a composite material with the necessary strength .   a second problem is the base .  the higher the bottom of the cable is off the ground  the more material is saved at the top  where most of the mass is .  this is why the cable in our story has a huge  etiolated whelk  at its base .  the nasa study concluded that a tower at least   miles     km  high would be best .  it could be built on a mountaintop  to reduce the height needed  but if the cable were to snap  the main debris would then fall on land .  so a tower in the ocean at the equator would make more sense .  current construction methods could  in principle  build a    mile     km  tower .   the final design problem is how to transport capsules up and down the cable .  whatever method is used  it has to be low on maintenance and high on speed .  magnetic levitation looks good .   after that  it   s mostly a question of protecting the cable against meteor strikes and incoming high energy particles .  a piece of cake .     having built your space elevator  you re now in a position to colonize other worlds .  the obvious first destination is mars .  you get there in a cloud of small  mass produced ships  and once you ve got there one of the first things you do is drop down a cable and build a martian space elevator .  you re up in orbit anyway  so why not take advantage of the fact .  again  this is the metaphorical aspect of the space elevator  as soon as just one exists  it opens up a vast range of new possibilities .  however  you ll probably need to land a team by some other method in order to construct the complex at the bottom to which the cable will be tethered .   mars isn t a great place to live  so the next step is to terraform it     to make it more earthlike .  there are reasonably plausible methods for doing that  detailed at length in kim stanley robinson s series red mars  green mars  blue mars .  mars is no improvement when it comes to meteor strikes  but at least the colony on mars is unlikely to get wiped out at the same time as the main population on earth .  because life is reproductive  if one of them does get wiped out  it can quickly be re colonized from the other .  after a few centuries  you d hardly notice any difference .  still  it may be better to be more ambitious and go to the stars .  by the time we re ready for that  we ll have interferometer telescopes good enough to spot which stars have suitable planets .  the only problem  then  will be to get there .   there are plenty of suggestions  and we won t add to them .  think of mid victorians predicting life in the     s .  the dynamic of extelligence is emergent or  to put it another way  we haven t the faintest idea what we ll think of next but it ll probably surprise us .   one way  if all else fails  is the generation ship     a huge vessel that can hold an entire city of people  who live  breed  educate  and die throughout the centuries long journey .  make it big and interesting enough  and they may even lose interest in the destination .  the discworld almost counts as one of these  it s on a journey  the inhabitants don t know where they re going  the designers have given it a small controllable sun  thus doing away with all those nasty fluctuations  and no less than five bio engineered creatures positively delight in clearing local space of intrusive debris  .  .  .   back on our world  you could take a really long term view and seed the galaxy with genetically engineered bacteria  carefully tailored so that whenever they find a suitable planet they eventually evolve into humanoid life  or life  at least  .  we would die out  but maybe our fleet of cheap  slow ships might seed a few new earths somewhere .   there s no shortage of ideas .  some might even be practical .  the galaxy beckons .  we might die trying     but since we re going to die anyway  why not try .   and what will we find out there .  will we find a radically different kind of  space elevator   for instance .  well  if there are aliens that live on neutron stars  as robert l .  forward describes in dragon s egg  then they might escape by tilting their world s magnetic axis  turning it into a pulsar  and surfing its plasma jet .  perhaps all those pulsars were formed in this way .  like any  space elevator   if you can manage the trick once  the rest is easy .  the inhabitants of one neutron star managed it  and colonized all the others  founding the pulsar empire  .  .  .   and since we can envisage new kinds of physical space elevator  there must surely also be new kinds of metaphorical space elevator .  not just aliens a bit like us  but radically different new kinds of life .   what else could live on a neutron star .   they re waiting .       forty seven   you need chelonium     that   said the dean   was a very unpleasant business .  good thing we weren t really there .    rincewind was sitting at the end of the long table  his chin on his hand .    really .   he said .   you thought that was bad .  try having a comet land on you .  that really makes your day .     it was the music that really got on my nerves   said the senior wrangler .    oh  well  good job the planet s a snowball  then   said rincewind .    i call this meeting to order   said ridcully  thumping the table .   where s the bursar .    the wizards looked around the main hall of the high energy magic building .    i saw him half an hour ago   the dean volunteered .    we are quorate  nevertheless   said ridcully .   now  .  .  .  the magic flux is almost run down  although hex reports that the model universe appears to be continuing on internal power .  amazing the way the whole place seems to strive to keep existing .  however  .  .  .  gentlemen  the project is at an end .  all it is has taught us is that you can t make a world out of bits and pieces .  you need chelonium for a proper world .  and you certainly need narrativium  otherwise the life you get is a lot of opening chapters .  a comet is no way to end a story .  ice and fire  .  .  .  that s very primitive .     poor old crabs   said the senior wrangler .    goodbye  lizards   said the dean .    farewell  my limpet   said the lecturer in recent runes .    what were the ones that left .   said ponder .    er  .  .  .   said rincewind .    yes .   said the archchancellor .    oh  nothing .  i had a thought .  .  .  but it couldn t possibly work .     some of the bears seemed quite bright   said ridcully  who had naturally sided with a lifeform that resembled him in several particulars .    yes  yes  it was probably the bears   said rincewind quickly .    we couldn t watch the whole world all the time   said ponder .   something could have evolved quickly  i suppose .     yes  that s right  something probably evolved quickly   said rincewind .   i shouldn t think there was any unauthorized interference in any way .     good luck to them  whatever shape they re in   said ridcully .  he assembled his papers .   that s it  then .  i won t say it hasn t been an interesting few days  but reality calls .  yes  rincewind .     what are we going to do with the snow globe     i mean  the world .   said rincewind .   as one wizard  they looked across at the world spinning gently in its dome .    is it any use to us  mister stibbons .   said ridcully .    as a curiosity  sir .     this university is stuffed with curiosities  young man .     well  then  .  .  .  only as very large paperweight .     ah .  rincewind  .  .  .  you are the professor of cruel and usual geography  so i suppose this is right up your street         there was a rattle from hex s tray .  ponder pulled out the paper .   it said      the project must be kept safe       fine .  rincewind can put it on a high shelf so that it doesn t get knocked   said ridcully  rubbing his hands together .       recursion is occurring      ridcully blinked at the writing .    is that a problem .    hex creaked .  there was a flurry of activity in the ant tubes .  eventually the write out clattered for some time .   ponder picked up the message .    er  .  .  .  it s addressed to mrs whitlow   he said .   er  .  .  .  it s rather odd .  .  .    ridcully looked over his shoulder .     don t dust it    he read .    she s a devil with a duster   said the senior wrangler .   the dean nails his door shut when he leaves his study .    the write out clattered again .     this is important    ponder read .    not a problem  not a problem   said ridcully .   so on to the next item .  ah  yes .  we have to shut down the reacting engine .  no  don t get up  rincewind  i ve had the door locked .  the interior of the squash court is still just a tiny bit not entirely completely safe  is that right  mr stibbons .     very definitely .     and therefore the area within it quite clearly counts as          let me guess   said rincewind .   it s cruel and unusual geography  yes .     well  done  that man .  and all you have to do         a sound that had been on the limit of hearing suddenly descended through the scales .  and there was silence .    what s that .   said ridcully .    nothing   said rincewind  with unusual accuracy .    the reacting engine has shut down   said ponder .    by itself .     not unless it can pull its own levers  no  .  .  .      the wizards clustered around the door to the old squash court .  ponder held up his thaumometer .    there s hardly any flux now   he said .   it s practically background  .  .  .  stand back  .  .  .    he opened the door .   a couple of white pigeons flew out  followed by a billiard ball .  ponder pulled aside a cluster of flags of all nations .    just natural fallout   he called out .   oh  .  .  .    the bursar ambled around the side of the reacting engine  waving a squash racket .    ah  ponder   he said .   have you wondered if time isn t simply space rotated through a right angle .     er  .  .  .  no  .  .  .   said ponder  watching the man carefully for signs of thaumic breakdown .    it would certainly make pretzels very interesting  don t you think .     er  .  .  .  have you been playing squash  sir .   said ponder   you know  i m really coming to believe that a closed contour is a boundary  up to parametrization  if and only if it is homotopic to zero   said the bursar .   and  for preference  coloured green .     did you touch any switches  sir .   said ponder  maintaining a careful distance .    this thingy here does make some shots very difficult   said the bursar  hitting the reacting engine .   i was trying to hit the rear wall around last wednesday .     i think perhaps we should leave   said ponder in a clear  firm tone .   it will soon be teatime .  there will be jelly   he added .    ah  the fifth form of matter   said the bursar brightly  following ponder .   the other wizards were waiting just outside the door .    is he all right .   said ridcully .   i mean by general bursarial standards  of course .     it s hard to tell   said ponder  as the bursar beamed at them .   i think so .  but the reacting engine must had been putting out quite a high flux when he went in .     perhaps none of the thaumic particles hit him .   said the senior wrangler .    but there s millions of them  sir  and they can pass through anything .    ridcully slapped the bursar on the back .    bit of luck for you  eh  bursar .    the bursar looked puzzled for a moment  and then vanished .       forty eight   eden and camelot    this book wasn t called the religion of discworld for a reason  although     heaven knows     there is plenty of raw material .   all religions are true  for a given value of  truth  .   the disciplines of science  however  tell us that we live on a world formed from interstellar debris some four billion years ago in a universe which itself is about    billion years old  which is science speak for  a very long time    that in the ensuing years it has been pummelled and frozen and re arranged on a regular basis  that despite or rather because of this  life turned up very quickly and seems to spring back renewed and re formed from every blow  and that we ourselves evolved on this planet and  with the suddenness of a bursting dam  became top species in a very short period of time .   actually  science tells us that many cockroaches  bacteria  beetles  and even small mammals might argue that last statement  but since they are not good at debate and can t speak  who cares what they think .  especially since they can t  eh .  a key thing about big brains is this  they know big brains are good .   most of us don t think like scientists .  we think like the wizards of discworld .  everything in the past was leading inevitably to now  which is the important time .   while the news that the earth is a small planet in a dull part of the universe has caught on in recent centuries  it s only in the last few decades that the words  the earth  have come to mean  for a significant proportion of any society   the planet  rather than  the soil  .   it was probably those photographs of the earth seen from the moon that did it .  we saw the whole planet as a single thing  rather than just the bit of it that we were standing on .  and it looked fragile  and kind of lonely      we watch the fireworks as great balls of ice plummet into the atmosphere of a nearby planet and  although any one of them would have seriously troubled the earth  the event was just that  a firework display .  as one old lady told a news reporter   that sort of thing happens in outer space  .  but we re in outer space  too  and it might pay us to get good at it .   the dinosaurs were not  as suggested in jurassic park   selected for extinction      they were clobbered by a very large rock  and or its after effects .  rocks don t think .   the dinosaurs were in fact doing very well  and had merely neglected to develop three mile thick armour plating .  they may even have evolved something that we d recognize as  early civilization   we shouldn t underestimate how much the surface of the planet can change in    million years .  but rocks don t care  either .   but even if the rock had missed  there were other rocks .  and if they had missed too  then we should be aware that the planet has other  home grown means of disposal .   evidence is emerging that suggests that other extinctions were caused by  natural  but catastrophic changes in the planet s atmosphere .  a case is being made that indicates that the very existence of life on earth will  periodically  trip a catastrophe .   rocks don t mind .   this will probably not happen tomorrow .  but  one day  it will .  and then rincewind s kaleidoscope is shaken up for a new pretty pattern .   eden and camelot  the wondrous garden worlds of myth and legend  are here now .  this is about as good as it ever gets .  mostly  it s a lot worse .  and it won t stay like this for very long .   there are  perhaps  choices .  we could leave .  we ve dealt with that .  considerable optimism is required .  but there might be other small blue planets out there  .  .  .  by definition  though  earthlike worlds will have life on them .  that s why they ll be earthlike .  and the trouble is that the more earthlike it is  the more troublesome it would be .  don t worry about the laser wielding monsters     you can talk to them  if only about lasers .  the real problem is more likely to be something very  very small .  in the morning you get a rash .  in the afternoon  your legs explode .    the other  choice  is to stay .  we may be lucky     we tend to be .  but we won t be lucky forever .  the average life of a species is about five million years .  depending on how you define humanity  we may already be close to the average .   a useful project  and one that s much cheaper to achieve  is to leave a note to the next occupiers  even if it is only to say  we were here  .  it may be of interest to a future species that even if they are  alone in space  they re not alone in time .   we may already have left our marker .  it depends on how long things will really last on the moon  and if  in a hundred million years  anyone else feels it necessary to go there .  if they do  they may find the abandoned descent stages of the apollo moon landers .  and they ll wonder what a  richard m .  nixon  was .   how much luckier are the inhabitants of discworld .  they know they live on a world made for people .  with a large hungry turtle  not to mention the four elephants  interstellar debris becomes lunch rather than catastrophe .  large scale extinction has more to do with magical interference than random rocks or built in fluctuations  it may have the same effect  but at least there is someone to blame .   unfortunately  it does reduce the scope for asking interesting questions .  most of them have already been answered .  certainty rules .  mustrum ridcully is not the kind of person who would tolerate an uncertainty principle  after all .   back in roundworld  there is perhaps one point worth making .   just suppose there is nothing else .  arguments about intelligent life on other worlds have always been highly biased by the desires of those doing the arguing that there should be intelligent life on other worlds  and we three are among them .  but the argument is a house of cards with no card on the bottom .  we know of life on one world .  everything else is guesswork and naked statistics .  life may be so common through the universe that even the atmosphere of jupiter is alive with jovian gasbags and every cometary nucleus is home to colonies of microscopic blobuies .  or there may be nothing alive at all  anywhere else but here .   perhaps intelligent life arose before humanity  and perhaps it will again when humanity s span has become a rather complex layer in the strata .  we can t tell .  time does not simply  as the hymn says  bear all its sons away     it can easily see the disappearance of the entire continent on which they stood .   in short  in a universe a billion grandfathers long and a trillion grandfathers wide  there may be just a few hundred thousand years on one planet where a species worried about something other than sex  survival  and the next meal .   this is our discworld .  in its little cup of spacetime  humanity has invented gods   philosophies  ethical systems  politics  an unfeasible number of ice cream flavours and even more esoteric things like  natural justice  and  boredom  .  should it matter to us if tigers are made extinct and the last orangutan dies in a zoo .  after all  blind forces have repeatedly erased species that were probably more beautiful and worthy .   but we feel it does matter  because humans invented the concept of things  mattering  .  we feel we ought to be brighter than a mile of incandescent rock and a continent sized glacier .  humans seem to have created  independently  in many places and at various times  a make a real human being kit  which begins with prohibitions about killing and theft and incest and is now groping towards our responsibilities to a natural world in which  despite its ability to hurt us mightily  we nevertheless have a godlike power .    we advance arguments about saving rainforests because  there may be undiscovered cancer cures in there   but this is because extelligence wants to save rainforests and the cancer cure argument might convince the bean counters and the fearful .  it might have a real basis in fact  too  but the real reason is that we feel that a world with tigers and orangutans and rainforests and even small unobtrusive snails in it is a more healthy and interesting world for humans  and  of course  the tigers and orangutans and snails  and that a world without them would be dangerous territory .  in other words  trusting the instincts that up until now have generally seen us through  we think that tigers are nice  or  at least  tigers are nice in moderation and at a safe distance  .   it s a circular argument  but in our little round human world we ve managed to live on circular arguments for millennia .  and who else is going to argue with us .       explained to the hilt in the science of discworld ii  the globe .       this is probably another lie .  alien microbes are unlikely to find us edible .  so are alien tigers  although they might do us quite a lot of damage in finding out .  but certainly an alien world will have a whole host of nasty surprising  if we are not very careful .  we can   t tell you what they   ll be .  they   ll be a surprise .       we apologize to any real gods .       unfortunately  huge malicious destructive force is a god like power .       forty nine   as above  so below    rincewind walked very gingerly towards his office  the globe of the project held carefully in his hands .   he would have expected an entire universe to be heavier  but this one seemed on the light side .  it was probably all that space .   the archchancellor had explained at length to him that although he would be called the egregious professor of cruel and unusual geography  this was only because that was cheaper than repainting the title on the door .  he was not entitled to wages  or to teach  or express any opinions on anything  or order anyone around  or wear any special robes  or publish anything .  but he could turn up for meals  provided he ate quietly .   to rincewind  it sounded like heaven .   the bursar appeared right in front of him .  one moment there was an empty corridor  the next moment there was a bemused wizard .   they collided .  the sphere went up in the air  turning gently .   rincewind rebounded from the bursar  looked up at the ball curving through the air  flung himself forward and down with rib scraping force and caught it a few inches from the stone floor .    rincewind .  don t tell him who he is .    rincewind rolled over  clasping the little universe  and looked back along the passage .  ridcully and the other wizards were advancing slowly and cautiously .  ponder stibbons was waving a spoonful of jelly invitingly .   rincewind glanced up the bursar  who was looking perplexed .    but he s the bursar  isn t he .   he said .   the bursar smiled  looked puzzled for a moment  and vanished with a  pop  .    seven seconds .   shouted ponder  dropping the spoon and pulling out a notebook .   that ll put him in  .  .  .  yes  the laundry room .    the wizards hurried off  except for the senior wrangler  who was rolling a cigarette .    what happened to the bursar .   said rincewind  getting to his feet .    oh  young stibbons reckons he s caught uncertainty   said the senior wrangler  licking the paper .   as soon as his body remembers what it s called it forgets where it s supposed to be .   he stuck the bent and wretched cylinder in his mouth and fumbled for his matches .   just another day at unseen university  really .    he wandered off  coughing .   rincewind carried the sphere though the maze of dank passages and into his office  where he cleared a space for it on a shelf .   the ice age had cleared up .  he wondered what was happening down there  what gastropod or mammal or lizard was even now winding up its elastic ready to propel itself towards the crown of the world .  soon  without a doubt  some creature would suddenly develop an unnecessarily large brain and be forced to do things with it .  and it d look around and probably declare how marvellous it was that the universe had been built to bring forward the inevitable development of creature kind .   boy  was it in for a shock  .  .  .    okay  you can come out   he said .   they ve lost interest .    the librarian was hiding behind a chair .  the orangutan took university discipline seriously  even though he was capable of clapping someone on both ears and forcing his brain down his nose .    they re busy trying to catch the bursar right now   said rincewind .   anyway  i m sure it couldn t have been the apes .  no offence  but they didn t look the right sort to me .     ook .     it was probably something out of the sea somewhere .  i m sure we didn t see most of what was going on .    rincewind huffed on the surface of the globe  and polished it with his sleeve .   what s recursion .   he said .   the librarian gave a very expansive shrug .    it looks okay to me   said rincewind .   i wondered if it was some sort of disease  .  .  .    he slapped the librarian on the back  raising a cloud of dust .   come on  let s go and help them hunt  .  .  .    the door shut .  their footsteps died away .   the world spun in its little universe  about a foot across on the outside  infinitely large on the inside .   behind it  stars floated away in the blackness .  here and there they congregated in great swirling masses  spinning about some unimaginable drain .  sometimes these drifted together  passing through one another like ghosts and parting in a trailing veil of stars .   young stars grew in luminous cradles .  dead stars rolled in the glowing shrouds of their death .   infinity unfolded .  walls of glittering swept past  revealing fresh fields of stars  .  .  .    .  .  .  where  sailing through the endless night  made of hot gas and dust but recognizable nevertheless  was a turtle .   as above  so below .       v  .   june      updated text to match  nd edition paperback  including two new chapters   proofread  and added chapter icons  etc .
