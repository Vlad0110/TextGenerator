thing      about the author      other books by terry pratchett      cover      copyright      about the publisher      introduction     this is only you can save mankind  the first book about a boy called johnny maxwell .  he   s english  but then  no one   s perfect .   it   s been a long time since the book was first published  and we had to ask ourselves  how much should we change for this new edition .  and the answer was  not much .   after all  a book   s a done and finished thing  a sort of picture of the time in which it was written .  no one expects tom sawyer to have a skateboard  sigh   but i expect he   ll be given one  someday     .  so we haven   t made very many alterations to this book .  we   ve changed some of the slang and a few little details to make things clearer  and left it at that .  there   s no point in giving your dad a pair of newrocks  pushing him into the mosh pit  and trying to pretend he   s fourteen .    but maybe there are one or two things i should point out .  only you can save mankind was written during the gulf war   not the one we   ve just had  which was the sequel  but the one more than ten years ago .  i hope no one intends to make it a trilogy .   computers were just getting powerful enough to run realistic looking games  although they were pretty clunky by today   s standards .  at the same time  people were watching the first    video war .     every night the news showed the views from bombsight cameras  in what looked like live action  often presented by general    stormin    norman    schwarzkopf  who was in charge .   on your computer  games that looked like war .  on your tv  a war that looked like a game .  if you weren   t careful  you could get confused    .   oh  and mobile phones weren   t that common  at least for kids .  if you were away from home  you had to use a phone attached by a wire to the wall .  it was terrible .        terry pratchett            the mighty scree wee    empire     is poised to attack earth .     our battleships have been  destroyed in a sneak raid .     nothing can stand between earth and the  terrible vengeance of the screewee    .     but there is one starship left     and out of the mists of time comes one warrior   one fighter who is the last hope of civilization .   you .   you are the savior of civilization .   you are all that stands between  your world and certain oblivion .   you are the last hope .     only you can save mankind .        action packed with new features .   just like the real thing .   full color sound and slam vector    graphics .     suitable for ibm pc  atari  amiga  pineapple  amstrad  nintendo .  actual game shots taken from a version you haven   t bought .   copyright         gobi software        w .  agharta drive  shambala

first fighter  fire the missile   thwump   empty the guns at the fighter   fplat fplat fplat fplat   hit fighter no .    and take out its shields with the laser   bwizzle   while the missile   pwwosh   takes out fighter no .     dive  switch guns  rake fighter no .    as it turns fplat fplat fplat   pick up fighter no .    in the sights again up the upcurve  let go a missile   thwump   and rake it with     fwit fwit fwit .   fighter no .    .  it always came in last  but if you went after it first  the others would have time to turn and you   d end up in the sights of three of them .   he   d died six times already .  and it was only five o   clock .   his hands flew over the keyboard .  stars roared past as he accelerated out of the melee .  it   d leave him short of fuel  but by the time they caught up  the shields would be back and he   d be ready  and two of them would already have taken damage  and   here they come   missiles away  wow  lucky hit on the first one  die die die .   red fireball   swsssh   take shield loss while concentrating fire on the next one   swsssh   and now the last one was running  but he could outrun it  hit the accelerator   ggrrrrrsshhh   and just keep it in his sights while he poured shot after shot into   swssh .   ah .   the huge bulk of their capital ship was in the corner of the screen .  level     here we come   careful  careful   there were no more ships now  so all he had to do was keep out of its range and then sweep in and we wish to talk .   johnny blinked at the message on the screen .   we wish to talk .   the ship roared by   eeeyooowwwnn .  he reached out for the throttle key and slowed himself down  and then turned and got the big red shape in his sights again .   we wish to talk .   his finger hovered on the fire button .  then  without really looking  he moved it over to the keyboard and pressed pause .   then he read the manual .   only you can save mankind  it said on the cover .     full sound and graphics .  the ultimate game .      a screewee heavy cruiser  it said on page seventeen  could be taken out with seventy six laser shots .  once you   d cleared the fighter escort and found a handy spot where the screewee   s guns couldn   t get you  it was just a matter of time .   we wish to talk .   even with the pause on  the message still flashed on the screen .   there was nothing in the manual about messages .  johnny riffled through the pages .  it must be one of the new features the game was packed with .   he put down the book  put his hands on the keys  and cautiously tapped out  die  alein scum   no .  we do not wish to die .  we wish to talk .   it wasn   t supposed to be like this  was it .   wobbler johnson  who   d given him the disk and photocopied the manual on his dad   s copier  had said that once you   d completed level     you got given an extra        points and the scroll of valor and moved on to the arcturus sector  where there were different ships and more of them .   johnny wanted the scroll of valor .   johnny fired the laser one more time .  swsssh .  he didn   t really know why .  it was just because you had the joystick and there was the fire button and that was what it was for .   after all  there wasn   t a don   t fire button .   we surrender .  please .   he reached over and  very carefully  pressed the save game button .  the computer whirred and clicked  and then was silent .   he didn   t play again the whole evening .  he did his homework .   it was geography .  you had to color in great britain and put a dot on the map of the world where you thought it was .       the screewee captain thumped her desk with one of her forelegs .      what .      the first officer swallowed and tried to keep her tail held at a respectful angle .      he just vanished again  ma   am     she said .      but did he accept .         no  ma   am .      the captain drummed the fingers of three hands on the table .  she looked slightly like a newt but mainly like an alligator .      but we didn   t fire on him .         no  ma   am .         and you sent my message .         yes  ma   am .         and every time we   ve killed him  he comes back    .          he caught up with wobbler in break .   wobbler was the kind of boy who was always picked last when you had to pick teams  although that was all right at the moment as the pe teacher didn   t believe in teams because they encouraged competition .   he wobbled .  it was glandular  he said .  he wobbled especially when he ran .  bits of wobbler headed in various directions  it was only on average that he was running in any particular direction .   but he was good at games .  they just weren   t the ones that people thought you ought to be good at .  if ever there was an interschool first one to break the unbreakable copy protection on galactic thrusters  wobbler wouldn   t just be on the team  he   d be picking the team .      yo  wobbler     said johnny .      it   s not cool to say yo anymore     said wobbler .      is it rad to say cool .     said johnny .      cool   s always cool .  and no one says rad anymore  either .      wobbler looked around conspiratorially and then fished a package from his bag .      this is cool .  have a shot at this .         what is it .     said johnny .      i cracked fighter star terabomber     said wobbler .     only don   t tell anyone  all right .  just type fsb .  it   s not much good  really .  the space bar drops the bombs  and   well   just press the keys  you   ll see what they do    .         listen   you know only you can save mankind .         still playing that  are you .         you didn   t  you know  do anything to it  did you .  um .  before you gave me a copy .         no .  it wasn   t even protected .  didn   t have to do anything except copy the manual .  why .         you did play it  didn   t you .         a bit .     wobbler played games only once .  wobbler could watch a game for a couple of minutes and then pick up the joystick and get the top score .  and then never play it again .      nothing   funny   happened .         like what .     said wobbler .      like       johnny hesitated .  he could tell wobbler  and then wobbler would laugh  or not believe him  or say it was just some bug or something  some kind of trick .  or a virus .  wobbler had disks full of computer viruses .  he didn   t do anything with them .  he just collected them  like stamps or something .   he could tell wobbler  and then somehow it wouldn   t be real .      oh  you know   funny .         like what .         weird .  um .  lifelike  i suppose .         it   s s   posed to be .  just like the real thing  it says .  i hope you   ve read the manual properly .  my dad spent a whole coffee break copying that .      johnny gave a sickly grin .      yes .  right .  better read it  then .  thanks for star fighter pilot           terabomber .  my dad brought me back alabama smith and the jewels of fate from the states .  you can have a copy if you give me the disk back .         right     said johnny .      it   s ok .         right     said johnny .   he never had the heart to tell wobbler that he didn   t play half the games wobbler passed on .  you couldn   t .  not if you wanted time to sleep and eat meals .  but that was all right  because wobbler never asked .  as far as wobbler was concerned  computer games weren   t there for playing .  they were for breaking into  rewriting so that you got extra lives or whatever  and then copying and giving away to everyone .   basically  there were two sides to the world .  there was the entire computer games software industry engaged in a tremendous effort to stamp out piracy  and there was wobbler .  currently  wobbler was winning .      did you do my history .     said wobbler .      here     said johnny .        what it was like to be a peasant during the english civil war .     three pages .         thanks     said wobbler .     that was quick .         oh  in geog last term we had to do one about what it   s like being a peasant in bolivia .  i just got rid of the llamas and put in stuff about kings having their heads chopped off .  you have to toss in that kind of stuff  and then you just have to keep complaining about the weather and the crops and you can   t go wrong  in peasant essays .          johnny lay on his bed reading only you can save mankind .   he could just about remember the days when you could still get games where the instructions consisted of something that said     press   for left and   for right and fire for fire .      but now you had to read a whole little book that was all about the game .  it was really the manual  but they called it    the novel .      partly it was an anti wobbler thing .  someone in america or somewhere thought it was real clever to make the game ask you little questions  like    what   s the first word on line    on page    of the manual .     and then reset the machine if you didn   t answer them right  so they   d obviously never heard of wobbler   s dad   s office   s photocopier .   so there was this book .  the screewee had turned up out of nowhere and bombed some planets with humans on them .  nearly all the starships had been blown up .  so there was only this one left  the experimental one .  it was all that stood against the screewee hordes .  and only you   that is to say john maxwell  aged twelve  in between the time you get home from school and get something to eat and do your homework   can save mankind .   nowhere did it say what you were supposed to do if the screewee hordes didn   t want to fight .   he switched on the computer and pressed the load game key .   there was the ship again  right in the middle of his sights .   he picked up the joystick thoughtfully .   there was an immediate message on the screen .  well  not exactly a message .  more a picture .  half a dozen little egg shaped blobs  with tails .  they didn   t move .   what kind of message is that .  he thought .   perhaps there was a special message he ought to send .     die  creep    didn   t seem to fit properly at the moment .   he typed  whats hpaening .   immediately a reply appeared on the screen  in yellow letters .   we surrender .  do not shoot .  see  we show you pictures of our children .   he typed  is this a trick wobbler .   it took a little while before the reply came .   am not trick wobbler .  we give in .  no more war .   johnny thought for a while  and then typed  youre not supoosed to give ni .   want to go home .   johnny typed  it says in the book you blue up a lot of planets .   lies .   johnny stared at the screen .  what he wanted to type was  no  i mean  this cant happen  youre aliens  you cant not want to be shot at  no other game aliens have ever stopped aliening across the screen  they never said we dont want to go .   and then he thought  they never had the chance .  they couldn   t .   but games are a lot better now .   they never made things like the old megazoids seem real  with stories about them and full color graphics .   this is probably that virtual reality they   re always talking about on the television .   he typed  it is only a game  after all .   what is a game .   he typed  who are you .   the screen flickered .  something a bit like a newt but more like an alligator looked back at him .   i am the captain  said the yellow letters .  do not shoot .   johnny typed  i shoot at you and you shoot at me .  that is the game .   but we die .   johnny typed  sometimes i die .  i die a lot .   but you live again .   johnny stared at the words for a moment .  then he typed  dont you .   no .  how could this be .  when we die  we die .  forever .   johnny typed desperately  no  thats not right because  in the first mission  theres three ships you have to blow up before the first planet .  i ve played it lots of times and there s always three ships there     different ships .   johnny thought for a while and then typed  what happens if i switch of tthe machine .   we do not understand the question .   this is crazy  thought johnny .  it   s just a very unusual game .  it   s a special mission or something .   he typed  why should i trust you .   look behind you .   johnny sat bolt upright in his chair .  then he let himself swivel around  very cautiously .   of course  there was no one there .  why should there be anyone there .  it was a game .   the newt face had disappeared from the screen  leaving the familiar picture of the inside of the starfighter .  and there was the radar screen        covered in yellow dots .   yellow for the enemy .   johnny picked up the joystick and turned the starfighter around .  the entire screewee fleet was there .  ship after ship was hanging in space behind him .  little fighters  big cruisers  massive battleships .   if they all had him in their sights  and if they fired     he didn   t want to die .   hang on  hang on .  you don   t die .  you just play the game again .   this was nuts .  it was time to stop it .   he typed  all right what happens now .   we want to go home .   he typed  all right no problem .   you give us safe conduct .   he typed  ok yes .   the screen went blank .   and that was it .  no music .  no    congratulations  you   ve got the highest score    .   just the little prompt  flashing on and off .   what did safe conduct mean  anyway .       operate controls to play game     you never said to your parents     hey  i really need a computer because that way i can play megasteroids .      no  you said     i really need a computer because of school .      it   s educational .   anyway  there had to be a good side to the trying times everyone was going through in this house .  if you hung around in your room and generally kept your head down  stuff like computers sort of happened .  it made everyone feel better .   and it was quite useful for school sometimes .  johnny had written    what it felt like to be different sorts of peasants    on it and printed them out on the printer  although he had to rewrite them in his handwriting because although the school taught keyboard skills and new technology  you got into trouble if you used keyboard skills and new technology actually to do anything .   funnily enough  it wasn   t much good for math .  he   d always had trouble with algebra  because they wouldn   t let you get away with    what it feels like to be x  .     but he had an arrangement with bigmac about that  because bigmac got the same feeling when he looked at an essay project as johnny did when he was faced with a quadratic equation .  anyway  it didn   t matter that much .  if you kept your head down  they were generally so grateful that you were not  e . g .   causing policemen to come to the school  or actually nailing a teacher to anything  that you got left alone .   but mainly the computer was good for games .  if you turned the volume control up  you didn   t have to hear the shouting .       the screewee mother ship was in uproar .  there was still a haze of smoke in the air from the last bombardment  and indistinct figures pattered back and forth  trying to fix things up well enough to survive the journey .   the captain sat back in her chair on the huge  shadowy bridge .  she was yellow under the eyes  a sure sign of lack of sleep .  so much to be done   half the fighters were damaged  and the main ships were in none too good condition  and there was hardly any room and certainly no food for all the survivors they were taking on board .   she looked up .  there was the gunnery officer .      this is not a wise move     he said .      it is the only one i have     said the captain wearily .      no .  we must fight on .         and then we die     said the captain .     we fight  and then we die .  that   s how it goes .         then we die gloriously .         there   s an important word in that sentence     said the captain .     and it   s not the word    gloriously .         the gunnery officer went light green with rage .      he   s attacked hundreds of our ships .         and then he stopped .         none of the others have     said the gunnery officer .     they   re humans .  you can   t trust a human .  they shoot everything .      the captain rested her snout on one hand .      he doesn   t     she said .     he listened .  he talked .  none of the others did .  he may be the one .      the gunnery officer placed his upper two front hands on the desk and glared at her .      well     he said     i   ve talked to the other officers .  i don   t believe in legends .  when the full enormity of what you have done is understood  you will be relieved of your command .      she turned tired eyes toward him .      good     she said .     but right now  i am captain .  i am responsible .  do you understand .  have you got the faintest idea of what that means .  now   go .      he didn   t like it  but he couldn   t disobey .  i can have him shot  she thought .  it   d be a good idea .  bound to save trouble later on .  it   ll be no .      on the list of things to do    .   she turned back to continue staring at the stars outside  on the huge screen that filled one wall .   the enemy ship still hung there .   what kind of person is it .  she thought .  despicable though they are  there   s so few of them .  but they keep coming back .  what   s their secret .   but you can be sure of one thing .  they surely only send their bravest and their best .       the advantage of the trying times was that helping yourself from the fridge was ok .  there didn   t seem to be any proper mealtimes anymore in any case .  or any real cooking .   johnny made himself spaghetti and baked beans .  there was no sound from the living room  although the tv was on .   then he watched a bit of television in his room .  he   d been given the old one when they got the new one .  it wasn   t very big  and you had to get up and walk over to it every time you wanted to change channels or the volume or whatever  but these were trying times .   there was a film on the news showing some missiles streaking over some city .  it was quite good .   then he went to bed .       he was not entirely surprised to wake up at the controls of a starfighter .   it had been like that with captain zoom .  you couldn   t get it out of your head .  after an evening   s concentrated playing  you were climbing ladders and dodging laser zap bolts all night .   it was a pretty good dream  even so .  he could feel the seat under him .  and the cabin smelled of hot oil and overheated plastic and unwashed people .   it looked pretty much like the one he saw on the screen every evening  except that there was a thin film of grease and dirt over everything .  but there was the radar screen  and the weapons console  and the joystick     hey  much better than the computer .  the cabin was full of noises   the click and whirr of fans  the hum and buzz of instruments .   and better graphics .  you get much better graphics in your dreams .   the screewee fleet hung in the ai   hung in space in front of him .   wow .   although dreams ought to be a bit more exciting .  you got chased in dreams .  things happened to you .  sitting in the cockpit of a starfighter bristling with weapons was fun  but things ought to happen    .   he wondered if he should launch a missile or something    .  no  hang on  they   d surrendered .  and there was that thing about safe conduct .   his hands wandered over the switches in front of him .  they were a bit different from the computer keyboard  but this one        are you receiving me .      the face of the captain appeared on the communications screen .      yes .     said johnny .      we are ready .         ready .     said johnny .     what for .         lead the way     said the captain .  the voice came out of a grille beside the screen .  it must be being translated by something  johnny thought .  i shouldn   t think giant newts speak english .      where to .     he said .     where are we going .         earth .         earth .  hang on .  that   s where i live .  people can get into serious trouble showing huge alien fleets where they live .      the grille hummed and buzzed for a while .  then the captain said     apology .  that is a direct translation .  we call the planet that is our home    earth .     when i speak in screewee  your computer finds the word in your language that means the same thing .  the actual word in screewee sounds like       there was a noise like someone taking their foot out of a wet cowpat .     i will show our home to you .      a red circle suddenly developed on the navigation screen .   johnny knew about that .  you just moved a green circle over it  the computer went binkabinkabinka  and you   d set your course .   they   ve shown me where they live .   the thought sank in .   they trust me .   as he moved his fighter forward  the entire alien fleet pulled in behind him .  they eclipsed the stars .   the cabin hummed and buzzed quietly to itself .   well  at least it didn   t look too hard    .   a green dot appeared ahead of him .   he watched it get bigger and recognized the shape of a starfighter  just like his .   but it was a little hard to make it out .   this was because it was half hidden by laser bolts .   it was firing at him as it came .   and it was traveling so fast  it was very nearly catching up with its own fire .   johnny jerked the joystick and his ship rolled out of the way as the   the enemy starfighter roared past and barreled on toward the screewee ships .   the whole sky full of screewee ships .   which had surrendered to him .   but people out there were still playing the game .      no .  listen to me .  they   re not fighting anymore .      the starfighter turned in a wide curve and headed directly for the command ship .  johnny saw it launch a missile .  someone sitting at a keyboard somewhere had launched a missile .      listen .  you   ve got to stop .      it   s not listening to me  he thought .  you don   t listen to the enemy .  the enemy   s there to be shot at .  that   s why it   s the enemy .  that   s what the enemy   s for .   he swung around to follow the starship  which had slowed down .  it was pouring shot after shot into the command ship        which wasn   t firing back .   johnny stared in horror .       the ship rocked under the hail of fire .  the gunnery officer crawled across the shaking floor and pulled himself up beside the captain   s chair .      fool .  fool .  i told you this would happen .  i demand that we return fire .      the captain was watching the chosen one   s ship .  it hadn   t moved .      no     she said .     we have to give him a chance .  we must not fire on human ships .         a chance .  how much of a chance do we have .  i shall give the order to        the captain moved very fast .  when her hand stopped  she was holding a gun very close to the gunnery officer   s head .  it was really only a ceremonial weapon  normally screewee fought only with their claws .  but its shape said very clearly that things came out of the hole in the front end with the very definite purpose of traveling fast through the air and then killing people .      no     she said .   the gunnery officer   s face went blue  a sure sign of terror .  but he had enough courage left to say     you would not dare fire .          it   s a game  thought johnny .  there   s not a real person in that ship .  it   s someone playing a game .  it   s all a game .  it   s just things happening on a screen somewhere .   no .   i mean  yes .   but        at the same time        it   s all happening here    .   his own ship leaped forward .   it was easy .  it was so easy .  just line up circles on the screen  binkabinkabinka  and then press the fire button until every weapon on the ship was empty .  he   d done it many times before .   the invader hadn   t even seen him .  it launched some missiles   and then blew up in an impressive display of graphics .   that   s all it is  johnny told himself .  just things on a screen .  it   s not real .  there   s no arms and feet spinning away through the wreckage .  it   s all a game .   the missiles arrived    .   the whole cockpit went blinding white .   he was aware  just for a moment  of cold space around him  with things in it    .   a bookcase .  a chair .  a bed .   he was sitting in front of the computer .  the screen was blank .  he was holding the joystick so hard that he had to concentrate to let go of it .   the clock by his bed said     because it was broken .  but it meant he   d have to get up in another hour or so .   he sat with his quilt around him watching the television until the alarm went off .   there were some more pictures of missiles and bullets streaking over a city .  they looked pretty much the same as the ones he   d seen last night  but were probably back by popular demand .   he felt sick .       yo less could help  johnny decided .   he normally hung out with wobbler and bigmac on the bit of wall behind the school library .  they weren   t exactly a gang .  if you take a big bag of potato chips and shake them up  all the little bits end up in one corner .   yo less was called yo less because he never said    yo .     he   d given up objecting to the name by now .  at least it was better than nearly massive  which was the last nickname  and o .  j .  bottle  which was the one before that .  johnny was the official nickname generator .   yo less said he   d never said    massive     either .  he pointed out that johnny was white and never said     yerwhat .  yerwhat .  yerwhat .     or    god save the queen    and anyway  you shouldn   t make jokes about racial stereotyping .   johnny didn   t go into too much detail .  he just talked about the dream  and not about the messages on the screen .  yo less listened carefully .  yo less listened to everything carefully .  it worried teachers  the way he listened carefully to everything they said .  they always suspected he was trying to catch them out .   he said     what you   ve got here is a projection of a psychological conflict .  that   s all .  want a cheese ring .         what   s that .         it   s just crunchy cheesy flavored           i mean the other thing you said .      yo less passed the bag on to bigmac .      well   your mum and dad are splitting up  right .  well known fact .         could be .  it   s a bit of a trying time     said johnny .      o kay .  and there   s nothing you can do about it .         shouldn   t think so     said johnny .      and this definitely affects you     said yo less .      i suppose so     said johnny cautiously .     i know i have to do a lot of my own cooking .         right .  so you project your   um   suppressed emotions onto a computer game .  happens all the time     said yo less  whose mother was a nurse  and who wanted to be a doctor if he grew up .     you can   t solve the real problems  so you turn them into problems you can solve .  like   if this was thirty years ago  you   d probably dream about fighting dragons or something .  it   s a projected fantasy .         saving hundreds of intelligent newts doesn   t sound very easy to solve     said johnny .      dunno     said bigmac happily .     ratatatat blam .  no more problem .     bigmac wore large boots and camouflage trousers all the time .  you could spot him a mile off by his camouflage trousers .      the thing is     said yo less     it   s not real .  real   s real .  but stuff on a screen isn   t .         i   ve cracked stellar smashers     said wobbler .     you can have that if you want .  everyone says it   s a lot better .         no oo     said johnny .     i think i   ll stick with this one for a while .  see if i can get to level twenty one .         if you get to level twenty one and blow up the whole fleet  you get a special number on the screen  and if you write off to gobi software  you get a five pound token     said wobbler .     it was in computer weekly .      johnny thought about the captain .      a whole five pounds .     he said .     gosh .      it was gym in the afternoon .  bigmac was the only one who played .  he   d never been keen until they   d introduced hockey .  you got a club to hit people  he said .   yo less didn   t do sports because of intellectual incompatibility .  wobbler didn   t do sports because the sports coach had asked him not to .  johnny didn   t do sports because he had a permanent note  and no one cared much anyway  so he went home early and spent the afternoon reading the manual .   he didn   t touch the computer before tea .   there was an extended news  which meant that cobbers was postponed .  there were the same pictures of missiles streaking across a city that he   d seen the night before  except that now there were more journalists in sand colored shirts with lots of pockets talking excitedly about them .   he heard his mother downstairs complain about cobbers  and by the sound of the raised voices  that started trying times again .   then there was some history homework about christopher columbus .  he looked him up in the encyclopedia and copied out four hundred words  which usually worked .  he drew a picture of columbus as well  and colored it in .   after a while he realized that he was putting off switching the computer on .  it came to something  he thought  when you did schoolwork rather than play games    .   it wouldn   t hurt to at least have a game of pac man or something .  trouble was  the ghosts would probably stay in the middle of the screen and refuse to come out and be eaten .  he didn   t think he could cope with that .  he   d got enough to worry about as it was .   on top of it all  his father came upstairs to be fatherly .  this happened about once a fortnight .  there didn   t seem to be any way of stopping it .  you had to put up with twenty minutes of being asked about how you were getting on at school  and had you really thought about what you wanted to be when you grew up .   the thing to do was not encourage this  but as politely as possible .   his father sat on the edge of the bed and looked around the room as though he   d never seen it before .   after the normal questions about teachers johnny hadn   t had since the first year  his father stared at nothing much for a while and then said     things have been a bit tricky lately .  i expect you   ve noticed .         no .         it   s been a bit tricky at work .  not a good time to start a new business .         yes .         everything all right .         yes .         nothing you want to talk about .         no .  i don   t think so .      his father looked around the room again .  then he said     remember last year  when we all went down to falmouth for the week .         yes .         you enjoyed that  didn   t you .      he   d got sunburned and twisted his ankle on some rocks and he had to get up at eight thirty every morning  even though it was supposed to be a vacation .  and the only tv in the hotel was in front of some old woman who never let go of the remote control .      yes .         we ought to go again .      his father was staring at him .      yes     said johnny .     that would be nice .         how   re you getting on with space invaders .         sorry .         space invaders .  on the computer .      johnny turned to look at the blank screen .      what   re space invaders .     he said .      isn   t that what they   re called anymore .  space invaders .  you used to get them in pubs and things  oh  before you were born .  rows of spiky triangular green aliens with six legs kept on coming down the screen and we had to shoot them .      johnny gave this some thought .     what happened when you   d shot them all  then .         oh  you got some more .     his father stood up .     i expect it   s all more complicated now  though .         yes .         done your homework  have you .         yes .         what was it .         history .  had to write something about christopher columbus .         hmm .  you could put in that he didn   t set out to discover america .  he was really looking for asia and found america by accident .         yes .  it says that in the encyclopedia .         glad to see you   re using it .         yes .  it   s very interesting .         good .  right .  right  then .  well  i   m going to have another look at those accounts           right .         if there   s anything you want to talk about  you know           all right .      johnny waited until he heard the living room door shut again .  he wondered if he ought to have asked where the instruction manual for the dishwasher was .   he switched on the computer .   after a while the screen for only you can save mankind came on .  he watched the introductory bit moodily and then picked up the joystick .   there weren   t any aliens .   for a little while he thought he   d done something wrong .  he started the game again .   there were still no aliens .  all there was  was the blackness of space  sprinkled with a few twinkling stars .   he flew around until he was out of fuel .   no screewee  no dots on the radar screen .  no game .   they   d gone .       cereal killers     there was more news these days than normal .  half the time the tv was showing pictures of tanks and maps of deserts with green and red arrows all over them  while in the corner of the screen would be a photo of a journalist with a phone to his ear  talking in a crackly voice .   it crackled in the background while johnny phoned up wobbler .      yes .         can i speak to wob   to stephen  please .      mutter  clonk  bump  scuffle .      yes .         it   s me  wobbler .         yes .         have you had a look at only you can save mankind lately .         no .  hey  listen  i   ve found a way to           could you have a go with it right now  please .      pause .      you all right .         what .         you sound a bit weird .         look  go and have a go with the game  will you .      it was an hour before wobbler phoned back .  johnny waited on the stairs .      can i speak           it   s me .         there   s no aliens  right .         yes .         probably something built into the game .  you can do that  you know .  a kind of time bomb thing .  maybe it   s programmed to make all the aliens vanish on a certain date .         what for .         make things more interesting  i expect .  probably gobi software will be putting adverts in the computer papers about it .  you all right .  your voice sounds a bit squeaky .         no problem .         you coming down to the mall tomorrow .         yeah .         see you  then .  chow .      johnny stared at the dead phone .  of course  there were things like that on computers .  there   d been something in the papers about it .  a friday the thirteenth virus  or something .  something in the program kept an eye on the date  and when it was friday the thirteenth  it was supposed to do something nasty to computers all over the country .   there had been stories about evil computer hackers menacing society  and wobbler had come to school in homemade dark glasses for a week .   johnny went back and watched the screen for a while .  stars occasionally went past .   wobbler had written an actual computer game like this once .  it was called journey to alpha centauri .  it was a screen with some dots on it .  because  he said  it happened in real time  which no one had ever heard of until computers .  he   d seen on tv that it took three thousand years to get to alpha centauri .  he had written it so that if anyone kept their computer on for three thousand years  they   d be rewarded by a little dot appearing in the middle of the screen  and then a message saying     welcome to alpha centauri .  now go home .      johnny watched the screen for a bit longer .  once or twice he nudged the joystick  to go on a different course .  it didn   t make much difference .  space looked the same from every direction .      hello .  anybody there .     he whispered .   he watched some television before he went to bed .  there were some more missiles  and someone going on about some other missiles that were supposed to knock down the first type of missile .       the fleet traveled in the shape of a giant cone  hundreds of miles long .  the captain looked back at it .  there were scores of mother ships  hundreds of fighters .  more and more kept joining them as news of the surrender spread .   the chosen one   s ship flew a little way ahead of the fleet .  it wasn   t answering messages .   but no one was shooting at them .  there hadn   t been a human ship visible for hours .  perhaps  the captain thought  it   s really working .  we   re leaving them behind    .       johnny woke up in the game .   it was hard to sleep in the starship .  the seat started out as the most comfortable thing in the whole world  but it was amazing how uncomfortable it became after a few hours .  and the lavatory was a complicated arrangement of tubes and trapdoors and it wasn   t  he was beginning to notice  entirely smellproof .   that   s what the computer games couldn   t give you  the smell of space .  it had its own kind of smell  like a machine   s armpit .  you didn   t get dirty  because there was no dirt  but there was a sort of grimy cleanliness about everything .   the radar went ping .   after a while he could see a dot ahead of him .  it wasn   t moving much  and it certainly wasn   t firing .   he left the fleet and went to investigate .   it was a huge ship .  or  at least  it had been once .  quite a lot of it had been melted off .   it drifted along  absolutely dead  tumbling very gently .  it was green  and vaguely triangular  except for six legs  or possibly arms .  three of them were broken stubs .  it looked like a cross between a spider and an octopus  designed by a computer and made out of hundreds of cubes bolted together .   as the giant hulk turned  he could see huge gashes in it  with melted edges .  there was a suggestion of floors inside .   he switched on the radio .      captain .         yes .         can you see this thing here .  what is it .         we find them sometimes .  we think they belonged to an ancient race  now extinct .  we don   t know what they called themselves  or where they came from .  the ships are very crude .      the dead ship turned slowly .  there was another long burn down the other side .      i think they were called space invaders     said johnny .      the human name for them .         yes .         i thought so .      johnny was glad he couldn   t see the captain   s face .   he thought  no one knows where they came from  or even what they called themselves .  and now no one ever will .   the radar went ping again .   there was a human ship heading toward the fleet at high speed .   this time he didn   t hesitate .   the point was  the screewee weren   t very good at fighting .  after the first few games it was quite easy to beat them .  they couldn   t seem to get the hang of it .  they didn   t know how to be sneaky  or when to dodge .   it was the same with all of them  come to think of it .  johnny had played lots of games with words like    space    and    battle    and    cosmic    in the titles  and all the aliens were the sort you could beat after a few weeks    playing .   this player didn   t stand a chance against a real human .   you got six missiles .  johnny had two streaking away before the enemy was much larger than a dot .  then he just kept his finger on the fire button until there was nothing left to fire .   a spreading cloud of wreckage  and that was it .   it wasn   t as if anyone would die  after all .  whoever had been in there would just have to start the game again .   it felt real  but that was just the dream    .   dreams always felt real .   he turned his attention to the thing by the control chair .  it had a nozzle which filled a paper cup with something like thin vegetable soup  and a slot that pushed out very large plastic bags containing very small things like sandwiches .  the bags had to be big to get all the list of additives on .  they contained absolutely everything necessary to keep a star warrior healthy .  not happy  but healthy     he   d taken one mouthful when something slammed into the ship .  a red glare filled the cabin  alarms started to blare .   he looked up in time to see a ship curving away for another run .   he hadn   t even glanced at the radar .   he   d been eating .   he spun the ship .  the multivitamin sandwich flew around into the wiring somewhere .   it was coming back to get him .  he prodded furiously at the control panel .   hang on    .   what was the worst that could happen to him .   he could wake up in bed .   he took his time .  he dodged .  he weaved .  another missile hit the ship .  as the attacker roared past  johnny fired  with everything .   another cloud of wreckage .   no problem .   but it must have fired a missile just before he got it .  there was another red flash .  the lights went out .  the ship jumped .  his head bounced off the seat back and banged onto the control panel .   he opened his eyes .   right .  and you wake up back in your bedroom .   a light winked at him .   there was something beeping .   bound to be the alarm clock .  that   s how dreams end    .   he lifted his head .  the flashing light was oblong .  he tried to focus .   there were shapes there .   but they weren   t saying     .   they were spelling out    air leak     and behind the insistent beeping was a terrible hissing sound .   no  no  he thought .  this doesn   t happen .   he pushed himself up .  there were lots of red lights .  he pressed some buttons hurriedly  but this had no effect at all except to make some more lights go red .   he didn   t know much about the controls of a starship  other than fast  slow  left  right  and fire  but there were whole rows of flashing alarms that suggested that a lot of things he didn   t know about were going wrong .  he stared at some red letters that said    secondary pumps failure .     he didn   t know what the secondary pumps were either  but he wished  he really wished  they hadn   t failed .   his head ached .  he reached up  and there was real blood on his hand .  and he knew that he was going to die .  really die .   no  he thought .  please .  i   m john maxwell .  please .  i   m twelve .  i   m not dying in a spaceshi     the beeping got louder .   he looked at the sign again .   it was flashing     .   about time  he thought  as he passed out    .       and woke up .   he was at the computer again .  it wasn   t switched on  and he was freezing cold .   he had a headache  but a tentative feel said there was no blood .  it was just a headache .   he stared into the dark black screen and wondered what it felt like to be a screewee .   it felt like that  except that you didn   t wake up .  it was always air leak  or  alert alert alert  beeping on and off  and then perhaps the freezing cold of space  and then nothing .   he had breakfast .   you got a free alien in every box of sugar glazed snappiflakes .  it was a new thing .  or an old thing  being tried again .   the one that ended up in his bowl was orange and had three eyes and four arms .  and it was holding a ray gun in each hand .   his father hadn   t got up .  his mother was watching the little television in the kitchen  where a very large man disguised as an entire desert was pointing to a lot of red and blue arrows on a map .   he went down to neil armstrong mall .   he took the plastic alien with him .  that   d be the way to invade a planet .  one alien in every box .  wait until they were in every cupboard in the country  send out the signal  and bazaam .   cereal killers .   maybe on some other planet somewhere you got a free human in every packet of ammonia coated snappicrystals .  hey  zorks .  collect the whole set .  and there   d be all these little plastic people .  holding guns  of course .  you just had to walk down the street to see that  of course  everyone had a gun .   he looked out of the bus window .   that was it  really .  no one would bother to put plastic aliens inside the plastic cereal if they were just  you know  doing everyday things .  holding the cosmiczippo ray    hedge clippers .  getting on the megadeath    bus .  hanging out at the star thruster mall .   the trouble with all the aliens he   d seen was that they wanted to either eat you or play music at you until you became better people .  you never got the sort that just wanted to do something ordinary like borrow the lawn mower .   wobbler and yo less and bigmac were trying to hang out by the ornamental fountain  but really they were just hanging around .  yo less was wearing the same gray trousers he wore to school .  you couldn   t hang out in gray trousers .  and wobbler still wore his sunglasses  except they weren   t real sunglasses because he had to wear ordinary glasses anyway  they were those clip on sunglasses for tourists .  also  they weren   t the same size as the glasses underneath  and had rubbed red marks on his nose .  and bigmac  in addition to his camouflage trousers and    terminator    t shirt with    blackbury skins    on the back in pen  had got hold of a belt made entirely of cartridge cases .  he looked stupid .      yo  duds     said johnny .      we   ve been here ages     said yo less .      i went one stop past on the bus and had to walk back     said johnny .     thinking about other things .  what   s happening .         do you mean what   s happening  or sort of hey  my man  what   s happening .     said wobbler .      what   s happening .     said johnny .      i want to go into j j software     said wobbler .     they might have got cosmic coffee mats in .  it got a review in bazzammm .  and they said it   s got an unbreakable copy protection .         did they say it was any good .     said bigmac .      who cares .         you   ll get caught one day     said yo less .      then you get given a job in silicon valley designing antipiracy software     said wobbler .  behind his two thicknesses of glasses  his eyes lit up .  wobbler thought that california was where good people went when they died .      no  you don   t .  you just get in trouble and you get sued     said yo less .     and the police take all your computers away .  there was something in the paper .      they wandered aimlessly toward the computer shop .      i saw this film once  right  where there were these computer games  and if you were really good  the aliens came and got you and you had to fly a spaceship and fight a whole bad alien fleet     said bigmac .      did you beat it .  i mean  in the film  the alien fleet got beaten .      bigmac gave johnny an odd look .      of course .  sure .  there wouldn   t be any point otherwise  would there .         only you can save mankind     said johnny .      what .         it   s the game     said wobbler .      but it always says something like that on the boxes you get games in     said johnny .  except if you get them from wobbler  he added to himself  when you just get a disk .      well .  yeah .  something like that .  why not .         i mean they never say     only you are going to be put inside a billion pounds worth of machine with more switches than you   ve ever seen and be blown to bits by a thousand skilled enemy pilots because you don   t really know how to fly it .         they wandered past mr .  zippy   s ice cream extravaganza .      can   t see that catching on     said wobbler .     can   t see them ever selling a game called get shot to pieces .         you still having trouble at home .     said yo less .      it   s all gone quiet     said johnny .      that can be worse than shouting .         yes .         it   s not that bad when your mum and dad split up     said wobbler     although you get to see more museums than is good for you .         still found no aliens .     said yo less .      um .  not in the game .         still dreaming about them .     said wobbler .      sort of .      someone handing out leaflets about big savings on double glazing gave one  in desperation  to yo less .  he took it gravely  thanked her  folded it in two and put it in his pocket .  yo less always filed this sort of thing .  you never knew when it might come in handy  he said .  one day he might want to double glaze his surgery  and he   d be in a good position to compare offers .      anyone see the war on the box last night .     said bigmac .     way to go  eh .         way to go where .     said yo less .      we   re really kicking some butt .         some but what .     said wobbler .      we   ll give them the    mother in law of all battles     eh .     said bigmac  still trying to stir some patriotism .      nah .  it   s not like real fighting     said wobbler .     it   s just tv fighting .         wish i was in the army     said bigmac wistfully .     blam .     he shot the double glazing lady  who didn   t notice .  bigmac had a habit of firing imaginary guns .  other people played air guitar  he shot air rifles .      couple more years     he said .     that   s all .         you ought to write to stormin    norman     said wobbler .     ask him to keep the war going until you get there .         he   s done pretty well for someone called norman     said yo less .     i mean   norman .  not very macho  is it .  it   s like bruce  or rodney .         he had to be norman     said wobbler     otherwise he couldn   t be stormin    .  you couldn   t have stormin    bruce .  come on .      j j software was always packed on a saturday morning .  there were always a couple of computers running games  and always a cluster of people gathered around them .  no one knew who j j were  since the shop was run by mr .  patel  who had eyes like a hawk .  he always watched wobbler very carefully  on the fairly accurate basis that wobbler distributed more games than he did and didn   t even charge anyone for them .   the four of them split up .  bigmac wasn   t much interested in games  and yo less went down to look at the videos .  wobbler had found someone who knew even more complicated stuff about computers than he did himself .   johnny wandered down the racks of games .   i wonder if the screewee do this  he thought .  or people on jupiter or somewhere .  go down to a shop and buy    shoot the human    games .  and have films where there   s a human running around the place terrorizing a spaceship     he became aware of a raised voice at the counter .   you didn   t often get girls in j j software .  once  quite a long time ago  during a bit of time she   d set aside for parenting  johnny   s mother had tried playing a game .  it had been quite a simple one   you had to shoot asteroids and flying saucers and things .  it had been embarrassing .  it had been amazing that the flying saucers had even bothered to shoot back .  more likely they should have parked and all the aliens could have looked out of the windows and made rude noises .  women didn   t have a clue .   a girl was complaining to mr .  patel about a game she   d bought .  everyone knew you couldn   t do that  even if you   d opened the box and it was full of nothing but mouse droppings .  mr .  patel took the view that once the transparent wrapper had come off  even the pope wouldn   t be allowed to return a game  not even if he got god to come in as well .  this was because he   d met people like wobbler before .   the boys watched in fascinated horror .   she kept tapping the offending box with a finger .      and who wants to see nothing but stars .     she said .     i   ve seen stars before  actually .  it says on the box that you fight dozens of different kinds of alien ships .  there isn   t even one .      mr .  patel muttered something .  johnny wasn   t close enough to hear .  but the girl   s voice had a kind of penetrating quality  like a corkscrew .  when she spoke in italics  you could hear them .      oh  no .  you can   t say that .  because how can i tell if it works without trying it .  that comes under the sale of goods act        .      the awed watchers were astonished to see a slightly hunted look in mr .  patel   s eyes .  up until now he   d never met anyone who could pronounce brackets .   he muttered something else .      copy it .  why should i copy it .  i   ve bought it .  it says on the box you meet fascinating alien races .  well  all i got was one ship and some stupid message on the screen and then it ran away .  i don   t call that fascinating alien races .      message     ran away     johnny sidled closer .   mr .  patel muttered something else  then turned to one of the shelves .  the shop watched in amazement .  there was a new game in his hand .  he was actually going to make an exchange .  this was like genghis khan deciding not to attack a city but stay at home and watch football instead .   then he held up his hand  nodded at the girl  and stalked over to one of the shop   s own computers  the ones with so many fingermarks on the keys that you couldn   t read them anymore .   everyone watched in silence as he loaded up the copy of the game that the girl had brought back .  the music came on .  the title scrolled up the screen  like the one in star wars .  it was the usual stuff     the mighty screewee fleet have attacked the federation     whatever that was     and only you        and then there was space .  it was computer space   a sort of black  with the occasional star rolling past .      there ought to be six ships on the first mission     said someone behind johnny .   mr .  patel scowled at him .  he pressed a key cautiously .      you   ve just fired a torpedo at nothing  mr .  patel     said wobbler .   finally mr .  patel gave up .  he waved his hands in the air .      how d   you find the things to shoot .     he said .      they find you     said someone .     you should be dead by now .         see .     said the girl .     you get nothing but space .  i left it on for hours  and there was just space .         maybe you   re not persevering .  you kids don   t know the meaning of the word    persevere        said mr .  patel .   wobbler looked over the shopkeeper   s head to johnny and raised his eyebrows .      it   s like persistently trying     said johnny helpfully .      oh .  right .  well  i persistently tried the other night and i didn   t find any  either .      mr .  patel carefully unwrapped the new copy of the game .  the shop watched as he slotted the disk into the computer .      then let us see what the game looks like before mr .  wobbler plays his little tricks     he said .   there was the title screen .  there was the story  such as it was .  and the instructions .   and space .      soon we shall see     said mr .  patel .   and then more space .      this one was delivered only yesterday .      lots more space .  that was the thing about space .   mr .  patel picked up the box and looked at it carefully .  but they   d all seen him take off the shrink wrap .   they   ve gone  thought johnny .   even on the new games .   they   ve all gone .   people were laughing .  but wobbler and yo less were staring at him .          no one really dies           i reckon     said bigmac     i reckon           yes .     said yo less .      i reckon   ronald mcdonald is like jesus christ .      bigmac did that kind of thing .  sometimes he came out with the kind of big  slow statement that suggested some sort of deep thinking had been going on for some time .  it was like mountains .  johnny knew they were made by continents banging together  but no one ever saw it happening .      yes .     said yo less in a kind voice .     and why do you think this .         well  look at all the advertising     said bigmac  waving a fry in the general direction of the rest of the burger bar .     there   s this happy land you go to where there   s lakes of banana milkshake and   and trees covered in fries .  and   and then there   s the hamburglar .  he   s the devil .         mr .  zippy   s advertised by a giant talking ice cream     said wobbler .      i don   t like that     said yo less .     i wouldn   t trust an ice cream that   s trying to get you to eat ice creams .      occasionally they talked like this for hours  when there was something they didn   t want to talk about .  but now they seemed to have run out of things to say .   they all looked silently at johnny  who   d hardly touched his burger .      look  i don   t know what   s happening     he said .      gobi software   s going to be really pissed off when they find out what you   ve done     said wobbler  grinning .      i didn   t do anything .     said johnny .     it   s not my fault .         could be a virus     said yo less .      nah     said wobbler .     i   ve got loads of viruses .  they just muck up the computer .  they don   t muck up your head .         they could     said yo less .     with flashing lights and stuff .  kind of like hypnosis .         you said before i was making it all up .  you said i was projecting fantasies .         that was before old patel went through half a dozen boxes .  i   m glad i saw that .  you know she actually got another copy and her money back  actually .      johnny smiled uncomfortably .   wobbler drummed his fingers on the table  or partly on the table and partly in a pool of barbecue sauce .      no  i still reckon it   s just something gobi software did to all the games .  i like the virus idea  though     he said .     humans catching viruses off of computers .  nice one .         it   s not like that     said johnny .      they used to do this thing with films where they   d put in just one frame of something  like an ice cream or something  and it   d enter people   s brains without them knowing it and they   d all want ice cream     said yo less .     subliminal advertising  it was called .  that   d be quite easy to do on a computer .      johnny thought about the captain showing him pictures of her children .  that didn   t sound like hypnosis .  he didn   t know what it did sound like  but it didn   t sound like hypnosis .      perhaps they   re real aliens and they   re in control of your computer     said yo less .      oooo   eee   ooo     said bigmac  waving his hands in the air and speaking in a hollow voice .     johnny maxwell did not know it  but he had just strayed into   the toilet zone   deedledeedle  deedledeedle  deedledeedle           after all  you   re supposed to be leading them to earth     yo less went on .      but that   s just their own name for their own world     said johnny .      you   ve only got their word for it .  and they   re newts  too .  you could be bringing them here .      they all looked up  in case they could see through the ceiling  t f insurance services  and the roof to a huge alien fleet in the sky above .      you   re just getting carried away     said wobbler .     you can   t invade a planet with a lot of aliens out of a computer game .  they live on a screen .  they   re not real .         what   re you going to do about it  anyway .     said yo less .      just keep doing it  i suppose     said johnny .     who was that girl in patel   s .         oh  she   s always around     said wobbler .     saw her in there once playing cosmic trek .  girls aren   t much good at computer games because they haven   t got such a good grasp of spatial   something or other like we have     he went on airily .     you know .  they can   t think in three dimensions  or something .  they haven   t got the instincts for it .         the captain   s a female     said johnny .      it   s probably different for giant alligators     said wobbler .   bigmac sucked a packet of tomato ketchup .      do you think it might still be going on when i   m old enough to join the army .     he asked thoughtfully .      no     said yo less .     stormin    bruce   ll get it all sorted out .  he   ll kick some butt .      they chorused    some but what .     like tired monks .   they went to the movies in the afternoon .  alabama smith and the emperor   s crown was showing on screen s .  wobbler said it was racist  but yo less said he quite enjoyed it .  they discussed whether it could still be racist if yo less enjoyed it .  johnny bought popcorn all around .  that was another thing about trying times   pocket money was erratic  but you tended to get more of it .   he had spaghetti hoops when he got home  and watched tv for a while .  the pyramid shaped man disguised as a desert seemed to be on a lot now .  he told jokes sometimes .  the journalists laughed a bit .  johnny quite liked stormin    norman .  he looked like the sort of man who could talk to the captain .   then there was a program about saving whales .  they thought it was a good idea .   then you could win lots of money if you could put up with the game show   s host and not  for example  choke him with a cuddly toy and run away .   there was the news .  the walking desert again  and pictures of bombs being dropped down enemy chimneys with pinpoint precision .  and sports .   and then     all right .  let   s see .   he switched on .   yes .  space .  and more space .   no screewee anywhere .   hang on  he thought .  they   re all in the big fleet  aren   t they .  following me .  they followed me out of   out of   out of game space .  you must be able to get there from here  if you keep going long enough .  in the right direction  too .   which way did i go .   can i catch up to myself .   can anyone else catch up to me .   he watched the screen for a while .  it was even more boring than the quiz show .   sooner or later he   d have to go to sleep .  he   d thought hard about this  while alabama smith was being chased by bad guys through a native marketplace    .      johnny had a theory about these marketplaces .  every spy film and every adventure had a chase through the native marketplace  with lots of humorous rickshaws crashing into stalls and tables being knocked over and chickens squawking  and the theory was  it was the same marketplace every time .  it always looked the same .  there was probably a stallholder somewhere who was getting very fed up with it    .   anyway     he   d take his polaroid camera .   he went to bed early with the camera strap wound around his wrist .  cameras didn   t dream .       the ship smelled human .   there were no alarms  no hissing noises .   i   m back  thought johnny .   and there was the screewee fleet  spread out across the sky behind him .   and the camera  with its strap wrapped around his arm .  he untangled it quickly and took a photo of the fleet .  it whirred out of the machine after a few seconds .  he held it under his armpit for a moment  and it gradually faded up .  yep .  the fleet .  if he could get it back  he   d have proof     there was a red light flashing beside the screen on the console .  someone wanted to talk to him .  he flicked the switch .      we saw your ship explode     came the voice of the captain .  the screen crackled for a moment and then showed her face .  it looked concerned .     and then it   returned again .  you are alive .         yes     said johnny  and then added     i think so .         excuse me .  i must ask .  what happens to you .         what .         when you   go .      johnny thought  what do i tell her .  i stay awake in school .  i stay in my room a lot .  i hang out with wobbler and the others .  we hang around in the mall  or in the park  or in one another   s houses  although not my house at the moment because of trying times  and say things like    i   m totally splanked    even though we   re not sure what they mean .  sometimes we go to the movies .  we live in blackbury  most excellent city of cool .   i must have the most boring life in the entire universe .  i expect there   s blobs living under rocks on neptune that have a more interesting life than me    .      it   d be too hard to explain     he said .     i        there was a ping from the radar .      i have to go     he said  feeling a bit relieved .  facing someone else in mortal combat was better than trying to tell a giant newt about trying times .   there was a ship coming in fast .  it didn   t seem to notice him .  its screen must be full of screewee ships .   it was in the middle of his targeting grid .  around him  the starship hummed .  he could feel the power under his thumb .  press the button and a million volts or amps or something of white hot laser power would crackle out and     his thumb trembled .   it didn   t seem to want to move .   but no one dies .  he told himself .  there   s just someone somewhere sitting in their room in front of a computer .  that   s what it looks like to them .  it   s all just something on a screen .  no one really dies .   i can fire right into his retrotubes with pinpoint precision .   no one really dies .   the ship roared past him and onward  toward the fleet .   on the radar screen he saw two white dots  which meant that it had fired a couple of missiles .  they streaked toward one of the smaller screewee ships  with the attacker close behind them  firing as he went .   the screewee burst into flame .  johnny knew you shouldn   t be able to hear sound in space  but he did hear it   a long  low rumble  washing across the stars .   the human ship turned in a long curve and came back for another run .   the captain   s face appeared on the screen .      we have surrendered .  this must not be allowed .         i   m sorry  i           you must stop this now .      johnny let his own ship accelerate while he tried to adjust the microphone .      game player .  game player .  stop now .  stop now or        or what  he thought   or i   ll shout    stop    again .   he raised his thumb over the fire button  took aim at the intruder        please .  i mean it .      it was plunging on toward another ship  taking no notice of him .      all right  then        blinding blue light flashed across his vision .  he shut his eyes and still the light was there  purple in the darkness .  when he opened them again  the ship ahead of him was just an expanding cloud of glittering dust .   he turned in his seat .  the captain   s ship was right behind him .  he could see its guns glowing .   they never did this in the game .  they had much more firepower than you  but they used it stupidly .  it had to be like that .  you could only win against hundreds of alien ships if they had the same grasp of gunnery techniques as the common cucumber .   this time  every gun had fired at exactly the same time .   the captain   s face appeared on the screen .      i am sorry .         what .  what happened .         it will not happen again  i promise you .         what happened .      there was silence .  the captain appeared to be looking at something beyond the camera range .      there was an unauthorized firing     she said .     those responsible will be dealt with .         i was going after that ship     said johnny uncertainly .      yes .  it is to be hoped that another time you can do so before one of my ships is destroyed .         i   m sorry .  i   i didn   t want to fire .  it   s not easy  shooting another ship .         how strange that a human should say that .  clearly the space invaders shot themselves .         what do you mean .         were they doing you any harm .         look  you   ve got the wrong idea     said johnny .     we   re not really like that .         excuse me .  things appear differently from where i sit .      it would have been better if she had shouted  but she didn   t .  johnny could have dealt with it if she had been angry .  instead  she just sounded tired and sad .  it was the same tone of voice in which she   d spoken about the space invaders wreckage .   but he found he was quite angry too .   she couldn   t be talking about him .   he picked spiders out of the bath  even if they   d got soapy and didn   t have much of a chance .  yet she   d looked at him as if he was genghis the hun or someone   after blowing a ship into bits .      i didn   t ask for this  you know .  i was just playing a game .  i   ve got problems of my own .  i ought to be getting a good night   s sleep .  that   s very important at my age .  why me .         why not .         well  i don   t see why i should have to be told how nasty we are .  you shoot at us as well .         self defense .         no .  often you shoot first .         with humans  we have often found it essential to get our self defense in as soon as possible .         well  i don   t like it .  find someone else .      he switched off the screen and turned his ship away from the fleet .  he half expected the captain to send some fighters after him  but she did not .  she didn   t do anything .   soon the fleet was merely a large collection of yellow dots on the radar screen .   hah .  well .   they could find their own way home .  it wasn   t as if they needed him anymore .  the game was ruined .  who was going to spend hours looking at stars .  they   d have to manage without him .   serve them right .  he was doing things for them  and they were only newts .   occasionally a star went past .  you didn   t get stars going past in real space .  but they had to put them in computer games so that people didn   t think they   d got something like wobbler   s journey to alpha centauri .   interesting point .  where was he going .   the radar screen went bing .   there were ships heading toward him .  the dots were green .  that meant    friendly .     but the missiles streaking ahead of them didn   t look friendly at all .   hang on  hang on   what color was he on their radar .   that was important .  friendly ships were green and enemy ships were yellow .  he was a starship .  a human starship .   but on the other hand  he   d been on the same side as the screewee  so he might show up     he grabbed the microphone and got as far as    um  i       before the rest of the sentence was spread out  very thin  very small  against the stars .       he woke up .   it was     .   his throat felt cold .   he wondered why people made such a fuss about dreams .  dream boat .  dream river .  dream a little dream .  but when you got right down to it  dreams were often horrible  and they felt real .  dreams always started out well and then they went wrong  no matter what you did .  you couldn   t trust dreams .   and he   d left the alarm set  even though this was sunday and there was nothing to do on a sunday .  no one else would be up for hours .  it   d be a couple of hours even before bigmac   s brother delivered the paper  or at least delivered the wrong paper .  and he was all stiff from sitting at the computer  which wasn   t switched on .   maybe tonight he   d put some stuff on the floor to wake him up .   he went back to bed and switched the blanket on .   he stared at the ceiling for a while .  there was still a model space shuttle up there .  but one of the two bits of string had come away from the thumbtack  so it hung down in a permanent nosedive .   there was something in the bed .  he fumbled under the covers and pulled out his camera .   which meant     some more fumbling found a rectangle of shiny paper .   he looked at it .   well  yes .  huh .  what   d he expect .   he got up again and turned the computer on  then lay in bed so that he could watch the screen .  still more fake stars drifted past .   maybe other people were doing this too .  all over the country .  all over the world  maybe .  maybe not every computer showed the same piece of game space  so some people were closer to the fleet than others .  or maybe some people were just persistent  like wobbler  and wouldn   t be beaten .   you saw people like that in j j software sometimes .  they   d take a shot at whatever new game old patel had put on the machine  get blown to bits or eaten or whatever  which was what happened to you on your first time  and then you couldn   t get rid of them with a crowbar .  you learned a bit more  and then you died .  that   s how games worked .  people got worked up .  they had to beat some game  in the same way that wobbler would spend weeks trying to beat a program .  some people took it personally when they were blown to bits .   so the ships he   d seen  then  were the ones that wouldn   t give up .   but the captain hadn   t been at all grateful to him .  it wasn   t fair  making him feel like some kind of monster .  as if he   d like shooting anyone in cold blood .  they   d just totally destroyed another ship .  ok  it was attacking them after they had surrendered  but after all it was a only a game    .   except  of course  it wasn   t game to the screewee .   and they   d surrendered .   that didn   t make them his responsibility  did it .  not the whole time .  it had been ok for a little while  but he was getting tired of it .   he padded downstairs in the darkened house and pulled the encyclopedia off its shelf under the video player .  it had been bought last year from a man at the door  who   d persuaded johnny   s father that it was a good encyclopedia because it had a lot of color pictures in it .  it did have a lot of color pictures in it .  you could grow up knowing what everything looked like  if you didn   t mind not knowing much about what it was .   after ten minutes with the index he got as far as prisoners of war  and eventually to the geneva convention .  it wasn   t something you could illustrate with big colored pictures  so there wasn   t much about it  but what there was he read with interest .   it was amazing .   he   d always thought that prisoners were  well  prisoners   you hadn   t actually killed them  so they ought to think themselves lucky .  but it turned out that you had to give them the same food as your own soldiers  and look after them and generally keep them safe .  even if they   d just bombed a whole city  you had to help them out of their crashed plane  give them medicine  and treat them properly .   johnny stared at the page .  it was weird .  the people who   d written the encyclopedia   it said inside the cover that they were universal wonder knowledge data printing  inc .   of power cable  nebraska   had shoved in all these pictures of parrots and stuff because they were the natural wonders of the world  when what was really strange was that human beings had come up with an idea like this .  it was like finding a tiny bit of the middle ages in the middle of all the missiles and things .   johnny knew about the middle ages because of doing his essay on    what it felt like to be a peasant in the middle ages .     when a knight fell off his horse in battle  the other side weren   t allowed to open him up with a can opener and torture him  but had to look after him and send him back home after a while  although they were allowed to charge for the service .   on the whole  the screewee were letting him off lightly .  according to the geneva convention  he ought to be feeding all of them as well .   he put the book back and turned the television on .   that was odd .  someone was complaining that the enemy were putting prisoners of war in buildings that might be bombed  so that they could be bombed by their own side .  that was a barbaric thing  said the man .  everyone else in the studio agreed .   so did johnny  in a way .  but he wondered how he would explain something like this to the captain .  everything made sense a bit at a time .  it was just when you tried to think of it all at once that it came out wrong .   there was too much war on television now .  he felt it was time to start showing something else .   he went out into the kitchen and made himself some toast  and then tried to scrape the burned bits off quietly so as not to wake people up .  he took the toast and the encyclopedia upstairs and got back into bed .   to pass the time  he read some more about switzerland  which was where geneva was .  every man in the country had to do army training and keep a gun at home  it said .  but switzerland never fought anyone .  perhaps that made sense somewhere .  and what the country used to be known for was designing intricate and ingenious mechanical masterpieces that made a little wooden bird come out and go cuckoo .   after a while he dozed off and didn   t dream at all .   on the screen the fake stars drifted by .  after an hour or so a yellow dot appeared in the very center .  after another hour it grew slightly bigger  enough to be seen as a cluster of smaller yellow dots .   then johnny   s mother  who had come to see where he was  tucked him in and switched it off .       if not you  who else .      there was a constant smell of smoke and burned plastic in the ship now  the captain noticed .  the air conditioners couldn   t get rid of it anymore .  some of the smoke and burned plastic was the air conditioners .   she could feel the eyes of her officers on her .  she didn   t know how many of them she could count on .  she got the feeling that she wasn   t very popular .   she looked up into the eyes of the gunnery officer .      you disobeyed my orders     she repeated .   the gunnery officer looked around the control room with an air of injured innocence .      but we were being attacked     he said .     they fired the first shots .         i said that we would not fire     said the captain  trying to ignore the background murmur of agreement .     i gave my word to the chosen one .  he was about to fire .         but he did not     said the gunnery officer .     he merely watched .         he was about to fire .         about is too late .  the tanker kreewhea is destroyed .  along with half our campaign provisions  i should add   captain     said the gunnery officer .      nevertheless  an order was directly disobeyed .         i cannot believe this .  why can   t we fight .      the captain pointed out of the window .  the fleet was passing several more ships of the ancient space invader race .      they fought     she said .     endlessly .  and look at them now .  and they were only the first .  remember what happened to the vortiroids .  and the meggazzoids .  and the glaxoticon .  do you want to be like them .         hah .  they were primitive .  very low resolution .         but there were many of them .  and they still died .         if we are going to die  i for one would rather die fighting     said the gunnery officer .  this time the murmur was a lot louder .      you would still be dead     said the captain .   she thought  there   ll be a mutiny if i shoot him or imprison him .  i can   t fine him because none of us have been paid .  i can   t confine him to his quarters because   she hated to think this   we might need him  at the end .      you are severely reprimanded     she said .   the gunnery officer smirked .      it will go on your record     the captain added .      since we will not escape alive       the gunnery officer began .      that is my responsibility     said the captain .     you are dismissed .      the gunnery officer glared at her .      when we get home           oh .     said the captain .     now you think we will get home .          by early evening johnny   s temperature was a hundred and two  and he was suffering from what his mother called sunday night flu .  he was lying in the lovely warm glow that comes from knowing that  whatever happens  there   ll be no school tomorrow .   the backs of his eyeballs felt itchy .  the insides of his elbows felt hot .   it was what came of spending all his time in front of a computer  he   d been told  instead of in the healthy fresh air .  he couldn   t quite see this  even in his itchy eyeball state .  surely the fresh air would have been worse .  but in his experience being ill always came of whatever you   d been doing .  parents would probably manage to say it came of taking vitamins and wrapping up nice and warm .  he   d probably get an appointment down at the health center next friday  since they always liked you to be good and ill by the time you came  so that the doctors could be sure of what you   d got .   he could hear the tv downstairs .  he spent twenty minutes wondering whether to get out of bed to switch on his old one  but when he moved there were purple blurs in front of his eyes and a goioioing hum in his ears .   he must have managed it  though  because next time he looked  it was on  and the colors were much better than usual .  there were the newscasters   the black one and the one who looked like his glasses fitted under his skin instead of over the top   and there was the studio  just like normal .   except that it had the words    screewee war    in the corner  where there were usually words like    budget shock    or    euro summit .     he couldn   t hear what people were saying  but the screen switched to a map of space .  it was black .  that was the point of space .  it was just infinity  huge and black with one dot in it that was everything else .   there was one stubby red arrow in the middle of the blackness .  several dozen blue ones were heading toward it from the edge of the map .  in one corner of the map was a photo of a man talking into a phone .   hang on  thought johnny .  i   m almost certain there wasn   t a bbc reporter with the screewees .  they   d have said .  probably there isn   t even a cnn one .   he still wasn   t getting any sound  but he didn   t really need any .  it was obvious that humans were closing in on the fleet .   the scene changed .  now it showed a tent somewhere  and there was the huge man standing in front of another copy of the map .   this time the sound came up .  he was saying        that johnny .  he   s no fighter .  he   s no politician .  he goes home when the going gets tough .  he runs out on his obligations .  but apart from that  hey  he   s a real nice kid    .         that   s not true .     johnny shouted .      it isn   t .     said a voice behind him .   he didn   t look around immediately .  by the sound of it  the voice had come from his chair .  and that was much more impossible than the screewee being on television .  no one could sit in that chair .  it was full of old t shirts and books and supper plates and junk .  there was a deep sock layer and possibly the lost strawberry yogurt .  no one could sit down there without special equipment .   the captain was  though .  she seemed quite at home .   he   d only ever seen her face on the screen .  now he could see that she was about six feet long  but quite thin   more like a fat snake with legs than an alligator or a newt .  she had two thick  heavy pairs of legs about halfway down  and two pairs of thinner ones at the top  on a set of very complicated shoulders .  most of her was covered in a brown overall  the bits that stuck out   her head  all eight hands or feet  and most of her tail   were a yellow bronze  and covered in very small scales .      if you parked out in the street  mrs .  cannock opposite will be really mad     johnny heard himself say .     she carries on about my dad leaving his car parked out in the street and it   s not even a thousand yards long .  so this is a hallucination  isn   t it .         of course it is     said the captain .     i   m not sure that real space and game space are connected  except in your head .         i saw this film once where spaceships could go anywhere in the universe through wormholes in space     said johnny .     that means i   ve got a wormhole in my head .      the captain shrugged  which was a very interesting sight in a being with four arms .      watch this     she said .     this is very impressive .  i expect this will be shown a lot .      she pointed at the screen .   it showed stars  and a dot in the distance .  it got bigger very quickly .      i think i know that     said johnny .     it   s one of your ships .  the sort you get on level seven  isn   t it .         the type  i think  will not matter for long     said the captain quietly .   the ship was heading away from the camera .  its rocket exhausts got larger and larger .  the camera seemed to be mounted on a        missile .     said johnny weakly .   the screen went blank .   johnny thought of the dead space invader armada  turning over and over in the frosty emptiness between the game stars .      i don   t want to know about it     said johnny .     i don   t want you to tell me how many screewee there were on board .  i don   t want you to tell me what happ           no     said the captain     i expect you don   t .         it   s not my fault .  i can   t help what people are like .         of course not .      the captain had a nasty way of talking in a reasonable voice .      we are under attack     she said .     humans are attacking us .  even though we have surrendered .         yes  but you only surrendered to me     said johnny .     i   m just me .  it   s not like surrendering to a government or something .  i   m not important .         on the contrary     said the screewee     you   re the savior of civilization .  you   re all that stands between your world and certain oblivion .  you are the last hope .         but that   s not   real .  that   s just what it says at the start of the game .         and you did not believe it .         look  it always says something like that .         only you can save mankind .     said the captain .      yes  but it   s not really true .         if not you  then who else .         look     said johnny     i have saved mankind .  in the game  anyway .  there aren   t any screewee attacking anymore .  people have to play it for hours to find any .      the captain smiled .  the shrug had been impressive .  but the captain   s mouth was    inches long .      you humans are strange     she said .     you are warlike .  but you make rules .  rules of war .         um .  i think we don   t always obey all those rules     said johnny .   another four armed shrug .      does that matter .  even to have made such rules   you think all of life is a game .      the captain pulled a small piece of silvery paper out of a pocket of her overall .      your attackers have left us too short of food .  so  by your rules     she said     i must ask for the following  fifteen tons of pressed wheat extractions treated with sucrose  ten thousand quarts of cold bovine lactation  twenty five tons of the baked wheat extraction containing grilled bovine flesh and trace ingredients  along with chopped and fried tubers and fried and corn extract coated rings of vegetables of the allium family  one ton of crushed mustard seeds mixed with water and permitted additives  three tons of exploded corn kernels coated with lactic derivation  ten thousand quarts of colored water containing sucrose and trace elements  fifteen tons of prepared and fermented wheat extract in vegetable juice  one thousand tons of soured lactic acid flavored with fruit extract .  daily .  thank you .         what .         the food of your fighting men     explained the captain .      doesn   t sound like food .         you are right     said the captain .     it is disgustingly lacking in fresh vegetables and dangerously high in carbohydrates and saturated fats .  however  it appears that this is what you eat .         me .  i don   t even know what that stuff is .  what are pressed wheat extractions treated with sucrose .         it said    snappiflakes    on the package     said the captain .      soured lactic acid .         you had a banana yogurt .      johnny   s lips moved as he tried to work this out .      the grilled bovine flesh and all that stuff .         a hamburger and fries with fried onion rings .      johnny tried to sit up .      are you saying that i   ve got to go down to the shops and get takeout jumboburgers for an entire alien space fleet .         not exactly .         i should think not           my chief engineer wants a bucket of chicken lumps .         what do screewee usually eat .         normally we eat a kind of waterweed .  it contains a perfect balance of vitamins  minerals  and trace elements to ensure a healthy growth of scale and crest .         then why           but  as you would put it  it tastes like poo .         oh .      the captain stood up .  it was a beautiful movement .  the screewee body had no angles in it  apart from the elbows and knees  she seemed to be able to bend wherever she wanted .      and now i must return     she said .     i hope your attack of minor germs will shortly be over .  i could only wish that my attack of human beings was as easily cured .         why aren   t you fighting back .     said johnny .     i know you can .         no .  you are wrong .  we have surrendered .         yes  but           we will not fire on human ships .  sooner or later  it has to stop .  we will run instead .  someone gave us safe conduct .      the worst bit was that she didn   t raise her voice  or accuse him of anything .  she just made statements .  big  horrible statements .      all right     said johnny  in a dull voice     but i know it   s not real .  i   ve got the flu .  you get mild hallucinations when you get the flu .  everyone knows that .  i remember i was ill once and all the floppy bunnies on the wallpaper started dancing about .  this is like that .  you can   t really know about this stuff .  you   re just in my head .         what difference does that make .     said the captain .  she stepped out through the wall  and then poked her head back into the room .      remember     she said     only you can save mankind .         and i said i already           screewee is only the human name for us     said the captain .     have you ever wondered what the screewee word for screewee is .          he must have slept  but he didn   t dream .  he woke up in the middle of the afternoon .   a huge ball of incandescent nuclear fire  heated to millions of degrees  was shining brightly in the sky .   the house was empty .  his mother had left him a breakfast tray  which was to say that she   d put together a new snappiflakes box  a spoon  a bowl and a note saying    milk in fridge .     she   d also put her office phone number on the bottom of the note .  he knew what it was anyway  but sometimes she used the phone number like other people would use a band aid .   he opened the box and fished around inside .  the alien was in a hygienic little paper bag .  it was yellow and in fact did look a bit like the captain  if you almost shut your eyes .   he wandered aimlessly through the rooms .  there was never anything any good on television in the middle of the day .  it was all women talking to one another on sofas .  he sneaked a look out into the street  just in case there were half mile long rocket exhaust burns .  and then he went back upstairs and sat and stared at the silent computer .   ok .   so   you switch on .  and there   s the game .  somehow it felt worse thinking about playing it by just sitting in front of it now .   on the other hand  it was daytime  so most people would be at school or at least keeping a low profile somewhere .  johnny wasn   t quite certain about game time and real time  but maybe the attacks stopped when people had to go to school .  but no  there were probably people playing it in america or australia or somewhere .   besides  when you died in your sleep  you woke up  so what happened now if you died while you were awake .   but the screewee were getting slaughtered out there .  or in there .  or in here .   the captain was stupid not to fire back .   his hand switched on the computer without his mind really being aware of it .   the game logo appeared .  the music started up .  the same old message scrolled up the screen .  he knew it by heart .  savior of civilization .  certain oblivion .   only you can save mankind .   if not you  who else .   he blinked .  the message had scrolled off the top of the screen .  he couldn   t have imagined that extra last line   could he .   and then the same old stars .   he didn   t touch the keyboard or the joystick .  he wasn   t certain what direction he should be going in .  on the whole  straight ahead seemed best .  for hours .   he glanced at the clock .  it was just past four o   clock .  people would be home from school now .  they   d be watching cobbers and she   ll be apples and moonee ponds .  bigmac would be watching with his mouth open at his brother   s .  wobbler would be watching while trying to rob some other poor computer games    writer of his just rewards .  yo less probably wouldn   t be paying much attention  exactly  it   d just be on while he did his homework .  yo less always did his homework when he got home from school and didn   t pay attention to anything else until it had been finished to his satisfaction .  but everyone watched cobbers .   except johnny  today .   he felt vaguely proud of that .  the television was off .  he had other things to do .   somewhere in the last ten minutes he   d made a decision .  he wasn   t sure exactly what it was  but he   d made it .  so he had to see it through .  whatever it was .   he went to the bathroom and found the thermometer .  it was an electronic one that his mother had bought from a catalogue  and it also told the time .  everything in the catalogue had a digital clock built in .  even the golf umbrella that doubled as a handy picnic table .  even the thing for getting fluff out of socks .      away with not being able to know what the time is all the time blues     said johnny vaguely  and stuck the thermometer in his mouth for the required twenty seconds .   his temperature was    .      .   no wonder he felt cold .   he went back to bed with the thermometer still in his mouth and looked at the screen again .   still just stars .   the rest of them would probably be down at the mall now  unless yo less was trying for an a  with his homework .  hanging out .  waiting for another day to end .   he squinted at the thermometer .  it read    .      .   still nothing but stars on the screen         chicken lumps in space     he woke up .  the familiar smell of the starship tickled his nose .  he cast his eyes over the control panel .  he was getting a bit more familiar with it now .   right .  so he was back in real life again .  when he got back to   when he got back to   he   d have to have a word with the medics about this odd recurring dream that he was a boy in     no .  he thought .  i   m me .  not a pilot in a computer game .  if i start thinking like that  then i   ll really die .  got to take charge .   then he noticed the other ships on the screen .  he was still a long way from the fleet  of course .  but there were three other ships spread out neatly behind him  in convoy .  they were bigger and fatter than his  and insofar as it was possible to do this in space  they seemed to wallow rather than fly .   he hit the communications button .  a plump face appeared on the screen .      wobbler .         johnny .         what are you doing in my head .      the on screen wobbler looked around .      well  according to this little panel riveted on the control thingy  i   m flying a class three light tanker .  wow .  is it normally like this inside your head .         i   m not sure     said johnny .  by the main communication screen was another switch saying    conference facility .     he had a feeling he knew what it did .   sure enough  when he pressed it  wobbler   s face drifted to the top left hand corner of the screen .  yo less   s face appeared in the opposite corner  with johnny   s own head above it .  the other corner stayed blank .   johnny tapped a button .      bigmac .     he said .     yo less .      bigmac   s face appeared in the blank .  he appeared to be wiping his mouth .      checking the cargo .     said johnny sarcastically .      it   s full of hamburgers .     said bigmac  in a voice like a good monk who   s just arrived in heaven and found that all the sins of the flesh are allowed .     boxes and boxes of hamburgers .  i mean millions .  with fries .  and one bucket of chicken lumps  it says here .         it says on this clipboard     said yo less     that i   m flying a lot of prepared corn and wheat products .  shall i go and see what they are .         ok     said johnny .     then that means you   re driving the milk tanker  wobbler .         oh  yes .  that   s right .  bigmac gets burgers  wobbler gets boring milk     moaned wobbler .   yo less   s face reappeared .      back there it   s breakfast cereals  mainly     he said .     in giant jumbo mega civilization sized boxes .         then bigmac   d better bring his ship between you and wobbler     said johnny briskly .     we can   t risk a collision .         snap  crackle  fababababboom .     said bigmac .      will we remember this when we wake up .     said wobbler .      how can we .     said yo less .     we   re not dreaming .         ok .  ok .  um .  so will we remember this when he wakes up .         i don   t think so .  i think we   re only here as projections from his own subconscious mind     said yo less .     he   s just dreaming us .         you mean we   re not real .     said bigmac .      i   m not sure if i   m real     said johnny .      it feels real     said wobbler .     smells real  too .         tastes real     said bigmac .      looks real     said yo less .     but he   s only imagining we   re here .  it   s not really us .  just the us that   s inside his head .      don   t ask me  thought johnny .  you were always best at this stuff .      and i   ve just worked out  right     said yo less     that if we send in the box tops from every single pack back there  we can get six thousand sets of saucepans  ok .  and twenty thousand books of football stickers and fifty seven thousand chances to win a stylish five door ford taurus .          the four ships lumbered on toward the distant fleet .  johnny   s starship could easily outdistance the tankers  so he flew in wide circles around them  watching the radar screen .   there was an occasional zip and sizzle from wobbler   s tanker .  he was trying to take its computer apart  just in case there were any design innovations johnny might remember when he woke up .   ships appeared on the screen .  there was the big dot of the fleet and  around the edges of the screen  the green dots of the game players .   a thought occurred to him .      yo less .         yeah .         have those things got any guns .         er   what do they look like .         there   s probably a red button on the joystick .         not got one on mine .         what about you  wobbler .  bigmac .         nope .         which one   s the joystick .     said bigmac .      it   s the thing you   re steering with .         yeah  wipe the mustard off and have a look     said yo less .      nothing on it     said bigmac .   unarmed  thought johnny .  and slow .  one hit with a missile and wobbler is sitting inside the biggest cheese in the universe .  what happens to people in my dream .   why does it always go wrong .      i   ll just go on ahead     he said  and pressed the fast button .   there were three players attacking the screewee fleet .  it soon became two  johnny had one in his sights all the way in  curving away through the smoke ring of the explosion and heading for the next attacker so fast that he was only just behind his own missile .   it was going after the captain   s ship  and the player wasn   t paying attention to his radar .  another explosion  already behind johnny as he looked for the third player .   johnny realized he wasn   t thinking about it .  his eyes and hands were doing all the work .  he was just watching from inside .   the third player had spotted the tankers .  it saw him  turned  and actually managed to get some shots away .   oh  no .  johnny   s mind whirred like a machine  judging speed and distance     he felt the ship buck under him  but he held it steady until the crosshairs merged .   then he pressed his thumb down until a beeping sound told him he hadn   t got anything more to fire .   after a while the red mist cleared .  he found thoughts slinking back into his mind again .  they moved slowly  uncertain of where they were  like people drifting back into a bombed city  picking through rubble  trying to find the old familiar shapes .   there was a metallic taste in his mouth .  his elbow ached   he must have banged it on something during the turn .   he thought  no wonder we make rules .  the captain thinks it   s strange  but we don   t .  we know what we   d be like if we didn   t have rules .   a light flashed by the communication screen .  someone wanted to talk to him .  he flicked a switch .   the face of the captain appeared .      ah  johnny .  what an efficient technique .         yes .  but i had to           of course .  and i see you have brought some friends .         you said you needed food .         even more so now .  that last attack was severe .         aren   t you firing at all .         no .  we have surrendered  i remind you .  besides  we must not stop .  some of us at least will reach the border .         border .     said johnny .     i thought you were going to a planet .         we must cross the border first .  beyond the border  we are safe .  even you cannot follow us .  if we fight  all of us die .  if we run  some of us live .         i don   t think humans can think like that     said johnny .  he glanced out of the cockpit .  the tankers were getting nearer .      you are mammals .  fast .  hot blooded .  we are amphibians .  cold blooded .  slow .  logical .  some of us will get across .  we breed fast .  to us  it makes sense .  to me  it makes sense .      the captain   s image moved to a corner of the screen .  wobbler  bigmac  and yo less appeared in the other three quarters .      that was brilliant shooting     said bigmac .     when i   m in the army           there   s a frog on my screen     said wobbler .      it   s   she   s the captain     said johnny .      a woman in charge .     said yo less .      no wonder the aliens always lose     said wobbler .     you should see the side of my mum   s car .         um .  she can hear you  i think .  don   t use sexist language     said johnny .   the captain smiled .      i invite your comrades to unload their welcome cargoes     she said .   they found out how to do it eventually .  the whole of the middle of the tankers came away as one unit .  small screewee ships  not much more than a seat and a pilot   s bubble and a motor  nudged them into the holds of the biggest ships .  without them  the tankers were just a cockpit and engine and a big empty network of girders .   johnny watched the tank from yo less   s ship drift gently through the hatch of the captain   s ship .      er   if when you  you know   you   re pouring them out of the box     he said     and you sort of find something plastic falls into your bowl   well  it   s just a joke .  it   s not on purpose .         thank you .         if you save all the box tops  you could probably win a ford taurus     said yo less .  there was a slight tremble in his voice as he tried to sound like someone who talked to aliens every day .     you could get your photo in competitor   s journal     he added .      that would be very useful .  some of the corridors in this ship are very long .         don   t be daft     said bigmac .     he   d   she   d never get spare parts .         really .  in that case we shall have to go for the six thousand sets of saucepans     said the captain .      how do we get back .     said wobbler .      how did you get here .      wobbler frowned .      how did we get here .     he said .     one minute i was   was   and then here i was .  here we were .         come to that  where did all the milk and burgers come from .     said bigmac .      it   s all right     said yo less .     i told you .  we   re not really here anyway .  we   re just anxiety projections .  i read about it in a book .         that   s a relief  then     said wobbler .     that   s worth knowing when you   re a billion miles out in space .  anyway   so how do we get back .         i don   t know     said johnny .     i generally do it by dying .         is there some other way .     said yo less  after a long  thoughtful pause .      i don   t think there is for me .  this is game space .  you have to die to get out     said johnny .     i think you can probably just fly back .  i   m not definitely sure any harm can come to you .  you   re not playing   in your heads  i mean .         well       wobbler began .      but i   d go soon  if i was you     said johnny .     before some more players arrive .         we   d stay and help     said wobbler     but there   s no guns on these things  you see .      he sounded worried .      yeah .  silly of me not to have dreamed of any     said johnny kindly .      yo less might be right and we   re just stuff in your head     said wobbler .     but even people in dreams don   t want to die  i expect .         right .         you going to be in school tomorrow .         might be .         right .  well  then   chow .         see you .         you hang in there  right  johnny .     said yo less anxiously .      i   ll try to .         yeah  give them aliens hell  my man .     said bigmac  as the tankers turned .   johnny could hear them still talking as the three ships accelerated away .      that was a foe par  bigmac .  johnny   s on the aliens    side .         what .  you mean they   re on our side .         no  they   re on their side .  and so is he .         whose side are we on  then .         we   re on his side .         oh .  right .  er .  yo less .         what .         so who   s on our side .         eh .  he is  i suppose .         so is there anyone on the other side .      the ships became dots on the radar  and then vanished off the edge of the screen .   where to  johnny had no idea .   i may have wished them here  or dreamed them  or something .  but i mustn   t do it again .  maybe they   re not really here  but i don   t want to see my friends die .  i don   t want to see anybody die .   at least i   m on my side .   he scanned the sky .  after a while the captain said     you are not leaving .         not yet .         until you die  you mean .      johnny shrugged .      it   s the only way out     he said .     fight until you die .  that   s how all games go .  you just hope you can get a bit farther each time .      there were still no more attackers on the screen .  the fleet looked as if it wasn   t moving  but it had built up quite a speed .  every second was taking it farther from game space .  every second meant that fewer and fewer players would have the patience or determination to go on looking for it .   he helped himself to some of the horrible nourishing soup from its spigot .      johnny .         yes .         i believe i upset you some time ago by suggesting that humans are bloodthirsty and dangerous .         well .  yes .  a bit .         in that case   i would like to say   i am grateful .         i don   t understand .         that you are on our side .         yes  but i   m not bloodthirsty .         then i think perhaps a little while ago someone else must have been flying your ship .         no .  it   s hard to explain it to you     said johnny .  first of all  he   d have to be able to explain it to himself .      shall i embark upon a less troubling topic of conversation .         you don   t have to     said johnny .     i mean  you   re in charge .  you must have things to do .         oh  spaceships fly themselves     said the captain .     they keep going until they hit things .  there is little to do .  tend the wounded and so on .  i seldom have a chance to talk to humans .  so   what is sexist .         what .         it was a word you used .         oh  that .  it just means you should treat people as people and  you know   not just assume girls can   t do stuff .  we got a talk about it at school .  there   s lots of stuff most girls can   t do  but you   ve got to pretend they can  so that more of them will .  that   s all of it  really .         presumably there   s  uh  stuff boys can   t do .         oh  yeah .  but that   s just girls    stuff     said johnny .     anyway  some girls go and become engineers and things  so they can do proper stuff if they want .         transcend the limitations of their sex .  outdo the other sex  even .  yes .  it is much the same with us .  some individuals show an awe inspiring desire to succeed  to make a career in a field not traditionally considered to be appropriate to their gender .         you  you mean     said johnny .      i was referring to the gunnery officer .         but he   s a man   i mean  a male .         yes .  traditionally  screewee warriors are female .  they are more inclined to fight .  our ancestors used to have to fight to protect their breeding pond .  the males do not do battle .  but in his case        a speck appeared on the radar .   johnny put down his cup and watched it carefully .   normally  players headed straight for the fleet .  this one didn   t .  it hovered right on the edge of the screen and stayed there  keeping pace with the screewee ships .   after a while  another dot appeared from the same direction  and kept on coming .   this one at least looked like just another player .   there was a nasty equation at the back of johnny   s mind .  it concerned missiles .  there were the six missiles per level in only you can save mankind .  once you   d fired them  that was it .  so the longer he stayed alive  the less he had to fight with .  but all the attacking players would have six missiles each .  he   d only got four now .  when they were gone  it   d just be guns .  one missile in the right place would blow him up .  losing was kind of built in  in the circumstances .   the attacker came on .  but johnny kept finding his gaze creeping to the dot at the edge of the screen .  somehow it had a watchful look  like a shark trailing a leaky airbed .   he switched on the communicator .      attacking ship .  attacking ship .  stop now .      they can   t speak  johnny thought .  they   re only a player   they   re not in the game .  they can   t speak and they can   t listen .   he found he   d automatically targeted a missile on the approaching dot .  but that couldn   t be the only way .  sooner or later you had to talk  even if it was only because you   d run out of things to throw .   the attacker fired a missile .  it streaked past johnny and away  heading on into empty space .   not real  johnny thought .  you have to think they   re not real .  otherwise you can   t do it .      attacking ship .  this is your last chance .  look  i mean it .      he pressed the button .  the ship juddered slightly as a missile took off .  the attacker was moving fast .  so was the missile .  they met and became an expanding red cloud .  it drifted around johnny   s ship like a smoke ring .   someone  somewhere  was blinking at their screen and probably swearing .  he hoped .   the dot was still on the edge of the screen .  it was irritating him  like an itch in a place he couldn   t scratch .  because that wasn   t how you were supposed to play .  you spotted some aliens and you shot at them .  that was what the game was supposed to be about .   lurking in the distance and just watching made him uneasy .  it looked like the kind of thing people would do if they were   well        taking it seriously .       the captain sat in front of her desk  watching the big screen .  she was chewing .  anything was better than waterweed  even   she looked at the box   even sugar frosted corn crackles in cold bovine lactation .  sweet and crunchy  but with odd hard bits in     she inserted a claw into her mouth and poked around among her teeth until she found the offending object .   she pulled it out and looked at it .   it was green  and had four arms .  most of them were holding some sort of weapon .   she wondered again what these things were .  the chief medical officer had suggested that they were  in fact  some sort of vermin that invaded food sources .  there was a theory among the crew that they were things to do with religion .  offerings to food gods  perhaps .   she put it carefully on one side of her desk .  in the right light  she thought  it looked a bit like the gunnery officer .   then she opened the little cage beside the bowl and let her birds out .   there had been things very like alligators among the screewee   s distant ancestors  and some habits had been handed down .  the captain opened her mouth fully  which made her lower and upper jaws move apart in a way that would make a human   s eyes water .   the birds hopped in and began to clean her teeth .  one of them found a small piece of plastic ray gun .       the watching ship was moving  still keeping at a great distance  traveling around the fleet in a wide circle .  it had watched one more attacker come in  johnny had got rid of this one with a missile and some shots  although a flashing red light on the panel was suggesting that something  somewhere  wasn   t working anymore .  probably those secondary pumps again .   he found he was turning the ship all the time to keep the distant dot in front of him .      johnny .      it was the captain .      yes .  are you watching it .         yes .  it is moving between us and the border .  it is in our direct line of flight now .         you can   t sort of steer around it .         there are more than three hundred ships in the fleet .  that may be difficult .         it seems to be waiting for something .  i   ll   i   ll risk going to have a look .      he let his ship overtake the fleet and run ahead of it  toward the distant dot .   it made no attempt to get out of his way .   it was a starship just like his own .  in fact  in a way   it was his starship .  after all  there was only one starship in the entire game  the one you flew to save mankind .  everyone was flying the same one   in a way .   it hung against the stars  as lifeless as a space invader .  johnny moved a bit closer  until he could see the cockpit and even the shape of a head inside .  it had a helmet on .  everyone did   it was on the cover of the box .  you wore a helmet in a starship .  he didn   t know why .  maybe the designers thought you were likely to fall off when you went around corners .   he tried the communicator again .      hello .  can you hear me .      there was nothing but the background hiss of the universe .      i   m pretty sure you can .  i   ve got a feeling about it .      the tiny blob of the helmet turned toward him .  you could no more see through the smoked glass of the helmet than you could through a pair of sunglasses from the outside  but he knew he was being stared at .      what are you waiting for .     said johnny .     look  i know you can hear me  i don   t want to have to        the other ship roared into life .  it accelerated toward the oncoming fleet on two lances of blue light .   johnny swore under his breath and kicked his own engines into life .  there was no hope of overtaking the attacker .  it had a head start  and a starfighter   s top speed was a starfighter   s top speed .   it was just out of gun range .  he raced along behind it .   ahead  he could see some of the big capital ships of the fleet maneuvering clumsily out of the way .  they spread out slowly  trying to avoid colliding with one another .  seen from the front  it was like watching the petals of a flower opening .   the attacker roared for the middle of the fleet .  then it rolled gently and fired six missiles  one after another .  a moment later  two of the small screewee fighters exploded and one of the larger ships spun around as it was hit .   the attacker was already heading for another fighter .  johnny had to admit it   it was beautiful flying .  he   d never realized before how badly most players flew .  they flew like people who lived on the ground   from right to left and up and down  woodenly .  like someone moving something on a screen  in fact .   but the attacker rolled and twisted like a swallow in flight .  and every turn brought another screewee ship under its guns .  even if they had been firing back  it wouldn   t have been hit  except by accident .  it pirouetted .   the captain   s face appeared on the screen .      you must stop this .         i   m trying .  i   m trying .  don   t you think i   m trying .      the attacker turned .  johnny hadn   t thought it was possible for a starship to skid  but this one did .  it paused just for a moment as its jets slowed it down  and then it accelerated back the way it had come .   right down his sights .      look  stop .     he shouted .  he had a missile ready .  why even bother to shout .  players couldn   t hear  they only saw the game on the screen        who are you .      it was a very clear voice  and very human .  the captain sounded as though she   d learned the language out of a book  but this voice was one that someone had really used since they were about one year old .      you can hear me .         get out of the way  stupid .      the two pilots stared at each other across a distance that was getting smaller very  very fast .   i   ve heard that before  johnny thought .  that voice .  you can hear all the punctuation    .   they didn   t crash   exactly .  there was a grinding noise as each starship scraped the length of the other  ripping off fins  ripping open tanks  and then spun drunkenly away .   the control panel in front of johnny became a mass of red lights .  there were cracks racing across the cockpit .      idiot .     screamed the radio .      it   s all right     said johnny urgently .     you just wake up        his ship exploded .       the dark tower     it was         by the thermometer .  time was different in game space .   no matter how often you died  you never got used to it .  it wasn   t as if you got better with pract     she   d heard him .  inside the game .   he sat up .   the screewee were inside the game because it was their world .  wobbler and the rest hadn   t really been in it  he was pretty sure he   d just dreamed them in because he needed someone to pilot the food tankers .   but he   d heard her in patel   s .  that ringing  sharp voice  which made it very clear that its owner thought everyone in the whole world was dim witted and had to be talked to like a baby or a foreigner .   on the screen  empty space rolled onward .   he had to find her .  apart from anything else  no one who flew like that should be allowed anywhere near the screewee .   wobbler   d probably know who she was .   he found the room moving around him when he stood up .  he probably really was ill  he thought .  well  not surprising .  what with trying times and stupid school and parents trying to be friends and now having to save an entire alien race instead of getting proper sleep  it wasn   t surprising .   he made it to the hall and took the phone off its base and brought it back upstairs .  he   d just extended the antenna when it rang .      um  hello   blackbury five five five nine eight zero who   s that speaking please .         is that you .  this is me .         oh .  hello  wobbler .         you ill or something .         flu .  look  wobbler           you seen the papers today .         no .  mum and dad take them to work with them .  wobbler           thing in the papers about gobi software .  hang on   says    no encounters of the twenty first kind .     that   s the headline .      johnny hesitated .      what does it say .     he asked  very cautiously .      what does    inundated    mean .            s like    overwhelmed        said johnny .      says that gobi software and computer game shops have been   inundated with complaints about only you can save mankind .  because they made that offer of five pounds if you shoot all the aliens  and it says people aren   t finding any aliens .  and gobi software is in trouble because of the trades descriptions act .  and they keep on using the word hacker     said wobbler in the sneering tones of one who knows what a hacker really is and knows that most journalists don   t .     and there   s a quote from al rampa  president of gobi .  he says they   re recalling all the games  and if you send back the original disks they   ll send you a voucher for their new game  dodge city      .  that got four stars in faazzzzaaap .      recalling the games        yes  but you haven   t got the original disks     said johnny .     you hardly ever have any original disks .         no  but i know the guy whose brother bought it     said wobbler happily .     so it was just a problem with the game  right .  you weren   t crazy after all .         i never said i was crazy     said johnny .      no  but   well  you know     said wobbler .  he sounded embarrassed .      wobbler .         yes .         you know that girl who was in patel   s .         oh  her .  what about her .         d   you know who she is .         she   s someone   s sister  i think .         whose .         goes to some kind of special school for the terminally clever .  she   s called kylie or krystal or one of those made up names .  what do you want to know for .         oh  nothing .  just because she complained about the game in patel   s  i suppose .  whose sister is she .         some guy called   oh   plonker .  yeah .  friend of bigmac   s .  you sure you   re all right .         yes .  fine .  cheers .         cheers .  you going to be in tomorrow .            spect so .         cheers .         cheers .          bigmac didn   t have a phone .  where bigmac lived  people hardly even got letters .  even muggers were frightened to go there .  people talked about the joshua n   clement housing block in the same way that they probably once talked about the black hole of calcutta or the spanish inquisition   s reception area .   the tower loomed all alone  black against the sky  like someone   s last tooth .   there wasn   t much else around the place .  there was a row of boarded up shops  but you could see where the fire had been .  and there was a pub made out of neon lights and red brick  it was called the jolly farmer .   the tower had won an award in       just before bits had started falling off .  it was always windy .  even on the calmest day  gales whistled icily through the concrete corridors .  the place was some kind of wind reservation .  if the joshua n   clement block had existed a few thousand years ago  people would have come from all over the country to sacrifice to the wind god .   johnny   s father called it rottweiler heights .  johnny could hear them barking as he walked up the stairs  the elevators had stopped working in       .  everyone in the tower seemed afraid  and mostly they seemed afraid of one another .   bigmac lived on the fourteenth floor  with his brother and his brother   s girlfriend and a pit bull called clint .  bigmac   s brother was reliably believed to be in the job of moving vcrs around in an informal way .   johnny knocked cautiously  hoping to be loud enough to be heard by the people but quiet enough to be missed by clint .  no such luck .  a wall of sound erupted from behind the door .   after a while there was the clink of a chain and the door opened a few inches .  a suspicious eye appeared at about the height an eye should be  while a few feet below there was a certain amount of confused activity as clint tried to get both eyes and his teeth into the same narrow crack .      yeah .         is bigmac in .         dunno .      johnny knew about this .  there were only four rooms in the flat .  bigmac   s family was huge and lived all over the town  and practically no member of it knew where any other member was until they were quite sure who was asking .      it   s me  johnny maxwell .  from school .      clint was trying to push a six inch wide head through a two inch wide hole .      oh  yeah .     johnny felt that he was being carefully surveyed .     he   s down the pub .  yeah .         oh  right     said johnny in what he hoped was a normal voice .     i mean  yeah .      bigmac was thirteen .  but the jolly farmer was reputed to serve anyone who didn   t actually turn up on a tricycle .   his way home led back past the pub anyway .  he agonized a bit about going in .  it was all right for bigmac .  bigmac had been born looking seventeen .  but bigmac turned out to be outside anyway  leaning against the hood of a car .  he had a couple of friends with him .  they watched johnny intently as he approached  and the one who had been nonchalantly fiddling with the car   s door handle stood up and glared .   johnny tried to swagger a bit .      yeah  johnny     said bigmac  in a vague kind of way .   he   s different here  johnny thought .  older and harder .   the other youths relaxed a little .  bigmac knew johnny .  that made him acceptable  for now .      don   t often see you up here     said bigmac .     you drinking now or what .      johnny got the feeling that asking for a coke would definitely be bad for his street credentials .  he decided to ignore the question .      i   m looking for plonker     he said .     wobbler said you know him .         what d   you want him for .     said bigmac .   on the wall in school  or down at the mall  bigmac wouldn   t have even asked .  but there were different rules here .  like  in school bigmac tried to hide how good he was at numbers  and up here he had to hide his ability to hold a normal conversation .   johnny saw a way through .      actually i   m looking for his sister     he said .   one of bigmac   s friends sniggered .   bigmac took johnny   s arm and led him a little way off .      what   d you come up here for .     he said .     you could   ve asked me tomorrow .         it   s   important .         bigmac .  you coming or what .      bigmac glanced over his shoulder .      can   t     he said .     got to sort out something else .      one of the kids said something to the other one  and they both laughed .  then they got into the car .  after a little while it started up  bumped up onto the pavement and off again  and then accelerated into the night .  they heard the tires screech as it turned the corner on the wrong side of the road .   bigmac relaxed .  suddenly he was a lot less tough  and a bit shorter  and more like the amiable not quite thicko johnny had always known .      didn   t you want to go with them .     asked johnny .      you   re a nerd  aren   t you     said bigmac  in a friendly enough voice .      wobbler says you have to say dweeb now  not nerd     said johnny .      i usually say loser .  come on  let   s go     said bigmac .        cos there   ll probably be some unhappy people around here pretty soon .     s their own fault for leaving a car here .         what .         dweeb .  you don   t know nothing about real life  you .         it   s just games     said johnny  half to himself .     all different sorts .  bigmac .      somewhere away in the distance a car horn wailed and was suddenly cut off .  bigmac stopped walking .  the breeze blew his t shirt against him  so    terminator    was superimposed on a chest that looked like a rake .      what .     he said .      look  have you ever wondered what   s real and what isn   t .         bloody stupid thing to wonder     said bigmac .      why .         real   s real .  everything else isn   t .         what about   well  dreams .         nah .  they   re not real .         they   ve got to be something .  otherwise you couldn   t have them  right .     said johnny desperately .      yeah  but that   s not the same as really real .         are people on television real .         course .         why   re we treating them as a game  then .         you mean   on the news           yes .         that   s different .  you can   t have people going around doing what they like .         but we           anyway  space games aren   t real     said bigmac .  he kept looking down the dark street .   johnny relaxed a little .      are you real .         dunno .  feel real .  it   s all crap anyway .         what is .         everything .  so who cares .  come on  i   m going back home .      they strolled past what had been  in       an environmental green space and was now a square of dog poisoned earth where the shopping carts went to die .      plonker   s a bit of a maniac     said bigmac .     bit of a wild man .  bit of a loony .  lives in a big posh house  though .         where .         oh  in tyne avenue or crescent or somewhere     said bigmac .   a blue light lit his face for a moment as a police car flashed past the end of the road  its siren dee dahing into the distance .   bigmac froze .      what   s his real name .     said johnny .      eh .  yeah .  garry  i think .      bigmac was staring at the end of the road .  the blue light was still visible .  it had stopped about half a mile away  they could see it reflected off a billboard .      just garry .     said johnny .   bigmac   s face was wet in the light of the street lamps .  johnny realized that he was sweating .      might be dunn     said bigmac .  he shifted uneasily from one foot to the other .   another siren echoed around the night .  an ambulance went past on the main road  ghostly under its flashing light .      look  bigmac           bugger off .      bigmac turned and ran  his doc martens crashing on the pavement .  johnny watched him go .  he thought of all the things he should have said .  he wasn   t stupid .  everyone knew what happened to cars around the dark tower .  what could he say now .   and his body thought  you don   t say anything .  you do something .  it started running all by itself after his friend  taking his brain with it .   despite a bedroom full of weight training equipment that would have been of considerable interest if the police had ever bothered much about a recent theft down at the sports center  bigmac wasn   t in much of a condition .  he had been born out of condition .  johnny caught up to him on the bend .      i told you   to   buggeroff .  nothing   todo   withyou .     said bigmac  as they headed toward the distant lights .      they crashed it  didn   t they .         nozzer   s a good driver .         yeah .  good at going fast .      there was a crowd standing around at the traffic lights farther down the road .  as they ran  another ambulance overtook them and rocked to a halt .  the crowd parted .  johnny caught a glimpse of   well  not a car  but maybe what a car would look like after trying to be in the same place as a cement truck .  he knew it was a cement truck  because one had climbed up the pavement and lay on its side .  its load was fast becoming the biggest brick in the world .   in the distance there was the scream of a fire engine  getting nearer .   he grabbed bigmac   s arm  pulling him around .      i don   t think you want to go any closer     he said .   bigmac shook himself free just as the police managed to lever the crumpled door open .   bigmac stared .   then he turned  tottered over to a low garden wall by the roadside  and was sick .   when johnny reached him  his whole body was shaking with cold and terror .      bugger you  i could have been in that  you        bigmac was sick again  all down the front of arnold schwarzenegger .  johnny took his coat off and put it over the other boy   s shivering shoulders .         they kept goin    on at me  i told them  i said           yeah .  yeah  that   s right     said johnny  looking around .     look  you just sit here   there   s a phone   you just sit there  all right .  you just           don   t go away .         what .  oh .  yes .  right .  come on then            click .      hello  this           yo less .  it   s johnny .         yes .         your mum in the hospital tonight .         no  she   s on days this week .  why .         can you get her to bring her car down to withe ridge road .         what   s up .  you sound as if you   ve been           look  shut up .  get her to do it  right .  please .  it   s bigmac .         what   s up with him .         yo less .  this is important .  this is really important .         you know how she carries on when i           yo less .         oh  all right .  hey  is that a siren .         we   re in a phone booth .  you   d better get her to bring a blanket or something .  and hurry up  it   s dead smelly in here .         that was a siren  wasn   t it .         yes .      he put the phone down .   bigmac wasn   t being sick anymore .  he hadn   t got anything to be sick with .  he was just leaning against the door  shaking .      she   ll be along right away     said johnny as cheerfully as he could manage .     she   s a nurse .  she knows all about this stuff .      outside  one of the ambulances drove away .  firemen were all over the wreck .  some of them were getting equipment off the engine .   bigmac stared at the scene .      they   re probably fine     lied johnny .     it   s amazing how people can           johnny .         what .         no one   s fine who looked like that     said bigmac in a flat voice .     there was blood all over .         well           my brother   ll kill me when he finds out .  he said if i have the cops around again  he   ll throw me out of the window .  he   ll kill me if he finds out .         he won   t  then .  you didn   t do anything .  we were just hanging out and you felt ill .  that   s all .         he   ll kill me .         what for .  no one knows anything except me  and i don   t know anything .  i promise .          it was after eight when johnny got home .  he left his coat in the shed until he could sneak it in and sponge it off  and said he   d been round at yo less   s  which was true  and was a pretty good way of avoiding questions  because his parents approved of yo less on racial grounds .  to object to him being round at yo less   s would be like objecting to yo less .  yo less was real handy .   anyway  it wasn   t as if anyone had cooked any dinner .  mrs .  yo less had made him a hot chocolate when he was there  but he hadn   t accepted a meal  because that suggested you didn   t have them all that often at home and you didn   t do that .  she   d put bigmac to bed .  bigmac with his skinhead haircut .   he microwaved himself something called a pour on genuine creole lasagne  which said it served four portions .  it did if you were dwarfs .   the phone rang as he was carrying it upstairs .  it was wobbler .      yo less just called me .         right .         why didn   t you get them to put bigmac in an ambulance .         who with .      there was a moment of silence from wobbler as he worked this out .  then he said     yuck .         right .         anyway  people   d ask questions .  bigmac   s been in enough trouble as it is  what with his brother and one thing and another .         right .         wow .         got to go now  wobbler .  got to eat my dinner before it congeals .      he put the phone down on the tray and looked at it .  there was something else he was going to do .  what was it .  something  anyway .   the lasagne looked real .  it looked as though someone had already eaten it once .       the captain looked up .   most of her officers were standing in front of her .  except for the gunnery officer  who was looking smug  they all wore rather embarrassed expressions .      yes .     said the captain .   to her surprise  it wasn   t the gunnery officer who spoke .  it was the navigation officer  a small and inoffensive screewee who suffered from prematurely shedding scales .      um     she said .      yes .     said the captain again .      um .  we   that is  all of us       said the navigation officer  looking as if she wished she was somewhere else        we feel that  uh  the present course is  uh  an unwise one .  with respect     she added .      in what way .     said the captain .  she could see the gunnery officer grinning behind the little screewee .  no one could grin like a screewee   their mouths were built for it .      we  uh   that is  all of us   we are still being attacked .  and that last attack was a terrible one .         the chosen one stopped it  at the cost of his own life     said the captain .      um .  he will return     said the navigation officer .     um .  twenty of our people will not .      the captain wasn   t really looking at her .  she was staring at the gunnery officer  whose grin was now wide enough to hold a set of billiard balls and probably the cue too .   he   s been talking to them  she told herself .  everyone   s on edge  no one can think straight  and he   s talking to them .  i should have had him shot .  they wouldn   t have liked it  but i could probably have shouted them down .      so what is it you are suggesting .     she said .      um .  we   that is  all of us     said the little screewee  with an imploring glance at the gunnery officer     we feel we should turn and           fight .     said the captain .     make a last stand .         um .  yes .  that   s right .         and that   s the feeling of all of you .      the officers nodded  one after another .      um .  sorry  ma   am     said the navigation officer .      the others stood and fought     said the captain .     the   space invaders .  and the others .  we   ve all seen the wrecks .  all they knew was how to attack .  they stood and fought  and fought and died .         we are dying too  um     said the navigation officer .      i know .  i am sorry     said the captain .     but many are living .  and every minute takes us farther from danger .  we are so near the border .  if we stop   you know what will happen .  game space will move .  the border will retreat .  the humans will find us .  and then they will           die     said the gunnery officer .     and we shall win .  those others were stupid .  we are not .  we can win .  we shall give the humans the mother of all battles .         ah  yes     said the captain .     mother and grandmother of battles .  battles that breed more battles .         and this is your leader speaking     sneered the gunnery officer .     the leader of the fleet .  it is pathetic .  cowardly .         when we are home       the captain began .      home .  this is our home .  we have no other .  all this talk of the border  and a planet of our own   have any of us seen it .  no .  it   s a legend .  wishful thinking .  a dream .  we lie to ourselves .  we make up stories .  the chosen one .  the hero with a thousand extra lives .  it   s all dreams .  we live and breed and die on our ships .  that is our destiny .  there is no choice .          peace talks  peace shouts     johnny awoke in the starship .   normally he was some way from the fleet  but this time it was around him .  there were screewee ships on every side .   they were flying the wrong way .   immediately  a face appeared on the screen .  except for a few differences on the crest  and a slight orange tint to the scales  it might have been the captain .      calling the human ship .         who are you .         i am the new captain .  these are my instructions           what happened to the old captain .         she is under arrest .  these are my instructions           arrest .  what for .  what did she do .         she did nothing .  listen to me .  you have sixty seconds to get beyond range of our guns .  for honor .  after that  you will be fired upon with extreme force .         hang on           the count has started .         but           end of communication .  die  human .      the screen went blank .   johnny stared at it .   it hadn   t been a friendly face .  the voice had sounded as though it had learned human out of a book  just like the real captain .  but in this case it had been a nasty book .  it also sounded as though it belonged to someone who would count to sixty like this     one  two  three  four  five  seven  eighteen  thirty five  forty nine  fifty eight  fifty nine  sixty   firing  ready or not        his ship jerked forward  ramming him back in his seat .  that was one good thing about game space   you could do the kind of turns and maneuvers that  in real space  would leave the human body looking like thin pink linoleum across the cabin wall    .   the fleet slid past  dwindling to a collection of dots behind him .  a couple of laser beams crackled past  but some way away  it looked as though they were trying to frighten him off rather than kill him .   the screewee had turned around .  they were heading back deeper into game space .  why .  they   d show up on people   s screens soon .  there were always some players who   d go looking .  any day now some kid   d switch on his machine and there   d be wall to wall screewee  heading straight for him .  they weren   t safe even now .  yes   there were always some people who   d go looking    .   and there was a green dot ahead of him .  he recognized the way it moved  like a dog creeping around the edge of a sheep field .   he headed toward it .   now he could remember .  you thought better in game space  too .  it was as if he was more him in game space .  krystal or kylie or one of those made up names  wobbler had said .  and bigmac said the other name was dunn    .   he twirled the knob of the communicator panel .      krystal .     he tried .     kylie .  kathryn .  whatever .      there was just the hiss of the stars  and then     it   s kirsty  actually .         don   t fire .     said johnny  quickly .      who are you .         don   t fire  first .  promise .  i hate dying .  it makes it hard to think .      the other ship had stopped being a dot now .  if she was going to fire  he was as good as dead   if dead was good .      all right     she said slowly .     no firing .  peace talk .  now tell me who you are .         i   m a player  like you     said johnny .      no you   re not .  none of the other players talk to me .  anyway  you   re on their side .  i   ve been watching you .         not   exactly on their side     said johnny .      well  you   re not on my side     said kirsty .     no one is .         did they try to surrender to you too .  i heard you say in patel   s shop that they   d sent you a message .      there was another silence filled with the whispers of the universe  and then a cautious voice     you   re not the fat one who looks as though he could do with a bra  are you .         no .  listen       johnny tapped his controls hurriedly .      the black one who looks like an accountant .         no .  look           oh  no   not the skinny one with the big boots and the pointy head    .         no  i   m the one who kind of hangs around and no one notices much     said johnny desperately .      who .  i didn   t see anyone .         right .  that was me .         they surrendered to you .         yes .     number three missile went ping as it locked onto her ship .  now for number four        but you   re a nerd .      ping .      i think it   s dweeb now .  anyway  i   m more than a dweeb .      ping .      why .         i   m a dweeb with five missiles targeted on you .         you said you weren   t going to fire .         i haven   t yet .         you said this was a peace talk .         you did .  anyway  it is .  it   s just that i   m   kind of shouting .      if he concentrated  he thought he could hear music in the background when she spoke .      you   ve really got missiles targeted on me .         yes .         i   m amazed you thought of it .         so am i .  look  i don   t want to shoot anyone .  but i need help .  the fleet   s turned around .  they fired at me .         that   s their job  dweeb .  they fire at us  we fire at them .  why did they stop .  it   s no fun if they don   t fire back .         they surrendered .         they can   t surrender .  it   s a game .         well  they did .  sometimes you change the game .  i don   t know  kirsty .         listen  i hate that name .         i   ve got to call you something     said johnny .     what do you call yourself .         if you tell anyone else i   ll kill you           i thought you were planning to do that anyway .         i don   t mean just kill you  i mean really kill you .         all right .  what   s your game name .         sigourney   you   re laughing .         i   m not .  i   m not .  it was a sneeze .  honest .  no  it   s a   good name .  very   appropriate           it   s just dreaming  anyway .  i   m dreaming this .  you   re dreaming this .         so what .  doesn   t make things unimportant .      there was some more silence with the scratchy suggestion of music in the background  and then     ah ha .  while we   ve been talking  mr .  clever  i   ve targeted missiles on you .      johnny shrugged  even though there was no way she could see that .      doesn   t matter .  i thought you would  anyway .  so we kill each other .  then we   ll have to go through all this again .  it   s stupid .  don   t you want to find out what happens next .      more scratchy music .      i can hear scratchy music     said johnny .      it   s my walkman .         clever  i wish i   d thought of that .  i tried dreaming my camera  but the pictures weren   t any good .  what   re you listening to .         c inlay   details      please keep this copy for your records .         there was another scratchy pause .   then  as if she   d been thinking deeply  she said     look  we can   t be in the same dream .  that can   t happen .         we could find out .  where d   you live .      this time the pause went on for a long time .  the screewee fleet appeared on the radar .      we   d better move     said johnny .     they   ve started firing .  something   s happened to the captain .  she   s the one who wanted peace in the first place .  look  i know you live in tyne avenue or crescent or somewhere           how come we live so close .         dunno .  bad luck  i suppose .  look  they   re going to be in range soon           no problem .  then we shoot them .         we   ll be killed .  anyway           so what .  dying   s easy .         i know .  it   s living that   s the problem     said johnny  meaning it .     you don   t sound like someone who takes the easy way .      c inlay   details played on in the distance .      so what do you have in mind .      johnny hesitated .  he hadn   t thought that far .  the new captain didn   t seem to want to talk .      dunno .  i just don   t want any screewee to get killed .         why not .      because when they die  they die for real .      i just don   t  ok .      several fighters had left the fleet and were heading purposefully toward them .      i   m going to try and talk one more time     he decided .     someone must be listening .         nerdy idea .         i   m not much good at the other kind .      johnny turned his ship and hit the go faster button .  a few shots whiffled harmlessly past him and did a lot of damage to empty space .   and then he was heading at maximum speed toward the fleet .   music came over the intercom .      idiot .  dodge and dive .  no wonder you get shot a lot .      he wiggled the joystick .  something clipped one of the starship   s wings and exploded behind him .      and you   ve got the fighters after you .  huh .  you can   t even save yourself .      johnny didn   t take his eyes off the fleet  which was bouncing around the sky as he flung his ship about in an effort to avoid being shot at .      you might try to be some help .     he shouted .   there was a boom behind him .      i am .         you   re shooting them .         you   re very hard to please  actually .          the captain tried the door of her cabin again .  it was still locked .  and there was almost certainly a guard in the corridor outside .  screewee tended to obey orders  even if they didn   t like them .  the gunnery officer was very unusual .   that  she thought bitterly  is what comes of promoting a male .  they   re unreliable thinkers .   she looked around the cabin .  she didn   t want to be in it .  she wanted to be outside it .  but she was in it .  she needed a new idea .   humans seemed much better at ideas .  they always seemed to be on the verge of being totally insane  but it seemed to work for them .  the inside of their heads would be an interesting place to visit  but she wouldn   t want to live there .   how do you think like a human .  go into madness first  probably  and then out the other side    .          listen .  listen .  if you keep going this way  you   ll all be killed .  you   re going back into game space .  people like me will find you .  you   ll all be killed .  that   s how it goes .      and then he died .       it was     .  he was lying on his bed with his clothes on  but he still felt cold .   bits and pieces of his   his previous life trickled through his mind .   sigourney .   well  yo less would say that explained anything .  and now it looked as if he   d be spending every night watching the screewee get killed .   it was bad enough fighting off people in ones and twos .  but they were just the ones who were weird or lonely or bored enough to go looking .  wobbler said thousands of copies of the game had been sold .  even if most people took them back to the shops  there   d always be someone playing .  once the screewee turned up again  the news would get around    .   and then  one day  long after no one played the game anymore  there   d be these broken ships  turning over and over in the blank screen darkness of game space .   and he couldn   t stop it .  kir   sigourney was right .  that   s what they were there for .   it was tuesday  too .  it was math for most of the morning .  and then english .  he   d better write a poem at lunchtime .  you could generally get away with a poem .   he got his coat out of the shed and sponged it off as best he could  and then propped it up by the heater .  then he investigated the fridge .   his father had been doing the shopping again .  you could always tell .  there were generally expensive things in jars  and odd foreign vegetables .  this time there was yogurt vindaloo and more celery .  no one in the house liked celery much .  it always ended up going brown .  and his father never bought bread and potatoes .  he seemed to think that stuff like that just grew in kitchens  like mushrooms  although he always bought mushrooms  if they were the special expensive dried kind that looked like bits of moldy bark and were picked by wizened old frenchmen  .   there was a carton of milk that thumped when he shook it .   johnny found a cup in the ghastly cavern of the dishwasher and rinsed it under the tap .  at least there wasn   t much that could go wrong with black coffee .   he quite enjoyed the time by himself in the mornings .  the day was too early to have started going really wrong .   the war was still on television .  it was getting on his nerves .  it was worrying him .  you   d really think everyone would have had enough by now .       bigmac was in school .  he   d stayed the night at yo less   s .  mrs .  yo less had washed out his clothes  even the t shirt with    blackbury skins    on the back .  it was a lot cleaner than it had ever been .   he could feel wobbler and yo less looking at him with interest .  so were one or two other people .   later on  when they were in the middle of the rush that meant that every pupil in the school had to walk all the way across the campus to be somewhere else  yo less said     bigmac said you pulled him out of the wreck .  did you .         what .  he wasn   t even       johnny paused .   it was amazing .  he   d never thought so fast before .  he thought of bigmac   s room  with its weapons of the world posters and plastic model guns and weight training stuff he couldn   t lift .  bigmac had been thrown out of the school role playing games club for getting too excited .  bigmac  who spent all his time trying hard to be a big thicko  bigmac  who could work out math problems just by looking at them .  bigmac  who played the game of being   well  big tough bigmac .   johnny looked around .  bigmac was watching him .  it was amazing  given that bigmac   s ancestors were a sort of monkey  how much his expression looked like the one he   d first seen on the face of the captain  whose ancestors were a kind of alligator .  it said  help me .      can   t really remember     he said .      only my mum called the hospital and they said there were only two boys and they were           it was dark     said johnny .      yes  but if you   d really           it   s just best if everyone shuts up about it  all right .     said johnny  nodding meaningfully at bigmac .      she said you did everything right  anyway     said yo less .     and she said you aren   t being properly looked after .         yo less .         she said you ought to come round our house to eat sometimes           thanks     said johnny .     i   m a bit busy these days           doing what .     said yo less .   johnny fumbled in his pocket .      what does this look like to you .     he said .   yo less took it gravely .      it   s a photograph     he said .     just looks like a tv screen with dots on .         yes     sighed johnny .     it does  doesn   t it .      he took it back and shoved it deep into his pocket .      yo less .         what .         if someone was   you know   going a bit weird in the head           crazy  he means     said wobbler behind him .      just a bit overstrained     said johnny .     i mean   would they know .  themselves .         well  everyone thinks they   re a bit mad     said yo less .     it   s part of being normal .         oh  i don   t think i   m mad     said johnny .      you don   t .         well           ah aha .     said wobbler .      i mean   the whole world seems kind of weird right now .  you watch tv  don   t you .  how can you be the good guys if you   re dropping clever bombs right down people   s chimneys .  and blowing people up just because they   re being bossed around by a loony .         shouldn   t let    emselves be bossed around  then     said bigmac .  johnny looked at him .  bigmac deflated a bit .     it   s their own fault .  they don   t have to .  that   s what my brother says  anyway     he mumbled .      is it .     said johnny .   bigmac shrugged .      oh  well  yes     said wobbler .     how .  it   s hard enough to get rid of prime ministers  and at least they don   t have people taken out and shot .  not anymore  anyway .         my brother   s stupid     said bigmac  so quietly under his breath that johnny wondered if anyone else even heard it .      there was a man on the box saying that the bomb aimers were so good because they all grew up playing computer games     said wobbler .      see .     said johnny .     that   s what i mean .  games look real .  real things look like games .  and   and   it all kind of runs together in my head .         ah     said yo less knowingly .     that   s not crazy .  that   s shamanism .  i read a book about it .         what   s shamanism .         shamans used to be these kind of people who lived partly in a dream world and partly in the real world     said yo less .     like medicine men and druids and guys like that .  they used to be very important .  they used to guide people .         guide .     said johnny .     where to .         not sure .  anyway  my mother says they were creations of satan .         yes  but your mother says that about practically everything     said wobbler .      this is true     said yo less gravely .     it   s her hobby .         she said role playing games were creations of satan     said wobbler .      true .         real clever of him     said wobbler .     i mean  sitting down there in hell  working out all the combat tables and everything .  i bet he used to really swear every time the dice caught fire        shamanism  thought johnny .  yes .  i could be a shaman .  a guide .  that   s better than being crazy  at any rate .       it was math again .  as far as johnny was concerned  the future would be a better place if it didn   t contain  y   x  .  he had problems enough without people giving him pages of them .   he was trying to put off the idea of calling someone up .   and then there was social education .  normally you could ignore social education  which tended to be about anything anyone had on their minds at the time or  failing that  aids .  really the day ended with math .  se was just there to keep you off the streets for another three quarters of an hour .   he could try calling up .  you just needed the phone book and a bit of thought    .   johnny stared at the ceiling .  the teacher was going on about the war .  that was all there was to talk about these days .  he listened with half an ear .  no one liked the bombing .  one of the girls was nearly in tears about it    .   supposing she was really there .  or supposing she said she   d never heard of him .   bigmac was arguing .  that was unusual .   and then someone said     do you think it   s easy .  do you think the pilots really just sit there like   like a game .  do you think they laugh .  really laugh .  not just laugh because they   re still alive  but laugh because it   s   it   s fun .  when they   re being shot at for a living  every day .  when any minute they might get blown up too .  do you think they don   t wonder what it   s all about .  do you think they like it .  but we always turn it into something that   s not exactly real .  we turn it into games and it   s not games .  we really have to find out what   s real .      they were all looking at him .      anyway  that   s what i think     said johnny .       on earth  no one can hear you say    um        click .      yes .         um .         hello .         um .  is sig   is kirsty there .         who   s this .         i   m a friend .  um .  i don   t think she knows my name .         you   re a friend and she doesn   t know your name .         please .         oh  hang on .      johnny stared at his bedroom wall .  eventually a suspicious voice said     yes .  who   s this .         you   re sigourney .  you like c inlay   details .  you fly really well .  you           you   re him .      johnny breathed a sigh of relief .  real .   going through the phone book had been harder than flying the starship .  nearly harder than dying .      i wasn   t sure you really existed     he said .      i wasn   t sure you existed     she said .      i   ve got to talk to you .  i mean face to face .         how do i know you   re not some sort of maniac .         do i sound like some sort of maniac .         yes .         all right  but apart from that .      there was silence for a moment .  then she said  reluctantly     all right .  you can come round here .         what .  to your house .         it   s safer than in public  idiot .      not for me  johnny thought .      ok     he said .      i mean  you might be one of those funny people .         what  clowns .      and then she said  very cautiously     it   s really you .         really i   m not sure about .  but me  yes .         you got blown up .         yes  i know .  i was there  remember .         i don   t die often in the game .  it took me ages even to find the aliens .      huh  thought johnny .      it doesn   t get any better with practice     he said darkly .       tyne crescent turned out to be a pretty straight road with trees in it  and the houses were big and had double garages and a timber effect on them to fool people into believing that henry viii had built them .   kirsty   s mother opened the door for him .  she was grinning like the captain  although the captain had the excuse that she was related to crocodiles .  johnny felt he had the wrong clothes on  or the wrong face .   he was shown into a large room .  it was mainly white .  expensive bookshelves lined one wall .  most of the floor was bare pine  but varnished and polished to show that they could have afforded carpets if they   d wanted them .  there was a harp standing by a chair in one corner  and music scattered around it on the floor .   johnny picked up a sheet .  it was headed    royal college  grade v .         well .      she was standing behind him .  the sheet slipped out of his fingers .      and don   t say    um        she said  sitting down .     you say    um    a lot .  aren   t you ever sure about things .         u   no .  hello .         sit down .  my mother   s making us some tea .  and then staying out of the way .  you   ll probably notice that .  you can actually hear her staying out of the way .  she thinks i ought to have more friends .      she had red hair  and the skinny look that went with it .  it was as if someone had grabbed the frizzy ponytail on the back of her head and pulled it tightly .      the game     said johnny vaguely .      yes .  what .         i   m really glad you   re in it too .  yo less said it was all in my head because of trying times .  he said it was just me projecting my problems .         i haven   t got any problems     snapped kirsty .     i get on extremely well with people  actually .  there   s probably some simple psychic reason that you   re too stupid to work out .         you sounded more concerned on the phone     said johnny .      but now i   ve had time to think about it .  anyway  what   s it to me what happens to some dots in a machine .         didn   t you see the space invaders .     said johnny .      yes  but they were stupid .  that   s what happens .  charles darwin knew about that .  i am a winning kind of person .  and what i want to know is what were you doing in my dream .         i   m not sure it   s a dream     said johnny .     i   m not sure what it is .  not exactly a dream and not exactly real .  something in between .  i don   t know .  maybe something happens in your head .  maybe you   re in there because   because  well  i don   t know why  but there   s got to be a reason     he ended lamely .      why   re you there  then .         i want to save the screewee .         why .         because   i   ve got a responsibility .  but the captain   s been   i don   t know  locked up or something .  there   s been some kind of mutiny .  it   s the gunnery officer .  he   s behind it .  but if i   if we could get her out  she could probably turn the fleet around again .  i thought you might be able to think of some way of getting her out     johnny finished lamely .     we haven   t got a lot of game time .         she .     said kirsty .      she started all this .  she relied on me     said johnny .      you said    she        said kirsty .   johnny stood up .      i thought you might be able to help     he said wearily     but who cares what happens to some dots that aren   t even real .  so i   ll just           you keep saying    she        said kirsty .     you mean the captain   s a woman .         a female     said johnny .     yes .         but you called the gunnery officer a    he        said kirsty .      that   s right .      kirsty stood up .      that   s typical .  that   s absolutely typical of modern society .  he probably resents a wo   a female being better than him .  i get that all the time .         um     said johnny .  he hadn   t meant to say    um .     he meant to say     actually  all the screewee except the gunnery officer are females .     but another part of his brain had thought faster and shut down his mouth before he could say it  diverting the words into oblivion and shoving good old    um    in to their place .      there was an article in a magazine     said kirsty .     this whole bunch of directors of a company ganged up on this woman and fired her just because she   d become the boss .  it was just like me and the chess club .      it probably wouldn   t be a good idea to tell her .  there was a glint in her eye .  no  it probably wouldn   t be a good idea to be honest .  truthfulness would have to do instead .  after all  he hadn   t actually lied .      it   s a matter of principle     said kirsty .     you should have said so right at the start .     she stood up .     come on .         where are we going .     said johnny .      to my room     said kirsty .     don   t worry .  my parents are very liberal .          there were film posters all over the walls  and where there weren   t film posters  there were shelves with silver cups on them .  there was a framed certificate for the regional winner of the small bore rifle confederation   s national championships  and another one for chess .  and another one for athletics .  there were a lot of medals  mostly gold  and one or two silver .  kirsty won things .   if there was a medal for a tidy bedroom  she would have won that too .  you could see the floor all the way to the walls .   she had an electrical pencil sharpener .   and a computer .  the screen was showing the familiar message  new game  y n  .      do you know i have an iq of one hundred and sixty five .     she said  sitting down in front of the screen .      is that good .         yes .  and i only started playing this wretched game because my brother bought it and said i wouldn   t be any good at it .  these things are moronic .      there was a notebook by the keyboard .      each level     explained kirsty .     i made notes about how the ships flew .  and kept score  of course .         you were taking it seriously     said johnny .     very seriously .         of course i take it seriously .  it   s a game .  you   ve got to win them  otherwise what   s the point .  now   can we get onto the screewee flagship .         um           think .         can we get into a screewee battleship .      kirsty almost growled .     i asked you .  sit down and think .      johnny sat down .      i don   t think we can     he said .     i   m always in a starship .  i think things have to look like they do on the screen .         hmm .  makes some sort of sense  i suppose .     kirsty stuck a pencil in the sharpener  which whirred for a while .     and we don   t know what it looks like inside .      johnny stared at the wall .  among the items pinned over the bed was a card for winning the under   long jump .  she wins everything  he thought .  wow .  she actually assumes she   s going to win .  someone who always thinks they   re going to win    .   he stared up at the movie posters .  there was one he   d seen many times before .  the famous one .  the slavering alien monster .  you   d think she   d have something like a c inlay   details photo over her bed  but no  there was this thing        don   t tell me     he said     you want to get inside the ship and run along the corridors shooting screewee .  you do  don   t you .         tactically       she began .      you can   t .  the captain wouldn   t want that .  not killing screewee .      kirsty waved her hands in the air irritably .      that   s stupid     she said .     how do you expect to win without killing the enemy .         i   m supposed to save them .  anyway  they   re not exactly the enemy .  i can   t go around killing them .      kirsty looked thoughtful .      do you know     she said     there was an african tribe once whose nearest word for    enemy    was    a friend we haven   t met yet    .      johnny smiled .     right     he said .     that   s how           but they were all killed and eaten in eighteen hundred and two     said kirsty .     except for those who were sold as slaves .  the last one died in mississippi in eighteen sixty four  and he was very upset .         you just made that up     said johnny .      no .  i won a prize for history .         i expect you did     said johnny .     but i   m not killing anyone .         then you can   t win .         i don   t want to win .  i just don   t want them to lose .         you really are a dweeb  aren   t you .  how can anyone go through life expecting to lose all the time .         well  i   ve got to  haven   t i .  the world is full of people like you  for a start .      johnny realized he was getting angry again .  he didn   t often get angry .  he just got quiet  or miserable .  anger was unusual .  but when it came  it overflowed .      they tried to talk to you  and you didn   t even listen .  you were the only other one who got that involved .  you were so mad to win  you slipped into game space .  and you   d have been so much better at saving them than me .  and you didn   t even listen .  but i listened and i   ve spent a week trying to save mankind in my sleep .  it   s always people like me who have to do stuff like that .  it   s always the people who aren   t clever and who don   t win things who have to get killed all the time .  and you just hung around and watched .  it   s just like on the television .  the winners have fun .  winner types never lose  they just come in second .  it   s all the other people who lose .  and now you   re only thinking of helping the captain because you think she   s like you .  well  i don   t bloody well care anymore  miss clever .  i   ve done my best .  and i   m going to go on doing it .  and they   ll all come back into game space and it   ll be just like the space invaders all over again .  and i   ll be there every night .      her mouth was open .   there was a knock on the door and almost immediately  mothers being what they are  kirsty   s mother pushed it open .  she brought in a wide grin and a tray .      i   m sure you   d both like some tea     she said .     and           yes  mother     said kirsty  and rolled her eyes .         there   s some macaroons .  have you found out your friend   s name now .         john maxwell     said johnny .      and what do your friends call you .     said kirsty   s mother sweetly .      sometimes they call me rubber     said johnny .      do they .  whatever for .         mother  we were talking     said kirsty .      cobbers is on in a minute     said kirsty   s mother .     i  er  shall watch it on the set in the kitchen  shall i .         good bye     said kirsty  meaningfully .      um  yes     said her mother  and went out .      she dithers a lot     said kirsty .     fancy getting married when you   re twenty .  a complete lack of ambition .      she stared at johnny for a while .  he was keeping quiet .  he   d been amazed to hear his own thoughts .   kirsty coughed .  she looked a little uncertain for the first time since johnny had met her .      well     she said .     uh .  ok .  and   we won   t be able to fight all the players when they get back to game space .         no .  there   s not enough missiles .         could we dream a few more .         no .  i thought of that .  you get the ship you play with .  i mean  we know it   s only got six missiles .  i   ve tried dreaming more and it doesn   t work .         hmm .  interesting problem .  sorry     she added quickly  when she saw his expression .   johnny stared at the movie posters .  sigourney .  games everywhere .  bigmac was a tough guy in his head  and this one kept sharp pencils and had to win everything and in her head shot aliens .  everyone had these pictures of themselves in their head  except him    .   he blinked .   and now his head ached .  there was a buzzing in his ears .   kirsty   s face drifted toward him .      are you all right .      the headache was really bad now .      you   re ill .  and you look all thin .  when did you last eat .         i dunno .  had something last night  i think .         last night .  what about breakfast and lunch .         oh  well   you know   i kept thinking about           you   d better drink that tea and eat that macaroon .  phew .  when did you last have a bath .         it   s kind of           good grief           listen .  listen .     it was important to tell her .  he didn   t feel well at all .      yes .         we dream our way in     he said .      what are you talking about .  you   re swaying .         we go onto their ship .         but we agreed we don   t know what it looks like inside .         ok .  good .  so we decide what it does look like inside  right .      she tapped her pad irritably .      so what does it look like .         i don   t know .  the inside of a spaceship .  corridors and cabins and stuff like that .  nuts and bolts and panels and sliding doors .  scotsmen saying the engines canna tak    it anymoore .  bright blue lights .         hmm .  that   s what you think is inside spaceships  is it .      kirsty glared at him .  she generally glared .  it was her normal expression .      when we go to sleep   i mean  when i go to sleep   i   ll try and wake up inside the ship     he said .      how .         i don   t know .  by concentrating  i suppose .      she leaned forward .  for the first time since he   d met her  she looked concerned .      you don   t look capable of thinking straight     she said .      i   ll be all right .      johnny stood up .       in space  no one is listening anyway     and woke up .   he was lying down on something hard .  there was some sort of mesh just in front of his eyes .  he stared at it for a while .   there was also a faint vibration in the floor  and a distant background rumbling .   he was obviously back in game space  but he certainly wasn   t in a starship     the mesh moved .   the captain   s face appeared over the edge of the mesh  upside down .      johnny .         where am i .         you appear to be under my bed .      he rolled sideways .      i   m on your ship .         oh  yes .         right .  hah .  i knew i could do it    .      he stood up and looked around the cabin .  it wasn   t very interesting .  apart from the bed  which was under something that looked like a sun ray lamp  there was only a desk and something that was probably a chair if you had four back legs and a thick tail .   on the desk were half a dozen plastic aliens .  there was also a cage with a couple of long beaked birds in it .  they sat side by side on their perch and watched johnny with almost intelligent eyes .   right .  sigourney was right .  he did think better in game space .  all the decisions seemed so much clearer .   ok .  so he was on board .  he   d rather hoped to be outside the cabin the captain was locked in  but this was a start .   he stared at the wall .  there was a grille .      what   s that .     he said  pointing .      it is where the air comes in .      johnny pulled at the grille .  there was no very obvious way of removing it .  if it could be removed  the hole behind it was easily big enough for the captain .  air ducts .  well  what did he expect .      we   ve got to get this off     he said .     before something dreadful happens .         we are imprisoned     said the captain .     what more can happen that is dreadful .         have you ever heard the name   sigourney .     said johnny cautiously .      no .  but it sounds a lovely name     said the captain .     who is this sigourney .         well  if she can dream her way here as well  then there   s going to be trouble .  you should see the pictures she   s got on her walls .         what of .         um .  aliens     said johnny .      she takes a very close interest in alien races .     said the captain happily .      um .  yes .     the mere thought of her arrival made him pull urgently at the grille .     um .  there   s something on the inside   and i can   t quite get my hand through        the captain watched him with interest .      something like wingnuts     grunted johnny .      this is very instructive     said the captain  peering over his shoulder .      i can   t get a grip .         you wish to turn them .         yes .      the captain waddled over to the table and opened the birdcage .  both of the birds hopped out onto her hand .  the captain said a few words in screewee  the birds fluttered past johnny   s head  squeezed through the mesh  and disappeared .  after a second or two he heard the squeak squeak of nuts being undone .      what were they .     he said .      chee     said the captain .     mouth birds .  you understand .     she opened her mouth  revealing several rows of yellow teeth .     for hygiene .         living toothbrushes .         we have always had them .  they are   traditional .  very intelligent .  bred for it  you know .  clever things .  they understand several words of screewee .      the squeaking went on .  there was a clonk  and a nut rolled through the mesh .   the panel fell into the room .   johnny looked at the hole .      o kay     he said uncertainly .     you don   t know where it goes  do you .         no .  there are ventilation shafts all over the ship .  will you lead the way .         um           i would be happy for you to lead the way     said the captain .   johnny stood on the bed and crawled into the hole .  it went a little way and then opened onto a bigger shaft .      all over the ship .     he said .      yes .      johnny paused for a moment .  he   d never liked narrow dark spaces .      oh .  right     he said .       kirsty   s mother put down the phone .      there   s no one answering     she said .      i think he said his father works late and his mother sometimes works in the evening     said kirsty .     anyway  the doctor said he   s basically all right  didn   t she .  he   s just run down  she said .  what was the stuff she gave him .         she said it   d make him sleep .  he   s not getting enough sleep .  twelve year old boys need a lot of sleep .         i know this one does     said kirsty .      and you said he   s not eating properly .  where did you meet him  anyway .         um     kirsty began  and then smiled to herself .     out and about .      kirsty   s mother looked worried .      are you sure he   s all there .         he   s all there     said kirsty  climbing the stairs .     i   m not sure that he   s all here  but he   s certainly all there .      she opened the door of the spare room and looked in .  johnny was fast asleep in a pair of her brother   s pajamas .  he looked very young .  it   s amazing how young twelve is  when you   re thirteen .   then she went to her own bedroom  got ready for bed  and slid between the sheets .   it was pretty early .  it had been a busy evening .   he was a loser .  you could tell .  he dressed like a loser .  a ditherer .  someone who said    um    a lot  and went through life trying not to be noticed .   she   d never done that .  she   d always gone through life as if there was a big red arrow above the planet  indicating precisely where she was .   on the other hand  he tried so hard    .   she   d bet he   d cried when e . t .  died .   she pushed herself up on one elbow and stared at the movie posters .   trying wasn   t the point .   you had to win .  what good was anything if you didn   t win .          stuck .  you   re an alien     said johnny .     aliens don   t get stuck in air ducts .  it   s practically a well known fact .      he backed into a side tunnel and turned around .      i am sorry .  it occurs to me that possibly i am the wrong type of alien     said the captain .     i can go backward  but i am forwardly disadvantaged .         ok .  back up to that second junction we passed     said johnny .     we   re lost  anyway .         no     said the captain     i know where we are .  it says here this is junction  .         do you know where that is .         no .         i saw a film where there was an alien crawling around inside a spaceship   s air ducts and it could come out wherever it liked     said johnny reproachfully .      doubtless it had a map     said the captain .   johnny crawled around a corner and found        another grille .   there didn   t seem to be any activity on the other side of it .  he unscrewed the nuts and let it fall onto the floor .   there was a corridor .  he dropped into it  then turned and helped the captain through .  screewee might have descended from crocodiles  but crocodiles preferred sandbanks .  they weren   t very good at crawling through narrow spaces .   her skin felt cold and dry  like silk .   there were no other screewee around .      they   re probably at battle stations     said johnny .      we   re always at battle stations     said the captain bitterly  brushing dust off her scales .     this is corridor  .  now we must get to the bridge  yes .         won   t they just lock you up again .     said johnny .      i think not .  disobedience to properly constituted authority does not come easily to us .  the gunnery officer is very   persuasive .  but once they see that i am free again  they will give in .  at least     the captain added     most of them will .  the gunnery officer may prove difficult .  he dreams of grandeur .      she waddled a little way along the bare corridor  keeping close to the wall .  johnny trailed behind her .      dreams are always tricky     he said .      yes .         but they   ll wake up when the players start shooting again  won   t they .  they   ll soon see what he is leading them into .         we have a proverb     said the captain .     skeejee shejweejeeyee .  it means       she thought for a moment .     when you are riding a jee  a six legged domesticated beast of burden capable of simple instruction but also traditionally foul tempered  it is easier to stay on rather than dismount  equally  better to trust yourself to a jee than risk attack from the sure footed jeeyee  which will easily outrun a screewee on foot .  of course  it is a little snappier in our language .      they   d reached a corner .  the captain peered around it and then jerked her head back .      there is a guard outside the door of my cabin     she said .     she is armed .         can you talk to her .         she is under orders .  i fear that i will only be allowed to say    aaargh .        said the captain .     but feel free to make the attempt .  i have no other options .      oh  well   you only die a few hundred times  thought johnny .  he stepped out into the corridor .   the guard turned to look at him and half raised a melted looking thing that nevertheless very clearly said    gun .     but she looked at him in puzzlement .   she   s never seen a human before .  he thought .   he spread his arms wide in what he hoped was an innocent looking way  and smiled .   which just goes to show that you shouldn   t take things for granted because  as the captain told him later  when a screewee is about to fight  she does two things .  she spreads her front pairs of arms wide  to grip and throttle  and exposes her teeth  ready to bite  .   the guard raised the gun .   then there was a thunderous knocking on the other side of the cabin door .   the guard made a simple mistake .  she should have ignored the knocking  loud and desperate though it was  and concentrated on johnny .  but she tried to keep the gun pointing in his general direction while she pressed a panel by the door .  after all  it was only the captain in there  wasn   t it .  and the captain was still the captain  even if she was locked up .  she could keep an eye on both of them    .   the door opened a little way .  a foot came out  swinging upward  and caught the guard under the snout .  there was a click as all her teeth met .  her eyes crossed .   someone shouted     haiii .      the guard swayed backward .  kirsty came through the door airborne and started hacking at the guard   s arms with her hands .  she dropped the gun .  kirsty picked it up in one movement .  the guard opened her mouth to bite  spread her arms to grip and throttle  and then went cross eyed again  because the gun barrel was suddenly thrust between her teeth .      don   t   swallow       said kirsty  very deliberately .   there was a sudden  very heavy silence .  the guard stayed very still .      this is a friend of mine     said johnny .      oh  yes     said the captain .     sigourney .  one of your warriors .  is she a friend of mine .         at the moment     said sigourney  without moving her head .  she had tied one of the strips of webbing from the captain   s bed around her forehead .  she was breathing heavily .  there was a wild glint in her eye .  johnny suddenly felt very sorry for the guard .      you know  i   m glad she   s a friend of mine     said the captain .      ee ee ogg ee .     said the guard .  her arms were trembling .  the screewee didn   t sweat  but this one would probably have liked to .      we   d better tie her up and put her in the cabin     said johnny .      ees .     said the guard .      i could just fire     said sigourney wistfully .      no .     said johnny and the captain together .      eep .     said the guard .      oh  all right .     sigourney relaxed .  the guard sagged .      sorry to be late     said sigourney .     i had a bit of trouble getting to sleep .      the captain said something to the guard in screewee .  she nodded in a strangely human way and trooped obediently into the cabin  where she squatted down just as obediently and let them tie her hands and feet with more bits of bed .      you   ve got a black belt in karate too  i expect     said johnny .      only purple     sigourney said .     but i haven   t been doing it long     she added quickly .     huh .  is that the only kind of knot you can tie .         i went to karate once  with bigmac     said johnny  trying to ignore that .      what happened .         i got my foot caught in my trousers .         and you are the chosen one .  huh .  they could have chosen me .         they tried .  but i was the one who listened     said johnny quietly .   sigourney picked up the gun and cradled it in her arms .      well  i   m here now     she said .     and ready to kick some butt .         some but what .     said johnny wearily .  he really hated the phrase .  it was a game saying .  it tried to fool you into believing that real bullets weren   t going to go through real people .   sigourney sniffed .      nerd .      they went back into the corridor .      by the way     said johnny     what happened to me .         you just collapsed .  right there on the floor .  we   ve got a doctor living next door .  mum went and got her .  unusually bright of her  really .  she said you were just tired out and looked as though you hadn   t been eating properly .         this is true     said the captain .     did i not say .  too much sugar and carbohydrate  not enough fresh vitamins .  you should get out more .         yeah  right     said johnny .   there was something different about the corridor .  before  it had been gray metal  only interesting if you really liked looking at nuts and bolts .  but now it was darker  with more curves  the walls glistened  and dripped menace .  dripped something  anyway .   the captain looked different  too .  she hadn   t changed  exactly   it was just that her teeth and claws were somehow more obvious .  a few minutes ago she had been an intelligent person who just happened to be an eight legged crocodile  now she was an eight legged crocodile who just happened to be intelligent .   game space was changing now that two people were sharing one dream .      hold on  there   s       he began .      don   t let   s hang around     said sigourney .      but you   re       johnny began .   dreaming it wrong  he finished to himself .   this really is nuts  he told himself as he trailed after them .  at home kirsty went around being miss brains .  in here it was all  make my shorts .  eat my day .   the captain waddled at high speed along the corridors .  now steam was dribbling from somewhere  making the floor misty and wet .   there wasn   t that much in the screewee ships .  perhaps they ought to have sat down and worked out the inside of one in a bit more detail before they   d dreamed  he thought .  they could have added more cabins and big screens and interesting things like that  as it was  all there seemed to be were these snaking corridors that were unpleasantly like caves .   bigger caves  though .  they   d got wider .  mysterious passages led off in various directions .   sigourney crept along with her back against the wall  spinning around rapidly every time they passed another passage .  she stiffened .      there   s another one coming .     she hissed .     it   s pushing something .  get back .      she elbowed them into the wall .  johnny could hear the scrape scrape of claws on the floor  and something rattling .      when it gets closer  i   ll get it .  i   ll leap out        johnny poked his head around the corner .      kirsty .      she took no notice .      sigourney .     he tried .      yes .         i know you   re going to leap out     said johnny     but don   t pull the trigger  right .         it   s an alien .         so it   s an alien .  you don   t have to shoot them all .      the rattling got closer .  there was also a faint squeaking .   sigourney gripped the gun excitedly and leaped out .      ok  you   oh   um        it was a very small screewee .  most of its scales were gray .  its crest was nearly worn away .  its tail just dragged behind it .  when it opened its mouth  there were three teeth left and they were huddling together at the back .   it blinked owlishly at them over the top of the cart it had been pushing .  apart from anything else  kirsty had been aiming the gun well above its head .   there was one of those awkward pauses .      around this time     said the captain behind them     the crew on the bridge have a snack brought to them .      johnny leaned forward  nodded at the little old alien  and lifted the lid of the tray that was on the cart .  there were a few bowls of something green and bubbling .  he gently lowered the lid again .      i think you were going to shoot the tea lady     he said .      how was i to know .     kirsty demanded .     it could have been anything .  this is an alien spaceship .  you   re not supposed to get tea ladies .      the captain said something in screewee to the old alien  who shuffled around slowly and went off back down the corridor .  one wheel of the cart kept squeaking .   kirsty was furious .      this isn   t going right .     she hissed .      come on     said johnny .     let   s go to the bridge and get it over with .         i didn   t know it was a tea lady .  that   s your dreaming .         yes  all right .         she had no right to be there .         i suppose even aliens get a bit thirsty in the afternoons .         that   s not what i meant .  they   re supposed to be alien .  that means slavering and claws .  it doesn   t mean sending out for   for a coffee and a jam doughnut .         things are just like they are     said johnny  shrugging .   she turned on him .      why do you just accept everything .  why don   t you ever try to change things .         they   re generally bad enough already     he said .   she leaped ahead and peered around the next corner .      guards .     she said .     and these have got guns .      johnny looked around the corner .  there were two screewee standing in front of a round door .  they were  indeed  armed .      satisfied .     she snapped .     no hint of danish pastries anywhere .  right .  now can i actually shoot something .         no .  i keep telling you .  you have to give them a chance to surrender .         you always make it difficult .      she raised the gun and stepped out .   so did the captain .  she hissed a word in screewee .  the guards looked from her to kirsty  who was squinting along her gun barrel .  one of them hissed something .      she says the gunnery officer has instructed them to shoot anyone who approaches the door     said the captain .      i   ll fire if they move     said kirsty .     i mean it .      the captain spoke in screewee again .  the guards stared at johnny .  they lowered their guns .   suspicion rose inside him .      what did you just tell them .     he said .      i just told them who you were     said the captain .      you said i was the chosen one .      one of the guards was trying to kneel .  that looked very strange in a creature with four legs .   kirsty rolled her eyes .      it   s better than being shot at     said the captain .     i   ve been shot at a lot .  i know what i am talking about .         tell her to get up     said johnny .     what do we do now .  who   s on the bridge .         most of the officers     said the captain .     the guard says there have been   arguments .  gunfire .         that   s more like it .     said kirsty .   they looked at the door .      ok     said johnny .     let   s go    .      the captain motioned one of the guards aside and touched a plate by the door .       humans .      johnny saw it all in one long  long second .   firstly  the bridge was big .  it seemed to be the size of a soccer field .  and at one end there was a screen  which looked almost as big .  he felt like an ant standing in front of a tv set .   the screen was covered with green dots .   players .  heading for the fleet .   there were hundreds of them .   right in front of the screen was a horseshoe shaped bank of controls  with a dozen seats ranged in front of it .   it   s here  he thought .  when i was sitting in my room playing  they were in here in this great shadowy room  steering their ship  firing back    .   only one seat was occupied now .  its occupant was already standing up  half turning  reaching for something    .      go ahead     said kirsty .     make my stardate .      the gunnery officer froze  glaring at them .      too late     he said .     you   re too late .     he waved a claw toward the screen .     i   ve taken us back to where we belong .  there is no time to turn us around again .  you must fight now .      he focused on johnny .     what   s that .     he said .      the chosen one     said the captain  starting to walk forward .  the others followed her .      but we must fight     said the gunnery officer .     for honor .  the honor of the screewee .  that   s what we are for .      johnny   s foot touched something .  he looked down .  now that his eyes had become accustomed to the gloom  he could see that he   d almost tripped over a screewee .  it was dead .  nothing with a hole like that in it could have been alive .   kirsty was looking down too .  johnny could see other shapes on the floor in the shadows .      he   s been killing sc   people     he whispered .   shoot them in space  shoot them on a screen  and there was just an explosion and five points on the score total .  when they   d been shot from a few yards away  then there was simply a reminder that someone who had been alive was now  very definitely  not alive anymore .  and would never be again .   he looked up at the gunnery officer .  screewee were cold blooded and a long way from being human  but this one had a look about it   about him   that suggested a mind running off into madness .   there was a silvery sheen on his scales .  johnny found himself wondering if the screewee changed color  like chameleons .  the captain had always looked more golden when she was acting normally  and became almost yellow when she was worried    .   she was the color of lemons now .   she hissed something .  the guards looked at her in surprise but turned and filed obediently off the bridge .  then she turned to the gunnery officer .      you killed all of them .     she said  softly .      they tried to stop me .  it is a matter of honor .         yes  yes .  i can see that     said the captain  in a level voice .  she was shifting position slightly now  moving away from the humans .      a screewee dies fighting or not at all .     shouted the gunnery officer .   the captain   s scales had faded to the color of old paper .      yes  i understand  i understand     she said .     and the humans understand too  don   t you .      the gunnery officer turned his head .  the captain spread her arms  opened her mouth  and leaped .  the male must have sensed her  he turned  claws whirring through the air .   johnny reached out and caught kirsty   s gun as she raised it .      no .  you might hit her .         why   d she do that .  i could easily have shot him .  so could the guards .  why just jump at him like that .      the fighters were a whirling ball of claws and tails .      it   s personal .  i think she hates him too much     he said .     but look at the screen .      there were more green dots .  red figures that might have meant something to a screewee were scrolling up on one side too fast for a human to read .   he looked down at the controls .      they   re getting closer .  we   ve got to do something .      kirsty stared at the controls too .  the seats were made to fit a screewee .  so were the controls themselves .      well  do you know what means .     she said .     fast .  slow .  fire .  the cigarette lighter .      the fighters had broken apart and were circling each other  hissing .  the green and red light from the screen threw unpleasant shadows .   neither screewee was paying the humans the least attention .  they couldn   t afford to .  screewee walked like ducks and looked like cartoon crocodiles  but they fought like cats   it was mainly watching and snarling with short  terrible blurs of attack and defense .   a light started to flash on the panel and an alarm rang .  it rang in screewee  but it was still pretty urgent even in human .   the captain spun around .  the gunnery officer jumped backward  hit the ground running  and sped toward the door .  he was through it in a blur .      he can   t go anywhere     said the captain  staggering across to the controls .     i   can deal with him later    .         you   ve got some nasty scratches     said kirsty .  screewee blood was blue .     i know some first aid    .         a lot  i expect     said johnny .      but not for screewee  i imagine     said the captain .  her chest was heaving .  one of her legs seemed to be at the wrong angle .  blue patches covered her tail .      you could have just shot him     said kirsty .     it was stupid to fight like that .         honor .     snarled the captain .  she tripped a switch with a claw and hissed some instructions in screewee .     but he was right .  sadly  i know this now .  there is no changing screewee nature .  our destiny is to fight and die .  i have been foolish to think otherwise .      she blinked .      take off your shirt     kirsty demanded .      what .     said johnny .      your shirt .  your shirt .  look at her .  she   s losing blood .  she needs bandaging .      johnny obeyed  reluctantly .      you   ve got an undershirt on .  only grandads wear undershirts .  yuck .  don   t you ever wash your clothes .      he did  sometimes .  and occasionally his mother had a burst of being a mother and everything in the house got washed .  but usually he used the wash basket laundry  which consisted of going through the basket until he found something that didn   t seem all that bad .      but she said you wouldn   t know anything about screewee medicine     he said .      so what .  even if it   s blue  blood   s still blood .  you should try to keep it inside .      kirsty helped the captain to a chair .  the alien was swaying a bit  and her scales had gone white  speckled with blue .      is there anything i can do .     said johnny .   kirsty glanced at him .     i don   t know     she said .     is there anything you can do .      she turned back to the captain .   we   ll all die  johnny thought .  they   re all out there waiting .  and here   s me at the controls of the main alien ship .  we can   t turn around now .  and i can   t even read what it says on the controls .   i   ve done it all wrong .  it was all simple  and now it   s all complicated .   you think about doing things in dreams  but we   re always wrong about dreams .  when people talk about dreams they mean daydreams .  that   s where you   re superman or whatever .  that   s where you win everything .  in dreams everything is weird .  i   m in a dream now .  or something like a dream .  and when i wake up  all the screewee will be back in game space and they   ll be shot at again  just like the space invaders .   hang on    .   hang on    .   he stared at the meaningless controls again .   on one of them the symbols rearranged themselves to form    main engines .      this is my world  too .  it   s in my head .   he looked up at the big screen .   all of them .  they   re all there  waiting .  in bedrooms and dens around the world .  in between watching cobbers and doing their homework .   all waiting with their fingers on the fire button  and each one thinking that they   re the only one    .   all there  in front of me    .      i wasn   t expecting to do this     said kirsty behind him .     i wasn   t expecting to be bandaging aliens .  put a claw on this knot  will you .  what   s your pulse level .         i don   t think we have them     said the captain .   the ship thumped .   the distant background rumble of the engines was suddenly a roar .   the seats had bits sticking up where humans didn   t expect bits to stick up .  johnny was sitting cross legged on one  both hands on the controls  face multicolored in the light of the screen .   kirsty tapped him on the shoulder .     what are you doing .         flying     said johnny  without turning his head .      he said it   s too late to turn around .         i   m not turning around .         you don   t know how to fly one of these .         i   m not flying one of these .  i   m flying the whole fleet .         you can   t understand the controls .      green and red light made patterns on his face as he turned to her .      you know  everyone tells me things .  all the time     he said .     well  i   m not listening now .  i can read the controls .  why not .  they   re in my head .  now sit down .  i shall need you to do some things .  and stop talking to me as if i   m stupid .      she sat down  almost hypnotized by his tone of voice .      but how           there   s a control that lets this ship steer all the others as well .  it   s used on long voyages .     he moved a lever .     and i   m flying them as fast as i can .  i don   t think they can go any faster .  all the dials have gone into the    that   s screewee for red .         but you   re heading straight for the players .         i   ve got to .  there isn   t time to turn around    .          wobbler had a pinup over his bed .  it was a close up photograph of the intel            microprocessor  taken through a microscope  it looked like a street map of a very complicated modern city .  his grandfather complained that it was unhealthy and why didn   t he have a double page spread from giggles and garters instead  but wobbler had a vision  one day  if he could master basic math and reliably pick up a soldering iron by the end that wasn   t hot  he was going to be a big man in computers .  a number one programmer  with his hair in a ponytail at the back like they all wore .  never mind about yo less saying it was all run by men in suits these days .  one day the world would hear from wobbler johnson   probably via a phone line it didn   t know was connected to its computer .   in the meantime  he was staring at columns of numbers in an effort to make a completely illegal copy of mr .  bunky goes boing .  it had been given four stars and declared    megabad .  .  .      which was what splaaaaatttt .  magazine still thought meant pretty good if you were under sixteen .   he blinked at the screen and smeared the grease on his glasses a bit more evenly .   and that was enough for tonight .   he sat back  and his eye caught sight of only you can save mankind under a pile of other disks .   poor old rubber .  of course  you called people crazy all the time  but there was something weird about him .  his body walked around down on earth  but his brain was probably somewhere you couldn   t find with an atlas .   wobbler shoved the disk into the drive .  odd about the game  though .  there was probably a logical reason for it .  that   s what computers were  logical .  start believing anything else and you were in trouble .   the title came up  and then the bit that gobi software had stolen from star wars  and then     his jaw dropped .   ships .  hundreds of them .  getting bigger and bigger .  yellow ships filling the screen so that it was just black and yellow and just yellow and then blinding white     wobbler ducked .   and then a black screen .   almost black  anyway .   for a moment the words hung there     hi  wobler        and then vanished .       more alarms were clanging and whooping .   kirsty peered out from between her fingers .      i don   t think we hit anyone     said johnny  tapping on the keys .      you flew straight through them .         that   s right .         ok  but they   ll still come after us .         so now we turn around .  it   ll take a little while .  how   s the captain .      a clawed hand gripped the back of his chair  and her snout rested on his shoulder .      this is very bad     said the captain .     our engines are not designed to run at this sort of speed for any length of time .  they could break down at any moment .         it   s a calculated risk     said johnny .      really .  how precisely did you calculate it .     said the screewee .      well   not exactly calculate   i just thought it was worth a try     said johnny .      you   re turning back toward the players .         and we   re still accelerating     said johnny .      what were you typing just then .     said kirsty .      oh  nothing     said johnny  grinning .     just thought i saw someone i recognized .  you know  as we flashed past .         why are you looking so happy .     she demanded .     we   re in terrible trouble .         dunno .  because it   s my trouble  i suppose .  captain  why have all those lights over there come on .         they   re the ships of the fleet     said the captain .     the commanders want to know what   s happening .         tell them to hold on to something     said johnny .     and tell them   tell them they   re going home .      they both looked at him .      oh  yes  very impressive     said kirsty .     very dramatic .  all very           shut up .         what .         shut up     said johnny again  his eyes not leaving the screen .      no one tells me to shut up .         i   m telling you now .  just because you   ve got a mind like a  a hammer doesn   t mean you have to treat everyone else like a nail .  now   here they come again    .          wobbler took the disk out of the drive and looked at it .  then he felt around the back of his computer in case there were any extra wires .   that johnny   he was the quiet type .  he always said that all he knew about computers was how to switch them on  but everyone knew about computers .  he   d probably messed around with the game and given it back .  pretty good .  wobbler wondered how he   d done it .   he put the disk back in and started the game again .   only you can save mankind   yeah  yeah .   then the inside of the starship .  missiles  guns  score total  yeah  yeah     and stars ahead .  the sparkly ones you got in the game .  he   d done much better ones for voyage to alpha centauri .   no ships to be seen .   he picked up the joystick and moved it  watching the stars spin as the ship turned     there was a ship right behind him .  very much behind him .  dozens of ships  again .  hundreds of ships .  all getting bigger .  much bigger .  very quickly .   very  very quickly .   again .   when he got up off the floor and put the leg back on the chair  the screen was all black again  except for the little flashing cursor .   wobbler stared at it .   logic  he said .  not believing in logical reasons was almost as bad as dropping hot solder onto a nylon sock .  there had to be a logical explanation .   one day  he   d think of one .          they   re following us .  they   re following us .      little coils of smoke were coming up from the controls .  there were all sorts of vibrations in the floor .      i   m pretty sure we can outrun them     said johnny .      how sure .     said kirsty .      pretty sure .      kirsty turned to the captain .      have we got any rear guns .      the captain nodded .      they can be fired from here     she said .     but we should not do that .  we have surrendered  remember .         i haven   t     said kirsty .     which one fires the guns .         the stick with the button on the top .         this .  it   s just like a game joystick     she said .      of course it is     said johnny .     this is in our heads  remember .  it has to be things we know .      the screen showed the view behind the fleet .  there were green ships bunched up behind them .      they   re coming right down our tailpipe     said kirsty .     this is going to be really easy .         yes  it is   isn   t it     said johnny .   there was a dull edge to his voice .  she hesitated .      what do you mean .     she said .      just dots in the middle of a circle     said johnny .     it   s easy .  bang .  here comes the high score .  bang .  go ahead .         but it   s game space .  it   s a game .  why are you acting like that .  it   s just something on a screen .         fine .  just like the real thing .  press the button  then .      she gripped the stick .  then she paused again .      why do you have to spoil everything .         me .     said johnny vaguely .     look  if you   re not going to fire  switch the screen back to what   s ahead of us  will you .  this dial here says we   re moving at per  and that   s times faster than it says we ought to be going .         well .         well  i just think it   d be nice not to run into an asteroid or something .  of course  if you want us to end up five miles across and one inch thick  keep looking back .         oh  all right .      she took her finger off the screen switch .   and then she gasped .   they stared at the expanse of space ahead of them  and what was in the middle of it .      what     said kirsty  after a long pause     is that .      johnny laughed .   he tried to stop himself  because the ship was groaning and creaking like a tortured thing  but he couldn   t .  tears ran down his cheeks .  he thumped his hand helplessly on the control panel  accidentally switching a few lights on and off .      it   s the border     said the captain .      yes     said johnny .     of course it is .         but it   s       kirsty began .      yes     said johnny .     the border  see .  beyond it they   re safe .  of course .  no one crosses the border .  humans can   t do it .         it can   t be natural .         who knows .  this is game space  after all .  it   s probably natural here .  i mean  we   ve all seen it before .         but it is still a very long way off     said the captain .     i fear that        there was a dull explosion somewhere behind them .      missiles .     said kirsty .     you should have let me           no  listen     said johnny .     listen .         what to .  i can   t hear anything .         that   s because something   s making a lot of silence     said johnny .     the engines have stopped .         the engines have probably melted     said the captain .      we   ve still got   what is it   momentum or inertia or one of those things     said johnny .     we   ll keep going until we hit something .         or something hits us     said kirsty .   she looked at the border again .      how big is that thing .     she said .      it must be huge     said johnny .      but there   s stars beyond it .         not our stars .  i told you  that   s one place humans can   t go    .      they looked at each other .      what happens then     kirsty began  like someone exploring a particularly nasty hole in a tooth     if we   re on a ship that tries to go past the border .      they both turned to the captain  who shrugged .      don   t ask me     she said .     it   s never happened .  it is impossible .      now all three of them turned to look at the border again .      is it just me .     said kirsty     or is it just a little bit bigger .      there was some silence .      still     said johnny     what   s the worst that can happen to us .      then he wished he hadn   t said that .  he remembered thinking he   d hear the alarm clock waking him up  that very first time  and then he recalled the shock of realizing that he wasn   t being allowed to wake up at all .      you know  i don   t want to find out     he added .      without engines  we cannot turn the ship around     said the captain .     i am sorry .  you were too eager to save us .         it is getting bigger     said kirsty .     you can tell  if you watch the stars behind it .         i am sorry     said the captain again .      at least the screewee should make it     said johnny .      i am sorry .      kirsty stood up .     well  i   m not     she said .     come on .      she picked up the gun and strode away into the shadows .  johnny ran after her .      where do you think you   re going .         to the escape capsule     she said .      what escape capsule .         indeed     said the captain  scuttling after them     i ask that too .  there is no such thing .         there can be if we want there to be     said kirsty  opening the door .     you said the game is made up of things we know .  well  i know it   ll be right down under the ship .         but           it   s my dream as well as yours  right .  believe me .  there   ll be an escape capsule .     her eyes had that gleam again .  she hefted the gun .     i know it     she said .     i   ve been there .      he remembered her room .  he could picture her sitting there  with a dozen sharp pencils and no friends  getting top marks in her history homework  while in her head she was chasing aliens .      i cannot understand     said the captain .   the corridor outside was full of steam .  the ship might cross the border  but it was going to have to have a lot of repairs before it ever came back .      um     said johnny .     it   s a bit like the models in the cereal boxes .  it   s   kind of a human idea .      the screewee hesitated in the doorway .  then she turned to look at the screen .      we are getting closer     she said .     if you think there is something there  then you must go now .         come on .     said kirsty .      uh       johnny began .      thank you     said the captain gravely .      i haven   t really done much     said johnny .      who knows .  you never thought of yourself .  you tried to work things out .  you made choices .  and i chose well .         and now we must go .     said kirsty .      perhaps we shall meet again .  afterward .  if all goes well     said the captain .  she took one of johnny   s hands in two of her own .      good bye     she said .   kirsty caught johnny   s shoulder and dragged him away .      nice to have met you     she said to the alien .     sort of   interesting .  come on  you .      some of the lights had gone out .  the corridors were full of steam and vague shapes .  kirsty ran on ahead  darting from shadow to shadow .      we   ll have to go down     she said over her shoulder .     it   ll be there .  don   t worry .         you   re really into this  aren   t you .     said johnny .      here   s a ramp .  come on .  we can   t have much time .      there was another passage below that  and another ramp  curling away down through the steam .   they came out in a room bigger than the bridge .  there was a very large double door at one end  and banks of equipment around the walls .  and  in the middle  standing on three landing legs  was a small ship .  it had a stubby  heavy look .      there .  see .  what did i tell you .     said kirsty triumphantly .   johnny walked over to the nearest equipment panel and touched it .  it was sticky .  he looked at his fingertips .      it hasn   t been here long     he said .     the paint   s not dry .      a screen in the middle of the panel lit up  showing the captain   s face .      how interesting     she said .     i look down at my controls and discover a new one .  you have found your escape capsule .         it looks like it     said johnny .      we have ten minutes until we reach the border     said the captain .     you should have plenty of time .      there was a whirring noise behind johnny .  the escape capsule   s ramp was coming down .      i found a switch on the landing leg     said kirsty .   he joined her .  the ramp was a silvery gray color .  it gleamed in the misty blue light that streamed down from inside the capsule .      can you guess what i   m thinking .     said kirsty .      you   re thinking  we haven   t seen the gunnery officer lately     said johnny .     you   re thinking  he   ll be in there somewhere  hiding .  because this part is your dream  and that   s how your dream works .         only i   ll be ready for him     said sigourney .     come on .      she sidled up the ramp  turning constantly in a series of small excited hops to keep the gun pointed at any teeth that might suddenly appear .   there were two seats in the capsule in front of a very small control panel .  there was a big window .  there were a couple of small cupboards .  and there wasn   t much of anything else .   kirsty pointed to a cupboard and made a gesture to johnny to open it .  she raised her gun .   he opened the door and stood back quickly .   kirsty seriously menaced a stack of cans .   she caught johnny   s expression .      well  he could have been in there     she said .      oh  yes .  sure .  admittedly he   d have to stop to cut his arms and legs off and then curl up really small  but he could have been in there .         hah .  smart comment .         why not try looking under the seat cushions .  it   s amazing what gets down behind them .      kirsty tried to prod behind the control panel without johnny noticing .  he noticed .      maybe aliens don   t watch the same kinds of films we watch .     he said .      all right  all right  no need to go on about it     she snarled .  she looked at the controls and pressed a switch .  the hatch swung up .  the captain   s face appeared on a small screen in the middle of the panel .      eight minutes to the border     she said .      right     said kirsty .  she shoved a hand down behind her seat cushion and then looked at johnny   s grin .      you see aliens everywhere  don   t you     he said .      what   s that supposed to mean .         nothing .  nothing .  just a thought .      she glowered at him .   there were seat belts .  they put them on .  kirsty started to drum her fingers on the panel .  she seemed to be looking for something .      how do we open the doors .     said johnny .      all right  all right   it   s got to be here somewhere .      she pressed a button .  behind them  the ramp rose up and hissed into place .   johnny looked around .  there really was nowhere for anyone to hide .  they were aboard the escape craft .  they were safe .   he didn   t feel safe .  he grabbed kirsty   s arm .      wait a minute     he said urgently .     i think something   s wro        the screen flickered into life .   there was a screewee there .   it was the gunnery officer .      run and hide  human scum     he said .   they could see the screen behind him  he was on the bridge .      you .  where is the captain .     said johnny .      she will be dealt with .  while you run away .         no .      kirsty nudged him .      look  the screewee are safe     she said .     the border is only a few minutes away .  we   ve done it all .  you can   t chase around after her now .  she   ll have to take her chances .  that   s what she   d say if you asked her .         but i can   t ask her  can i .      he reached over and pushed a switch .  there was a whirring behind them as the ramp slid down .      i   m going back up there     he said .      he   ll be waiting for you .         fine .     he picked up the alien gun .     which bit   s the trigger .      she rolled her eyes .     this is stupid .         scared  are you .     said johnny .  his face was pale .      me .     she shrugged and snatched the gun .     i   ll take this     she said .     i   m used to guns .  you   ll only make a mess of it .          just like the real thing     they ran down the ramp and back to the corridor .      got a watch on .     said johnny .      yes .  we   ve got more than six minutes .         i should have known .     said johnny as they ran .     no one gets that long to escape .  james bond never turns up with enough time to have a cup of coffee and clean his shoes before he disarms the time bomb .  we   re playing games again .         calm down .         if we find a cat  i   m going to kick it .      the corridors were darker .  water dripped from the ceiling .  there was still some steam hissing out of broken pipes .   they reached a junction .      which way .      kirsty pointed .      that way .         are you sure .         of course .      they disappeared into the gloom .   about thirty seconds later they reappeared  running .      oh  yes  of course .         well  they all look the same  actually .  it must be this way .      this one did lead to the wide corridor with the door to the bridge at the far end .   it was open .  they could see the blue and white flickering of the big screen .   kirsty changed her grip on the gun .      o kay     she said .     no messing about this time  right .  no talking .         all right .         let   s go .         how .         you walk in there .  when he leaps out at you  i   ll get him .         oh .  i   m bait  am i .      kirsty glanced at her wrist .      you   ve got four and half minutes to think of something better     she said .     oh  sorry .  four minutes and twenty five seconds .  hang on  that   s twenty seconds now    .         i just hope you   re good .      kirsty patted the gun .     regional champion  remember .  trust me .      johnny walked toward the open doorway .  he tried to swivel his eyes both ways as he reached it .      four minutes and fifteen seconds     said her voice far  far behind him .   he halted on the threshold .      how come you weren   t national champion .     he asked .      i had food poisoning on the day  actually .         oh .  right .      he stepped through .   multitoothed death failed to happen to him .  he risked a better look to either side and then  swallowing  upward as well .      nothing here     he said .      ok .  i   m right behind you .      on the screen the border was already much bigger .  we   re traveling very fast  he thought  and it   s still more than four minutes away  and already it   s filling the sky .  huge isn   t the word for it .      i can see all around the room     he said .     no one   s here .         there was a control panel  wasn   t there .     said kirsty .     hang on   i   m in the doorway now .  yes .  he   s got to be behind the controls .  go ahead .  i   m ready if he leaps out .      i   m not  johnny thought .  he sidled across the floor until he could just see behind the bank of instruments .      there   s noth   hold it .         what .         i think it   s the captain .         is it alive .         she .  she   s a she .  you know she   s a she .  i can   t tell .  she   s just   lying there .  i   ll have a look .         what good would that do .         i   m going to have a look  all right .         careful  then .  stay where i can keep an eye on you .      he moved forward  searching the shadows around the edge of the huge room .   it was the captain  and she was alive .  at least  bits of what was probably her chest were going up and down .  he knelt beside her .      captain .     he whispered .   she opened one eye .      chosen one .         what happened .         he was   waiting .  while i   talked to you   he crept in   hit me    .         where   d he go then .         you   must   go .  not much time   left .  the fleet   is           you   re hurt .  i   ll get ki   sigourney over here        her claw gripped his arm .      listen to me .  he   s going   to blow up the   ship .  the fuel   the power plant   he   s        johnny stood up .      is she all right .     kirsty called out .      i don   t know .      she was standing in the doorway  outlined against the light .   there was a shadow behind her .  as johnny watched  it spread its arms .   it was bigger than a screewee should be .  it wasn   t a funny alligator   there was still a suggestion of alligator there  but now there was insect  too  and other things   things that had never existed outside of dreams    .   johnny shouted     he   s behind you .     then he lowered his head and ran .   kirsty turned .   you can   t trust dreams .  if you live inside them  they   ll turn on you  carry you along    .   he saw kirsty turn and look up  and up  at the gunnery officer .   the screewee opened his mouth .  there were more teeth than he   d had before  rows and rows of them  and every one glistening and sharp .   her dream  johnny thought .  no wonder she always fights .      shoot it .  shoot it .      she was just staring .  she didn   t seem to want to move .      you   ve got the gun .     he screamed .   she was like a statue .      shoot it .            oh        kirsty shook her head vaguely and then  as if she   d suddenly clicked awake  raised the gun .      ok     she said .     now        the screewee ignored her .  he jerked his head up and focused on johnny .  he hardly had eyes now .  the alien seemed to be looking at johnny with its teeth .      ah .  the chosen one     it said .  he slapped kirsty out of the way .  she couldn   t even have seen his arm move .  one moment she was aiming  and the next she was lifted into the air and dropping in a heap a few yards away .   the gun clattered onto the floor and slid toward johnny .      chosen one .     hissed the screewee .     foolish .  we are what we are .  you disgrace your race and mine .  for you  and her   for you  there   s no going back    .      kirsty was trying to get to her feet  her face contorted with anger .   johnny reached down and picked up the gun .   the screewee waved two arms in a sudden movement .  johnny flinched .   he heard  from a long way away  kirsty call out     quick .  throw it to me .  to me .      the alien smiled .   johnny backed away a little .  the alien was concentrating entirely on him .      to me  you idiot .     shouted kirsty .      you .     said the alien to johnny .     shoot me .  you can   t .  such weakness .  like your captain .  a disgrace to the screewee .  always weak .  and that is why you want peace .  the strong never want peace .      johnny raised the gun .   the alien moved forward  slowly .  his teeth seemed to fill the world .  his arms seemed longer  his claws sharper .      you cannot     he said .     i   ve watched you .  at least the other humans could fight .  we could die honorably .  but you   you talk and talk   you   d do anything rather than fight .  you   d do anything but face the truth .  you save mankind .  hah .      johnny stepped back again  and felt the edge of the control desk behind him .  there was no more retreating .      will you surrender .     he said .      never .      johnny saw a movement out of the corner of his eye .  kirsty was going to try to leap on the thing .  but the alien wasn   t like the guards now .  she wouldn   t stand a     he fired .   there was a small  sharp explosion .   the screewee looked down in shock at the sudden blue stain spreading across his overall  and then back up to johnny almost in bewilderment .      you shot me   in cold blood           no .  my blood   s never cold .      the alien toppled forward .  and now he was smaller again  more like a screewee .      and i had to     said johnny .      you shot him     said the voice behind him .  he looked around .  the captain had pulled herself to her feet .      yes .         you had to .  but i didn   t think you could    .      johnny looked down at the gun .  his knuckles were white .  with some difficulty  he managed to persuade his fingers to let go .      i didn   t think i could  either .      he walked over to kirsty  who was staring at the thing on the floor .      wow     she said  but quietly .      yes     he said .      you           yes  i shot him .  i shot him .  i wish i didn   t have to  but i had to .  he was alive and now he isn   t .     there were more alarms sounding now  and red lights flashing on the control panel .  on the screen  the border completely filled the sky .     can we go .  how much longer have we got left .      she looked hazily at her watch .      a minute and a half .      he was amazed .  he felt he was sitting inside his own head  watching himself .  there wasn   t any panic .  the one who was watching didn   t know what to do  but the one outside seemed to know everything .  it was   like a dream .      can you run .     she nodded .     really fast .  what am i saying .  you   ve probably won medals .  come on .      he pulled her after him  out of the bridge and along the dark corridors .  kirsty was hardly concentrating anymore  the walls glistened less .  there were even nuts and bolts again .   they reached the capsule .  johnny ran from leg to leg until he found the button that let down the ramp .  it seemed to take ages to come down .      how long .         we   ve got fifty seconds        up the ramp  into the seats .   there weren   t many controls .  johnny peered at them .      what are you doing .     said kirsty .      like you said before .  looking for one marked    doors open .         the screen flickered into life .      johnny .  the doors open from up here     said the captain .   johnny glanced up at kirsty .      we didn   t know that     he said .      is the ramp back up .         yes .         doors opening .      there was a clonk ahead of them  and a hiss as the air in the hall escaped through the widening crack .  the twinkling  unreal stars of game space beckoned them .   johnny   s hand hovered over the biggest red button on the panel .      johnny .         yes  captain .         thank you .  you did not have to help us .         if not me  then who else .         hah .  yes .  and now   good bye .  we will not   meet again .         good bye .      johnny looked at kirsty .      how long .         ten seconds .         let   s go .      he hit the button .   there was a boom behind them .  the walls flashed past .  and suddenly they were surrounded by space .   johnny leaned back against the seat .  his mind was blank  empty  except for something that kept on replaying itself like a piece of film .   over and over again  his memory fired the gun .  over and over again  the alien collapsed .  action replay .  pinpoint precision .  just like the real thing .   kirsty nudged him .      can we steer it .         hmm .  what .     he looked vaguely at the controls .     well  there   s this joystick           turn us around  then .  i want to watch them go through .         yes .  me too .          the capsule turned gently in the deep void of game space  right up against the border .   the screewee fleet hurtled past .  as each ship reached the border  it flickered and faded .      do you think they   ve got a planet to go to  really .         i think they think so .         do you think they   ll ever be back .         not now .         um   look   when i looked up and i saw that thing   i mean  it was so real .  and i thought  but it   s alive  it   s living  how can i           yes     said johnny .      and then it was dead and   and i didn   t feel like cheering    .         yes .         when it   s real  it   s not easy .  because people die and it   s really over .         yes .  i know .  over and over .  d   you know what .         what .         my friend yo less thinks dreams like this are a way of dealing with real life .         yes .         i think it   s the other way around .         yo less is the black one .         yes .  we call him yo less because he   s not cool .         anticool   s quite cool too .         is it .  i didn   t know that .  is it still cool to say    well wicked    .         johnny .  it was never cool to say    well wicked .            how about    vode    .         vode   s cool .         i just made it up .      the capsule drifted onward .      no reason it can   t be cool  though .         right .      game stars glittered .      johnny .         yes .         how come you get on with people so well .  how come people always talk to you .         dunno .  because i listen  i suppose .  and it helps to be stupid .         johnny .         still here .         what did you mean   you know  back there .  when you said i see aliens everywhere .         um .  can   t remember .         you must have meant something .         i   m not even sure there are aliens .  only different kinds of us .  but i know what the important thing is .  the important thing is to be exactly sure about what you   re doing .  the important thing is to remember it   s not a game .  none of it .  even the games .      the ship became a dot against the night .      what do we do to get home .  i   ve always had to die to get out .         you can get out if you win .         there   s a green button here .         worth a try  yes .         right .          light was streaming into the room when johnny woke up .  he lay in someone else   s bed and looked around through half closed eyes .   it was like all spare rooms everywhere .  there was the lamp that was a bit old fashioned and didn   t fit in anywhere else .  there was the bookcase with the books that no one read much .  there was a lack of small things  apart from an ashtray on the bedside table .   there was a clock  but at some time in the past the power had gone off for a while  and although people must have sorted out every other clock in the house  they   d forgotten about this one  so it just sat and flashed      continuously  day and night .  but an absence of sound from below suggested that it was still early in the morning .   he snuggled down  treasuring this time stolen between dreaming and waking .   so   what next .  he   d have to talk to kirsty  who dreamed of being sigourney and forgot that she was trying to be someone who was acting .  and he had a suspicion that he   d see his parents before long .  he was probably going to be talked at a lot  but at least that   d make a change .   these were still trying times .  there was still school .  nothing actually was better  probably .  no one was doing anything with a magic wand .   but the fleet had got away .  compared to that  everything else was   well  not easy .  but less like a wall and more like steps .   you might never win  but at least you could try .  if not you  who else .   he turned over and went back to sleep .       the border hung in the sky .   huge white letters  thousands of miles high .   they spelled       and the fleet roared past .  tankers  battleships  fighters   they soared and rolled  their shadows streaking across the letters as ship after ship escaped  forever .       about the author     terry pratchett   s novels have
