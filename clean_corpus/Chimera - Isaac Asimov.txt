the hour the instant he saw the hole cut in the wall of the cafeteria at the seth canobil hospice center  where he worked .  his irritation turned quickly to confusion  then embarrassment  and finally fear .  he walked up to the opening and reached out to touch the edge  but withdrew his fingers centimeters from brushing the too smooth cut .  in the flat light it shone mirror bright .      ah .  .  .     he said  looking around .  the police officers who had brought him here stood impassively  their faces professionally expressionless .  director ortalf looked around at the people milling about the area .  they moved in groups of threes and fours  some in uniform  most in civilian clothes .  ortalf started at the sight of a drone moving slowly across the floor  its sensors inspecting every centimeter of the tiles .      forensic     explained a deep  male voice nearby .   ortalf looked around .  a tall man in somber gray was watching him  his face as ambivalent as everyone else   s  except for his eyes  which glistened expectantly .      ah     ortalf said again .     are you .  .  .  .         mr .  ortalf      the man said  ignoring the question .     director ortalf .         yes .         you run this facility .      ortalf nodded sharply .     what is going on .  who   .         a routine maintenance monitor detected a power outage here     the man explained .     according to its logs  this was listed as a class b primary site .  it attempted to restore the lines  but found irregularities .  it then alerted the local authorities .          power outage .  .  . but we have a back up .         had .         redundant system .  .  . had .         how many people work here  director ortalf .     the man  who must be some sort of inspector  ortalf surmised  walked away  forcing ortalf to catch up and walk with him .      um .  .  . six permanent staff     he said .   the man paused briefly  then continued walking .     i understand you have nearly three thousand wards here .       ortalf tried to think .     your people got me out of bed not even half an hour ago  inspector .  i haven   t had time to shower  to get breakfast  to  three thousand .  yes  that sounds about right .         and only six staff .         six permanent staff  i said .  we have several interns and part time volunteers  but even so  almost everything is automated .      they left the cafeteria and started down a long corridor .  emergency lights glowed dimly along the floor and ceiling  even though the regular lights were on .      who was on call tonight .     the inspector asked .      i don   t  please  inspector  what is going on .      at the end of the corridor a short set of stairs led down into a nurse   s station .  banks of screens showed a bright orange stand by flashing on them .  ortalf   s gnawing apprehension worsened .  he moved toward the main console  but the inspector gripped his upper arm tightly .      please don   t touch anything .  who was on call tonight .         i don   t remember .  joquil  i think .  yes  kilif joquil .      the inspector gestured toward a door that opened at the rear of the station .  ortalf pushed it wide open .  sprawled over the cot that hugged one wall of the cubicle lay a large body  face down .   ortalf thought for a moment that the man was dead .  but a sudden  labored breath heaved through the torso .  dread gave way to impatience .      what is going on .     the director demanded .   the inspector nodded toward the sleeping male nurse .     did you know kilif joquil used brethe .         what .  now look       the inspector aimed a long finger at the nightstand at the head of the cot .  ortalf stared at its contents for a long time before he recognized the inhaler and an unlabeled vial .      we screen our people carefully     he said weakly .      i   m sure you do .       ortalf looked at the inspector .     habits can start any time .  we scan every six months .       the nurse shifted in the cot again  then lay still .  ortalf turned and left .  the inspector said nothing  just followed  as the director headed for the door to the first ward .   ortalf stopped at the entrance .  the room stretched  nearly a hundred meters on a side  dwarfing the half dozen or so strangers now wandering the aisles of matreches .  ortalf searched the field of metal and plastic  looking for the telltale difference  a flaw  damage  a sign of disruption .  his pulse raced .      not this one     the inspector said quietly  just behind him .     number five .        ward five was two levels down .  ortalf   s breathing came hard when he reached it .  twice the size of the first level wards  it contained the same number of matreches .  these  however  were larger  more complex .  more was demanded of them  the lives within required special care .   ortalf spotted the damaged units at once .  he staggered toward them  dodging down a jagged path between the intact incubators  till he reached the first one .   sticky fluid covered the floor around it .  the shell had been removed and the sac within punctured .  ortalf expected to see an asphyxiated  dehydrated corpse in the bed  but the cradle was empty .  the tubes of the support system lay severed and useless on the cushions  a couple of them still oozing liquids .  ortalf made to reach in  but hesitated  touch would tell him the same as sight  that the child was gone .  he looked around  confused and close to panic .  nearby he saw two more violated matreches .      but .  .  . but .  .  .     he stopped when he found the inspector watching him .     i don   t understand     ortalf said finally .   the inspector came to a conclusion .  concerning what  ortalf could not be sure  but he recognized the change in the inspector   s face  from glassy hardness to near pity .  the inspector nodded and gestured for them to return to the administration level .   ortalf let himself be escorted back  dazed .  he barely noticed the people and machines that roamed through his facility .  police  forensic units  specialists  insurance adjustors  too  for all he knew  and within hours the lawyers would be calling .   the inspector brought him to his own office and closed the door .      what   s happened .     ortalf asked .  he had wanted to make it a demand  but it came out as a pale  exhausted gasp .      i   d frankly hoped you might be able to tell me  director ortalf .  but .  .  .     he sat on the edge of ortalf   s desk and gazed down at him .  some of the hardness had returned  but mixed now with sympathy .      from what we   ve been able to reconstruct so far  the entire clinic was severed from outside communications .  there was one independent oversight program with a direct line to your maintenance chief  but after ten minutes even that was cut .  most of it went down with the power .  you may well have a number of fatalities to deal with .  i   m not sure how critical these systems are to each unit          each matreche has its own power unit to protect from a complete outage .          so i gathered from the manufacturer   s specs .  are they all up to par .         so far as i know .  you   d have to ask our maintenance supervisor  kromis          we   d love to  but we can   t find her .         she .  .  . have you been to her apartment .         police are there now .  i   d like to have her employment file when you get a moment .  in fact  we   ll want the employment files on all your people  even the consultants  interns  and part timers .         do you really think it could have been one of my people .         not alone  no .  but it   s clear that whoever it was had a thorough knowledge of your systems .         of course .  um .  .  . do you know how they broke in .         once the power was down and the security net with it     the inspector explained     a hole was cut through the point where there would least likely be a back up alarm they could know nothing about  nobody alarms cafeterias  and from there they went through the clinic  cutting the rest of the power and finally deactivating even your passive monitoring systems .      ortalf blinked .     it could take days to get everything back up .     he stared off toward a wall  his thoughts an anxious jumble .     how many are missing .     he asked .      twenty four  i think .  all from ward five .         all .      the inspector nodded .     who were they .         i don   t .  .  . you mean  who do we maintain in ward five .  a special group  i   m afraid .  very special .         isn   t everyone in your facility special .      ortalf studied the inspector  unsure if he heard sarcasm in the man   s voice .  the face  though  remained impassive .      some more than others     ortalf said .     those  ward five  have the most severe situations .         upds  aren   t they .         yes .  untreatable physiological dysfunctions .         lepers .      ortalf started .     i   m sorry .         nothing .     impatience flashed across the inspector   s face .     ancient reference .  it   s not important .  tell me  can you think of any reason someone would want to kidnap them .         no .         blackmail .  ransom .         i doubt any of them will live long enough outside their matreches to be of any use in that regard .          why is that .         the matreches  each one is specifically modified to its occupant .  they   re unique  like the individuals they support .  they change over time  with the condition of their charge .  it would be nearly impossible to duplicate those specifications in another unit quickly enough to save a removed occupant .  i have no doubt that a number of them are dead already .         i see .  that leaves revenge .  who were they .         revenge .     ortalf stood .     you   re joking .  what could any of these children have done          not them     the inspector said calmly .     their parents .         their histories are completely confidential .  inaccessible .          really .  you do that as efficiently as your employee background checks .         i   m the only one who can access those records .         and will you inform the parents when you   ve done so  to let them know that their children have been lost .      ortalf  uncomfortable  sat down and shook his head .     that   s not the arrangement we have .         they don   t want to know  do they .  that   s why you have them in the first place .          you have to understand  a lot of them have no family to begin with .          discards .  abandoned .         yes .         i   d be willing to wager that many of those whose records are so carefully sealed are children with families .      the inspector stood  and for a moment ortalf expected to be struck .  he closed his eyes and waited  but the blow never came .  when he looked up  the inspector stood in the doorway  his back to the director .      the records will be required     the inspector said .     please make yourself available for further questioning .      ortalf watched the man walk away .  nearly a minute passed before he realized that he still did not know the inspector   s name .  at that moment  he was just as glad not to .      twenty five years later          one    c  oren lanra watched from behind a grime encrusted refuse bin in the recess of an old  unused loading dock .  a sneeze threatened  teased by sharp odors and the chill air .  across the wide alley  members of a third shift crew emerged from an unmarked door .  even if they saw him they would pass him off as one of the ubiquitous warren ghosts  homeless and destitute  that haunted the districts surrounding petrabor spaceport .  coren wore a shabby  ankle length gray black coat over worn coveralls  four days    beard darkened his pale face beneath oily  unwashed hair .  he itched .   three hours still remained in the third shift .  coren counted fifteen people through the door  all but one of the full crew compliment of the largely automated warehouse .  they were unlikely to get into trouble  coren recognized their supervisor among them  marked by the thick silver rings around his upper arms .  they strode noisily up the alley  boots crunching on scattered debris  laughter echoing off the walls  heading for a home kitchen or a bar .  they rounded a corner .  coren listened till their voices came as whispers in the distance .   he dropped from the lip of the bay and hurried to their exit door  propped open by a thin sheet of plastic he   d stuck there earlier to jam the lock and disable the tracking sensor that kept a log of when the door was    used .  just inside  he found an id reader set in a heavy inner door .  he slipped his forged card into the slot and waited to see if he had gotten what he had paid for .   the light on the reader winked green and he slipped through into a locker room .  forty eight lockers  sixteen per shift .  coren wondered where the last worker was inside the mammoth complex .   from one of the oversized pockets in his coat he took out a small button and pressed it on the frame of the exit door .  should anyone follow him through  the button would warn him with a strong signal pulse tuned to a receiver on his wrist .   he went to the shower room .   water dripped from some of the shower heads  the floor was damp .  he turned on a jet of hot water and removed several blocky objects from various pockets .  he placed them beneath the steaming spray and stepped back .  quickly  the scan occluding resins melted off a number of devices .  coren shut off the water and gathered them up  shaking away the excess water .   he hurried down a short hallway that let into a large office area  then threaded a path through the maze of irregularly spaced desks and chairs to the transparent wall that overlooked the main warehouse space .   immense square blocks formed a grid below the enormous ceiling .  within each block  stacks or cubicles  nacelles  skids  crates  all manner of packaging  filled the volume .  turnover was constant .  the space between each block extended down several levels and buzzed with transports  bringing loads up from below or  coming from the bays along the far wall  descending with newly arrived cargo to the proper location .  the contents were monitored by a very sophisticated ai system  not alive  no  but as close to machine awareness as terran prejudice and law allowed .   walkways followed the grid pattern  staircases led down into the hive like labyrinth .  coren wondered just how far he would fall if he lost his balance while walking along one of those narrow paths .  he pressed close to the wall and looked straight down and could not make out the bottom .   he turned away  head swimming in a brief wash of vertigo .  at least there was a roof above .  .  .   coren took out a few of his vonoomans .  the little machines clustered in the palm of his left hand .  he turned slowly  surveying the office .  satisfied  he knelt down and set them on the floor .  he lightly touched them  and each glowed briefly as it activated .      if rega knew i used you     he whispered to them     he might .  .  .     he grunted  self mocking  and touched each one again .  the devices stirred for a few moments  then shot off in different directions  seeking out the specific energy signatures of communications  monitoring  and alarm systems .  once in place  coren would be able to range wherever he wished within the warehouse  free of detection .   he took out a palm sized pad and switched it on .  less than a minute later all the telltales winked green .   he sat down at one of the desks  jacked his palm monitor into the computer keyboard before him  and initiated an access sequence .  the security code was not very sophisticated  his decrypter gained entry in less than thirty seconds .  coren keyed quickly .  the scheduling chart came up on the screen  showing incoming and outgoing traffic for all the bays on the far side of the warehouse .  he studied the times .   most of the bays were tightly scheduled .  one showed a half hour period with nothing going out  nothing coming in .  he tapped queries .  a shipment had been canceled at the last minute .  three shipments  in fact  all belonging to a company called kysler  and all cancellations routed out of the baltimor ite oversight offices .  baltimor .  .  . practically the other side of the globe .  odd .  there was an ite oversight office in the laus district and another up north in arkanleg  both of which should have had responsibility for supervising traffic in and out of petrabor .  still  there was no reason baltimor would be necessarily barred from such duties .  .  .   he opened the manifests .  mostly raw synthetic materials  exotic molecular structures  exported by an auroran owned wholesaler .  one bin contained electronics manufactured by imbitek .  coren studied the id tags for a few moments .  kysler diversified was the distributor .  all the lots had destination codes which he could not read .   coren closed down the station .  he unjacked his monitor  checked the status on his little interference runners once more  then headed out .  he knew now which bay he needed .   coren followed the transparent wall till he came to an exit .  a short staircase took him down to the walkway that bordered the labyrinth .  he produced another handful of vonoomans  smaller than the first group  from a different pocket .  activated  they scurried along the walkway and disappeared .  the first group gave him security  interfering with the warehouse systems  these would find people for him .   automated tractors following invisible guide signals sped through the canyons  a constant loud humming and rush of cold air that whipped at his coat .  the place smelled of oil and ozone  metal and hot plastic  and  under all that  an organic odor  yeast or mold .  rot .   the walkway took him to a broad receiving area fronting a row of large bay doors .  as he neared  the sounds grew thunderous  doors opening and slamming shut  transports rumbling through in both directions  the wind now almost constant .  and beyond that  in the distance  deeper  sepulchral  the heavy thunder of the port itself  shuttles lifting off and landing irregularly  disrupting any possible rhythm to all the noise .   between the edge of the storage hive and the bays lay six meters of ancient  stained apron .  except for small piles of boxes and litter  coren saw nowhere to hide .  he set free another handful of machines and retreated to the nearest staircase leading down into a canyon .   fog lay heavily a few stories below .  coren descended half the height of the block  until the cold bit at his face and filled his sinuses with warning hollowness .  he sat down on a step and pulled his palm monitor out once more .   it unfolded four times to give him a display showing the locations of all his little spies against a map of the entire warehouse .  the surveillance blocks still showed operative .  now he saw blue dots where all his other machines had secreted themselves .  he pressed the half meter square screen against the wall beside him and waited .   ten minutes .   one blue dot turned red .  coren looked up  surprised .  the intruder had come from the nearby loading bays .  the sixteenth member of the crew  he thought .  coren looked down at the fog  twenty or more meters below  and wondered if he should move  into even more bitter cold .  but numbers flashed beside the dot on his flatscreen  coordinates that told him the precise location of the worker  who waited near one of the bay doors  showing no sign of coming any closer to coren .  after a few seconds coren felt confident that he would not be seen  not by this one  at least .   twelve more minutes passed .   three blue dots turned red  far down the row  back near the offices .  as he watched  his machines focused on the new intruders  coordinates proliferated over the screen  and he counted bodies  fifty one .   the number surprised him .  he had expected no more than a dozen  at most fifteen .   they came as a group down a walkway  heading this direction  obviously for a meeting with the waiting dockworker  who now moved a few steps from the wall .   coren folded the screen back down to palm size and crept up the stairs to the lip of the walkway .   the dockworker stood just inside the warehouse by an open bay door several meters away  his back to coren .  hands in pockets  the man shifted minutely from foot to foot as if keeping time to a tune only he heard .  coren looked across the grid of walkways to the approaching group .  from this distance he recognized no one .  all of them wore black  all of them carried small packs .   five or six children accompanied the adults .   coren glanced at his palm monitor .  the communications and surveillance dampers still showed green .  he estimated that he had another twenty minutes before the ai figured out why its internal security system was down .   coren peeled off his overcoat .   as the fifty one refugees gathered around the dockworker  coren stepped silently from the stairwell and moved smoothly up to the perimeter  then cautiously worked his way through them .  he looked at no one  aware only that a few people gave him quick  nervous looks .  they were frightened  tense  too careful perhaps in some ways  careless in others .  none of them would want to believe that they had been followed or infiltrated or caught  so unless it was made obvious that he did not belong here  they would explain him away to themselves .  at least  for the time being .   long enough to reach the front of the gathering .       no changes     a woman said tersely .     canister bj      .  don   t tell me about some other canister          it can   t be helped     the dockworker said calmly .     i   m sorry .  the one segregated for you was found and impounded .         why wasn   t i informed .         i   m informing you now .  i   m informing you that we have back up .  we were prepared .  it   s the same as it was  only different .  a new canister .  i could point out that you were supposed to be a party of fifty two and you   re missing one .  bad security .  but  hey  we understand  people get scared and back out at the last minute .     he gave her a crooked smile .     we are professionals .     .   the woman was tall  almost gaunt  sharply featured .  her head sat forward  angry and demanding  as she glared at the dockworker  who gazed back at her evenly .  coren admired his nerve under that displeased inspection .   after several seconds  she nodded slowly .     all right .  but if this turns out to be anything but copasetic i   ll peel your skin off with pliers .  tell your people we   re ready .      the worker nodded and walked through the bay .   coren started forward .   something closed on his right bicep .  he tugged at it automatically  to no effect .  he turned around  left hand curled to give a palm blow  and froze  abruptly and utterly terrified .   a robot regarded him blankly through mesh covered eye sockets .      i apologize  sir     it said quietly     but i must ask that you come with me .       the robot drew him back through the crowd  which now watched him with open fear and shock .  some cringed back from the robot  but most stood fast  staring outrage at coren lanra .   the robot walked him down the row of bay doors  to the fourth one from the group  and waited  still holding him  firmly but harmlessly .      damn it  coren .       coren glanced around at the voice .  he looked at the woman he had come to talk to .  he waited as long as he could before speaking  taking advantage of the opportunity to simply look at her .  finally  he said     good to see you  too  nyom .      she let her breath out through her teeth  slowly  and coren felt himself smile .      don   t tell me you   re surprised to see me     he said .      i   m not .  that   s what bothers me .      coren gestured toward the robot .     umm .  .          coffee  go see to our arrangements .         yes  nyom .      the robot released coren    s arm .  he congratulated himself that he did not immediately step away from it .  instead  he watched it walk back toward the group of refugees .      what are you doing .     he asked the young woman .     running baleys .         you know i am .  i have been .          i   d hoped i   d been misinformed .  are you insane .      she shook her head impatiently .     that   s good  coren  appeal to my vanity .  you always had a way of making me feel special .          i   m serious .  do you know what you    re doing .         usually .      coren waited  but she said nothing more .  abruptly  he felt awkward and slightly foolish .  he glanced toward the baleys .      where   d you get the tinhead .     he asked .     your father would love that .         to hell with my father and to hell with you .  what  did he send you to find me .  what are you going to do  throw me over your shoulder and drag me back home .         the thought had occurred to me .      she snorted  but took a step back .  then she gave him a narrow look .     what are you going to do .      he met her gaze evenly  trying to think of a suitable answer .  finding none  he shook his head .     i didn   t know you had a robot .      she laughed .     you don   t have a plan .  rega didn   t send you .  you came on your own .         not exactly .  he did tell me to find out what you   re doing and          and what .  sit on me till the election is over .  that   s what this is about  then .  rega is afraid his little girl   s activities might botch his election .  tell him not to worry .  i think he can ruin his chances all on his own  he doesn   t need my help .  in fact  you can give him some good news  he won   t have to worry about me anymore at all .  i won   t give him any further cause for concern .      coren waited .  he recognized the tone of voice  the half smile  and a small point of fear burned at the back of his throat .  he slipped his hands into his pockets  the right one finding a small plastic bag .  he squeezed it till it burst in his palm .      nyom     the robot interrupted .  coren started and nyom laughed .      coffee won   t hurt you     she said .     what is it  coffee .         time     the robot said .      i   ll be right there .      coffee retreated .      what do you mean  nyom .     coren asked .   she sighed and stepped closer .     tell me the truth now  coren  did you tell the authorities .  am i going to be arrested by immigration and trade enforcement .         no .      she studied him .     you really just came all on your own .         too many people are hard to control .         that   s not it .     she frowned .     it   s still personal  isn   t it .     when he did not answer  she smiled .     i   m really flattered .  and i   m sorry .      she touched his face lightly and turned away .   he grabbed her arm .     what did you mean  nyom .         i   m going with this bunch  that   s all .  my turn to exit .  nothing personal  coren  but if you found me  then it   s only a matter of time before the authorities find me .  i   m taking this ride .      coren felt his fear grow  becoming panic .     go where .         nova levis .      coren released her .  he wanted to argue .  more  he now really did want to drag her out of here .  but it was clear from her expression  from the waiting baleys  and the robot watching everything that he would not be able to .      well     he said  shrugging .     i can die happy now .  i know you really are insane .      he cleared his throat .     you do know that nova levis is under blockade  i suppose .         we   ll make it .     for a moment  nyom looked sad .     sorry .  i wish .  .  .         nyom .  please don   t .      she shook her head .     gotta go .  you shouldn   t be seen .  my contacts aren   t as understanding as i am .      nyom sprinted back to her flock of baleys .  seconds later they filed through the bay door .  coren backed quickly up against a wall  standing motionless until they had all passed out of the warehouse proper .   behind him  one of the bay doors began to open .   coren broke for it and slipped around the edge just as a huge hauler rumbled through  carrying a four meter high stack of cubes .  its slipstream almost knocked him down .   just on the other side of the opening  coren found a massive support rib rising to the ceiling high overhead .  he pressed into the corner and waited till the bay door sealed  then pulled another device from his pocket .   he raised the optam to his eyes as he peered around the column of composite metal .   seven or eight meters from the wall  the pavement ended and a tangled maze of thin tracks spread out  delta like  busy with huge transports carrying large containers  bins  and packages from the tunnel system that led directly to the shuttle pads dotting the landing area of petrabor field .  the surge and rumble of shuttle traffic drove through him  vibrating his bones .   he was annoyed that nyom had read him so easily .  he had hoped she would assume that he had brought back up  the police  immigration authorities  other company security .  he thought he could talk her out of it  that  after loading her latest troop of misguided would be settlers aboard whatever means of transport she had arranged  he could convince her to come home and suspend operations for a time .  until the end of the election .  he had hoped she might finally want to stay with him .   he had hoped .  .  .   the view through the optam showed the party of baleys  a few dozen meters down  on an empty patch .  while coren watched  a huge pod drifted out of the writhing traffic and came to a stop before them .  the end developed a seam and opened smoothly to one side .  four people stepped from its dark interior to meet with nyom .   coren stiffened .  two of the four were robots .  one looked a bit more sophisticated than the other  almost human  but the dull sheen that outlined its sleek head and body gave it away .  it moved with an unusual grace  a fluid  almost organic motion  uncharacteristic of any robot with which coren was familiar .  it circled the baleys  slowly  as if taking inventory .  it stopped before nyom   s robot  coffee  then seemed to come to a decision and rejoined its companions .   coren touched a contact on the side of the optam and sound came through the bead in his ear  but he only heard the muffled  unintelligible sounds of a discussion .  he lowered the optam and tried to adjust the aural filters to compensate for the noise  then raised it again .   the strange robot was gone .   coren dropped the optam  he saw the robot clearly .  when he raised the magnifier again  the robot did not appear .  he could see the other robot easily  a machine slightly smaller than coffee  a bit sleeker .  but the first robot remained invisible .   masked .  .  .  .   coren tensed  preparing to act .  the baleys began filing into the big container  and he realized that he would do nothing .  nyom knows what she   s doing  he thought .  at least as far as procedure goes .  she did not act alarmed  so he had to assume she knew these people  these machines .  it unsettled him  though  to watch her  the last one  walk up the ramp  accompanied by coffee .   the masked robot followed a minute later  causing coren   s pulse to accelerate again .  the other contacts  human and robot  closed up the container  then walked away .   five minutes later an automated hauler hooked onto the container and pulled it into the maze of tracks and out of coren    s reach .   abruptly  coren felt a wave of bitterness .  failure did that .  it would have been so simple  so much easier if she had just come with him .  now .  .  .   he opened his palm monitor and keyed for a new signal .  a bright yellow dot glowed on the small screen .  the smear he had placed on nyom had transferred from fabric to metal to plastic  a clever seeker code built into the tiny molecules that imparted a kind of machine instinct to find a suitable place to use as a conductor and enable them to transmit .   he pocketed the optam and the palm monitor and slipped back through the bay door on the next cycle  just ahead of another huge pallet .  all he had to do now was get out of the warehouse  and all the communications damping he had put in place  and signal his contact on kopernik station .   he imagined how angry nyom was about to be .      so what .     he mused as he recovered his overcoat .     better she   s righteously pissed off at me than dead from some trigger happy blockade station .     ht  glanced back at the bay door .     nova levis .  what are you thinking  nyom .  or are you thinking .     he trotted along the walkway toward the offices  muttering .     you   ve never been particularly impulsive  but when you are  you are absolutely unpredictable .  nova levis .  damn .      when he reached the locker room  he punched a code into the palm monitor .  all the little machines he   d released throughout the warehouse began to eat themselves into dust .  nothing would be left to analyze  if anyone ever found them .  just minuscule piles of refuse .   he checked the time  estimated that he had about six hours before that bin reached dockside on kopernik .  he could even clean up before he made his call .  .  .   he recovered the small button he had placed in the exit and stepped into the alley .  he saw no one and quickly bounded across to where he had been hiding when the nightshift crew had left .  he fished one more device from an inside pocket and opened it .  he tapped in a code and waited for the comm to upload for him .   the screen remained blank .  he ran a diagnostic .  locality error scrolled across the small screen .  coren hissed  annoyed .  something around here was interfering with the link .  he should have tested it first .  probably being this close to the port was causing problems .  he closed up the comm unit and headed down the alley .   he splashed through the accrued seepage and hunched his shoulders against the random drops of condensation from the unseen ceiling high overhead .  he rounded the next corner and headed up a broad alleyway littered with abandoned shipping crates  refuse dumpsters  old and broken transports  and the scraps of traffic .      hey  gato .      coren glanced to his right  at the source of the throaty voice .  a tall man came out of the shadow of a receiving bay and loped toward him  hands in the pockets of a long overcoat .  coren   s hand moved for the stunner he carried in his jacket .  the stranger coughed heavily  a phlegmy hack coren recognized as one of the recent strains of sublevel tuberculosis .  not contagious usually  but coren liked to keep his distance .      not tonight     he said .      hey  that   s not sapien     the man said .      just wanting a share  you know .      coren reflexively pulled out a few credits from his pocket and tossed them .   the man scooped them up with more alacrity than coren would have guessed .      thanks  gato     he said and touched a finger to his hat .   coren turned away .   a hand clenched around his throat between one breath and the next .  coren grabbed the wrist and pushed forward to relieve the pressure  but the hand held .  the wrist  wrapped in a thick sleeve  seemed like steel .  coren tried to turn away from the encircling arm and drive an elbow back .  he missed  tried again  and then dropped to his knees under a sharp blow to the left shoulder .   he choked .  sparks danced around the edge of his vision .  he tried to sweep a hand around to catch the knees of his attacker  but he was too off balance .   he closed his eyes  and the pain went away .     coren came awake lying on damp pavement  his throat burning as he choked on the sourness in his mouth .  his shoulder throbbed and would not support his attempt to push himself up .  he rolled over and stared up at dark walls  too close .  he had been moved .  he lay still for a minute or more until the acid subsided and his breathing calmed .  he managed finally to sit up .   he was about three meters from the end of a narrow hallway  but still in the same general area of petrabor  from what he could see beyond .  his head spun and his legs trembled as he got to his feet .  he needed to get to a medical unit  he knew  but not down here  no telling what kind of treatment he might get from the quacks practicing in the sublevels .  he needed to get to a comm sooner .   he patted his pockets .  his stunner was gone  as were his optam  palm monitor  and comm unit .  but they had missed his id  and he still had a few credits in a calf pouch .   coren tried to figure out what had happened .  he was not a small man  and he had been trained well during his years with special service  but whoever had attacked him had handled him as if he were a child .  possible  but not the panhandler .  surely not .   he sighed heavily and coughed .   later  he thought  stumbling from the hallway .  figure it out later .  .  .  .       two    w  hen he returned to the hostel  all coren wanted to do was fall into bed and sleep .  he leaned against the door of his room  eyes shut  feeling his bruises and weariness .  he had been beaten up once before  years ago  but the brain did not remember the pain .   he forced his eyes open .  the clock above the bed said nineteen ten local .      damn .  five hours .       he lurched to the small desk and pulled a briefcase from beneath it .  he threw off his overcoat and tapped in the release code on the case  then took out his personal datum .  he jacked it into the room comm and entered a string of numbers .  he sat down then  anxiously watching while the link assembled itself through a secure channel .      come on .  .  . come on .  .  .         palen here     a voice crackled sharply from the comm .      it   s coren  sipha .  the package is on its way up .         already tracking it .  we   ll have it in the bay in .  .  . two hours and a bit .  where have you been .  i expected your call          i   ll tell you later .  i was delayed unavoidably .         you still coming up .         as soon as i get clean .  i   ll be on a shuttle in an hour .         if we get the package in station before you get here .         can you delay opening till i   m there .         within limits .         i   m moving as fast as i can  sipha .  thanks .       coren entered a new number and read over the shuttle schedules that scrolled onto the screen .  hand trembling slightly  he booked one  and closed down the link .  he considered trying to contact the data troll who had told him about tonight   s clandestine emigration  but that could scare her .  she had been nervous anyway  their meeting had not gone smoothly .  coren had been in too big a hurry to question her anxiety  but now he wondered about it .  he unjacked his datum and put it away .   he assembled his luggage quickly  then stripped off the grimy clothes .  he showered  depilated his face  and dressed in tailored black and dark blue .  the overcoat and coveralls went into the recycle chute .   coren snatched his briefcase and single duffle  gave the cubicle a last look  gaze lingering on the bed .  i really need sleep  he thought .  on the shuttle  he decided  and left for the port .     coren gripped the armrests  unable to make himself relax .  he knew the shuttle was in motion and  though he felt nothing  the knowledge made him sick .  he forced himself not to slouch  grateful that the nausea was not worse .      big brave policeman     he muttered sourly     scared of a little spaceflight .       he glanced at his fellow passengers .  one man slept soundly by induced coma  an option coren found more repellant than the flight itself   and the only others he could see clearly seemed to be spacers  tall and elegant and gathered together in one section in the front of the cabin  talking animatedly  unfazed by the fact that they were hurtling through space with less than thirty centimeters of hull between them and vacuum .   coren closed his eyes and tried to think about what had happened to him .   it was possible that nyom had hired someone to cover her back and that the panhandler had been her muscle .  possible  but inconsistent with nyom looms  at least  not the nyom looms coren thought he knew .   perhaps he no longer really knew her .  he had made an assumption  relied on old data  and gotten hurt .   but assuming for the moment that the panhandler had not been her man  then who was he .  coren   s shoulder and neck throbbed  the bruise would be spectacular .   definitely have to have a talk with that data troll  he thought .  the idea that he had been set up troubled him  but it was not unlikely .  baley running attracted an undependable variety of conscience  people committed to various causes but with a weakness for money that worked against their revolutionary principles .  the few true believers were unapproachable in any ordinary sense  those from whom coren could extract information were  by definition  untrustworthy .   the troll who had supplied him with the data for last night   s shipment  a woman named jeta fromm  should have been more reliable .  coren used a clearing house for people like her  data recovery systems  ltd .  an innocuous name  considering how much borderline illicit trade they dealt in .  but they guaranteed the work of their operatives  sometimes in heavy handed and unpleasant ways  and would not take it well to learn that one of their people had betrayed a client .  still  he had not gotten that impression from jeta fromm .  she did not seem like the sort who would indulge in doublecrosses .  she had been anxious  but the data she supplied had been accurate .  if anything  she had seemed preoccupied .  coren relied a great deal on his intuition about people  he had occasionally been wrong  no system is perfect  and he thought he had judged her correctly .  perhaps he had and something else was involved .  it would not do to act before he knew  which meant he had to find her on his own and not go through the clearing house .  they might misunderstand .  at best  he could cost her employment .  at worst .  .  .   the other possibility was that number sixteen third shift dockworker who had met with nyom .  but coren had not seen him clearly and with his optam stolen he had no images to work with .  perhaps he could find out who he was through the ite office in baltimor .  he knew someone there .  it would be interesting in any case to find out what connection existed between that branch and a petrabor baley smuggling operation .   at least he knew he could rely on sipha palen and accomplish his mission .   nyom would be furious with him .   no matter  so long as she was safely back on earth and out of circulation for a while .  rega owned a villa in kenya sector where he often went to be alone  coren himself had overseen its security .  it was the safest place he knew to tuck nyom away while the election ran .      your attention please      an automated voice said .     we will be docking at kopernik station in fifteen minutes .  please be sure your safety field is on and secured and any personal objects are stowed in the appropriate compartments .  remain in your seats until the green debarkation light is on .  thank you .      coren sighed gratefully .  fifteen minutes .  good .  he looked up at the group of spacers and briefly caught one   s eye .  for a moment he thought he recognized an expression of sympathy .  but it passed and she laughed at a joke from one of her companions .   he shifted uncomfortably .  his safety field had stayed on the entire trip .  his skin prickled slightly from the faint pressure .  his shirt stuck to him from the sweat  he would need another shower as soon as he debarked .   he felt a brief lurch and clutched desperately at the armrests .      we have completed docking at kopernik station  bay two one seven .  please remain seated until we are ready for debarkation .  we hope you have enjoyed your flight and we thank you for traveling intrapoint .      coren bit back a snide comment and concerned himself with shutting down the safety field .  his legs hurt from the constant tension .   a row of green lights winked on overhead the length of the cabin .  an attendant came through to help anyone who might need assistance .  coren stood  thankful his legs did not shake .  he pulled his briefcase from the cubby beneath his seat and made his way to the exit .  as he walked down the white walled tunnel away from the shuttle  he began feeling more confident .  he emerged into the brightly lit  cheerily colored  close ceilinged reception lounge feeling a bit foolish about his fear .  he slipped on his jacket while he scanned the waiting crowd .   sipha palen stood off to the left and gave him a nod  then strolled off .  coren checked in at the security desk and retrieved his duffle .  he caught up with sipha halfway down the concourse and fell into step beside her .   sipha stood at least twelve centimeters taller than him  with broad shoulders tapering into what she called a    swimmer   s build     slim hipped and sinewy .  pale amber eyes stood out sharply against her brassy brown skin  she wore her copper hair in a thick queue than hung to just between her shoulder blades .  her ivory suit hinted at    uniform     without being obvious .  she smelled of hot metal and flowers .      how was the flight .     she asked nonchalantly .      don   t      he said .   she gave him a wry smile .     you should fly more often .  you might learn to like it .         it   s good to see you  sipha     he said  ignoring the jab .      likewise .  the package arrived four hours  twenty minutes ago .  we have the bay secured  just my people .  do you want to go right there or tidy up first .         let   s get it over with .  maybe i can enjoy the rest of my stay afterward .       sipha made a dubious noise  but increased the pace slightly .  she led him to an in station shuttle car .      by the way     he said as he strapped in     there are two robots in there .  one looks pretty ordinary  but the other one was invisible to my optam .         masked .         i can   t think of another explanation .  so let your people know to be careful .      they made the transit in silence  coren staring at a spot just above sipha   s right shoulder .  the car slowed to a halt and sipha stepped lithely out .  coren followed her down a service corridor into an immense bay .   the security people standing around straightened when they saw sipha .  she strode across the pale gray floor toward the cargo bin sitting near its center .  coren   s heartbeat quickened upon seeing it  relief  he realized .  it was here  safe  and soon nyom would be on her way to even more safety .   it is still personal .  .  . he thought .   a pair of uniformed techs  expressions tight  approached sipha .  they spoke in low  terse tones .      open the damn thing now .     sipha shouted .   she sprinted the rest of the distance to the bin .  coren dropped his luggage and ran after her .  techs  galvanized  lurched into motion .   people converged on the bin .  coren stopped outside the huddle of technicians working to open it and waited  impatient and anxious .   the seal parted and the door folded down .   coren shouldered his way through the uniforms .   sipha entered the bin first .      get me some light in here .     she called  her voice hollow .   coren bumped her  stopped at the edge of darkness .  the spillover from the bay lights picked out disconnected details of a squat bulk just before them and lines that might be the edges of shelves or cots .  coren heard a faint  rhythmic buzzing .      what   .     he began .   techs came up behind them with hand held floodlamps .  they switched them on and raised them .   coren blinked at the sudden glare .   the air smelled faintly burnt .  .  .      shit     sipha breathed .   racks of couches crowded the walls all around  three deep  with barely a meter between levels .  each pallet contained a body .  none of them moved  coren detected no breath pushing at clothing  no hint of life .  dead bodies  an umbilical running from each facemask to the large apparatus in the center of the cramped open space directly before sipha and coren .   on the opposite side of the big machine  coffee knelt  motionless .   coren   s ears sang with blood .  sparks teased at the periphery of his vision and he felt cocooned  separated from his surroundings .  he made himself step forward .  he looked in at the nearest corpse .  she had been strapped into the couch .  her hands had clutched spasmodically at the fabric beneath her .   the couch above her held a child  its eyes staring blindly .   he made his way around the apparatus  stepping carefully over the tubes running from its base  up the railings  and into the couches .   coffee   s hands were frozen on a control panel .  coren bent over to see what the robot was touching .  disengage .  coren glared at the robot .  he felt his hands curl instantly into fists .      you piece of          coren .      he looked up at sipha .  she still stood at the entrance .  she pointed up .   coren looked .   dangling from the ceiling of the bin was another body .  hanging  suspended  it shifted ever so slightly right to left and back in the movement of air coming from the bay .  it was a woman  her head angled sharply to the left .  her eyes were wide  tongue extruded between her lips .   nyom .     the tea in his cup had gone cold as coren watched sipha   s people remove the bodies .  the air in the office cubicle was a few degrees too cool .  he stared fixedly through the window at the forensic dance around the crime scene .   nyom would be brought out last  he knew  because her condition was so different .   sipha entered the office and sat down heavily behind the small desk .      fifty two bodies     she said .     we don   t have the facilities to store them in our morgue .  i   m having stasis units moved into an equipment locker nearby .  best we can do till we know how to handle this .      coren looked up .     fifty two .  there were fifty one baleys .         we   ve got fifty two now .         all human .      sipha nodded .     maybe one was already in the bin .  who knows .         what about the other robot .     coren asked .      no second robot .  just the one .  sorry .         i saw it enter the bin with them .  you    re telling me it got out .         you saw it get in at the warehouse dock .  after that  who knows .  once on board its shuttle  it could have left .  or it might not have even gotten on the shuttle .     she grunted .     we could ask the one we do have  but it   s collapsed .         how convenient     he said .     what ship was this bin scheduled for .         it   s not even in dock yet  won   t be for another three days .  a settler cargo hauler  slated for a direct run to an orbital facility owned by a company called the hunter group .          three days .  .  .     coren shook his head .      so     sipha said after a time     what do you think happened .      coren shuddered briefly and set the cup aside .  he folded his hands in his lap .     the other robot .  it must   ve glitched or malfunctioned or .  .  . something .  it killed nyom  then suffocated the others by switching off the rebreather unit .         what about nyom   s robot .  why would it have allowed that to happen .         they must   ve been in it together .       sipha said nothing .  coren turned his chair to face her .  she wore a skeptical expression .      that   s what you want to believe     she said .   coren nodded .     trouble is  i don   t have a viable alternative .  do you .         no .  but i   m not sure i can accept that one robot could kill .  you want me to accept that two of them were cooperating in a mass murder .       coren grunted .     since when have you gone spacer .      she frowned .     since when have you lost the ability to think .      coren glared at her .      we partnered for two years in special service     she said .     i thought you were more reasonable than that .  maybe i was wrong .  maybe working for rega looms has loosened your grip on objective reality .  what do you think .      coren worked himself back from anger and tried to think it through .  sipha had come into the service directly from the military  a different path than his more direct route of applying to the academy for civic defense  forensics  and criminal interdiction .  despite their divergent backgrounds  coren had come to trust her .  he still did .  it had surprised him when  after he had left the service  she had taken this position as head of security for kopernik station .   but it put her in almost daily contact with spacers and settlers  both factions of whom had embassy branches on the station .   nevertheless  he trusted her .  that  he recognized  had not changed .      all right     he said slowly .     tell me your reasoning .         that robot is collapsed .  positronic nervous breakdown .  something happened to cause it  and if it could break down like that then it could not have harmed any of those people .  if it were still walking around  calmly trying to do its business  then i might agree with you .     she sat back .     i   ve been up here five years  coren .  i   ve learned a little bit about robots .  have to  when you deal with spacers who won   t leave home without them .  i had to learn to discount my own prejudices a long time ago if i wanted any chance of running my department efficiently and doing my job honestly .  it wasn   t easy  i still don   t like them  but i know their limitations .  it wasn   t the robot .  not that one  anyway .  and i doubt it was this other one  there   s no in built compunction that prevents a robot from harming another robot  especially in the defense of humans .  as far as we   ve been able to tell  that second robot wasn   t even on board when this happened .     she gestured toward the bay .     besides  what motive .  suicide .  bringing along a robot would have been the best way to fail to commit suicide .  they   re programmed to save our lives for us  whether we want them to or not .      coren nodded .     all right  that   s all logical .  as far as it goes .  sorry about the remark .          forget it .  so  how do you want to proceed .         why do i get a say .  isn   t this official now .      sipha pursed her lips thoughtfully .     maybe .     she seemed to consider carefully .     see  this bay is settler .  when you contacted me about this little favor you wanted  i called in a few favors of my own .  right now  this whole business exists in an official vacuum .  no one knows but you  me  and my immediate staff .      she stabbed a finger in the direction of the cargo bin .     and whoever killed all those people .         you   ll have to make it official sooner or later .         true .  but maybe by then we can figure this out .      coren studied her for a moment .  something in her expression teased at him .      there   s something else     he stated .   sipha still pondered  then nodded .     i agreed to do this for you because i need you .          i   m flattered .  but i   m also private now .         oh  i think we can change that if we need to .  but .  .  . i have a problem i can   t take to my superiors .  i   m not even sure who among my own people i can trust with it .  i need outside help .  i didn   t know how i was going to get it till you called .         is it related .         i wouldn   t be surprised .  probably .  it has to do with baleys  at least .  dead ones  too  though this is the first load of corpses to show up on my station .       coren raised an eyebrow in amusement .        your    station .      sipha smiled wolfishly .     oh  yes  old partner mine .  never doubt it .  my station .  it has trouble and i want it fixed .     she gazed past him  into the bay .     as i say  this is the first load of corpses .  the occasional body has been turning up from time to time .  the sorts of people who easily get crushed when they learn the wrong thing  or know too much  or who just show up where they shouldn   t .  most of them have been thoroughly professional kills .  .  . till about three months ago .      coren waited .  she seemed to come to a decision and activated the datum on the desk .  the paper thin screen extruded and winked on .  she worked intently for a couple of minutes  then crooked a finger at him to have a look .      we found this in one of our detention cells     she said .   on the screen coren saw a body  laid out on a morgue table .  it had been a woman  the basic shape was still intact  but he had never seen a body so thoroughly bruised  blue  green  and sickly yellow marks ran from the scalp to the toes .  faint red laceration marks interrupted the mottling here and there .      what was it .  explosive decompression .  something fall on her .         in a detention cell .     sipha asked wryly .     she was alive when we put her in there .  small quantity brethe peddler  nothing major  ever public nuisance  more than anything else .  she was supposed to be  you see  because she worked for me .         regular cop .         no  she really did used to deal in black market .  i made her a better deal .  it worked out .  she worked the settler section for me .      coren felt himself smile .     and when there was something really important to report .  .  .  .         she got herself arrested .  this hadn   t been the first time she   d visited one of my cells .  the next shift  we found her like this .  very simply  every bone in her body had been broken .  a lot of them were crushed .         what was she reporting .         i don   t know .  she came in    under the influence .     i was tied up with arranging all this for you and didn   t get a chance to talk to her .         no one heard or saw anything .         evidently not .  that   s why i   m not really sure about my people .  can you think of a way that could happen and no one on watch would know about it .      coren shook his head .     what about surveillance .         blank for that section .  i suspended two of my officers for negligence  but i honestly don   t think they were the ones who did it .  someone with a bit more expertise fiddled the recorders .  the problem with that is  i have at least five people on my staff who could have done it  but none of them has a motive .     sipha gestured toward the image on the screen .     besides  look at that and tell me how it was done .  a couple of adjusters with clubs .  i don   t think so .         but since you don   t really suspect your two discipline cases  you have an idea .       sipha nodded .     during autopsy we came up with this .      she tapped the keypad .     the bruising is uninterrupted over the entire body and none of the fractures are consistent with blows .       the screen changed  showing an image of a shoulder  blackened like rotting fruit .  sipha adjusted the scan and one shape emerged  slightly darker than the surrounding bruise .  coren stared at the vague outline of a hand .  an odd hand  to be sure  the fingers too thick and short  the spread too wide .      was it clear enough for any kind of prints .     he asked .      no prints .  perfectly smooth except for a couple of joints .  and the bone beneath this impression had been ground nearly to powder .  no  partner mine  this isn   t a human hand .         a robot .     he shook his head .     but you said          i said that robot      she pointed out at the bay      didn   t do it .  but that   s still my best guess .  and if a robot did this      she gestured at the screen      if a robot  maybe your second mystery robot   got into my cells and did this  then i have a serious problem .     she looked up at him .     will you help me .         i      coren began .   the door opened .  one of sipha   s men leaned in .     chief  you need to see this .            couple things     the older man  baxin  sipha   s staff pathologist   said when sipha and coren entered the bin .  he pointed at the rebreather unit .  the umbilicals had all been disconnected and had retracted into the unit .     that   s a standard fain bischer rebreather .  about six years old  out of date  but still in good working order .  no reason it won   t last another hundred years once it   s been cleaned out .         cleaned out of what .     sipha asked .      we don   t know yet  but it   s evident from the postures of the deceased that they   ve been poisoned .  something in the rebreather  we assume .  something clever  too .  the filtration system should have blocked it  but it didn   t .     he nodded sharply .     that   s one thing .  the other .  .  .     he pointed up .   nyom   s body had been taken down and now they could see how she had been suspended .  the roof had a crack in it  about half a meter long and perhaps five to eight centimeters at the widest .  the metal around it was discolored  heat scored .      the bin was pressurized     the tech explained .     the air leaked out through that crack .  my guess is that the body was drawn to it during freefall .  the fabric of her pants got caught in it .          did decompression kill her .     coren asked .      no .  a broken neck did that .  she was dead before she got stuck in the ceiling .      coren looked down at the rebreather .     why .  if everyone else was poisoned .  .  .     he looked around .     where   s the robot .         i   ve got it in an impound locker     baxin said .     i didn   t know where else to put it .      sipha extended her hand .     give me the tag .  i   ll take care of the robot .  how long on autopsies .         fifteen  twenty hours     baxin said .     a few preliminaries sooner than that maybe .          what made the crack .     coren asked .     it looks intentional .          it is     baxin said .     heat induction  industrial grade drill or welder  crystallized the metal  made it brittle .         what kind .         we don   t have it .  there   s nothing in here that would do that .         not even the robot .         no  i don   t think so .  specialized tool  in my opinion .      coren gave the hole in the roof a last glance  then left the bin .   when sipha joined him  he said     doesn   t make sense .  who broke her neck if coffee didn   t .      she glanced at him .         coffee    .         that   s what she called the robot .     he saw sipha   s expression .     don   t ask me  i don   t know why .  but who else could have broken her neck .         we   ll check the bodies to see if time of death matches in all cases .  but i still think you   re wrong about the robot .  maybe it knew they were being poisoned  that   s what it was trying to stop .         how did it know .  and who          i know  who broke nyom   s neck .  maybe the same one who crushed that brethe dealer .         and which one would that be .  which dead one in that bin who had never been to kopernik before would that be .     coren asked sarcastically .     oh  wait  i know .  the same one who cracked a hole in the bin with an inducer that no one can find .       sipha snarled at him .     i don   t damn well know  coren .  so i repeat  will you help me .      he nodded .     oh  yes .  i   ll help you .  no question .     he mulled his options for a few seconds .     i   m going back down .  you can handle the autopsies without me .  also  i   ll need id on all of them .         what   s down there .     sipha frowned .  clearly  she had thought they would be working together for a few days .      i have a couple of people to talk to .  for one  the data troll who put me onto nyom in the first place .  i want to find those people nyom was dealing with  and she   s my best chance right now .     he drew a deep breath .     and we   re going to need a roboticist .         there   s a lab full of them here          do you trust them .      sipha scowled  then shook her head .     not till i find out who killed my brethe dealer .          i   ll see if i can take care of that  then .         i suppose you know a roboticist .         of one  yes .  i think it   s best to stay away from anyone involved directly with the spacer sector on kopernik .      sipha nodded .     i   ll get you on the next shuttle back to d . c .         no  not d . c .  lyzig district  that   s where my informant lives .  i   ll take the suborbital back to d . c .  after i talk to her .  send me the autopsy data when you have it .         what are you going to say to looms .      coren shook his head .     i   ll worry about that when i see him .          three    t  he flight down frightened him more than the trip up to kopernik .  perhaps it was the idea of falling  but coren felt at the edge of panic from the moment the shuttle left dock till he walked  legs trembling  into the concourse at lyzig station .  it did not make sense  he never reacted this way on a semiballistic  and he resented the idea that it was all psychosomatic .  he went directly to a public restroom and rinsed his face in cold water  then sat in a stall till the sweating and nausea passed .      never again     he muttered as he finally gathered himself up .  he checked his watch  twenty minutes wasted getting over his reaction  and left the restroom .   he rented a locker and shoved his one bag inside  then headed for the station lobby .   lyzig buzzed with first shift traffic .  the warrens swarmed with people going to jobs or shops or meetings .  coren liked lyzig  clean  robust  a polished politesse substituted for the unmannered friendliness of other eurosector districts  as if the residents were conscious of a long history  an important past they were obliged to honor .   at the station gate he flagged a taxi and gave his destination .  the driver   s eyebrows raised speculatively  but all he said was    very good  sir     and moved into the vehicular lanes .  the short ride ended at an ancient hotel .  coren tipped the driver and stepped out .   the taxi pulled away and coren began walking in the opposite direction .  his shakes were gone by now and he walked purposefully  in imitation of resident lyzigers .   he had three options to find jeta fromm .  he had already decided against contacting data recovery systems  through which he had originally found her .  he had to assume that whoever had killed nyom had gotten the same information about the baley run  and that meant a competitor .  he had no way of knowing yet where they would have gotten the data  it might have been jeta fromm herself  or her handlers  or some as yet undetermined third source .  he could too easily reveal his interest by going through the usual channels .   the second option was not worth considering at this point .  local police could find her and pick her up  but he would be effectively destroying her career and perhaps hurting several other people associated with her .  a significant part of the work he did depended on clandestine resources .  damaging them by    going local    could cost him his reputation and impair his ability to do his job .  using the local police  then  was a course of last resort .   his best option  then  was to find her himself .  he had met with her twice  at different locations of her choosing .  her nervousness had bothered him  so he had traced her back to her hab  just in case he needed to find her quickly and confidentially .  like now .   the area he now entered was very old  and the signs of wear and neglect became more evident the further he walked .  the fast pace and energy representative of lyzig faded  people here were in no hurry to go anywhere  a few were even sitting in doorways  or gathered in small groups near shops or in the cramped public spaces that passed for parks in this part of the urbanplex .   coren automatically imitated the lethargy around him  moving slower  keeping his head down .  he tucked his hands in his pockets and searched the corridor signs till he found one marked betragstras .  he walked down the narrower corridor to a steep metal staircase that ran up the windowless wall to his left .  the ghosts of old graffiti discolored the surfaces  scrubbed endlessly by automated cleaners that  over time  failed to remove all the paint .   at the top of the stairs  coren found a broad rooftop upon which stacks of single unit cubicles formed a small  cramped village .  light glowed from open doorways  and the thick smell of cooking almost covered the odors of plastic and sweat and unprocessed waste .   faces appeared at doorways  lingered for a few seconds  then retreated .   coren estimated about a thousand people lived in this precariously overbuilt shantytown  lived quite illegally and with little fear of eviction  but with the constant possibility of having the entire makeshift construct tumble down on them .  many of the residents worked legitimate jobs that paid too little to afford them a decent domicile and do whatever else they found more important   sending children to better schools  subscriptions to expensive entertainments  paying off a debt  or saving for the chance to emigrate  but just as many worked on the edge of legality  dealers in stolen data or controlled substances  informants  runners  small credit fences  rented muscle .  others simply had nowhere else to go and had fallen here  fortunate to at least have a place to sleep and a source for food .   coren took out his palm monitor and made his way through the maze of passageways  up a ladder  and down a short gangway to an unlit doorway .  the signal from the smear he had deposited on jeta the second time they met was weaker  but still traceable .  the self replicating vonoomans exhausted themselves after a few days and decayed unrecoverably .  he ran the sensor up and down a scale to test it .  satisfied that jeta fromm had at least stayed here for more than an hour  giving his tiny tracers a chance to proliferate in the environment  he pocketed the monitor .  he palmed a flash and switched it on as he kicked in the flimsy plastic door and stepped through .   in the harsh blue white illumination  the cubicle leapt into sharp relief .  a cot stretched against the wall to his left  a sleeping bag and extra blankets wadded up at the head .  a makeshift desk stood along the back wall  cluttered with objects that formed an indecipherable tangle .  along the wall to the right was a trunk  the lid open  the contents spilling over the edge  clothing  from the look of it .   immediately to the right coren found a lamp propped on a three legged table .  he switched it on and turned off his own light .   vacant .  he closed the door behind him .   he studied the room carefully .  jeta fromm had struck him as a fastidious person  neat and methodical .  this place did not .  he sat down on the edge of the cot .   disks  small pieces of paper  items of clothing  scraps of unidentifiable detritus littered the floor .  a chair lay on its side to the left of the desk .  the cot itself was angled away from the wall .   it appeared to coren that she  or someone  had left in a hurry  possibly in a panic .  jeta peddled data  rumor  software  illicit downloads  even documented fact when she sold material to the newsnets as a stringer  so any of a number of deals could cause her to run .   she had been very professional when he met her  but it seemed to him now that there had been an undercurrent of desperation .  she managed it well and he had been in a hurry  so he had neglected to pay it enough attention .   coren stepped up to the desk .  the clutter consisted mainly of components from old  salvaged readers  scanners  and bits of datum units .  he saw a control panel from a commline .  tools lay mixed with the debris .  two bare spaces suggested removed equipment .  he guessed  given her range of services  that she owned a pathburner  a very expensive microcircuitry cutter .  probably a very good decryption datum .  the cost of those two pieces would be more than his own yearly salary .   what he saw here convinced coren that jeta was on the run .  someone  maybe the same someone who had rolled him in petrabor  had come looking for her .  she had duly disappeared .   he knelt down and shuffled through the papers and disks on the floor .  the disks were labeled by numbers .  he could go through them  but he doubted she would have left anything behind worth the trouble .   the papers mostly contained scribbled comm codes  cryptic notes      jam on b stras   s    or    cram seef for rudo  level        and a couple of doodles .  one caught his eye that said    b meet at seven   s place   shift    followed by a comm code .  he slipped it into his pocket and stood .   he turned off the light and stepped outside .   to his left he glimpsed someone watching him from a doorway .  the door slammed shut .  coren reached the cubicle in three long strides and shouldered his way in .   in the pale light he saw a small man shoving himself in the comer behind a large chest of drawers .  coren shut the door and stepped closer .      i didn   t .  stop .  i didn   t .     the man cried .      you know jeta .     coren demanded .     she ask you to watch her place .         i don   t  nothing to say  gato  please          don   t    gato    me  shit .  dump it now .  you   re a friend of jeta   s .      he nodded once .  he was not quite as small as he at first seemed  but the clothes he wore were too big and his head was long and shaved bald .  his sleeves half covered his hands .      you    re watching for her  right .  who came to visit before me .  who   s looking for her .      the man shook his head a little too quickly .     don   t know .         don   t know what .  who  if  when .         never saw them before .         them .  two .  more .         two .  man and a woman .         the man     coren said .     short  stout  yellow skin .      a scowl flashed across his face .     no  it was  i don   t know .  leave me alone .      coren resisted the urge to grab the smaller man .  strong arming would do no good  but he wondered just how far subtlety would get him .      listen  gato     he said gently     jeta   s in trouble .  if i don   t find her first she   ll be dead .  savvy .  now  who came .         never  i      the man swallowed loudly and closed his eyes .     dead .     he whispered .      very dead .       the man nodded weakly .     she  two days ago  third shift  she says time to go  she   s sorry .  be back in a few days for her jumble          her what .         jumble  her stuff          all right  go on .         asks me just to spot who comes looking .  like you guessed .          and .         three hours later this tall gato  long coat  tosses her cube .  didn   t see me .  stayed in her place maybe twenty minutes .         tall .  anything else .         dark skin  like he   s seen sun or something .  didn   t blink .         didn   t blink .  .  . his eyes .         what else you got that blinks .         did he talk to you .         no     the man said indignantly .     i said he didn   t see me .         you said a woman .         came yesterday .  looked around jeta   s cube  stayed maybe an hour  then left .          what did she look like .         wore a mask .  not too big  though  but          nobody stopped her .         the other one was with her  stayed outside .          you don   t know where jeta might have gone .         no     the man insisted .   coren grunted .  he took a gamble .     who   s seven .      the man frowned .         seven    .  i don   t know .  .  .     he seemed honestly ignorant  so coren dropped it .      did these gatos talk to anybody else .         might have .     the man paused  thought it over for a moment .     yes  did .  cobbel and renz .  they got the first cubes at the edge .      coren suppressed a smile .     what did this tall gato sound like .         kind of raspy voiced  like he had trouble breathing .  but it came out of his chest  real deep .  cobbel and renz didn   t like him too much .          did the woman talk to anyone .         no .      coren considered .  then he stood .     all right  thanks .  i   m not here to hurt jeta .  you tell her the gato that paid her twice market for that last data she sold needs to talk to her again .  tell her to find me if she wants to stay alive .  savvy .         how   ll she find you .         same way she found what i wanted .  she   ll know .  you see her  you tell her to stay on the move  though .          serious shit .     the man asked .   coren nodded .     very .       he backed out of the cubicle and reentered jeta   s cube .  he took out his palm monitor and adjusted it  then turned a slow circle till a light flashed red .   from up in the corner  tucked in a crack between the wall and the ceiling  he removed a small button .  he repeated the scan and found another one  on her desk amid a jumble of electronics  pretending to be a relay switch .   if there were more  his monitor missed them .  he opened a slot in the side of the monitor and dropped them in .  they barely fit .   at the edge of the hab collection  he paused .  then he knocked on the nearest door .   a woman looked out at him .  she said nothing  only waited expectantly .      cobbel or renz .     coren said .      renz .  what .         the tall gato talked to you about jeta fromm .      she frowned .     what about him .         did he give you a code to tap if you found jeta .         you police .         private .          ah .     she stepped out .  she was quite a bit shorter than he  surprisingly so .     he tapped us .  ears allover the place .  cobbel   s still looking for all of them .  we figured that  when he didn   t give us a code .          he knew you   d lie .      rena shook her head .     wouldn   t lie .     she smiled .     wouldn   t tell him anything .          what was he like .      she frowned again  thoughtfully .     scary shit .  never blinked .  skin looked wrong .          wrong how .         don   t know .  just wrong .  diseased  maybe .  too smooth .  no veins .     she studied him narrowly .      jeta   s in trouble .         looks that way .  bad trouble .         you trying to help .         my fault .  trying to cover accounts .      renz nodded .     you won   t find her .  best she finds you .          if you see her  tell her .  i need to talk to her .         ain   t seen her in a few days .  she knows how to find you .      coren nodded .     i don   t think there   s much jeta can   t find .  do you .      that elicited a sly smile .      just out of curiosity     coren asked     how long has she lived here .  people in her profession move a lot  i know .         long enough     renz said .     longer than most  three months or so .       coren nodded .  that was a long time  for a data troll .      i   m going      coren said .     you see her  tell her .  i need to talk to her soonest .      he went to the steps .  he glanced back and saw people watching him now  openly .  something had passed through here that had scared them .   coren hurried down the steps .   on the way back to the tube station  coren stopped at a public comm and punched in the code he had found .  the screen flashed disconnected source .  he studied the note for a time  trying to decide if it would be worth his while to try to find this seven .  in the end  he fed the paper into a recycler .  no time to be as thorough as he wanted .  he tapped in the code for the auroran embassy and began making his way through the maze of connections to find the person he needed to speak to .     third shift was just beginning in petrabor sector .  coren   s timing was close  arriving at the warehouse just ahead of the crew .   he stood across from their entrance and this time they noticed him as they filed in by groups of twos and threes .  he no longer wore the tattered leftovers of a warren ghost but the fine suit of someone in authority  an inspector or manager or perhaps a cop .  as they saw him their friendly chatter died away  replaced by suspicion and silence .   coren had about half an hour before he needed to catch a semiballistic to d . c .  he studied the faces that passed before him  matching them to his memory  but the sixteenth crewman failed to appear .  no surprise .   the foreman emerged from the employee access and came toward him .  he was a short man  middle aged and just beginning to lose the firm lines of a body made powerful during time working the bays instead of just supervising others .      can i help you .     he asked  stopping a meter away .   coren held up his id  which contained the emblem identifying him as a licensed independent security investigator .  the foreman almost took a step closer to examine it  but coren shoved it back into his pocket .      last night     coren said     you took your crew out during on duty time .  a place called dimilio   s .      the foreman   s eyes became wary .     what about it .      coren shook his head sorrowfully .     that   s not contract .         the guild send you .  management .         what do you think would   ve happened if the routers had glitched with no one there to shut it down .         routers never glitch .         they do if they   re hacked .      now the wariness turned to fear .     hacked .  .  .     he swallowed .     you   re talking about          i   m not talking about anything yet .  i   m asking .  why did you think it would all right to walk out midshift  en masse like that  for a few drinks .      the foreman scowled at him .     i don   t have to talk to you .      coren nodded agreeably .     that   s right  you don   t .  but if that   s what you decide to do  the next people you talk to will be ite inspectors .  they don   t give a damn about contract protections .       the foreman took a tentative step closer .     look  it was oril   s birthday .  not yesterday  but the day before  but there wasn   t time then to do anything .  busy shift .  things slowed down yesterday  there were a couple of windows  we figured  what   s an hour or two .  we   ve never had a problem       coren sighed dramatically .     contract says someone has to be on duty          there was .  we left the sub here .  he didn   t know oril anyway  no loss .         the sub .  i didn   t see any sub listed       the foreman looked pained for a second .     farom was out  he   s been having trouble with his kid .  he   s already past his allotment for personal time and sick days  any more and he gets written up .  we paid the sub out of our own pocket to come in for him so farom wouldn   t get the reprimand .         i need the sub   s name .         i   m telling you  farom   s a good worker          the sub   s name .     coren leaned closer and softened his voice .     if i can keep this off the record i will  it   ll save me a lot of trouble .  i don   t need the extra datawork .  i just have to verify that you didn   t leave your shift unattended .  word is that management has some losses to explain to shareholders .  you know how that is .  now there was a glitch in the logs for the time you were all toasting oril   s good health .  if it was operator error  then we can correct it on our end and leave you alone .     coren reached out then and grabbed hold of the foreman   s coverall .     but you pull that kind of shit again  i   ll have your ass in front of management and the guild conciliators .  understand .         yuri pocivil     the foreman said quickly .     he   s normally second shift at the number four yard .  he had personal time .         how did you come to call him .         we used him before .         covering for farom .      the foreman swallowed .     as a matter of fact  yeah .      coren released him .     yuri pocivil .  i   m going to have a talk with him .  he explains the glitch to my satisfaction  you won   t see me again .          we   ve never had any problems with him before .         happens when you step out of contract .  go back to work .      shaken  the foreman almost bowed as he backed away .  he   d recovered his composure by the time he reached the entrance .  he gave coren a last look  to which coren returned a reassuring nod  then disappeared inside the warehouse .     yuri pocivil had failed to report to work that day and his apartment was vacant .  coren was not surprised  but he was disappointed .  it would have been simpler had he found him .  pocivil was a more direct line to whoever was running the operation .   he made his way to the station  mulling over his next move .  the routing had been modified in baltimor .  that  at least  was convenient to his next stop .       four    d  erec avery watched the screens with mild interest .  the central view was a complex collection of concentric  overlapping rings .  where some of the lines crossed  pockets formed containing patternless amalgams of small shapes  like froth or dried  cracked mud  or a cloud of midges .  the right hand screen showed a similar view but without the pockets .  the left showed only chaos .   as he watched  the rings on the central screen expanded and shrank minutely  as if jockeying for position in a crowded container  occasionally sending waves through one or more of the broken pockets .  one pocket suddenly dissolved  quickly forming its own node and growing a set of rings .  on the opposite side another pocket  this one filled with what appeared to be different sized pebbles  wavered on the brink of dissolution .  the pocket changed shape  narrowing  nearly splitting in two  then reinflating .  abruptly  it solidified  the pebbles merging to form a smooth surface .  then the wall burst and pebbles spilled across the orderly waves of circles  rupturing them  forming new pockets of disorder  and within seconds the screen lost all sign of pattern .      disappointing     said a calm  genderless alto voice .      what happened  thales .     derec asked  though he already knew .      i lost a primary anchor in the matrix     replied his office   s resident intelligence .     when it went  it caused a cascade .         did you know it was a primary anchor .         no .  that is  of course  the problem .  i have to assign anchor points without knowing how they relate to the entire matrix .  some are unimportant and stable  others are primary and stable  but a few are primary and corrupted .  when they go  they corrupt the entire system .         maybe you   ll get lucky next time  thales .      the positronic intelligence did not reply .  thales had long since catalogued most of what it called derec   s    sympathy concessions     meaningless phrases used to soothe hurt feelings or disappointments that  according to thales  seemed important to people not for what they contained  because they contained nothing useful  but for the fact that they were said .  for the moment  it appeared thales did not consider a response necessary .   the chaos filling the screen in front of derec  so far resist ant to thales    attempts at restoring pattern and function  showed all that remained of derec   s ambition  the flexibility of a human mind expressed in a positronic matrix .  he had always wanted to build a robotic intelligence that could cope with trauma  with failure  and recover from the brink of collapse .  he had hoped to build a robot that would work through three law violations and retain a coherent structure  preserving memory and identity in the face of the unacceptable .   he had failed .   the physical fragments of what had been the robot bogard filled a crate  awaiting shipment .  .  . somewhere .  the positronic remnants of bogard   s mind filled a buffer in thales    generously large  though currently abbreviated  memory .  bogard   s collapse had resulted from the death of bok golner  a death for which bogard had felt responsible  indeed had inadvertently caused .  golner had been a killer  an anti robot fanatic  and had been about to kill derec when bogard came to his creator   s rescue .  but none of that mattered in the absolutist structure of a positronic brain which prohibited the taking of a human life  intentions notwithstanding .  thales believed the key to bogard   s failure could be pulled from those shards .  but after nearly a year  they had proved indecipherable .  thales continued to express optimism  derec was not as sanguine .      perhaps     the ri said     i should make a copy of each stage so that i can reset one step back rather than do the entire construct over .  of course  that would require a larger memory buffer than the one to which i now have access .         oh  well     derec said  standing .     sorry .         i understand  derec .  no need to apologize .      perversely  derec felt a pang of guilt .  that lack of memory had been a problem throughout thales    attempts to reorder bogard   s matrix .  thales simply did not have enough in its present configuration .  derec counted them both lucky to have as much as they did .  of course  any less might begin impairing thales    normal functions .      i can try to make another request .  .  .     he said .      if you think it will help .      no  he thought  but it might make me feel better to try .  .  .   derec reached to the screen of chaos and touched an icon .  the screen went blank .      do you wish me to continue  derec .     thales asked .      sure .  i   m .  .  . i have some other things to tend to .         of course .      derec drifted into his living room .  against one long wall a subetheric showed two political candidates soundlessly debating .  he frowned  recognizing one of them  rega looms .  for a moment  derec felt confused  then remembered that looms was running for a senate seat in the upcoming election .  he had declared in opposition to jonis taprin  who had replaced clar eliton the previous year in a recall election .  taprin ran now on a revised  anti robot platform  a complete about face from his position not fourteen months earlier when  as eliton   s vice senator  he had supported what had become known as    concessionism    and a gradual reintroduction of positronics on earth .   in retrospect  derec did not know how much he had ever believed it could be done .  in earth   s long history of social change  fickle politics  and policy by trend  the ban on positronics had lasted the longest and tenaciously resisted reform .  hard to believe  on a world where once the newest and brightest and best technologies had been created and dispensed and embraced with almost childlike passion for novelty .   curious  derec turned on the volume .        travel to other worlds has diluted earth   s reservoir of genius     looms said  jabbing the armrest of his chair with a stiff finger .     i   ll concede that you now hold a position with which i have long been in agreement  that positronics should not be allowed a return to earth  but i feel that you don   t go far enough .  positronics is not the only threat .         mr .  looms  with all due respect     taprin said smoothly  clearly the more practiced public figure     you can   t expect us to shut down commerce .  what you suggest would break the back of our economy .         no  sir  i think that   s alarmist and misleading .  economies are artificial constructs  just like any other machine .  we make them what we want them to be .  i am simply saying that we should change the way in which we operate our economy so that we can eventually sever all ties to other worlds .         but  sir  you must take into account that there are citizens  terrans  who simply don   t want those ties severed .         there are also terrans who want positronic robots     looms countered .     we don   t let them dictate policy .         the numbers  sir  the numbers       derec switched off the subetheric .  looms    campaign strategy seemed to be to try to become more reactionary than his reactionary opponent .  a year ago derec would not have given that tactic a chance of success  but earth always surprised him .      you have a call  derec     thales said .     ambassador ariel burgess .       derec considered telling thales to say he was out .  instead  he went to the comm and pressed his thumb on the accept .     hello .         i hope i   m not interrupting anything  derec  but are you busy right now .     ariel asked crisply .   the visual was off  so derec allowed himself a wry smile .     nothing pressing .         would you come up to my office .  i need  i   d appreciate your opinion on something .            something .     for instance .      there was a pause .     please .      derec blinked .  please .  .  .  .     i   ll be right there .         thank you .       the connection broke and derec stared at the comm  baffled .      thales  i   ll be in ambassador burgess   s offices for a while     he said  moving to the door .     in case anything comes up .         very well  derec .        ariel   s offices consisted of four large chambers in the main diplomatic quarter of the auroran embassy .  the lone robot at the reception desk magnified the impression of emptiness  only one robot  out of a staff of four robots and eleven people a year before .      ambassador burgess is expecting you  sir     the robot said as he entered .     go right through .         thank you .       derec pushed open the door to ariel   s personal office .   he hesitated .  hofton stood behind and to the left of ariel   s chair  hands folded appropriately before him  posture straight and attentive  looking as if he had not been absent for most of the last year  transferred to another office .  he inclined his nearly hairless head in greeting but otherwise said nothing  face professionally expressionless .   a man sat in one of ariel   s highback visitor   s chairs .  he stood as the door closed behind derec .  tall  wide shouldered  with short  gray flecked hair  dark eyes set deep below pale eyebrows  and a too straight nose that hinted at cosmetic retouch  he looked familiar to derec .      mr .  lanra     ariel said     this is derec avery  special attach   to my department .       derec gave her a sharp look .      derec      she continued smoothly     this is coren lanra  head of security for dynan manual industries .      derec gripped lanra   s hand .     i   ve heard of you  of course .  mia daventri said you helped her out during the managin .  .  . situation last year .         indeed      lanra said .     and you    re the head of phylaxis group .          once upon a time .      lanra frowned .      i   ve asked mr .  avery     ariel said     to sit in as an impartial witness .  he   s attached to my office but he doesn   t work for me  unlike hofton .      lanra sat down .     i   d hoped to confine this meeting to just you and i  ambassador burgess .          humor me  mr .  lanra .  the past year has made me wary of private meetings .      lanra almost smiled at that .     very well .  i have a problem which may interest you .  i   d like to enlist your expertise .         in what capacity .      derec moved to the other visitor   s chair and sat down .  lanra seemed to be deliberating  lips pursed  hands pressed together meditatively .      you must understand     he said slowly     that this has nothing to do with dynan .  this is a private matter concerning rega looms and myself .         if you say so     ariel said dryly .   lanra sighed wearily .     rega looms    daughter was found dead less than twenty four hours ago on kopernik station .  she was involved in running baleys and was apparently accompanying a group of them .  all fifty two are dead .      ariel winced .     i   m terribly sorry .  but how          she had a robot in her possession .      derec sat forward  startled .  hofton moved his hands behind his back  which made him seem even more attentive .  ariel stared at lanra  openly amazed .   after a long silence  ariel cleared her throat .     this hasn   t been on the newsnets .         not yet     lanra said .     i hope to keep it that way for a few days .  longer if possible  but sooner or later someone is going to make some connections  find a source  something .         that   s    unique  mr .  lanra .  .  .      lanra said nothing .          the daughter of rega looms     derec said  as much to break the silence as to confirm what he had heard     had a robot .         yes  mr .  avery .         her own .         i presume so .         and where is it now .         on kopernik  under security lock .         forgive me     ariel said     but i still don   t see how this concerns us .      derec frowned at her .     this robot  it was collapsed .         uh .  .  . yes      lanra said .     frozen up  unresponsive .  but there   s activity  at least  there   s current still running through it .  i don   t know enough about them to know if that means anything .         well      derec began .      i repeat     ariel interrupted     i still don   t see how this concerns us .      lanra shifted uncomfortably .     forgive me  but it was my understanding that you are the liaison from the calvin institute here on earth .      ariel pursed her lips  inclining her head as if to say and .  .  .  .      this is a robotics issue     lanra said .     your field .  positronics .     his expression darkened .     i don   t know anyone else here .  if there are other specialists  i   m not aware of any  at least  none i can get access to .         and none you   d want to confide this to in any case     ariel said .     i suppose you want us to try to recover its memories  if possible .          something like that .      ariel laughed sharply .     how much do you know about our situation  mr .  lanra .  mia surely told you something about our current problems .  i can   t believe you   d come here like this without having done a little background work .      lanra straightened in his chair and the hint of a smile tugged at his lips .     i know that you aren   t held in very high esteem by your own people .  last year   s events with senator eliton          ex senator eliton     ariel said crossly .        didn   t come out in your favor  as perhaps they should have .         that   s generous of you  mr .  lanra     derec said .       generous .  no  mr .  avery  merely fair .  ex senator eliton   s duplicity cost us all a gram or two of flesh .  we were both under scrutiny for things eliton engineered .      faking his own death to discredit positronics  spacer diplomacy  ruin a long overdue reconciliation with earth  derec thought bitterly  and wrecking my own ambitions as a side effect .  .  . yes  that was an expensive experience .      involving ourselves in terran affairs     ariel said slowly     cost us perhaps a bit more than you know .         i may be able to help you defray some of those costs .      ariel shook her head .     based on the chance that rega looms will be elected to the terran senate .  you have to know how ironic that would be to us .     she stood .     i   m sorry  mr .  lanra  but i don   t really think there   s anything we can do to help you .         you haven   t heard everything yet      lanra said  rising .      i   m not interested .         then why did you agree to see me .         simple courtesy  mr .  lanra .  you were helpful to us last year .  i   m sorry we can   t return the favor  but the situation is too complicated just now .  if you   ll excuse me .         but       derec watched ariel end the interview with a firm shake of her head .  she glanced at him  then left the office  leaving lanra staring after her .   the door closed and lanra sighed heavily .  he looked at derec .     i don   t suppose you can do anything .         like what .  talk her into something that i agree is a bad idea .         i thought you   d be interested in the problem .  i thought you might welcome a chance to       derec shook his head .      you   re not interested .      derec laughed .     of course i   m interested .  that   s beside the point .         you   re a private citizen  mr .  avery .  would you consider taking the job as a consultant .  i imagine ambassador burgess could order you to stay here  but would she if you took this up of your own choice .      lanra   s eyes danced knowingly  as if he knew something about derec no one else did .  under other circumstances  derec decided  coren lanra might be an interesting man to know .      we misjudged you      derec said .     you knew exactly what our problems were before you came in here  didn   t you .  i   m not exactly a private citizen  not in any way that gives me the freedom of movement to do what you ask .  aurora   s entire policy is one of wait and see  don   t move  stay still and maybe the situation will change .  so even if ariel might want to help you  it   s doubtful ambassador setaris would allow it .  but you knew all this .  why pretend otherwise .         i didn   t want anyone to feel pressured .  people work better if they think they have a choice .     lanra shrugged .     a pleasure to meet you  mr .  avery .  perhaps under other circumstances .  .  .     he headed for the exit .     if you reconsider          i have your code  sir     hofton said .      thanks .       the door closed softly and derec let out a heavy breath .  he considered for a few moments doing exactly what lanra suggested  taking the job  whatever it was  and chancing ariel   s anger .   but she had a good point  what chance was there that rega looms could win his run for the senate .  and if he did  how likely would it be that he would help the very people he most wanted off earth .      i hate it when she   s so right     derec said .  he looked up then at hofton  who seemed amused .     you were awfully quiet .         not my place to interject opinion     hofton said .     besides  i concur with ariel   s assessment .         what are you doing here anyway .  i thought you had been assigned to another department .         which has been shut down .  i   m taking leave from official duties for a time .  ariel asked me to attend this meeting as a favor .      another department closed .  .  . the auroran presence on earth shrank a little more each week .  ariel kept these offices only because they had no other use for them .  she retained her title and  presumably  her perks for appearances only  but derec knew that ambassador setaris would ship her back to aurora in an instant if she could .  derec  too  for that matter .  they were embarrassments to the auroran mission here  they stayed only because admitting it to earth by recalling them would be more embarrassing .   but it would not take much to shift that balance .   still  to get his hands on a complete positronic lab would be worth a few risks .  he might be able to get thales the extra memory buffers then  might be able to set up a more thorough analysis protocol on bogard  while working on lanra   s problem  might       derec .      ariel stood in the doorway .     don   t even think about it .           i know you too damn well .      ariel poured them drinks .  hofton sat now in the chair vacated by coren lanra .  derec reflected idly that he had never before seen hofton relaxing .  ariel handed him a scotch  then gave another to derec .      you were just as tempted as i was     derec said .      i doubt it .  i   ve had enough of being burned by terrans .       derec sipped at his drink .     but think of it .  rega looms  the great luddite  has  had  a daughter who owned a robot .         if i may point out     hofton said     mr .  lanra said a robot was found in her company .  he never said she owned it .         she was a baley runner     derec said .     that   s what lanra said  she was running illegal emigrants  she was in charge .  i don   t think a baley slipping by ite would be allowed to bring along a robot .  therefore  it   s only logical that it was hers .         lanra probably thinks the robot killed her     ariel said .     he wants us to substantiate his suspicion .  that would be convenient  wouldn   t it .  any help rega looms might have been able to offer would evaporate when we hand him verification of his worst fears .         come on     derec protested .     how could that be .  from his description  the robot is collapsed .  obviously a three law violation occurred          you had a robot that collapsed after it killed someone .      derec stiffened .     that was an accident .      ariel shrugged .     whatever .  so might this have been .  would rega looms appreciate the difference .         it   s doubtful in any event     hofton said     that mr .  looms  should he win the election  could do anything on our behalf under any circumstances without compromising his newly won mandate .  should he win  he will do so as the avatar of the anti robot faction and  unless i   ve misunderstood his rhetoric  the anti spacer faction as well .  added to that  his daughter was engaged in illegal activities that ran counter to his political position and the rhetoric of his church .  that can   t be explained away .  i suspect mr .  lanra is offering what he cannot guarantee .         if coren lanra has his way     ariel said     none of this will ever become public .  he   s doing damage control .         precisely     hofton said .     and with no public reason to do so  looms will have no private reason to fulfill any obligations his agents may make without his knowledge .         rega looms has a dead daughter     derec said .     someone   s going to notice .      they sat in silence for a time  brooding .  derec began to resent lanra for bringing something to them that offered the possibility of rehabilitating their situation .  raised hopes crumbled too easily under analysis .      it would be interesting     hofton said finally     to know where she got a robot .  and how she managed to keep it with her .     he finished his drink and stood .     i have a few chores to tend to .  thank you for the chance to act the part of your aide once more .  it was fun .  should you need further performances .  .  .         you   ll be the first i call  hofton     ariel said  smiling wanly .     thanks .      hofton bowed his head .     ambassador .     he walked out .      i   m going to miss him     ariel said .   derec shot her a look .     have you heard something .         no  but how much longer could it be .     she leaned forward and turned her glass idly on the desk .     i still do a little liaison work so i get to keep track of some of the numbers of illicit robot traffic .  there   s still activity  but it   s declined precipitously in the last year .         is that a surprise .  ite must be working overtime now that they feel they have permission .         mmm .  mostly  i get to do p . r .  work with irate spacer businesses .  the latest was a complaint about a five hour delay in shipping .  an unscheduled route change out of petrabor spaceport .     she shrugged .     five hours .  you   d think the world was ending to hear the complaint .  too much excitement sometimes .     she smiled grimly .     did you know alda mikels is being released next week .         i thought he was sentenced to ten years for public endangerment .       ariel shrugged .     terran jurisprudence .  damned if i can see what   s prudent about it .  but how long after that do you think it will be before he starts haranguing us in public of trying to bring a suit against us .  that might just convince setaris to ship us home .      derec closed his eyes and swallowed more scotch .  alda mikels  head of imbitek heavy industries  industrialist  engineer .  and murderer .  the trial had lasted nearly two months  scores of witnesses  experts and counterexperts testifying .  .  . but not one positronic specialist .  derec had been deposed  as had ariel  but neither of them had been called to the stand .  something about their status as noncitizens  it seemed  derec never did get it entirely straight .   mikels had sabotaged the complex resident intelligence of washington d . c .    s union station  the showpiece on earth for positronics .  the fragile treaties and agreements that had allowed it to be built in the first place as an intercultural zone where earthers might come to see for themselves how positronics worked  the first step in a hoped for reintroduction of robots to earth  shattered in the aftermath of that very system   s failure and the subsequent slaughter of so many spacer and terran diplomats .   a failure alda mikels had implemented .   but the end result had been that mikel   s sabotage had been poorly understood and therefore the harm he   d done had been rendered less his responsibility than the unpredictable nature of positronics .  derec had watched  amazed  when the lesser indictment of    public endangerment    had been handed down .   it had all been part of a larger scheme to discredit positronics and any possible diplomatic advancements in spacer terran relations .  at its center had been senator clar eliton  a man who had convinced aurora of his honest intentions to help bring robots back to earth .  for his part  eliton had escaped prison because of the frail evidence to connect him to mikels and the others involved  which included the former head of special service  who had vanished .  at least eliton had been recalled  losing his senate seat in the process .   not that his replacement  jonis taprin  was much better .  he was openly hostile to spacers and robotics .  better that than the oily duplicity in which eliton had indulged  derec felt .   but it had been mikels    technology that had undermined the positronic intelligence that ran union station and allowed a team of assassins to enter the main gallery and shoot down the gathering of diplomats who had arrived to commence the conference they had hoped would begin reconciliation .   coren lanra   s employer  rega looms  had been suspected for a time .  none of his people had been shot during the slaughter  which made him look very culpable .  but that  too  had been a set up .   their own involvement  derec   s and ariel   s  had gotten them sequestered to the embassy  in a legal limbo  awaiting deportation at the convenience of sen setaris  the head of the auroran mission on earth .  ariel   s confinement had been repealed after a few months as certain duties were returned to her  but as far as derec knew she rarely left .  he often wondered what was taking so long to deport them .  it seemed cruel to leave them dangling like this  teasing them with possibilities .  he had grown numb waiting .   he finished his scotch and went to the bar for another .      my question     derec said     is how come we   re being so careful .  do you really want to stay here .      ariel frowned .     i don   t          you    re afraid to do anything that might get us kicked back to aurora sooner .  we both know that   s what they intend to do anyway .  why are we being so careful .  i repeat  do you want to stay on earth .         i don   t know .     she looked at him .     don   t you .         under these circumstances .     he shrugged and left the question hang .  in truth  he was tom .  saying no would mean he had never found anything worthwhile here  which would be a lie .  saying yes meant he was willing to tolerate anything to remain  which would be a bigger lie .  his affection for earth complicated his thinking .  he finished his second scotch and set the glass down .     thanks for the drink .  i have some time to hunt down and kill  so if you   ll excuse me .  .  .      ariel raised her own glass in mock assent .   derec left her offices and headed down the corridors  in the direction of his apartment  his mood muddied by the alcohol .  he reached the elevator and punched the button .      mr .  avery .      derec turned slowly .  coren lanra stood nearby .      forgive me     lanra said .     i just thought you   d like to know  that you   d be interested to know  that we believe a robot was responsible for nyom looms    death .      derec stared at him .  one more point in ariel   s favor .  .  .      that   s impossible  of course     he said .   lanra smiled thinly .     so you say .  but i suppose you   ll never know now .  thank you for your time .  sorry to bother you .      derec watched lanra walk away until the elevator door opened .       five    a  riel  you have a call .       ariel squeezed her eyes shut and groaned .  she rolled over  and the band around her skull tightened just enough to let her know that the muzzy warmth of too much scotch needed several more hours to sleep off .  too late .  she opened her eyes .   r .  jennie stood at the foot of the bed  impassive and attentive .      what .  what did you say  jennie .     her mouth felt gummy  barely cooperative .      you have a call .  ambassador setaris .          hell .  .  . what time is it .         two twenty .         in the morning .         i asked if it would be convenient for her to call again later  but she insists that she cannot .         of course she does     ariel complained as she pushed herself up and swung her legs over the side of the bed .     that   s what it means to be an ambassador .  ambassadorial prerogative .  .  . plenipotent  potentiary authority .  .  . executive privilege .  .  .     she shook her head .     two twenty .  .  .  what in .         i brought coffee .      ariel looked up at the robot .  a tray with silvered urn and various cups waited on ariel   s dressing table .  ariel sighed .     thank you  jennie .  tell ambassador setaris i will be there in a minute .  or two .         yes  ariel .      it seemed to ariel that her robot left the room gratefully  as if relieved to have something to do other than watch ariel struggle with a hangover .  impossible  really .  .  . or was it .  empathic mimicry was part of the positronic package .  .  .   ariel stood  dismissing the thought .  too complicated at the moment .  she stumbled only once on her way to the coffee .  she poured without trembling and raised the cup of hot  black liquid to her lips .  the aroma  usually welcome  made her shudder briefly  but she swallowed a mouthful without incident and decided that she would manage .   she caught sight of herself in the dressing table mirror and frowned at the deep circles under her eyes .  her black hair stood out in chaotic spikes and she noticed that she had the faint beginnings of jowls and a double chin .  the rest of her seemed trim enough  though she had not paid serious attention to her body in nearly a year .  she met her own eyes again  normally a clear blue  but cloudy now and slightly unfocussed  and saw the weariness .  this past year had been a steady mix of boredom and anxiety  layered over a sense of helplessness .  instead of fighting it she had taken to sense dulling indulgence .  it showed .   she finished the cup  poured another  and pulled on a robe .   r .  jennie had kept the screen on the comm blanked .  ariel sat down before the compact unit  ran fingers through her hair  and keyed accept .      good morning  ambassador     she said  letting sarcasm leak into her voice .      my apologies  ariel  i realize this is an inconvenient hour      setaris said smoothly .     i need to speak to you in person .  please come to my office .      ariel glanced at the time chop in the lower left corner of the screen .     i   m feeling a little          of course you are .  i imagine you have been for a while .  perhaps we can do something about it .  would you be so kind as to be here in an hour .  we have some things to discuss .          um .  .  . of course .         very good  ariel .  see you then .      the link died and ariel felt a hard lump develop just behind her breastbone .  what the hell .  .  .  .      jennie  it looks like we may finally be taking that journey .         shall i begin packing  ariel .         no .  .  . not yet .  but do an inventory .         yes  ariel .      ariel had expected to be recalled to aurora for nearly a year .  that it had not yet happened worried her .  now that it seemed imminent  it worried her more .   the message light winked on before her .  she automatically touched accept .   a single line of type scrolled across the screen .     we haven   t finished with you  ambassador burgess .  k . p .     ariel stared at it for some time before she keyed for a trace .  she knew it would not be backtracked  she had gotten messages like this before .  since last year   s trial  a dozen or more of these had been a daily nuisance .  most had come from recognizably marginal obsessives  harmless in any real sense  but a few had come from people who might have followed up on the threats  implied or otherwise .   it had been a few months  though  since a message like this had shown up on her system .  the screens the embassy had installed very efficiently and thoroughly blocked them all .  that one had gotten through was a mark of how good the sender was at penetrating protected systems .  which also showed just how dangerous he or she might be .   the trace came back negative .  no source could be located .   ariel finished her coffee and went to dress .     sen setaris   s offices dwarfed ariel   s .  even at this hour  embassy personnel scurried about constantly .  ariel counted five robots between the receptionist and setaris   s private office  and saw minor staff from at least four other spacer legations waiting in the anteroom .  the auroran embassy contained the main meeting hall for all joint legation conferences  and at least four guest suites were attached directly to the offices .  ariel   s own chambers  four levels below  were one of a dozen departmental offices with quasi independent status .  their importance to the principle mission was reflected in their relative size .   even so  ariel was surprised to see so much business being done .  perhaps the entire mission was shutting down .  she had heard nothing that would have suggested so drastic a move  but then she had been kept out of most embassy affairs .   sen setaris looked up from a flatscreen on her desk when ariel entered .  she appeared as elegant and austere as ever  thick  silvered hair forming wings around her narrow head  eyes large and brilliant green  and the ideal set of lines on her otherwise smooth face to give the impression of experience and intelligence without pointing up age .  on earth she was an anomaly in that regard  as were most senior spacers  terrans lived relatively short lives  aging quickly until death at around a hundred  while spacers tended to live to two or three centuries .  ariel did not know setaris   s exact age  but it was well on toward two hundred .   she wondered if setaris slept anymore .      ariel     setaris said  smiling thinly .     how good of you to be so prompt .  sit down  i   ll only be another minute or two .       ariel suppressed a sarcastic smile and sat on the long sofa to the left of setaris   s desk rather than in one of the visitor   s chairs .  if setaris noticed the small breach of protocol she gave no indication .  she continued working on the flatscreen  touching it from time to time  until finally she picked up a stylus and dashed her signature on the screen .  she shut the datum down and turned toward ariel .      what do you know about nova levis .     she asked .   ariel raised her eyebrows .     only what i   ve seen on subetheric .  it   s a settler colony that   s been blockaded .  they refused inspections for pirate bases or something .          that   s essentially correct  though  of course  there   s much more to it .  earth has requested spacer cooperation .  ships have been provided to patrol the perimeter of the system  but they want more .  they want an intervention .          you mean an invasion .         exactly .  it   s out of the question  of course  but we haven   t said no yet .  they   re offering us a chance to recoup our losses diplomatically .  if we could give them something to mollify their paranoia we might actually recover ground from .  .  .     setaris let the sentence drift off  her eyebrows raised suggestively .      what do we have to do with nova levis .     ariel asked .      nothing directly .  but it has been a transfer point for a good deal of black market trade .  that   s what started the terrans on this ill advised military operation .  solaria is still providing a limited amount of access  though  and earth has accused the fifty worlds of acting in collusion to thwart their legal mandate to investigate and control piracy .          do they actually have such a mandate .         they have ships around nova levis .  the finer points of law are so much wind under the circumstances .  it   s in our interest  however  to be seen as supporting legality in this case .  and because solaria has elected to ignore requests to cease any and all transport to nova levis  it falls to us to represent spacer adherence to law .         and in return  earth gives us what .         we gain credibility     setaris replied .   the true currency of diplomacy  ariel heard her finish .  she wondered if the solarians believed that .  she was not sure she believed it herself  but certainly her own credibility was no longer bankable .      why would solaria be so .  .  . uncooperative .     she asked .   setaris grunted .     do they need a reason .  but seriously  we don   t really know .  i   ve asked chassik and he keeps promising to look into it .         is nova levis hosting pirates .     ariel asked .   setaris frowned thoughtfully .     probably .  i   m afraid they may be involved in something worse .  but that   s speculation .  whatever they   re doing  it seems they think it necessary to hide it .       ariel waited .  when setaris remained silent  she asked     what does this have to do with me .         two things .  ite has suggested to us  without providing much proof      she gave ariel a dubious look as if to say as usual  then continued      that spacer businesses here are connected to the illicit shipments going to nova levis .  it seems that  they suggest  baley running and contraband travel the same routes and that we are colluding in all this .         that   s ridiculous .         i agree  but can you say for certain .  do you know what our people are doing these days .      ariel stiffened  fully aware of the implied criticism .  she had been lapse  she had let things slide .  she could not remember the last inspection she had administered through the auroran manufactories on earth .  she found the idea that aurorans would be tangled up in running baleys as well as contraband ludicrous .  .  . but she could not make a case based on current knowledge .   and of course it was her responsibility .  she was still trade and business liaison .  .  .         and the other thing .     she asked .      you had a visitor yesterday .  coren lanra  security chief for dynan manual industries .      ariel managed to keep both surprise and disgust from her voice when she answered .     yes  i did .         may i ask what he wanted .      don   t you already know .     he wanted my help .  he has a problem with a robot .      setaris pursed her lips .      you   re not surprised .     ariel asked .      did you know that the daughter of rega looms is a baley runner .     setaris asked instead .     she   s been operating a successful underground emigration avenue for nearly five years .     she nodded at ariel   s silence .     i just learned this myself recently .  i was quite surprised .          did you know that she   s now dead as a result .     ariel asked .   setaris frowned at that .     this .  .  . robot problem          relates to her death .          interesting .  did you agree to help him .         no  of course not .         why not .         under the circumstances  i thought minimizing our involvement in what seems to me a terran police matter would be the best course .  was i mistaken .      setaris folded her hands on the desk and seemed to study them .     not entirely  no .     she drew a sharp breath and looked up .     but .  .  . there are certain limitations official status imparts which can be very frustrating .  all circumstances have boundaries .  mine may be more constraining than yours in some cases .      ariel frowned .     are you suggesting that i help mr .  lanra .         the terrans are very concerned with their baley problem .  a growing fraction of them seem to be heading for nova levis .  the place has acquired a certain status since the embargo  a faux romantic patina making it seem more attractive than other .  .  . less notorious colonies .  it may be also that nova levis has the facilities for trans shipping them to other colonies more efficiently than trying to get direct routes from here .  that   s one of the suggestions i   ve heard .          you sound dubious .          most baleys get to where they want to go without a terrible amount of trouble  there are plenty of freelance pilots with ships for hire to take them .  and  frankly  i   m not convinced terran authorities really want to stop them .  but nova levis is different .  it requires blockade runners .  this is a problem on an order of magnitude higher than simple illegal emigration .          you think solaria is involved in getting them past the blockade .         it   s one of those certainties one can   t prove without creating an incident .  it might be possible to prove it from this end with less incident .         and you   ve been asked  unofficially  by earth to see if you can do something about it .      setaris almost smiled .     you know  you   re very sharp  ariel .  i   ve always admired that about you .  .  . even when you   re suffering the effects of alcohol poisoning .  imagine what you can do with a clear head and a purpose .      the sarcasm sank through ariel like a wave of muggy heat .  ariel felt herself start to bristle  but checked it before she said something impolitic .      i   m not entirely clear how rendering assistance to mr .  lanra would help us with any of this     she said instead .   setaris frowned .     now you   re being obtuse .  nyom looms and coren lanra had a relationship once .  we don   t know why it ended or if it did .  in either case  it seems logical that if she   s running baleys then her father  or someone in her father   s organization  is helping her .      ariel laughed briefly .     coren lanra doesn   t strike me as the type .          perhaps not .  but the connection exists nonetheless .      ariel nodded slowly  understanding exactly what setaris was asking her to do .  in a way  it made perfect sense  ariel was the most expendable member of the auroran mission .      can i expect any kind of extra consideration should things work out well .     she asked .      ariel  you know extra consideration is always on the table for good work .      but what constitutes    good    work .  politically convenient or thorough .      i   ll want hofton reassigned to me     ariel said .      i think you need an aide in any case .  it doesn   t look good to be all alone in your department .      ariel stood .     what level of access do i have .      setaris looked genuinely surprised .     i don   t believe your clearance was ever rescinded  ariel .         i would like confirmation of that .       setaris regarded her for a long time before nodding .      by this afternoon  if it   s not too much trouble     ariel said then  turning .      don   t you feel sometimes that you   ve been on earth too long  ariel .  that certain of their less admirable qualities have transferred .         i like to believe that it goes both ways  ambassador .     she made herself present a pleasant  innocuous  naive smile  though she did not expect setaris to be fooled .     if you   ll excuse me  i have to make some calls .      ariel expected setaris to call her back and retract everything  but she made it to the door without hearing her voice .  she wondered then what kind of confirmation she would actually get when she returned to her own office and checked .   her heart hammered as she reached the main corridor .  her head still hurt  but for the time being she did not really mind .     halfway back to her office she came to another conclusion and entered a general clerical station to call hofton .  an hour later  he joined her in the embassy restaurant at a table beside a bank of windows that overlooked an open air park on the roof of the building .  false dawn gave everything a shimmery  vague appearance .  beautiful  she thought  and pitied the agoraphobic terrans who could not enjoy such a simple  open view .      i understand     hofton said as he sat down     that i   m working for you again .         when did you receive notice .         around midnight .  i didn   t bother going to bed .  i gather you know something about this .      ariel chuckled .     she told you before she called me .  that   s interesting .     ariel gazed out the window for a time .  the trees swayed in a breeze .  somewhere to the east lay the atlantic ocean  somewhere northwest was the spaceport .  it would be pleasant  she thought  to live on a world where you didn   t have to make a special trip just to see open sky and trees .  .  .   hofton waited patiently .  at some point during ariel   s reverie he had ordered an iced drink .      sorry     she said  turning back to him .     to answer your question  yes  i know something about it .  not enough  of course  but it seems we   re being given a chance to redeem ourselves .          at what cost .      ariel shrugged .  the question was rhetorical  hofton understood the machinery of politics better than she .     ambassador setaris would like us to render assistance to mr .  lanra .      hofton frowned contemplatively .     i suppose     he said     we have no choice .       ariel flashed a sarcastic smile .     oh  sure .  we have a choice .      hofton looked skeptical  then raised his glass in mock toast .     here   s to damnation  then .  who do we have to kill .          six    c  oren kept a private office in an old quarter of d . c .   far from the corporate warrens of dynan .  he had not used it in nearly eight months .  when looms had asked him to find nyom  he hired the best cleaner he knew to find any and all eyes and ears .  only a few had turned up  and those had long since been severed at the receiving end .  coren set up a screen to let him know if any new ones turned up  and moved in .   the neighborhood was undergoing one of its period downturns in popularity .  not a year earlier  it was impossible to find available space here  but now even his own building was nearly empty .  he had leased the space before accepting the position with dynan  right before it had become really popular  thinking that he would go into private practice after leaving special service .  he had never used it for business other than dynan   s  though  and sometimes thought about breaking the lease and letting it go .  he was glad now that he had kept it .   he walked through the small reception area and into the main office .  he shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on the pole by the door .      good afternoon     his desk said .     please verify identity .      coren sat down and placed his palm against the id scan on the desktop .  he felt a moment   s warmth as the machine explored his hand  body temperature  blood chemistry  and pattern of bone growth .      welcome  mr .  lanra     the desk said .     you have three messages .          list     coren said .      one from sipha palen  one from rega looms  and one from myler towne .         who is myler towne .         director protem of imbitek incorporated .      coren drummed his fingers tentatively on the edge of the desk .     play rega looms     please .      the flatscreen remained retracted  no video  typical of rega .  a crisp tenor voice snapped out of the air .      coren  i   m in dukane district  code appended .  i would appreciate an update on that detail i asked you to look into at your earliest convenience .  i   ll be here till tomorrow  then i   m going to      he paused .     going to delfi .  i   ll forward the code when we get there .      coren checked the time chop .  most likely right now rega looms    entourage was packing him up to leave dukane .  it would not be a good time to interrupt  especially with bad news .  besides  coren thought  it would be best to tell rega in person .  he did not want to  for anyone else a comm dialogue would be sufficient .  but not rega .      desk  see if you can get me an update on mr .  looms    itinerary for the next three days .          yes  sir .         play sipha palen   s message  please .      this time the flatscreen slid up from the desk top and winked on .  sipha   s face filled the field .      coren  we   ve got prelims on the autopsies .  atropimyfex  an atropine based neurotoxin .  basic crystalline structure that gasifies on contact with moisture  in this case  the humidity of all those exhaling lungs .  it has the same profile as certain beneficial pharmaceuticals  but my pathologist says it didn   t need the camouflage since the rebreather   s filter system wouldn   t have caught it anyway .  baxin is really impressed  by the way .  says this is very sophisticated stuff  high profile .  it   s used mainly in terraforming work  suppression of indigenous fauna .  very expensive and not available legally on earth .  someone way up the chain wanted these people dead .  he   s doing work ups on all of them just to be sure  but he estimates that death came within five minutes of the first seizures .  paralysis in under ten seconds  then gradual destruction of the autonomic nervous system .  it starts breaking down  then  and becomes very difficult to trace in a few days .       she glanced off screen briefly .     nyom looms is a different matter .  she was evidently smart enough to carry her own breather .  we found it in one of the couches  crushed .  she died from a broken neck .  i   m having baxin go over her for any foreign material  he found some fabric under her fingernails  but he says you can rule out the robot we found .  whoever killed her was still on board  there   s no sign that anyone got out .  so we have a suicide murder .  i know that   s not what you thought we   d find  but .  .  .      she shrugged elaborately .     no sign of the robot you told me about .  the only thing we   ve gotten out of there are corpses .  no telltale handprint on nyom  either .  this was a very clean break  anyone with the hand strength and the training could have done it .  that   s all the good news i have  coren .  i   m sending you an encrypted data package with everything we   ve got so far .  let me know what you turn up down there .  i hope you come back up soon .      coren suppressed a mild shudder .  a return flight .   he had not hoped to find the second robot  but if the seals were intact from the inside  then someone had to have accompanied the baleys up .  so one of nyom   s own baleys had committed the crime .  it strained credulity .   but there was a missing passenger .  .  .       desk  code a reply to sipha palen  use same encryption .  sipha  we may still be looking at a robot  just not the one we have in the locker .  the second one got out somewhere  and someone else might have gotten in .  we don   t know what the exact procedure is for this kind of smuggling .  keep me apprised of what you find under nyom   s fingernails .  i   m still trying to find my informant .  she   s disappeared  of course .  i   ll comm you later .  desk  send .         yes  sir .  message encrypted and sent .  you have one message remaining .         wait .      jeta fromm posed a problem .  without her  tracking down the people nyom worked with would take days  weeks .  finding the dockworker  yuri pocivil  would be even harder .   for now  though  he had no answers .  maybe she would contact him  but he doubted it .      desk  do a records search for yuri pocivil .  last known residence in the petrabor district .  now play the last message .      appearing on the flatscreen was a face coren did not recognize  with a wide brow and short  black hair .  large  moist brown eyes stared out at him .      mr .  lanra  please forgive the presumption .  i   m myler towne  current administrative head of imbitek .  you may know our company .      he smiled slightly at his own false modesty .     i   m familiar with you  of course  and with your record .  we   d like to discuss the possibility of acquiring your services ourselves .  if you   re interested  please give me a little of your time and we can talk .  my code is appended .  i hope to talk with you soon .       the screen went blank and slid out of sight .   coren laughed out loud  then sobered .  surely this was a joke .  or was myler towne  temporary mouthpiece for the company that had nearly ruined rega looms  so ignorant of circumstances that he thought this was a good and accept able offer .   it might be amusing to meet with him and see how it goes .  .  .      do you wish to send a reply  sir .     the desk asked .      no .  not yet .  do you have that itinerary for me .         yes  sir .         let me see it .      a list of destinations within the northeastern quadrant of the continent appeared on the desk surface .  he skimmed it quickly  then touched one .  baltimor district .  that would be convenient  but rega would not be there for another two days .   still  lacking any other worthwhile possibility .  .  .      desk  send a message to rega looms  informing him that i   ll talk to him in delfi .  then find the code for brun damik at immigration and trade enforcement .          yes  sir .  do you wish me to connect you .         no  just give me a location .         baltimor district ite headquarters  level five  unnumbered private office .         thank you .       coren leaned back and considered what to do next .  brun damik would be a place to start  at least until he found fromm .   if he found her .   time  time  too damn little time .  .  .   he really did not want to speak with rega .  he could put that off for a day .  brun damik  though .  .  . so the man had a private  unnumbered office now .  coren chastised himself for not keeping better track of people he still knew in government service .  the trouble was  he had left originally out of a desire to have no more to do with government service  so he was unmotivated to pay close attention .   not very professional  coren .  not very professional at all .  .  .   that was the reason he had bought the desk in the first place  so he could overlook details like this without losing track of them altogether .  he appreciated his desk  it was the closest thing to full sentient awareness he could afford to buy on earth  just shy of illegal positronics .   illegal  but not unobtainable .  nyom had gotten hold of a robot  had even owned it long enough to name it and work with it under the noses of ite .   spacers kept robots within their own districts .  the ban on positronics had many  many holes in it .  there were even terrans who owned robots  fetishists and self indulgent social rebels who enjoyed flaunting the law and custom  even if only in private .   holes rega looms wanted to fill in  an ambition that would suffer should his daughter   s ideological treason become public .   coren stood and went to the door to his workroom .  a sofa sprawled the length of one short wall to the right  a low table before it .  an alcove contained changes of clothes .  to the left  three sets of shelves held a variety of boxes  bags  and objects  tech lanra used from time to time  some of it illegal even for him to possess .  he absently took a replacement optam from one shelf .   he locked the door and sat down on the sofa  folded his hands beneath his chin  and studied the shelves .  after a time  he heaved himself to his feet and went to a lower shelf .  he pulled out a shallow box and placed it on the table .   he took out a set of images and spread them over the table .  nyom looms  laughing  smiling  contemplative  seductive  playful  clothed  naked  painted  bathed in light .  the kind of pictures meant for one other person  exposed and cloistered at once .  old pictures  coren checked the dates  though he knew it without thinking  from five years ago .   one image showed them both  together  holding each other .      frivolously romantic      so nyom had pronounced them afterward  when it ended and she chose a life that discluded him .  disclusion  left out  overlooked  omitted  rather than excluded .  she never barred him from joining her  but she did not invite him  either .  probably because she already knew what he would say .   they had argued  he remembered  and she had left him confused .  it had taken some time for him to understand that part of what had hurt her was that he had not made a counteroffer .  he had not asked her to stay with him .  coren lanra did not think that way .  nyom had made a decision  what right had he to ask her to turn her back on her choice .   on the other hand  perhaps he still did not know what it had been about .   beneath the sheaf of images were three small boxes .  one contained a silver and jade bracelet  another contained a set of rings in gold and platinum  and the third held the receipt for an apartment lease they had shared .   coren stared at the pictures  left the boxes unopened  and grunted .  this was all  the only evidence outside his memories of their relationship .  all that remained of someone for whom he had cared .  all he would ever have of her  now .      she   s dead     he said quietly .     nyom is dead .      and then  for the third time in his life  coren lanra wept .     the office of immigration and trade enforcement  baltimor district  occupied five floors of a hexagonal block near the trade mall  where thousands of import export firms kept offices  adjacent to the warehouse warrens that occupied an apostrophe shaped wedge around the lines of the ancient harbor .  south of the district  spaceport facilities filled the upper levels and the urban canopy almost the entire distance to d . c .  passengers debarked in d . c .   at union station  cargo and its handlers came into baltimor  through customs and dissemination .   coren waited outside the administrative entrance  in a small cafe  watching .  brun damik emerged a little more than an hour before his regular shift ended .  damik walked quickly for a man of his size  but being so tall it appeared to be his natural gait .  coren had some trouble keeping up with him and nearly lost him twice before damik entered a restaurant .   coren watched from the entrance as damik was seated at a small table near the back of the dining room .  when the maitre d   h  tel approached  coren laid a credit note on his station and pointed at damik .      he   s alone  sir     the maitre d    said .  he palmed the note and turned his back while coren  smiling  entered the restaurant .   he sat down across from damik  who looked up from his salad  startled .      what   s good here  brun .  a little expensive for you  isn   t it .  take must be good this year .      damik   s face lost all expression for several seconds .  then  slowly  a wide grin compressed his features .     you ass .  lanra .  how are you .         busy these days .  but i thought i   d make time to talk to an old backstabber .  how are your connections these days  gato .      damik laughed loudly and slapped the table once  sharply .     what are you drinking .  i   m off shift  so it doesn   t matter .         i   m not  so it does .  are you buying .         of course .         nava .      damik frowned briefly .     that   s a solarian drink  isn   t it .      coren nodded .     tastes like a good bourbon but without the alcohol .       damik grunted .     very spacer .  riskless pleasure .  spineless ninnies .      coren shrugged .     good drink  though .         expensive .      he gestured for a waiter and gave the order anyway  including a beer for himself .     what have you been doing  coren .  still working for what   s his name .  rega looms .         i am .         he pays you well enough to afford good food .         when i have time to eat it .  what about you .  you   re not still counting canisters  are you .         not by hand  no .  they gave me my own department .         they must be desperate .       damik laughed again .  their drinks arrived and he raised his beer in a mock toast .  lanra tapped his glass and sipped .      so     damik said .     pleasantries aside  what do you need .      coren reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small hemisphere that looked like polished foam .  he pressed the base with his thumb and set it in the center of the table .   damik cocked an eyebrow .     does looms know you play with toys like that .         i take it you   ve seen one or two yourself  then .  no  actually  if rega knew what i use in the course of my job we   d probably have a serious policy disagreement .  fortunately  he   s not the sort of employer that pries a lot unless things go wrong .      damik thought about that .     has anything gone wrong .         we don   t have to be coy now  brun .     coren pointed at the hemisphere .     maybe special service has something that can unscramble the interference that   s generating  but it would take longer than our conversation .         you   re not staying for dessert  then .         i don   t think i   m staying for a second drink .  i asked how your connections are .  i meant it .         i got a promotion  didn   t i .         i   m talking about your black market ones .      damik grinned .     so   m i .  what do you need .         i stumbled on a diverted shipment recently .  you gimmicked a bay assignment all the way over in petrabor  some stuff for kysler .  i   m assuming it was you  or someone in your office .          you    stumbled    on it .  how does that work .         part of the job .  am i speaking to the right man .      damik shrugged .     what if you are .         baley running .  how does that work .      damik stabbed a forkful of green leaves and pushed them around the plate listlessly .     how much are you offering .         depends entirely on the quality of your data .          hm .  well  the cheap part is the actual transportation .  refitted cargo bins are popular .  usually  they only have to support life for a day or two till they get turned over to the ship that   s going directly to the colony of choice .  then it   s no different than steerage class .  most baleys  i can   t understand why they bother  they could go legally .         you know that   s not true .  ite screening sorts out    undesirables    and denies them visas .  that means anyone with a political opinion  technical skills above a certain level  and money they might take with them .  that   s about eighty percent of the people who apply .          if they   re that well off or that smart  why would they want to go .         i really don   t care .  go on .          the expensive part is the bribery .  you need a customs inspector  a set of transit permits  and enough to payoff a warehouse crew .  you need another customs official on the other end .          at kopernik .      damik nodded .     but you knew all this .         you left out the part i don   t know .  who do you start the process through .  who fronts the credits and who parcels out the payments .         it   s not that organized .  we   re talking about rats in the system  a few here and there .  whoever is taking money from the baleys themselves has to know who to talk to          not in every case     coren said .     that might be true for small groups  but in the last two years the numbers have increased .  there are shipments of up to three hundred people leaving in one group .         that   s a myth .  numbers like that  ite would look totally negligent  or subverted  to let them through .  no  the largest single group you   ll ever see go through would be fifty or sixty .  even that   s pushing it .     damik finished his salad .     so .         so that still means enough money to attract the people i   m looking for .  once they get a taste  they don   t go away  they assume control .      damik chuckled .     you never disappoint  lanra .  i can see why you left service  those idiots wouldn   t know what to do with a smart one like you .          i assume that means i   m right .  so who .         depends on the colony .  each one has a gatekeeper .         reporting to who .     coren asked .      i don   t know .  i imagine you   re right  there is some person or persons at the end of the chain  but .  .  .         okay .  then give me a gatekeeper .         which colony .         let   s say nova levis .      damik   s eyes widened fractionally  just for an instant .  he shook his head .     you don   t have that kind of credit .         how do you know .         because you   re overdrawn now and we haven   t even talked price .          i knew you were the right gato to talk to about this .  i always appreciated your honesty .         ha ha .  your wit hasn   t improved much .         but my credit has     coren said .   damik regarded him skeptically .  the waiter came and cleared away his salad plate  then set his dinner before him .  damik appeared to notice none of this  eyes fixed on coren .      do you remember     coren said as the waiter left     all that business last year involving clar eliton and the assassinations at union station .         lot of dead spacers .  so .         more than that   quite a few terrans were killed or hurt  too .  it was complicated .  for a time  rega looms was suspected .  in the course of doing my job  covering rega   s butt  technically  i learned a lot of details about a lot of people  mostly people i   ll never meet and never deal with .  but there   ve been exceptions .  you  for instance .      coren leaned forward  as if preparing to confide in damik .     we knew each other for .  .  . what .  six years before i left special service .         something like that .         in all that time i never knew you were a managin .  did you even know that yourself  or did you simply neglect to enter it in your file .     coren spread his hands .     none of my business  really .  before last year  none of anyone   s .  but they turned out to be less than simply embarrassing to someone like you .  they turned out to be  can you guess  brun .   a security risk .  now imagine that .  a bunch of fringe idiot anti spacer sociopaths an actual security risk .  i   ll tell you  brun  i got a real laugh out of that when i heard it the first time .  i thought     don   t those people at the terran bureau of investigation have anything better to do than upgrade their lists of the possibly dangerous all day long .  they should be after real criminals  real threats  real detriments to society .             you thought all that  did you .         yes  i did .  i thought all that .  but that was then .  today i thought     i wonder what the director of ite would say if he knew his freshly promoted chief of inspection at the baltimor station used to be one of those sorts .     and i decided to find out what you would think of it first .      coren sat back and smiled across the table at damik .   slowly  damik picked up a fork .     is that all .         no  no  no .  you were a real follower back then .  i   ve got your name attached to at least four other groups like the managins .  but to be fair  only two of those ever got serious attention from the tbi .      coren watched damik cut a piece of his cutlet and fork it into his mouth .     so  how   s my credit now .         still not good enough .     damik grinned crookedly .     i   ll tell you this  they   re all corporate types at the high end .  i wouldn   t be at all surprised if the guy getting out from rehab this week is one .         alda mikels .  is he the one you deal with .         i told you  i don   t know names       coren shifted in his chair  leaned on his forearms over the small table .     i asked  is that who you deal with .      damik moved back .  he studied coren with narrowed eyes for several seconds .  finally  he shook his head .     mikels is in jail  how could he do anything with baleys .  look  coren  that   s as much as you get       coren sat back .     let   s see  besides the managins  you were part of the campaign for terran rights  they were the ones who shut down the vats feeding calcubay district several years back .  about the time you were an active member  under the name of .  .  .     coren looked upward in mock concentration .     ah  i remember .  you called yourself    damil bruller  then there was          enough .         what   s the problem  brun .  no one can hear us .     coren gestured at his hemisphere .      how big a file do you have on me .         big enough .  come on  brun  i don   t have any desire to ruin your life .  this has nothing to do with you .  i just need to know how to find the people who would have had oversight on the last shipment of baleys out of petrabor that you so innocently arranged .  seriously  who do you deal with .  who helps you afford real pork .     coren took his own fork  reached across the table  and delicately worked loose a small piece of the gravy soaked meat .  he popped it into his mouth and smiled .     very good .         you don   t need to know that .         i   m afraid i do      coren said flatly .   damik let out a long  low breath  nearly a growl .     two people come see me to arrange things  a woman named tresha  and a man named gamelin .  at least  that   s what she calls him .  he never speaks  i assume he   s just muscle  he   s big enough .          tresha what .         the bank is closed for the day .      coren studied damik   s eyes  then shrugged .  he picked up his hemisphere and dropped it back into his pocket .      you don   t ever come talk to me again  lanra     damik warned .     we   re done .         oh  i wish i could promise that .  i really do .     coren smiled .     enjoy the rest of your meal .        coren entered a bar down the corridor from the restaurant  ordered a drink  then went into the restroom .  he shrugged out of his jacket  pulling it inside out  changing it from a dark green to a light blue .  he broke a small vial in his hands and smeared the thick liquid through his hair  which turned black in less than a minute .  he washed his hands before returning to his drink .   damik walked by a few minutes later .  coren gave him several meters before he sauntered after him .   damik went through the motions of surveying for a tail  but coren suspected that his skills were long unused and inadequate .  within two intersections  damik stopped looking behind him  and picked up his pace .   coren followed him to a high speed walkway that carried them south into the vast financial district that filled a lot of the area between baltimor and d . c .  he got off after ten kilometers and used a public comm .  coren counted off two minutes  twenty seconds .  damik left the booth and skipped across the accelerating lanes to continue south .   another ten kilometers .  coren took off his jacket and tied it around his waist .  damik had apparently decided no one would follow him from here and never bothered to do another survey .  coren moved closer out of contempt  as if to dare damik to recognize him  but the man never glanced back .   damik got off in a warehouse sector .  he descended three levels  to a home kitchen  and took a position leaning against one massive pillar .  he stood out in this t class area and drew a lot of odd looks  but he remained where he stood  feigning ambivalence .   coren turned his jacket out again  slung it by one finger over his shoulder  and skirted the edge of the kitchen till he found a table recently vacated .  he sat down before the remains of a late  vat based dinner  the rich yeast and grain aroma thick in his nostrils .  he gripped the nearly empty glass of beer and pretended to be enjoying the last of it  keeping damik in the corner of his field of vision .   about ten minutes went by before anyone approached damik .  an older man in an innocuous black jacket and gray pants came up to him .  coren slipped his optam out  adjusted its range  and waited .  just before damik and the old man were about to turn away  coren smoothly raised the device and recorded them .   they moved away from him .  the last coren saw of them  the old man put his arm around damik   s shoulders and patted him in an incongruously paternal manner .       seven    c  oren swallowed a painblock .  the throbbing along his neck and shoulder began to ebb .  he did not want to take the time to see his doctor  though he knew he should  he still did not know how badly he had been injured in petrabor .   he crossed the avenue to the open arcade .  shops alternated with private offices along both sides .  coren breathed in the mingled smells of several restaurants and food vendors .  at this hour he saw few people .  later  the place would be as crowded as it had been during the height of the last shift .   the door he sought turned out to be plain blue bearing a small nameplate  rw enterprises .   the image he had recorded of the older man matched quickly to a name  ree wenithal  and the company he owned .  the public record contained a brief description and little else  a general import export firm specializing in textiles  licensed eight years ago  with ree wenithal listed as sole owner .  no recent police reports  at least not in the last three years .   coren had nearly paid a second visit to brun damik after his cursory check of wenithal   s company  what was their connection .  then he found the one detail that had brought him directly here  wenithal had been a cop .   coren pressed his fingers to the nameplate .      yes .     a polite voice asked .      coren lanra to see mr .  wenithal .         do you have an appointment  mr .  lanra .         no  but i think he   ll want to talk to me .  i was given his name by a mutual acquaintance  a man named damik .      coren waited .      very well  mr .  lanra .  please come in .      the door opened .   at the end of a short hallway  he passed under an arch into a wide  brightly lit office area .  coren counted eight people working at desks .   a door at the rear opened and a neatly dressed man with thin  pearl white hair came toward him  the same man he had seen meet brun damik .  he seemed tall from a distance but as he neared  coren saw that it was an illusion  the man walked and carried himself as if he stood a head taller than anyone else .      mr .  lanra .     he extended a hand .     i   m ree wenithal .  how may i help you .         a little of your time  a few questions .      wenithal smiled and waved coren in the direction of his door .  coren keyed the little hemisphere in his pocket .   the office was dark  expensively furnished with heavy chairs and sofas and polished woodwork .  the desk was cluttered with disks and papers .  a suit hung from the handle of a closet door to the right .  another sheaf of papers lay beside a half full cup of coffee on an end table by an upholstered armchair that still held the imprint of its recent occupant .   coren turned at the sound of the door clicking shut .   wenithal   s left hand was in his jacket pocket .      there are easily four other ways to leave this office beside the way you came in     wenithal said matter of factly .      do i need to know any of them .         i suppose that depends on what you have to say .     his eyes narrowed .     you used a name i know to get in here .  but i don   t know you .          but you know my type .         tbi .         special service .         but not anymore .  you   ve gone private .          it happens from time to time .         who do you work for now .         rega looms .      wenithal   s face showed a moment of confusion .  then he grunted  took his hand from his pocket  and went to his desk .     drink .         no  thank you .      wenithal poured a glass for himself and added ice  moving carefully  methodically .     so     he said  turning to coren     what does mr .  looms want with me now .            now .     has he wanted anything from you in the past .      wenithal frowned .     we   ve done business before .  i admit  he   s never sent his security people to negotiate a new contract  but .  .  .         nothing .  i   m not here at his behest .  i   m following up on something else  unrelated to the company .         what would that be .         i   m told that you   re the man to see about baleys .         who told you that .  it wasn   t brun .         a mutual acquaintance .      wenithal shrugged .     suit yourself .  i don   t know anything about it .         i could check .       wenithal sighed .     i   m assuming you checked me out before you came in here .  you know what i used to do .  what i know stems from my investigations as a law enforcement officer .  most of that information is several years out of date .  i   m really not interested in rehashing old cases with you .          old cases often refuse to go quietly into a file .  especially if they   re big enough .         and are mine big enough .      coren shrugged .      you threatened brun over this .  you are the same man who spoke with him earlier  aren   t you .  what particularly do you want .         names .  who were you investigating .         you don   t know what you want  do you .         i hoped you might be able to help me narrow it down .  i   m looking for a baley runner  the one who makes all the arrangements with the shippers before the runners themselves shunt their cargoes .         a particular one  i imagine .     wenithal smiled sardonically .     actually  at one time i was investigating your mr .  looms .          for what .         it didn   t prove out .  his name was on a list .  you know how that goes .  it was coincidental .         so why mention it .         just to remind you that we all have files .  what would someone find in yours .         less than you might expect .  i   ve had a fairly dull career .      wenithal looked surprised  then laughed .     my cases are all a matter of public record  you could look for yourself .  why bother me .         what i   m looking for won   t be in your case logs .  for one thing  i doubt very much if the people i   m interested in are part of the public record .         why not .      coren felt his patience fray .     is this a test .      wenithal shook his head .     you   ve come into my business  you   ve asked questions that could be construed as accusatory  you   ve made requests you have no right to make and no authority to push through .  i haven   t heard one thing yet to convince me that i shouldn   t call the police and have you escorted out .         nova levis .      wenithal   s face hardened .  his reaction lasted less than a second  but coren recognized it and it surprised him .  dropping the name of the colony had been a gamble  wenithal could easily have feigned ignorance .  instead  wenithal now took this seriously .  coren wished he knew why .      this had been slightly amusing till now     wenithal said .     leave .  i no longer have any involvement in anything that might help you  and i resent the implication that i should .  i   m a businessman .  a legitimate businessman .         yes  well  you   re in imports and exports .  coincidence .         not at all .  i learned quite a bit about the industry working on certain cases .  when i retired it was easy to slip right into it .  now leave .  this interview is over .         that   s unfortunate .  i felt certain we could help each other .         why would you think that .         you said it yourself  i scared brun .  he came to you before anyone else .  why was that .  paternal advice .         as odd as it may seem  yes .      coren raised an eyebrow skeptically .     really .  well  if that is indeed the case  then perhaps we should both be concerned about the same thing .  if i compromised him and you have his interests at heart  then          if this is unrelated to rega looms  what is it related to .  what   s your concern in any of this .         i didn   t say it wasn   t related to looms  i said it wasn   t related to his company .          ah .  campaign stuff .  you   re private security  so part of your job is to clean up embarrassments .  let me guess  his daughter is in trouble .          why would you guess that .      wenithal shrugged .     rumors .  i hear things still .  conversations with old friends .  she runs baleys  does she .         not anymore .  she   s dead .      coren had not planned to tell anyone  but he wanted to see wenithal   s reaction .  he was not disappointed .  wenithal looked surprised and  for a moment  vulnerable .  the bluster and firmness of the ex cop vanished  replaced by an expression of informed terror .  it metamorphosed slowly into a mask of sympathy and sadness .      i   m .  .  . very sorry to hear that .  .  .     he turned away and muttered something more .      what was that .         hmm .  oh  nothing .  i was just  my condolences to mr .  looms .  how   .         running baleys .          i see .  .  . yes  i can see that you would be interested .  i   m very sorry  mr .  lanra .     he sat down .     i can   t help you .  i wish i could  but i   m long out of it .  all i could give you are rumors .         rumors are often more reliable .         pah .  police superstition .  you hope rumors are more reliable because usually they   re all you get .  when i was working i   d have taken a solid fact over rumor any day .     wenithal looked up  the wall back in place .     now if you don   t mind  i have a business to take care of .  i   m not a policeman anymore .  i did that for twenty two years .  no more .  go away .        coren wanted to return to his private office and begin reviewing wenithal   s career .  instead  he took the tubeway west  to delfi .  from wenithal   s place it was only forty five kilometers to looms    hotel .   what is it about a settler colony that would spook an ex cop like that .  his mention of nova levis had disturbed wenithal .  if he was part of a baley running scheme  it might make sense .  and if nova levis was the name that rattled him  then maybe he was the contact nyom went through  in which case coren would visit him again .   he dozed on the short ride  uneasily  the image of nyom dangling broken necked from the ceiling of that bin an unwelcome intrusion .   he tucked the earpiece of his portable comm in his left ear and keyed his office .  the desk answered .      i want you to search police files for the case logs of wenithal  ree .  especially his last few cases and anything that might relate to baleys and baley running .  anything on yuri pocivil .     he asked sotto voce .      public records search positive result     the desk reported .     pocivil  yuri .  immigrant  work pass issued six years ago .  originally from the settler colony cassus thole .  resident of petrabor district for the last four years .  employee of improvo shipping and storage  petrabor branch  last three years eight months .  current status  indefinite sickleave .  current location unknown .       sick leave .  dead more likely  coren thought sourly .  he said     is there an image attached .         yes  sir .         forward all this to sipha palen on kopernik station and continue search  locate .  any new messages .         new message from myler towne .  do you wish to hear it .         no .  file .     he hesitated .  then     make an appointment for me to see my physician  earliest convenience .  end link .     he plucked the earpiece out and tucked it back in the slot on the side of his comm .   yuri pocivil was a settler .  unusual for them to return to earth .  unless he had been born on cassus thole and thought earth had more to offer .  it was easy to forget that the entire settler program was less than two centuries old  with so many emigrants leaving earth all the time .   he wondered who owned improvo shipping and storage .  .  .     rega looms    entourage filled two floors of the banil holbro  in the center of the theater district in delfi .  coren stepped off the walkway directly onto the broad plaza fronting the polished false stone and gilt facade of the hotel .   two of coren   s people stood just inside talking to the bellcaptain .  their laughter seemed distant and muffled in the lobby .   both of them straightened when they saw coren .      boss     shola said .     back from vacation .         no  don   t worry  i   m not back yet     coren said .     where   s rega .      the other one  new man  coren thought for a moment .  what   s his name .  lukas  came up alongside him and they walked a few paces from the bellcaptain .      mr .  looms is in room four ninety one  sir .         thanks  lukas .  everything copacetic .  any problems .         other than lack of sleep .     lukas smiled wanly .   coren laughed .     that   s what overtime pay was invented for     he said and walked away  toward the elevators .   two more of his people waited in the hallway outside room four ninety one .  they greeted him with silent nods .  coren knocked on the door and entered .   rega looms sat on the edge of a chair  staring at a datum screen on the table between him and lio top  his campaign manager .  a spread of fruit and vegetables covered a sideboard  next to a big samovar .   lio looked up first .     hi  coren     she said .     didn   t expect you back so soon .         my compulsiveness is bothering me     he said  choosing a carrot from the tray .      just wanted to see how things were going .  or not .       rega looms continued to focus on the datum .     hello  coren .  make yourself comfortable  i   ll be with you in a few minutes .       coren wandered to the far end of the room and sat down in a too soft armchair .  he ate his carrot without really tasting it .  now that he was here  in rega   s presence  he felt anxious .      first thing in the morning     he heard looms say finally .   lio stood .  rega looms closed the datum and rubbed his eyes .      six  then .     lio asked .   looms nodded .     that will be fine .  thank you  lio .      she cast coren a sympathetic look .     g   night  coren .     coren   s heartbeat kicked up a notch .      coren     rega said .     come sit down here .      coren   s legs felt leaden  but he took the seat vacated by lio and made himself look at rega looms .   too much of nyom there  he thought  wincing .      my daughter      looms said .   until this moment coren had given no thought to what he intended to tell rega .  he justified  excused  this lapse by telling himself that he had yet to accept the facts .  but that was facile  a diversion to keep himself from acknowledging the truth  that it hurt to say the words and it would hurt more to see his own reaction mirrored in rega .      she   s dead  rega .      rega sat back as if slapped .  he did not look at coren  but stared at a point midway between them  eyes locked in place .  he closed them slowly and his mouth opened wordlessly .   coren   s ears began to hum in the silence .      how .     rega asked  a faint whisper .      i don   t have all the details .  she was running baleys and went with the last bunch .  they all turned up dead on kopernik station .         you didn   t prevent her .         how was i supposed to do that .      rega   s eyes snapped open and focussed on coren .     i pay you to know how to manage those details .          dragging her out was my only option .  not feasible .      rega did not look away  but the rage drained slightly from his face .  finally  he nodded .      now what .     he asked .      i need a few days to find out why and who .  i can keep it out of the newsnets that long  but you better be prepared for it to hit .  if i come up with answers  you could      he stopped himself .  he almost said  you could turn it to your advantage .  it surprised him for a moment .      that   s lio   s job     rega said  following his thoughts .  he closed his eyes again .     both of them now     he whispered .  he sighed .     i have a campaign to win .  do what you have to do to find them .  if it costs me the election  so be it .     his eyes glistened now .  he stood .     thank you for .  .  . for coming by  coren .  i know this wasn   t easy for you .         for either of us .         do you have any ideas yet .         possibilities .  do you want to know .         no .  not till you finish .  then i want to know everything .         yes  sir .      as coren started for the door  rega caught his arm .      everything  coren .      rega let go and walked away  toward the bedroom .  coren waited till the door snicked shut before he left .     by the time coren returned to his office  third shift was just ending .  his stomach churned  the carrot had triggered his hunger  so he stopped by a small carry out within walking distance of his building and bought a sandwich .      good morning     the desk greeted him .     please verify identity .      coren sat down and went through the procedure  unwrapping his sandwich with his free hand .      welcome  mr .  lanra .  you have two messages .  one from myler towne  one from ambassador burgess  auroran embassy .      coren stopped chewing .     burgess .  time .         six ten .      half an hour ago .   coren finished chewing and swallowed .     the one from myler towne  is it a repeat of the first message .         yes  sir .         file it .          yes  sir .         no word from jeta fromm .         no  sir .         anything further on yuri pocivil .         no  sir .         ree wenithal .         yes  sir .  public records plus case logs  per parameters .         good  good .  new search .  i want to know who owns improvo shipping and storage  and which freighter and passenger lines it does business with .         yes  sir .      coren stretched lazily until his shoulder twinged .     did you make that physician   s appointment .         yes  sir .  your physician has an opening six days from now  second shift .      good thing it   s not an emergency  coren thought wryly .     okay .  what specifically do you have on wenithal .  display .      the screen rose from the desk and file headers scrolled down .  coren caught the words    nova levis    and said    stop .  case file number        akb .  review .         infant abduction case involving several prominent families .  ree wenithal primary investigator .  eighteen month investigation culminating in sixty two percent recoveries and the closing of eight orphanages and four bioremedial research laboratories .          how does nova levis figure in .         r and d facility which came under investigation relative to ree wenithal   s investigation .  laboratory cleared of any charges .      cleared .  .  . but the name scared wenithal just the same .  .  .      collate the particulars  names of families  the children involved  witness lists  and other sources .         yes  sir .  do you wish to audit ambassador burgess   s message .         not yet .  alert me two hours from now .         yes  sir .      he rubbed his face and eyes as if to massage away the fatigue .   he felt incompetent .  things had gotten away from him already .  it had happened before  but he never got used to it .  so much of police work relied on chance and luck  the rest was a question of tenacity .  coren had a good track record of wearing a case down until he solved it .  but that took time  and right now he did not have that luxury .  he needed to know now .   he had lost jeta fromm .  that was his one chance of finding out about that strange robot quickly enough to find nyom   s killers before the murders went public .  the more time passed  the less likely he could wrap this up before the news broke .   going to brun damik had been a gamble .  not a bad one  coren thought  considering the rearrangement of shipping schedules out of his office for petrabor .  and damik did know something .  but instead of the answer that would have made coren   s life easier  he led him to ree wenithal .  in truth  despite the curious fact that damik had called wenithal first after coren   s visit  coren would have walked away from wenithal as a useless lead .   except for wenithal   s reaction to the name nova levis .  but now coren knew that nova levis was the name of a research lab .  how did that relate to the colony .  and what did kidnapping have to do with it .      desk  display data package received from sipha palen .      the screen came up .  a menu scrolled across it .  coren read through the choices  autopsy  crime scene  material forensics  and touched the icon over crime scene .   the screen showed the cargo bin .  coren hesitated  then accessed the internal view .   bodies stacked in couches crowding the walls .  .  .   he reached for the screen and accesssed the image of the dead brethe dealer  then gazed at it thoughtfully .     desk  i want a search for all manufacturers of prosthetic devices .  find a match for the hand pattern found on the woman   s shoulder  and the type of prosthetic capable of doing this kind of damage .         yes  sir .         end     he said .  the screen went blank .     i   ll go over it later .         yes  sir .      he scooped up his sandwich and went into his private space .  he was tired and hungry and the painblock had worn off sometime in the last hour .  it would do no good to rush into anything as unexpected as this .   the images of nyom still covered the table .  he gathered them up and placed them back in the carton .  he sat down then  and finished eating .       eight    h  e woke up with a stiff neck on top of the bruises .  he swallowed another painblock and went to his desk .        good morning  sir     the desk said .     analysis and collation on the provided data completed .  do you wish a summary .         in a moment .  i need coffee right now .     he switched his samovar on .  the machine hummed gently to life .  dark  steaming liquid filled a cup below the spigot .  coren breathed in the steam .     any more messages .         none .  do you wish to review those in the queue .         play ambassador burgess   s .      coren heard the flatscreen scroll up from the desktop  but he stood by the samovar  eyes closed  sipping his coffee .      mr .  lanra  i would like to apologize for any abruptness i may have exhibited with you yesterday .  it has come to my attention that our interests may intersect .  i would appreciate another opportunity to talk about it .  i   ll be in my office the rest of the day .       coren opened his eyes .     hm .  i wonder what i disturbed .  connect to ambassador burgess .         yes  sir .      a few seconds later a crisp male voice said     ambassador burgess   s office  how may i help you .      coren went to the desk .  on the flatscreen he saw the face of burgess   s aide  hofton .     coren lanra .  i   m returning the ambassador   s call .         of course .  wait one moment while i put you through .      the screen went pale gray  then ariel burgess appeared .  her eyes looked slightly puffy  perhaps she had gotten as little sleep as he .      ambassador burgess .         mr .  lanra  thank you for returning my call so promptly .         i admit i   m puzzled at this turnaround .         no more than i am .  perhaps between the two of us we can make sense of some of it .  would you care to meet with us again .         when .         as soon as convenient for you .         right now  frankly  nothing is convenient .  how about      he glanced at the time chop      ten .  that   ll give me a chance to clean up a little .          that would be excellent .  here .         certainly .  i know the way .      she almost smiled at that .     till then  mr .  lanra .      the screen blanked .      desk  give me a summary of the analysis on the data i gave you .          specify order .         um .  .  .     he rubbed his eyes  remembering .     update on yuri pocivil .         no further progress .         improvo shipping .          improvo shipping and storage is a subsidiary owned outright by the hunter group .  it has been in operation for thirty eight years with ninety two facilities within sol system and fifty one facilities located on various settler worlds .  the hunter group itself is an offworld company  headquarters on cassus thole .         really .  how many employees within this system .         six hundred seventy two thousand .         how many of those are immigrant .         two thousand seven hundred .         how many of those are natives of cassus thole .         eleven hundred twenty two .         uh huh .  interesting .  no list of board members .         no such list available at this time .         continue search  see if you can find one .  also  i want a list of all hunter group holdings .  next  the data from wenithal   s case file .         the last case he worked on was a major kidnapping ring .  it developed from an investigation into a single instance which led him to uncover a global operation with offworld connections .  infants were being sold through various vendors  primarily orphanages and child hospice centers  to offworld buyers .      coren   s interest spiked .     go on .  that sounds familiar .  what   s in the case file .         the record obtained from the public police database contains categorized tables  names cross referenced in hierarchical tabulations according to assigned probabilities .         sounds like his interview and suspect lists .         correct .  three hundred seventy nine names listed  all time  indexed over an eleven year period beginning twenty nine years ago  ending eighteen years ago .  of those with current public record files available  two hundred and ninety are deceased          stop .  two hundred and ninety dead .         correct .          pattern analysis .  common factors .         one hundred thirty fatalities occurred within an eight month period .  ninety seven died of age related factors .  eighty three died as the result of fatal accident .  sixty eight died as the result of fatal interaction          you mean homicide .         that is a legal definition not applicable in all instances .          they were killed by other people .          with certain qualifications  yes .          continue .         thirty nine died of causes unverifiable due to inaccessibility of data .         explain .         deceased were offworld at the time of death .  there were irregularities in subsequent reporting .         hard copy  names  places  dates  and cause of death .     coren watched while the desk produced a disk for him .     give me current disposition of surviving members of the list .         of the eighty nine remaining names  forty three are serving sentences in rehabilitation clinics  eighteen have emigrated to settler colonies  and five are residents in hospice centers .  displaying list of remaining twenty three .      coren read down the rows until he came to a name he recognized .  he whistled .      alda mikels .  .  . interesting .     he read on .     a few of these people are prominent public figures .  i      he stopped  startled .     rega looms .      coren stared at the name for a long time .  he retrieved his hemisphere then and set it into its niche on the desktop .      desk  download contents of last recorded exchange .         done .         play back .     coren listened to his conversation with ree wenithal again .  when he reached the point where he told wenithal that nyom looms was dead  he said     stop there .  subject said something below normal range of hearing .  amplify and enhance .       from the desk speaker he heard wenithal  in a raspy whisper  say    both of them now .         end playback .     coren looked at rega   s name on the screen .        both of them now .     what does that mean .         unknown     the desk said .  rega had said something very similar .  both of whom .      desk  give me a hard copy on these names  then file and return to standby .       coren went into his private room to clean up and change clothes .  he wanted to go back to his apartment and stretch out for several hours    decent sleep  but he lacked the time .   he slipped the disks into his pocket and drummed his fingers on the edge of the desk .  several years ago  coren remembered  alda mikels and a few others invited rega looms to join a business consortium which seemed to looms at the margins of legality  gray market at least  if not black market .  some of those people were on wenithal   s list .  considering looms    attitude toward most of them  coren wondered why they would have approached him in the first place .  perhaps the association went back further than rega had told him .      desk  i want a review of the last twenty three names  those surviving and still on earth .  initiate a records search and correlate common associations for the past twenty years .          parameters .         education  business  investments  public service  children .     he hesitated .     if nothing turns up  expand search to thirty years .          yes  sir .      coren disliked investigating his own employer .  sometimes  though  protecting rega looms required that he know things looms probably preferred he did not .      also  get me a thorough background on ree wenithal .  retired  law enforcement  currently runs his own import export firm .         public file previously referenced          i want a deeper background .         yes  sir .         also .  .  . also  display crime scene image from sipha palen   s data .      the view spread across the screen .  he stared at the bodies as the view rotated slowly through three hundred sixty degrees .  fifty two people .      give me a copy of this  too      he said .  one more disk extruded from the slot .   he ran down the list of instructions just given and tried to think of anything overlooked .  nothing came to mind but he could never quite shake the feeling that he had missed something .  without jeta fromm or the dockworker pocivil  all he had was nyom   s collapsed robot .   there   s never enough time to do this right .  .  .  .     the spacer embassy occupied a huge area on the eastern edge of d . c .   in the heart of the government districts .  embassies  really  as the structure contained the missions for all the spacer worlds .  most had one set of offices  usually unoccupied .  of the fifty worlds  only a dozen maintained full time staffs on earth  aurora and solaria being the largest .   just living on earth marked these people as unique .  most spacers disdained other worlds  especially the one that spawned them so long ago .  but no group is completely homogeneous  and spacers proved no exception .  the total spacer population on earth never exceeded a few tens of thousands  a handful compared to populations in the many millions  but their presence made a powerful impression on terrans .   of them all  coren reflected as he entered the main gallery of the embassy  he preferred the aurorans  they were the most approachable  the least defensive  compared to the xenophobic solarians .  to be sure  those solarians living here did not share the degree of paranoia exhibited by most of their people in dealing with outsiders  but they still came across as standoffish and mistrustful .   coren signed in at the reception desk and patiently received directions to the auroran arm of the embassy building .  he then retraced his path from the previous day .   hofton met him in the reception lounge of ambassador burgess   s offices .     the ambassador is expecting you  mr .  lanra .  mr .  avery is here as well .  i trust this is acceptable .         completely .      hofton escorted him into burgess   s office and closed the doors .   ariel burgess looked tired  with the beginnings of dark circles under her eyes .  derec avery seemed much the same as he had yesterday .      mr .  lanra     burgess said  rising from her seat and coming around the desk to clasp his hand .     thank you for giving us a second opportunity to discuss your problem with us .         thank you  ambassador .  i have to tell you  i   m a little dismayed .          i   m a little surprised myself .  it seems we have a parallel interest in your situation .         parallel interest .  .  . quid pro quo  then .         if that   s satisfactory .             i don   t have the luxury of time  ambassador .  what i need is a roboticist to see if anything can be salvaged from a collapsed positronic brain  the robot i told you about yesterday .         it allegedly witnessed a mass murder     derec avery said .     which would probably have precipitated the collapse .         possibly .          let me guess     burgess said .     you think the robot itself committed the crime .          a robot  certainly .         why .         we have no other viable suspect     he said .     everyone who boarded the cargo bin used to shuttle the victims to kopernik is accounted for  all dead .  there was no way for a human to get out of it without breaking the internal seals in place inside the bin .  so we   re left with a suicide murderer  or .  .  .     he pursed his lips .     i saw another robot board the bin with the victims .  it was .  .  . unusual .         a second robot     ariel said .     you didn   t mention this yesterday .          i didn   t know if you   d be helping me or not .         that might have changed our minds sooner .     coren held up his hands apologetically .      you said it was unusual     derec said .     how so .         it didn   t register through my surveillance equipment .  i could see it  as i see you  but through an optam it was invisible .  masked  what they used to call    stealthed .             we don   t make robots like that     ariel said .     that function is useless except for military or criminal purposes  and we don   t  can   t  use robots for either of those things .         nevertheless  i witnessed just such a robot .         and when the bin was opened .     derec asked .     was it there .         no .  only nyom looms    robot was present .  here .     he handed the disk containing sipha   s reports .     go to the crime scene .      in a moment they huddled around ariel   s desk  gazing at a full holographic image of the interior of the cargo bin .      this is what the security people on kopernik found when they opened it up     coren explained .      what is that the robot is working on .     derec asked .      a rebreather unit .  it contained a poison that caused neurological damage and paralysis .         who is this .     ariel asked  pointing to the body hanging from the bin ceiling .      nyom looms .  she wasn   t poisoned .  she had her own rebreather .  her neck was broken  instead .         fifty one others     hofton said .     how did she get attached up there .         the bin was cracked .  the air leaked out fairly quickly  not all at once  but in a vacuum it must   ve created a current .  we think it drew her to it .  her clothing was pulled through .          cracked     ariel mused .     big enough for your robot to slip through .         hardly .  you can see the dimensions for yourself .      ariel frowned and gave derec a look coren could not read .     it would be unlikely  i think     she said .  she sighed .     you still haven   t given us a convincing argument to indict a robot .     she pointed to the image of coffee .     what do you think  derec .  a modified dw    .         looks like it .  but it   s not possible  mr .  lanra .  there is no way to modify a positronic brain to subvert its three law constraints .  tampering at that level would destroy the brain .  the fact that it   s collapsed proves that its programming was consistent with its original protocols .  it witnessed the deaths of humans ostensibly in its charge .  it failed to protect them .  it collapsed .         as i recall     coren noted     a positronic brain was modified at union station to cause the deaths of a good number of people .      derec stiffened .     that   s .  .  . inaccurate .  it was modified to ignore a lethal situation .  it caused nothing .  and it collapsed shortly after it realized what had happened .     he frowned thoughtfully .     what was this robot doing at the rebreather controls .         as far as we can tell  trying to shut it off .         you   ve said    we    a few times now .  who else is involved in this investigation .     ariel asked .      kopernik station   s chief of security is working with me on this     coren replied .      how are you keeping it out of the newsnets  then .         the bin was delivered to a settler dock .  she has an arrangement with the settler security people .  it   s isolated  outside the usual legal channels .  for the time being  it doesn   t exist .  that won   t last long .         and the robot .     derec asked .      stored .         still in the settler section .         in chief palen   s morgue .         we need to have it .         there   s no way i can bring it down here .  not in time  anyway .  i need someone to go to it .      ariel looked at derec .     what do you think .      derec shook his head .     a risk .  i   m still not sure what my status is .      ariel looked at coren .     our .  .  . range of free movement may be somewhat curtailed .  especially mr .  avery   s .         mine isn   t     hofton said .     i could accompany mr .  avery up to our embassy branch on kopernik .     he glanced at derec .     you   d be in the diplomatic pouch  so to speak .      derec grunted  smiling thinly .      excuse me     coren said .     there   s no question here  is there .  you   re going to help me .         you wouldn   t be talking to us otherwise  mr .  lanra     ariel said .      why .      ariel looked thoughtful .     before i answer that  let me ask you something .  where was nyom looms taking this group of baleys .         nova levis .         why there .  i can think of at least a dozen other settler colonies that would accept baleys that aren   t under blockade .         i don   t know .  nova levis is .  .  . romantic .         that   s hardly a reason .  but even so  the next question is  why kill them .         her father is running for office     coren said .     something like this        just letting it out that she ran baleys would accomplish as much      ariel said  shaking her head .     what was there about this run that warranted murder .      coren said nothing .      that   s the question  then     ariel said .     answer the why  you discover the who .  theoretically  anyway .  and it won   t be a robot .      coren leaned across her desk and touched an icon on her flatscreen .     i   d like your opinion on these  then .      the image from ariel   s desk projector vanished  replaced a moment later by the autopsy images sipha had sent him of the brethe dealer who had died in her holding cell .  the sight brought a sharp hiss from derec avery  burgess paled .      at first we thought this was unrelated      coren explained .     maybe it is  but i   m guessing not .  frame sixteen      he gestured for ariel to find that image      is an enhanced display of a handprint left subdurally .  tell me what you think .       ariel touched her projector control and the autopsy images shifted .  the false color view of the oversized handprint bloomed .      too big for a human hand .  .  .     derec mused .   coren watched ambassador burgess .  finally  she nodded .  she glanced at him  frowning briefly  and looked away .      i   d have to agree with derec     she said .     a human hand didn   t make that .  but that still leaves the field open to a number of explanations .  prosthetics  for one .         i ran a catalogue check for any prosthetics commercially available that match that pattern .  nothing turned up .  that doesn   t rule out a custom manufacture  of course  but .  .  .         but you still think it   s a robot .         something managed to slip past all the security in a police cell block to do this .  i already told you the robot i saw was blind to my optam .  it may be the same technique in this case  a masked robot  invisible to surveillance monitors .         so now it   s a conspiracy of robots     derec said .     less and less likely .         can you give me a better explanation to account for the damage .     coren asked sharply .      isn   t that what we need to find out .     ariel burgess said .     you asked why we   re helping .  what you   ve proposed here is a good enough reason for me .  earthers think the worst of robots on a good day .  this      she waved at the projection      validates all your fears  if true .  a chance to head this off and perhaps prevent a very ugly purge would be a good enough reason  don   t you think .         for your part  that seems plausible .  but that   s not the only reason .      ariel bowed her head in mock acceptance .     of course not .  illegal emigration is a point in common between us and terra .  there   s a quid pro quo in that  too .         you   re working with ite .         no .  we   re working with you .       coren looked from one face to the other  returning to ariel .  he expected them to keep things from him  most of it details of their involvement that really did not concern him .  but he also expected them to be subtle about it .  instead  they were very obviously not telling him something .  if he did not need their expertise .  .  .      what specifically are you getting from this arrangement .     he asked .   ambassador burgess gave a faint smile and a slight shake of the head .  she gestured at the image of the dead woman on her screen .     who was this .  why was she killed .         according to chief palen  she was a small time narcotics dealer     coren lied .     could be any number of people she may have crossed in the course of business .         this seems excessive for a bad debt      ariel said .  she drew a deep breath  slowly released it .     aurora has been asked by terran authorities to look into the nova levis situation .  that involves a lot of baleys .  i was asked by my immediate superior to lend you aid .  partly  we may have a problem with spacer businesses shipping illegally from earth .  it   s being suggested that spacers are colluding in bypassing immigration and trade laws .  i presume they believe we   ll find things that will be mutually helpful .  is that sufficient answer for you  mr .  lanra .      coren folded his arms across his chest .     it will do .  .  .  for now .         in that case     ariel said  smiling uneasily     how do you want to proceed  mr .  lanra .          nine    w  e have work  thales .      derec started feeding disks into the reader on thales    console .     load these .         has phylaxis been revived  derec .     the ri asked .      no .  this is an embassy assignment .  sort of .     derec slid the last disk into the reader  then pulled a chair over .     to be honest  i   m not sure about this .  there   s a possibility that our situation could get worse .         then  is it advisable to accept .         we don   t have a lot of choices  thales .  ariel has been handed this by ambassador setaris .  i get the impression that setaris is just passing on instructions from aurora .     he leaned back and laced his fingers under his chin .     we   re to assist the chief of security for dynan manual industries  a man named coren lanra  in an investigation concerning the death of rega looms    daughter  baley running  and a possible robot involvement .      a few moments passed before thales responded .     based on the data i have just reviewed  am i correct that mr .  lanra suspects a robot in the deaths .         he does .         that is not possible .         i explained that to him .  but he   s an earther  he believes positronics are inherently evil .  still  i don   t have a better explanation for the body found in the holding cell .         the damage is singular .      derec grunted .     that   s one way to look at it .  for now  though  i want you to give me a program for a remote presence .  i have to go up to kopernik station to try to salvage the dw    they have .  it may be the only witness to what happened in the cargo bin .  i   ll need you to help me sift through what   s left of its brain .  i don   t think i can take all of you  and even if i could i   m not sure i want to risk you outside auroran territory .         according to my memory  the positronics laboratory on kopernik is more than ample for our purposes .  do we have a free comm channel to the auroran branch on kopernik .  i will need to establish that they have the facilities .         ariel   s setting that up now .  i   ll be on a shuttle in less than five hours  so we have to set this up quickly .         i have analyzed the data provided .         good .  i   d like to hear your assessment .         there are a number of inconsistencies  primary among them is the connection between the death of the brethe dealer and the deaths of the baleys .  except for the suggestion that a robot is involved  there is no basis i can see for the link between them .  if a robot is not involved in one or the other or  as is more likely  both  then the brethe dealer is an entirely separate issue and a complication in the investigation of the murdered baleys .         and if a robot is involved .         the likelihood of finding a robot capable of such crimes being as remote as it is  then there would be grounds to link the two  as it would be logical that only one such robot exists .  but that prompts a number of questions  all of which require factors of chance and coincidence that recomplicate the central question .  such a robot would need to be transported to and from kopernik on a regular basis  in a short period of time .          increasing the chance of discovery      derec noted .      precisely  even given the capabilities described by mr .  lanra of a robot able to hide from surveillance tools .  it should be pointed out that it is not accurate to suggest that only a robot could use masking capabilities .  for a robot  however  the risk of discovery in this instance would be unnecessarily higher .  there is nothing in the data provided concerning the baleys that implicate a robot .  this crime could just as well have been committed by humans .         how would the assassin escape .  everyone in the cargo bin was dead and the seals showed no indication of having been opened between the time the baleys boarded and chief palen   s people opened it up on kopernik .         human history is overfull with examples of suicide assassins .  however  barring that  i lack sufficient information to rule out all possible methods of escape .         what about the crack in the bin .         there is insufficient information for me to speculate productively about that .  it could be a structural flaw in the material .         all right  set that aside for the moment .  can you still access terran data sources .         of course .      despite the fact that it was incapable of emotion  derec nevertheless heard a note of smug pride in thales    statement .      of course     he echoed .     i want you to run a search for any recent murders or accidental deaths that bear similarities to the brethe dealer .          that will require me to access certain law enforcement datums .         is that a problem .         no  but it will take more time .  i may not have that information for some hours .  unless you do not care about detection .         do it right  thales .  i don   t want the tbi on our backs about this .  you said there were a number of inconsistencies .  continue .         all the passengers but one succumbed to a neurotoxin .  why not all of them .  nyom looms carried her own rebreather .  the question is why .  did she anticipate trouble .  was she sharing the primary rebreather before donning her own .  and if there was time for one to remove the rebreather mask  why not more .  the dw    unit appears to be trying to shut the rebreather off .  this suggests that the bin was pressurized and contained sufficient atmosphere that shutting down the rebreather would not constitute further threat to human life .          the crack .          why would they use a damaged bin .  it is reasonable to assume that an inspection would have revealed the crack prior to its transfer to an orbital lifter  unless  as i already suggested  it was a structural flaw which manifested only after lift off .  but it also seems reasonable to assume the crack was made specifically to force the passengers to continue using the rebreather  as the air would leak out  thus guaranteeing that they would be poisoned .          so the crack was made after the bin had been transferred     derec said .      if it was intentional  that is reasonable .  but by whom .         or what .  that brings us back to the robot hypothesis .         which remains unlikely .  the opening is too small for a robot to pass through  and since the dw    is the only one present  and is still present  in the bin  then we can rule it out .         the masked robot .         being undetectable by surveillance equipment would not render it invisible to plain sight .  it would still have been in the container .  there are other possibilities for creating such a crack .          coren lanra says he saw it board .         but it was not there when the bin was opened .  either it left before arrival on kopernik  even before it left earth  or mr .  lanra is mistaken .         agreed     derec said  nodding .     but there are no tools in the bin .  it appears that whoever made the opening also left .         unlikely .         again  i agree .  continue .         there is evidence of an absence .  not all the cradles in the bin are occupied .  two appear to have been empty when the bin was opened .  one can be accounted for by the victim found suspended from the ceiling .  the other was simply empty .  both were provided with rebreather masks .  from the appearance of both empty cradles  one was occupied .      have to ask lanra about that  derec thought .     so .  they miscounted .          one assumes these bins are prepared in advance .  that they would contain the exact number of cradles necessary for a single shipment seems unlikely .  however  if they did outfit this one to specific requirements  why would there be an extra .         possibly someone elected not to go at the last moment .         not an unreasonable hypothesis  derec .      maybe one of the late nyom looms    charges still lived  then .  one not involved in the murder  at least  since that empty cradle remained unaccounted for .      i have a question  derec     thales said .      yes .         should i suspend my work on bogard   s positronic matrix for the duration of this assignment .         why would   .  oh .      memory  derec realized .  normally thales possessed far more memory than either of these chores required  but already bogard   s problem took up more than thales possessed .  the hasty move from their former housing at the defunct phylaxis group building meant a good portion of thales    auxiliary memory buffers waited  unused  in storage .  having access to kopernik   s buffers  however  represented an opportunity for thales to once more utilize its full potential .      we   ll wait     he decided .     find out what facilities you can use on kopernik .  maybe you can divide functions .          i would appreciate the opportunity to test several hypotheses concerning bogard .  kopernik   s facilities would offer that chance .         we   ll find out .  is there anything else .         yes .  will identification of the deceased be provided .         i don   t know .  is it important .         finding commonalities among them may bear upon discovering who would want them all dead .      derec blinked .  sometimes he felt like an idiot .     of course .  i   ll ask .     he scratched his chin idly .     speaking of bogard  do you have an update .         no change since last report .  i do not possess sufficient memory to operate at a more effective level .         okay .  i didn   t expect anything  but .  .  .         there is a possible solution to the total problem .      derec hesitated .     you mentioned hypotheses .  .  .         part of bogard   s unusual make up was based on unorthodox hardware configurations .  i have attempted to simulate these  but like the human brain  the physical matrix itself represents a necessary and unpredictable condition of awareness .  given the limitations within which we are forced to work  i have compiled a protocol whereby it may be practical to encode a new positronic brain with a composite persona  bogard   s  and myself .      derec considered for a few seconds .     what good would that do .  bogard   s matrix is completely collapsed .  trying to load it into a new brain would either be rejected by the load protocols or result in a duplicate encoding  collapsed condition and all .         normally  yes .  the encoding protocols require a stable framework for reception to work .  i am suggesting that i can provide that framework while allowing those elements of bogard that match a viable positronic template to load within it .         a combination .         i could not predict to what extent the result would be a combination  how much of each source matrix would encode in the new brain  but in essence  parts of both bogard and myself would transfer together .      derec shifted in his chair  intrigued .     the result could be only a slightly less coherent matrix .  collapse would occur at the first challenge .         possibly .  i am running simulations to account for as many variables as possible based on my own composition .         what  uh  would be the point .         you would have a functioning persona capable of self analysis .  it might be possible to simply ask it why it failed .      derec felt eager to try .  he wanted to say yes .  he distrusted the impulse  but the idea excited him .      continue running the simulations until i can find out more about kopernik   s lab .         yes  derec .      the light on the comm winked on .  derec leaned closer  ariel was calling .     we may have that answer now     he said  and reached for the accept button .  his hand trembled slightly  he clenched it into a fist for a moment  then pressed the contact .     hofton brought the link to derec   s apartment .  derec opened the small metal case and ran a diagnostic on the device .      our shuttle lifts in an hour  twenty minutes     hofton said .     are you packed .      derec pointed to a single large case by the door .     this   ll take about half an hour      he said  patting the side of the link .     thales  we have a mark six collaborative transcriptor .         you requested a mark four .         is this a problem .         no  this is a considerable improvement .  refresh periods can be at greater intervals and more thorough .      derec looked at hofton .      i took a few liberties     the aide said .     no one was using this one .      derec smiled .     i didn   t realize you were such a good scrounger .         the position of    aide    is descriptively vague for a reason     hofton said .   the diagnostic winked green .     the unit checks one hundred percent  thales .  are you ready .         i have modified the download pathways to accommodate the superior unit .  start with nodes eight through fourteen .       derec opened a panel on thales    console and began attaching thick connectors .     did you happen to find out who   s running the lab on kopernik .         yes        hofton said .     rotij polifos .         i don   t know him .  is he good .         he   s been director for the past seven years .         hm .  anybody else .         there are two specialists and six interns .  from what i saw  i think you   ll be pleased .  i also did some background on mr .  lanra and his friend on kopernik .      derec rechecked the connections  then pressed a contact labeled open channel .  he watched the indicators for a few seconds .      coren lanra used to be special service     derec said .      yes  he did .  so was sipha palen .  in fact  they partnered together in service .         why   d they quit .         ideology  apparently .  in mr .  lanra   s case  he disapproved of the changes in terran policy toward positronics .  he resigned roughly at the time we were beginning work on the union station ri .  ms .  palen requested reassignment after being attached to senator kolbren   s office .         kolbren .  .  . isn   t he the one that sponsored the legislation attempting to bar all spacers from public areas .  for health reasons  if i recall .         in essence .  it was a quarantine measure .  it didn   t even get out of committee  but kolbren keeps winning reelection .  ms .  palen asked for a new position and was refused .  she resigned .  shortly afterward  she accepted her current position as chief of security for kopernik .       derec grunted .     odd .  she resented working for a rabid anti spacer  and her former partner resented growing cooperation with spacers .  how did they get along as partners .         i   m not psychic .  your guess is as good as mine .  i suppose they found other things upon which to base their relationship .       derec looked at hofton .  he could never tell when the man was being sincere or sardonic .  it annoyed him that ariel seemed to like hofton so much  derec   s own dry wit irritated her .      both  however     hofton continued     had exemplary records while in special service .         and now he works for a man who wants to see us all thrown off earth .     derec shrugged .     so we cooperate with him .         a quandary .  it is odd .         any ideas .         none i   d be willing to share at the moment .      hofton   s expression remained politely attentive  betraying nothing more .  he had worked for ariel for nearly three years .  before hofton  she had gone through four other aides in something over two years .  derec had never asked about them or asked why hofton was different .  he wanted to ask now .   instead  he said     hofton  you   re perfect .         one tries  sir .      derec laughed  and was rewarded by a faint smile from hofton .      anything else i need to know about these people .     derec asked .      i   m not sure .  one curious fact about mr .  lanra came up .  he   s an orphan .         really .         yes  sir .  he matriculated from the connover trinidal youth asylum  a life long resident .  i find this remarkable because many people from the same background don   t enjoy much success .         he never knew his parents .         no .  and  of course  the records are sealed .  but as far as i could tell  he never tried to look into them .         hm .  what about palen .         very much the opposite .  large  extended family  prosperous  the best schools  etcetera .      hofton waited a beat .     should i continue looking .         not on my account .  maybe ariel would like to know more .  is lanra accompanying us to kopernik .         no  sir .  he has lines of investigation down here .  .  . so he says .       derec gave hofton a curious look .      the shuttle up to kopernik two days ago     hofton said     was his first trip offworld .      for a few seconds  derec did not understand .  then     oh .  well  then  i suppose it   s just as well he has things to do down here .       hofton nodded .     i think it   s for the best .          probably .         we may find ms .  palen more cooperative anyway  simply because she doesn   t work for rega looms .         that   s certainly a possibility .      they fell silent then  and derec stared at the link until a light winked on requesting the next phase of its setup .  derec worked silently  rearranging the connections  reconfiguring part of the device to match the next part of thales    requirements .   hofton softly cleared his throat .     may i ask a question  sir .         sure .         why are you involving yourself in this .      derec straightened  trying to compose an explanation of the link and why thales required it due to the distances involved and the complexity of the job  but stopped  comprehending the question a moment later .      you mean with this investigation .     he asked .      yes .         i could ask you the same .     hofton waited and derec nodded .     i love this     he said  waving at thales .     working with positronics .  working  period .  i hate inactivity .         you could do calisthenics in that case .      derec laughed briefly .     i   m doing this because i can  because it might give me a chance to do something i want to do .  because the chance to get my hands on the tools to do some serious work is worth the risk .         you   d like to rebuild your robot  bogard .         of course i would  but it   s more than that .         there are several good reasons for you to refuse .         i know .  i   m not going to think about them .     derec looked at hofton .     you .         you mentioned inactivity .  do you have any idea how dull diplomatic work can be .     he smiled wryly .     seriously  though  i have been with perhaps a dozen senior diplomats .  the work was interesting  more so in the beginning  before the desensitizing produced by overfamiliarity and intimate contempt  but rarely challenging .  even so  had my various superiors been in the least worth the bother  i would never have complained  much less transferred .  i never thought i   d find myself working for someone like ambassador burgess .  it was very difficult when i was forced to leave her service last year .  i admit  i   d begun to take her for granted .  but i just finished several months with a man named cotish valgas  who is a deputy overseer in furnishing and accoutrements .  yes  there is such a department  i was shocked myself .  suffice it to say that i   ll never take ms .  burgess for granted again .         she   s special  isn   t she .      hofton nodded slowly  his eyes bright and sharp .     she is that  sir .         so why is she doing this .         because she   s been ordered to .      derec shook his head .     no  no .  you   ve known her for all this time .  is that the ariel you know .      hofton frowned .     she   s more disciplined  i think  than you give her credit .      he blinked and folded his arms .     but  no  not really .  she could easily refuse .  she   s been expecting a recall to aurora anyway .         so .         i think she wants a chance to get even .          with who .         all of them  sir .  all of them .     he glanced at his watch .     we have an hour before the shuttle leaves .  will you be done .      derec checked the monitors .     five more minutes .      hofton cleared his throat  and shifted uncomfortably on his feet .     um .  .  . i spoke perhaps too openly  mr .  avery          she   ll never hear about it from me .     hofton looked mildly relieved .     under one condition .         sir .         call me derec .         i   ll do my best  sir .          ten    t  hree people were waiting in his office when coren returned .  two of them wore the look of professional security  well dressed but practical  no clothing that would bind and impede a wide range of movement  while the third looked very administrative .  coren recognized none of them other than by type .  he resisted the immediate urge to run  right now he did not have time for further complications .      mr .  lanra     the administrative type said .     i   m del socras .  i work for mr .  myler towne of imbitek .  forgive the intrusion  but i was instructed to convey mr .  towne   s regards and extend his invitation to lunch .       coren glanced at the security  both of whom had risen to their feet upon his entrance .     i really am rather busy  mr .  socras .          mr .  towne realizes this .  it will be a brief lunch .      coren considered his options  run  call the police  or comply .  from the look of the pair of security types  it was even odds that he could get away .  dragging in the police might complicate things to the point that his investigation of nyom   s death would have to be postponed or abandoned .  it always seemed to be the petty things that interrupted one   s plans .   that was the problem  though .  if it were petty  why would towne be so insistent .  reluctantly  he concluded that his only viable option was to go along and find out .      very well .  shall i meet him somewhere .         we have a car  mr .  lanra .         of course you do .     coren made himself smile .     shall we  then .         one moment  sir     one of the security said and pulled out a palm monitor that looked remarkably like coren   s own .  he walked around coren twice  then reached into coren   s pocket and removed his hemisphere .  he handed it to towne .      i don   t think you   ll need this  mr .  lanra     towne said  setting it on the desk .     our security is very good .         i   m sure it is     coren said tightly .   socras led the way out of the building and across the avenue to the garage .   the drive lasted fifteen minutes  during which time socras made a few attempts at polite conversation which coren ignored .  to his credit  coren thought  he took the hint and lapsed into a polite silence .   the windows were all darkened .  when they stopped  he had no idea where exactly he was .   he was shocked to see a garden .   outside .  no  he saw delicate ribbing overhead  supporting a high vaulting ceiling .  relieved  he surveyed the rest of the chamber .  a garden  yes  and an expensive one .   a large dead patch off to the left  an area that looked as if some withering blight had eaten the life out of the very air around it  spoiled the placid beauty around him .  even the pavement and wall nearby were blackened .   a touch on his elbow prompted him to move forward .   myler towne sat behind a small table covered with dishes .  he dwarfed his chair and made the people around him appear small .  he looked up as coren stopped .      mr .  lanra      he said  his voice surprisingly gentle .     i   m pleased you accepted my invitation .          is that what it was .         of course .  it   s illegal to coerce people .         of course it is .  what can i do for you  mr .  towne .         come to work for me .      coren held back a laugh .   towne looked at him  scooped a mound of mashed potato onto his fork  and smiled .      neither of us     he said     has time for banter .  i have some questions before you answer me .  you saw the damage when you came in .         yes .  .  .         i used to take my lunch there .      coren glanced back at the dead patch .     you mean that was an attack .         did you engineer it .      coren started .     excuse me .      towne smiled briefly .     i didn   t think so .  have you ever worked for imbitek .         i think you   d know .         possibly .  i don   t have all my predecessor   s records .     towne waited  ate another bite of potato  then pushed the plate away a thumb   s width .     did you .         no .         you were involved in that imbroglio last year that put mr .  mikels in prison  weren   t you .         no .      myler towne glanced around at his people .     i was misinformed .  i was under the impression that you met with the auroran liaison from the calvin institute .  was that on some other matter .  i ask  you see  for a number of reasons  not all of which may be immediately connected          my employer was under suspicion for the events that put your employer in prison  mr .  towne .  i was doing my job  seeing to his security .  i was not  however  involved in any of it .         hmm .  indeed .  then why have you been twice to the auroran embassy in the last two days .         your first message to call came before either of those meetings  so i assume your reasons had nothing to do with that .  have they changed .         when i hire someone i want to know about them .         you aren   t hiring me .      towne gave a mock frown of disbelief .     you    re turning my offer down .         i am .         but you haven   t even heard it .      coren sighed .     must i .      myler towne stood .  he was an enormous man  easily head and shoulders taller than coren  and not  as coren first suspected  run to fat .  for his size  he had a trim waistline  which implied that the shoulders filling his smock were solid and powerful .      it   s such a good offer     towne said .   he came around the small table and an attendant immediately began clearing off the dishes .  another removed the table  and a third took away the chair .   towne took coren   s upper right arm in a massive hand that nearly encircled his bicep .     walk with me  mr .  lanra .      coren moved without thinking .  there was no question of refusing .   towne guided him deeper into the arboreta .  the scents of various flowers mingled  almost too sweet .  the colors competed for his eye .      do you like it .     towne asked .      it   s .  .  . astonishing .         not entirely decorative .  beautiful  yes  but this is a working facility .  there are several plots of non terran plantlife .         isn   t that .  .  .  .         illegal .  no  we have permission .  well  for most of them .  a few unexpected forms got in with the authorized seeds and have proven useful .  we do a substantial business in pharmaceuticals  as well as our industrial divisions .       coren glanced back in the direction of the    accident    and shuddered .      no  that wasn   t caused by an alien plant     towne said .     not directly  at least .  we manage the biospheres here better than that .  what you saw was a deliberate attempt to kill me .  a very fast acting substance  something we call a decompiler  was introduced in a standard defoliant .  the plants we grew there possessed a method of self defense that produced a cloud of protein molecules as they tried to rid themselves of the infection  in this instance a hopeless task  but it kept the poor things spewing vapor .  i liked to eat there because the molecules so produced have a very pleasant aroma and a side benefit for the palate .  anyway  the moment this compound  which the plants continuously kept in the air  came into contact with flesh  it reacted with the adiposa and began to work faster .  much faster .  one of my gardeners wandered in there just before lunch a few day sago .  the entire plot was reduced to the state you saw in about ten minutes .         um       coren worked to keep the image out of his head and failed .     so someone is trying to assassinate you .         absolutely .         what does this have to do with me .         nothing .  that   s why i called you .  i live within thick layers of security  mr .  lanra .  for someone to get that close        coren nodded  understanding perfectly .     you don   t trust your own staff .         there are a few  of course  but i   m not sure i would secure the results i need if i were to put them to finding the traitor .  i think it would be better done by an outsider  someone not overly familiar with the situation or the personnel involved .         i suppose its pointless to ask if there was surveillance .         constant .  we have nothing .  we   ve reviewed the record and nothing unusual happened .  i have one gardener for that plot  had  i should say  and he was the only one recorded tending the area .  i doubt he would have been stupid enough to step into his own trap had he laid it .         it would be extreme .  any idea who ordered it .         oh  yes  i have a very good idea .  i can   t prove it .  and i   d rather not say just now .      at that point  towne released coren   s arm and stopped .  coren turned to face him .      i would rather wait till i hear your answer     towne said .   coren shook his head .     any other time  mr .  towne  i might consider it .  but just now           i   ll pay you half a million credits .  half now  half when your investigation is successful .      coren   s breath exploded as if he had been punched .      don   t be shocked  mr .  lanra  i   m very serious .  this is worth considerably more to me than a half million .         forgive me  mr .  towne .  .  .     coren swallowed .     you must know that i can   t accept .  i have other responsibilities right now          looms    election .  you can   t think he   ll win .  besides  i know that you   ve essentially delegated his security to your subordinate .          that   s not the only thing  but i do owe some loyalty to mr .  looms .  how would it look if i left his employ now .      towne nodded .     it would look bad .  i won   t try to tell you that his election would be an inconvenience to imbitek .  seeing him fail would hardly be unwelcome .  but i think he will  anyway .  so do you .  or you    re not as smart as i thought .          still  i   m engaged in a project that i can   t let drop .  in a few days i might be able to reconsider          in a few days i could be dead .         then let me recommend another          i want you  mr .  lanra .  i   m not interested in second best .     towne cocked his head to one side .     more money .  name your price  we can negotiate .         this is a personal matter .         very much so .          for me .  i   m afraid i can   t .  not right now .      towne looked about to say more  then closed his mouth .  he shrugged .     i   m sorry  then .  i   ll have my people take you back to your office .  don   t fret  mr .  lanra  i   m not the vindictive sort .     he pursed his lips .     this personal issue .  perhaps i could help .  i   m not without resources .      coren hesitated .  towne   s offer took on new possibilities .  he could not use his own security people to find nyom   s killer  but it would have been good to have the help .  he ran through a number of ways he might take advantage of imbitek   s security .   no  it was too complex .  he did not have the time to work it out  build the appropriate firewalls  exercise the desired level of control .      that   s very generous     coren said carefully .  damn  it   s tempting .  .  .      i think i can wait one more day     towne said .     let me know .     he looked to his left then  and gestured .     thank you for taking the time to talk with me  mr .  lanra .       the pair of security that had accompanied socras appeared then .  they escorted coren back through the lush garden .  he paused before the dead foliage on the way out  fascinated in spite of his decision .   decompilers .  he wondered .     he instructed his desk to run a thorough sweep on the office for eyes and ears .  when the desk reported none  coren was surprised .  he hefted his hemisphere  wondering how else they might set up surveillance .   i don   t have time for this .  .  .      what about the searches .  report .         of the twenty three names you designated for records searches  partial correlations have been found as far back as twenty eight years .  eight of them attended the same university together .  sixteen have military service records .  twelve share relatives through marriage .         give me the highest factor of commonality .         investment .      no surprise there  he thought .  every one of those twenty three names was moneyed .     any particular stock .         nova levis corporation .  all of them were primary shareholders .          nova levis .  the colony or the lab .      the lab .         you said    were  they are no longer investors .         the corporation ran for eight years without showing a profit and was consequently closed .         sold .  to who .         purchased outright by the kysler diversified group .  debt paid out of available funds plus sale of equipment and patents .      kysler .  .  . the same company that owned those shipments diverted to make room for nyom   s baleys .  .  .  .      what patents .     he asked .      unknown at this time .  do you wish another search .         yes .  who was on the board of directors .         unknown .         did any of those twenty three sell early .         three  kyas vol  tenebra patis  and rega looms .         how early .         joint sale  three years after purchase of shares .         did any other shareholders who are not on this list of twenty three sell at that time .         one .  gale chassik .         the solarian ambassador .         presently .  he was not ambassador at the time .      coren considered .     i want a complete dossier on nova levis corporation .  for the time being  though  how does this figure into ree wenithal   s career .         ree wenithal was an operative of eurosector bureau of criminal investigation .  his last case involved research into nova levis corporation as one of several laboratories suspected as collusive entities in a kidnapping ring .  results proved inconclusive  no action taken .      so that   s where his reaction came from .  .  .      synopsis of his last investigation .         three year investigation of kidnapping and infant brokerage  leading to the discovery of a child selling trade operating between earth and a settler colony named tau regis .  agent wenithal received a commendation for excellence in police investigation  three citations for exceptional public service  and a merit commendation for valor after exposing the ring and overseeing its destruction .  he retired one year afterward with full pension and lifetime honors awards .  he opened his own business two years later  a small private security firm which failed after four years .  he remained retired then until starting the present firm of rw enterprises .         hard copy the dossier on the investigation .         only the public record is available .  details are under security seal pending review .         very well  the public record  then .     coren tapped a fingertip against his chin  thinking .     question  if wenithal   s case only lasted three years  why is there an eleven year spread concerning the names in his files .         subjects related in prior investigations from various districts .  collated by wenithal under his own investigation for related details .         so this was not the first time these matters had been investigated .         no .  ongoing investigations in five separate jurisdictions extending back seven years prior to wenithal   s case .         are any of the investigating officers available .         no .  eighteen officers  all deceased .         what about staff .  are any of the people who worked for nova levis still alive and available .  the principle researchers  what happened to them .         five researchers .  three are listed as deceased  one emigrated shortly after the lab closed  and the fifth is listed only as missing .         missing .  name .         kyas vol .          one of the primary shareholders who baled out early .         correct .         just missing  no last known address .  what about his file .  who was he .         an immigrant  native of spacer world theia  resident director of research at two medical centers prior to accepting directorship of neurobiology department of nova levis .       spacer .  .  .  .      did he return to theia .         the record does not so indicate .         missing .     that could mean anything .      the one who emigrated  destination .         nova levis .      coren grunted .     why am i not surprised .          unknown .      coren felt himself smile at the desk   s literalness .     very well .  continue search .  in the meantime  link me to sipha palen  encrypt protocols .      the screen emerged from the desktop and winked on .  coren waited patiently while the machines exchanged the proper codes to set up the link .  a few minutes later sipha   s face filled the screen .      about time     she said .     i was beginning to think you   d forgotten all about me .         no chance .  i   ve had an interesting time since last we spoke .  listen  i   m sending you a positronic specialist .          you   re kidding .  you really know one .         two  actually  but you   re only getting derec avery .      sipha frowned for a moment  then whistled .     i am impressed  partner mine .         you know about him .         i know someone who knows him .  you would think he was the reincarnation of susan calvin to listen to this person .         who .  oh  yes .  never mind .  anyway  he should be on his way up within the next hour or two .  he   s coming in company with an officer of the auroran embassy  a fellow named hofton .  meet them  keep the heat off them  and get them to their embassy branch as quietly and quickly as possible .  avery   s position with terran authorities is .  .  . what would be a good word .  .  .  . fluid .  i don   t want him busted and deported before he can do us any good .          consider it done .  nobody arrests anyone on my station unless i say so .         good  good .  i   m also sending you a list of names .  this is a fishing expedition  frankly  but it might turn up something .  see if any of the deceased match in any way .         i   ll do what i can .  have you found your informant .         no .  someone else is looking for her  too .  it might be a race .     he thought about that .     keep your people alert to her coming through kopernik .  if she   s on the run she might try leaving earth .         got a description .         i   ll forward you an image .  what about on your end .  anything new .         we found some fibers on the bin that match fibers taken from nyom looms    fingernails .  she fought .  our target may be banged up a bit .      somehow i doubt that  coren thought .     what kind of fibers .         synthetic of some kind .  we   re still analyzing it .  i   ll let you know when we identify it .     she paused .     you   re sending derec avery up .  does that mean you   re staying down .         afraid so .  i   ve got some things to follow up .         and you really don   t want to get back on a shuttle  do you .      coren smiled wryly .     no  not really .  sorry .         you   re going to have to get over that some day .  especially if you ever expect me to continue our friendship .         we   ll see .         uh huh .      coren shrugged .     hey  can i help it if i   m just an ordinary terran .         you aren   t  though .  that   s why your aversion annoys me .         yes  well .  .  .     he felt awkward  caught wordless .     did you tell looms .     she asked .      um .  .  . yes .  he took it better than i expected .  or maybe not .  it   s hard to read him  sometimes .         does he want you to keep looking .         yes .         you would  anyway .         yes .      sipha nodded as if understanding something else about him .     let me get back to work .  i   ll see to it mr .  avery gets to the auroran embassy .         right .     coren started to reach for the disconnect  then hesitated .     sipha  have you ever caught anyone smuggling stolen children through kopernik .      she stared at him  momentarily stunned .     no .  why .         something .  .  . just a peripheral bit of information i stumbled on .  an old case  nothing current .  just thought i   d ask .  thanks .          talk to you later .      the screen went blank .   coren cleared his throat and shrugged  as if trying to physically reset his thinking .     desk  do you have that public file on wenithal   s last case .         yes .         display it  please .       the screen filled with text .  coren leaned forward and began to read .       eleven    u  nion station d . c .  looked much the same as always  but derec never felt at ease with it  not after the assassinations and the subsequent ruin of his company and his hopes .  the floor had long since been cleansed of blood and now shone with the high polish of smokey mirrors .  people hurried about their business beneath its cavernous arch  announcements echoed over the p . a .   and no one seemed to notice how much it had changed .   as derec walked toward the customs desk  hofton behind him carrying a large bag and a columnar container  he kept looking around  searching  until he realized what it was he sought .   robots .  there were no robots .   union station had once  for a short time  been a kind of free zone where robots worked openly .  the terran senate had passed special legislation to allow positronics here  as a testing ground to see how earthers would react  and to show earthers the nature of robots .  spacers came through union station d . c .  and no other port on earth  so it was convenient to provide them with a reception area that offered familiar accommodations .  a resident intelligence had been installed to supervise the complex operations of the facility and manage all the robots .  derec   s company  the phylaxis group  had overseen its installation and had been contracted to do the maintenance and troubleshooting for it  but subsequent events took all that away .  and more .   he was nervous here  partly because it had been months since he had visited union station and his last memory of it held death  and partly because this was the first time since the trials at which the conspirators in the assassinations were found guilty and sentenced he had left the embassy .  though treated primarily as witnesses  derec   s staff had been detained and questioned for several weeks  and at least one person had been arrested on a minor charge tangentially related to phylaxis and its activities .  in the aftermath  it had been made clear to derec that his presence on earth may be required indefinitely .  he was to make himself available to the court .   his passport had been confiscated .   later  ariel had let him know that she had interceded in his arrest .  his auroran citizenship was reinstated and he received a new passport  but his position became tenuous in the course of action taken by ite to challenge the new document  and an injunction resulted barring him from leaving earth .      legally     ariel had explained     this is absurd .  it   s a gesture .  they can   t keep you from leaving unless they arrest you .  they can   t arrest you on auroran soil .  if you do leave  your auroran passport won   t be questioned anywhere else and without criminal charges being filed  there are no grounds for extradition .  they   re trying to keep you here because they don   t know what they want to do with you .  you frighten them .  we all do .      i have news for you  ariel  he now thought as he placed his one small bag on the customs desk  they frighten me .  .  .   hofton set his burdens on the desk beside derec   s and extracted a disk from his jacket .  he handed it to the attendant .      i didn   t even have a chance to find out anything about the director of the lab     derec said .     rotij polifos .  never heard of him .          i had a chance     hofton said .     and .         i think later .  .  .  .      derec looked at the customs attendant  who seemed totally absorbed by their documents .     sure     he said .   in retrospect  derec realized that he saw the attendant push the button .  she closed out one screen  turned smoothly  and her hand brushed across a depression on the desk to the right of her keypad .  a second later  she handed hofton a disk .      derec avery .      derec turned to the voice and found himself confronted by three men in uniform and a fourth in a dark suit .  one of the uniforms stood closest .      yes .     derec replied  his pulse picking up .      port authority     the uniform said .     would you come with us  please .         um   i           excuse me  officer     hofton said  stepping forward .     is there a problem .         we have some questions for mr .  avery .         you may ask them here .  we have a shuttle to catch .      the uniform frowned .     who are you .      hofton extended his ill .  the officer slipped the disk into a palm reader  then showed it to the man in the suit .      we are on auroran embassy business      hofton said .     unless you have specific issues that you are willing to state publicly  you have no legal grounds to detain us .  our passage is to kopernik station and we will be staying at the embassy annex there .  i can cite you the relevant part of the diplomatic accommodations code if you like  but i believe you already know it .          there   s no need to      the man in the suit said .      identify yourself  sir     hofton said .     are you also port authority .  if not  please produce a valid warrant .         warrant .  .  .  .         if you wish to detain mr .  avery  i believe a warrant is required  you may not do so on spec .  if there is such a warrant  we are permitted to return to the auroran embassy here for consultation with our law department .  mr .  avery is currently working under a brief from ambassador burgess .  you may check that .  the brief extends her diplomatic immunity to her agents .  you may check that in the code as well .  but you may not detain us while you do so unless you have a valid warrant .         what is the nature of your visit to kopernik .     the man in the suit asked .      you have not yet identified yourself     hofton said .     mr .  avery is not obligated to answer that .         are you a lawyer .         no  sir .  if i were i would have settled this matter by now .  i   m giving you the benefit of a less predatory disposition .       the man in the suit stepped forward  his face reddening .     that man     he said  jabbing a finger at derec     does not leave this planet .          i repeat     hofton said calmly     do you have a valid warrant .      derec watched  stunned  as if time had stopped .  hofton did not flinch  did not smile  did not do anything that might have looked like an actionable gesture .  the man in the suit reddened further .      you have no authority to prevent him      hofton said finally .     if you attempt to do so  the auroran embassy will file a formal complaint .  if you do not have that warrant  i can also promise that you will no longer hold the position you currently do .  now  there   s an easy solution .  kopernik is technically earth .  a satellite  true  and not on the ground  but if you check you will see that it qualifies as earth .  mr .  avery is not leaving earth .         that   s facile     the man in the suit said .      yes .  but legal .      one of the uniforms was smiling .  the man in the suit stepped back .      i   ll be contacting my people on kopernik     he said .     we   ll have this conversation sooner or later .         you   ll have plenty of time then to enjoin mr .  avery from further travel outsystem     hofton said .     now  if you don   t mind  we have a shuttle to catch .      hofton turned to the custom attendant .     please return my original disk now .      the attendant paled visibly and handed over another disk .      thank you     hofton said and grabbed the container and the bag .     mr .  avery .      shaken  derec managed to walk toward the debarkation concourse .   halfway to the shuttle  he glanced at hofton .     how true was all that .         mostly     hofton said .     i was guessing that they had no warrant  which is the only reason i could think that might prevent them from detaining us .  as for what the auroran embassy would do if he had insisted  which he could have .  .  .  well  i rather doubt they   d risk an incident over you .          you bluffed     derec said in amazement .   hofton nodded .     successfully  i think .        derec took his briefcase from the kopernik customs inspector  nodded curtly  and walked forward  into the debarkation lounge .  from space  kopernik station resembled a child   s construction from struts and blocks and spheres  additions over time added to the original dumbbell configuration giving the impression of an abstract modelbuilder   s idea of a tree .  symmetry could be sensed but not directly observed .   the interior looked no different from any brightly lit warren on earth .  the debarkation lounge resembled the foyer of a hostel .  derec had dozed during the last half hour of the flight and felt slightly muddled .  he searched for signs directing him to the spacer section  which should be nearby .  he noticed a pair of women off to his right who seemed to be waiting for someone .   then he saw a station security officer to the left  also watching for someone .  anxious  he increased his pace .      mr .  avery .     a man called from behind him .   a sickly warm sensation erupted within him  spreading out from his stomach .      sir     hofton called .      mr .  avery      the man repeated .      derec  wait     a woman said .   derec hesitated at the familiar voice  almost turned to look  and stumbled a few steps .  a passerby caught his arm  steadying him .  derec jerked away .     sorry     he muttered .     thank you .          derec      hofton said  coming around to block his path .      derec     came the familiar sounding voice again .  female .  where .   one of the two women he had noticed grinned at him .  thick mahogany hair haloed her rounded face .  she wore a loose fitting shift and pants  auroran style .  derec stared at her  sure he should know her and unable to name her .   standing beside her was the second woman  taller  dark skinned  athletic  dressed in a suit that suggested a uniform .  she radiated authority and he wondered what trick or bluff hofton could do now to get them to the spacer embassy .  he swallowed hard and made himself stay put .      sir     hofton said .     i believe our contact is here .         hi  boss      the familiar woman said .   derec stared  recognizing her now .     rana .  .  .  .  rana duvan .  .  .  .  .      her grin widened .      mr .  avery .     the dark woman asked quietly  stopping within arm   s length .      y yes .         i   m sipha palen     she said  extending a hand .     coren told me to expect you .  i apologize for being late .      tentatively  derec clasped her hand .  the grip was dry and strong .  abruptly  he felt very foolish .      ms .  palen  yes .  i      he looked past her at rana .     would you excuse me .      he set his briefcase down at hofton   s feet and embraced rana .  her arms came around his back and squeezed him .      i don   t      he began .      it   s good to see            what are you   .           too long      she commented .        can   t believe it  you look       derec   s breath escaped in a heavy sigh  simultaneously with rana    s sharp laugh .  he stepped back .  her eyes glistened and she wiped at them impatiently .      what are you doing here .     derec asked .   rana smiled .     i   m your embassy contact .         embassy .  .  .  .         long story     she said .     later .     she nodded in sipha palen   s direction .     business .      palen watched with a bemused gleam in her eyes  hands clasped behind her back .      sorry     derec said .     rana and i used to work together .  it   s been a while since we saw each other .         of course     palen said .      um .  .  . yes  mr .  lanra said you   d meet us .  you   re chief of security .         every bit of it      she said  smiling .     welcome to kopernik .          thank you .  i believe i   m supposed to oversee an excavation on a positronic brain .     he looked at rana  who shrugged .      we haven   t let it out of our lockup yet      palen said .     now that you   re here  we can get started .         rana is more than qualified          coren and i have agreed to a certain protocol in this case .  you are part of it .         i see .  well  then  let   s get started .  i understand there   s a time limit .         there is .  i   ll take you to the robot directly and we   ll all escort it to the auroran embassy  if that   s acceptable to you  ms .  duvan .          i   m not in charge of the embassy     rana said .  she glanced at hofton .     if it   s been cleared with yart  then .  .  .         i   ve already secured the appropriate clearances     hofton said .     ambassador leri is aware that certain unusual circumstances prevail .  we have his cooperation .         good     sipha palen said .     then .  .  .  .     she made a gesture for them all to proceed .   derec retrieved his briefcase and they fell into a group  he and palen in the lead  hofton and rana following .  as they passed beneath the arch leading to the main concourse  derec glanced to the left and saw a tall man in a knee length ivory coat .  his face was almost as pale as his coat  but mottled  as if from scarring .  the faintest trails of hair traced across his scalp above a high forehead  and sharp  golden green eyes shifted slowly  intently .  he stood facing the customs aisles  as if waiting for someone  but as they walked by  he turned to watch derec and his companions .  it seemed to derec  just for a moment  that the man smiled .  too brief to get a firm sense about it  but derec thought he recognized a sign of familiarity and satisfaction in that expression .   then derec was through the archway and out of sight .  he had never seen the man before .  he knew he did not want to meet him .  the reaction was irrational and after several steps he dismissed the entire episode as a leftover of his anxiety .   must be palen   s man  he thought .  it made sense .  by the time they reached the embassy branch  derec had forgotten all about him .     palen   s section looked cramped .  the doors were narrow and the passageways claustrophobic .  the main desk nearly filled the front office  the bulkheads behind it filled with communications equipment that appeared constantly active .  as they    entered  two uniformed officers looked up from where they sat behind the long  heavy counter .      chief      one started .      not now     palen said .     where   s oler .         back in the lockup     the other officer said .      chief     the first one said again     you   ve got a message here from an agent harwol  tbi .  he says it   s urgent  would you          later      palen cut him off .   without another word  palen led the way around the end of the desk and into a corridor .  at the other end  they emerged into a wide  low ceilinged chamber lined with cells .  derec counted three people behind the transparent doors  none of whom bothered to look up as palen   s group filed through .  one  though  caught derec   s eye  a spacer  judging by the clothes .   adjacent to the cell block was another chamber about the same size  but without the cells  instead  tables  chairs  and a few couches littered the floor .  against one wall stood an autochef and a samovar .   a short woman with no hair sat at one table  bent over a reader  one hand wrapped around a tall cup .  she looked up .      we   re here to get the tinhead  oler     palen said .     get us a gurney  will you .      the woman nodded  paused to finish reading something  then walked out .  palen went to a plain door opposite the auto chef .  with a passkey  she opened it and stepped inside .   derec followed palen into the storage locker .  shelves stacked against the left wall to the ceiling  boxes and canisters piled on the floor to the right .  at the far end lay a robot  legs bent up in the small space .      you stored it here .     derec asked .      it hasn   t moved since we found it     palen said .     what would you have me do  put it in a cell where it could be seen .  most of our guests don   t stay very long .  i thought it best to keep rumor to a minimum .         i understand  but i thought you   d have it in your forensic pathology lab or something .         i repeat  i wanted to keep rumor down .  i already have the people who were there when we found it assigned exclusively to the crime scene and a communications block around that bay .     palen frowned .     besides  my people were a little nervous about it .         i thought you were used to dealing with robots     derec said .     that   s what lanra implied anyway .         more used to it than the average terran  but considering the possibility that this one committed murder  that was more faith than i was willing to ask of my people .         you don   t believe that  do you .         no .  but it wasn   t me i was concerned with .  now  do you want to look at this thing or criticize my methods some more .      chastised  derec stepped past her and knelt down .  as he expected  it was a dw     a very versatile laborer  basically .  in the inadequate light of the closet  it seemed physically in reasonably good condition  but it was hard to tell .  he lifted one heavy arm and pulled it straight .  relieved  he set it down  at least it had not locked up .      it should be easy to move .     he stood .     what have you done to it .         i had my chief pathologist go over it for physical evidence  but honestly not much beyond that .  it was in his lab for about an hour  then we put it in here .  i thought it best to just wait for you .          fine .  let   s get it to the spacer embassy  then .         mr .  avery .     palen stepped closer to him .  in the tight space she seemed to tower over him .  it was an effort not to back away .     what are the chances of recovering anything from it .         there   s no way i can give you an estimate yet .  i have to see how badly collapsed it is first .         but statistically          any numbers i give you would be meaningless .  you   ll just have to wait till we can start the excavation .     he waited  but she continued to stare at him .  he shrugged .     i   m sorry .         fine .  then let   s get you situated .        yart leri looked very much an auroran  slim  face smoothly ageless  large  clear eyes  and a politely attentive demeanor that nonetheless discouraged intimacy .      welcome  mr .  avery     he said  meeting them in the embassy reception area .  a robot occupied the desk .     we   ve arranged quarters for you and mr .  hofton .  i   ve been instructed to lend every assistance .  the resources of the embassy are  within certain limits  at your disposal .         thank you .  i   d like first off to see your positronics lab .         certainly .  i   ll have rotij show you around .  that   s rotij polifos .  he   s our chief roboticist .  he   ll be assisting you  should you require it .         with all due respect      derec said     might i be allowed to choose my own lab assistant .      leri blinked .     of course .         i   d like rana .      the ambassador almost frowned .     she is not  i believe  fully credited          nor is she auroran .  i understand that .  but we worked together before .  i found her most adequate .          i see no objection     leri said .      in that case  i   d like to see the lab as soon as possible .         i understood this would be a priority situation .  i   ve had rotij prep an area just for your use .         shall i wait for you .     palen asked .      yes  if you could     derec said .     this won   t take that long .  then i   d like to get the robot here as quickly as possible .         may i ask     leri said     what robot .         you haven   t been briefed .         not in all the particulars .  .  .      derec did not know what orders leri might have had from sen setaris .  best to say nothing  he decided  and sort out the protocols later .      i   ll leave it to higher authority  then     he said .     i   m sure ambassador setaris will update you as needed .          but       the lab  sir .     derec prompted .   leri frowned .     this way .       derec caught a look from rana .  she rolled her eyes as if to say now there   s going to be trouble  then nodded for derec to follow leri .   the small reception area gave no indication of the volume the embassy occupied .  leri led derec  hofton  and rana down a hallway to an elevator .  four levels down  it opened onto a lab area derec guessed at about five hundred square meters .   derec took a few tentative steps forward  surveying the equipment neatly arrayed across the room .  he recognized most of it  but a few pieces looked unfamiliar .      we finished a complete overhaul six months ago     rana offered .   derec whistled appreciatively  terran fashion  then saw leri   s puzzled look .     i   m very impressed  sir .  it doesn   t look like you want for anything .          this is a working lab  mr .  avery     leri said with a mixture of pride and contempt .     kopernik hosts a large population of robots in the spacer sections .  we service the positronics of all the incoming and outgoing spacer ships .         including the solarian .         the solarians do not possess such a lab .  they contract us to do their service and repair work .      a small cluster of people huddled together in a far corner  talking among themselves .  derec counted five and wondered which among them was head of the lab .      rotij     leri called .   one of the group looked toward them  raised a hand  then excused himself from the discussion .  he approached with long strides  he was typically tall  with a spacer   s indeterminate age .      yes .     he said  stopping before them .      rotij polifos     leri intoned     this is derec avery and his aide  hofton .  .  .     leri blinked at hofton uncertainly .      that   s correct     hofton said .     hofton  from the groundside mission .  the people i spoke to you about  from ambassador burgess   s office .  .  .  .         yes  of course     rotij said .  he seemed distracted and mildly put out .     honored  mr .  avery .  i know your work .         thank you .         rotij     leri continued     is chief roboticist and director of this positronics lab .     he looked between them for a few moments  then nodded  satisfied .     according to my instructions  you    re to be accorded every service of the facility .  should you require anything else  please feel free to see me .         thank you  ambassador     derec said .     you   re very kind .         if i may  i   ll leave you to director polifos          i need a minute  yart     polifos said .   leri blinked .     i   m sure we can get together later and          now .  if you please .         mr .  avery requires immediate attention .  afterward  of course .     with that  leri spun around and returned to the elevator .   polifos glared after leri for several seconds  then laughed caustically .     busy man .     he turned toward derec with a sigh .     well .  how can i help you .  ambassador burgess   s instructions were vague except on the point that you   re to have the run of the place .  i   m afraid i   ll have to ask that you leave us some area to do our regular work          i need a single station     derec said .     for one robot  full range diagnostic ensemble  and a large memory cache for an ri direct link .       the director   s face lost expression .     well .  .  . i don   t see a problem .  .  . did you say an ri direct link .         yes     hofton said .     and it   s quite heavy .        polifos wanted very much to watch while derec set up the link to thales  but his attention was divided by the work he had been supervising when derec and hofton first arrived .  he was both relieved and disappointed when derec made it clear that he wanted to work with rana .   the instant polifos returned to the huddle on the other side of the lab  rana began reconfiguring a commlink station for thales    requirements .      i assume nothing   s changed     she said  fingers moving deftly over the board .      thales    configurations .  no  only location and peripheral memory cache .  here are the numbers .     he scribbled out the address and the current parameters .   rana frowned .     how did you get all of it into that small of a buffer .  thales must feel absolutely claustrophobic .         daily complaints .  i didn   t have much choice .  the move into the embassy was rather hasty .  i   m lucky it wasn   t confiscated .         i was going to say  i   m surprised you still have him .            him    .  that   s very spacer of you .         i   m working on it .      she flashed him a smile .     i never expected to see you again .          ever .         well  not this soon  anyway .      she glanced over her shoulder  across the lab .     i   ll see about having this area shielded .  then you can tell me what the hell is going on .      derec followed her gaze .  hofton had left with palen to fetch the robot .  for the moment it was only rana and himself and a couple of technicians on the far side of the room  intent on their own work .      is there a problem .     derec asked quietly .      nothing overt .  rotij can be a pain sometimes .     she shook her head .      what are you doing here .     he asked .      qualifying for auroran citizenship .         seriously .         perfectly .  this is what i salvaged .  frankly  it   s more than i ever expected .  the tbi was really upset with us  you know .  i have a chance to go to aurora and maybe study at the calvin institute .  it would have helped if .  .  .     rana shrugged .      if ariel had retained some cachet .         to put it mildly .         we   re working on recovering some .  that   s part of what this is all about .       rana finished configuring the board .  she pulled a cable from the case containing derec   s link and connected it to the console .  she pressed a contact and waited .  after a few seconds  she entered more commands .      you   re very good     derec said .      i should be .  you trained me .         i think you were a better student than i was a teacher .      rana initiated a long encryption sequence  then turned to another  smaller board .  she watched it briefly  touched one button  and sighed .      all right     she announced  clapping her hands dramatically .     unless someone is trying very  very hard  we   re secure from eavesdropping .          do you think anyone would .      rana gave him a wry look .     our ambassador yart leri is a jealous little god and is not at all happy at being kept ignorant about your mission .  he wouldn   t do it out of malice  just vanity .         what about rotij polifos .  he seemed unhappy about all this .         this .  maybe .  but one of our interns was arrested yesterday and he   s naturally upset about it .  i don   t consider rotij the jealous type .  not that way .         i saw a spacer in palen   s lockup .  what was the charge .         disorderly conduct .  it doesn   t mean anything  it   s just an excuse for palen to haul someone in for questioning .  what her questions might be  who knows .  just have to wait for masid to be released and find out .         polifos .  is he good .         competent .  secretive .  i don   t know a lot about him  he never talks about himself .         anyone else i should be concerned with .     derec asked .      no one comes immediately to mind  but this is kopernik .  i doubt your presence is even known on the rest of the station  but i don   t like taking chances .     she glanced at her encryption  then sat down .     so .  what is this all about .         we   re doing a favor for rega looms .      he waited while rana digested this .  a smile worked at her face .     you are joking .         no .  not in the least .  of course  that   s not all of it .  i don   t know what it   s about on ariel   s end  but looms    problem apparently dovetails with a project setaris gave to ariel .  hofton will be returning with what looks like a standard dw    that witnessed a murder .  it   s collapsed  we need to see if we can recover anything .          i haven   t heard about any murders .  not recently  anyway .         baleys .  fifty of them  looks like .  you haven   t heard anything because palen is working on the same favor and keeping it silent as long as she can .         how long has it been so far .         two  two and a half days .  i   m guessing .         and how exactly does rega looms fit into this .         his daughter was one of the victims .       rana stared at him blankly .  then     i see .      derec coughed softly .     so  tell me about this auroran citizenship .      rana shrugged .     a gamble .  when the dust settled last year  i applied for emigration .  ite refused  based on essential skills  but i couldn   t get an employment stamp  either .  so i went to ariel and asked if she could help .  a few referrals later  it looked possible that i could get auroran citizenship due to the fact that i   m an undesirable .       derec started .     what .         i   m a positronic specialist .     she grinned wryly .     absurd  isn   t it .  but just the fact that i worked in a field that was for all intents and purposes outlawed on earth put me in a special category of almost but not quite foreign spy .  i have the entire law in my apartment and i occasionally read through it for a laugh .  anyway  we started the data flowing .  i   ve gotten this far  a transfer to kopernik .  the longer i work here  in this lab  the less desirable i become to terran authorities .     she smiled .     when the aurorans here found out i was a positronics tech  they didn   t know whether to believe me or throw me out .  when they learned how i   d become one  they wanted to hand me off to someone else .  anyone else .  ariel got dragged back in .  her suggestion was to hire me as a contract worker and go from there .  i   ve had to start the application process over three times now .  i can   t blame them for being cautious .  but it   s in the works now .  my application has been forwarded to aurora .  all i have to do now is to continue proving that i know what i   m doing .     she bobbed her eyebrows .     so that   s where i stand .  waiting .  like i said  six months ago we upgraded the whole lab .  i did most of the conceptual work with rotij  who   s very good  by the way .  rotij has added his name to my list of sponsors .          i   m glad .  it would be interesting to watch you at the calvin .          i might shake them up a little .         just might .       rana smiled .     what about you .      derec shrugged elaborately .     like you  waiting .  only difference is  i don   t have any clear path .  ariel got my auroran citizenship renewed  but there   s some .  .  . complication .  .  .  with the terran authorities .  i   m stuck in the embassy unless i want to be barred from earth forever .         i thought you were cleared of any charges .         not quite that simple .  this is earth  after all .  i suppose it would make everything easier if i just packed up and left .         would that be so bad .         i don   t know .  yes .  .  . no .  .  . maybe .  it   s .  .  . i like earth .  for all its maddening irrationality  there   s so much here .  they have history .  thousands of years of history .  there   s something intoxicating about it .     derec felt clumsy  as if groping to make sense .     it   s the first place i really came to know after i recovered from amnemonic plague .  i might as well have been born here .         i forgot about that .  sorry .         don   t be .     derec disliked talking about his past  lack of past  really .  the one thing he shared with ariel that would never change  both of them were recovered amnesiacs  victims of burundi   s fever .  the damage the disease caused left them permanently incapable of recovering memories from before its onset .   but they had rebuilt their lives .  derec had used earth as a focus  a home base  a place from which to find .  .  . what he needed to find .      ariel doesn   t share your appreciation     rana said .     she told you that .         we had a couple of long talks .  she needed a sympathetic ear  i think  that would go away later .         well .  i don   t know  though .  she   s here .  she requested an earth posting .          hm .  by the way  not to change the subject but .  .  . what about bogard .      derec sighed .     bogard .  most of bogard is in a crate stashed in a lockup in the embassy .  thales keeps teasing at his matrix .  of course  without sufficient memory  there   s only so much thales can do .         we   ve got the memory here .         believe me  the thought did cross my mind .  and thales    .  if possible .  .  .      rana smiled conspiratorially .     i don   t see a problem .  we   ll do what we can .      he gestured at the encryption sequence .     how big is this .         i   m using a five digit key .         five .  isn   t that a little excessive .         all these years on earth and you   re still not paranoid enough .  actually  i   m encrypting against positronic intrusion .  i   m letting thales choose the key .  that way you or i can   t give it away .         and thales won   t .  impressive .         thank you .     she regarded him thoughtfully .     and thanks for wanting to work with me again .  i hope i can help .             believe me  it helped just seeing you .      rana looked startled  then laughed nervously .     i missed you .      derec felt a warm rush of blood flow through his scalp and face .  surprised  he looked away .   a tone sounded  and rana looked over at the comm console .     ah .  we have security .     she tapped in a command .     thales .         i am online  rana .  how are you .        half an hour later  the robot arrived  encased in a dull gray canister  rolled on a gurney between palen and hofton .  its entry attracted attention from the huddle of technicians  who watched it all the way across the lab until it disappeared behind the blind rana had erected .   derec waited for palen to open the case .  the lid peeled back with a soft snik .  it was much as he had seen in the storage closet  an older model dw     or perhaps even  now that the light was better  a dw    with modifications  stretched out like a corpse in a coffin .  derec pressed two fingers against the place where its ear would be .  a small panel on the chest slid away to reveal a screen .  derec touched the screen  setting it aglow .  a string of alphanumerics scrolled rapidly over it  stopped  then disappeared  leaving behind a flashing red dot .      it didn   t hurt to try      he said .     thales  the self diagnostic is junk .  we   ll have to do this from first principles .         i am prepared  derec     thales replied .   palen frowned at the link perched on the console .      resident intelligence      derec explained as he began connecting cables to various jacks in the robot   s head and torso .  he had to wipe accrued grime off a couple of them .     a disembodied positronic brain configured to act as a primary systems processor .         uh huh     palen said .     like the one that went crazy in union station last year .      derec hesitated .     basically .  only this one is mine and no one has tampered with it but me .  so you needn   t worry about it hallucinating .      he finished the connections .     run synchronous pattern test  thales .  test link .          working  derec .     a moment later     the link is fine .  we can proceed .         is there anything left in there .      it took nearly two minutes for thales to answer .      damage is considerable  derec  but i detect a few orderly sectors .  memory nodes have not been corrupted .      derec exchanged grins with rana .      what does that mean .     palen asked .      it means     derec said     that we have a good chance of salvaging something for you .           twelve    a  riel felt a momentary surge  like the rush from falling  as the limo left the embassy .  she could not pin down in memory the last time she had been out side the spacer mission .  she swallowed dryly  waiting .  the further the transport carried from the garage  the calmer she became  after a time  she laughed at herself .   she opened her datum and accessed current files .  a list of reports scrolled down the screen  detail work she had neglected for months .  the complaints sorted themselves automatically in a separate column  apart from the regular stock and shipping reports all aurorans were required to file .  three firms came up more often than any other  one of them filing eighteen complaints over the last six months  all of them having to do with delayed or lost exports .   carsanli intercomp built domicile environmental control units  adaptable to a wide range of habitats .  their principle customers were settler colonies .  ariel was impressed with their logic  they built the units on earth  using part spacer technologies and part terran  and shipped through terran distributors  which minimized their spacer presence .  a lot of spacer firms conducted business in a similar fashion  but often had a difficult time in the manufacturing end due to restrictions on factory space and local regulations concerning employment and vending requirements .  in an unusual arrangement  carsanli leased a factory already owned and operated by a terran firm  imbitek  from whom they also bought the terran components .   the company kept its offices in the convention district of d . c .  ariel recognized the area as she entered it .  she used to come here twice a week  before so many spacer businesses had abandoned earth .  there was still a large spacer presence  though  and she had no sound reason for having neglected her duties .   the limo stopped at the main entrance to the offices .  she stepped out and looked around .  this was a warehouse area .  people in worktogs or officewear filled the passages as first shift opened .  she caught a few frowns and curious looks from passersby  but ignored them .  steeling herself  she entered the building .      ambassador burgess     said a tall auroran who greeted her .  behind him stood a broad reception desk and the company seal on the wall  an oblate disk filled with a moil of multihued shapes that reminded ariel of feathers .     welcome to carsanli intercomp .  i   m farin holiye  general manager .  this is most unexpected .      she grasped his hand briefly .     things have been unusually complicated recently .  i apologize for taking so long to come down .      holiye smiled brightly .     not at all  not at all .  please  this way .  we can talk in my office .      ariel followed him through a door and up a short flight of stairs .  he waved her into a wide  dark paneled office .      may i offer refreshment .     he asked  heading for a sidebar .      no  thank you .  i have a rather full schedule today .  but i wanted to see you first .          ah .  yes  well .  .  .     he gestured to a pair of plush chairs on opposite ends of a low table .     i don   t wish to begin with a complaint          i   m aware of the number of reports you   ve sent     ariel said  sitting .     i   m here now .         yes .  .  . well  the basic problem is that several consignments of product have gone missing  i think it   s accurate to say stolen .  insurance has compensated for them  of course  but we   ve lost three major customers over it .         you sent them replacements .         of course  but those went missing  too .  it was very aggravating .         shipments to the same clients .  .  . that   s very interesting .  may i see the manifests .         certainly .     he went to his desk and returned with a slate .     i had them prepared for you .      ariel scanned the columns .  four very large orders purchased by a construction firm on epsilon coriae never arrived .  as holiye had claimed  insurance covered the loss  but the settler company canceled the contract .  ite attributed the loss to piracy and pled lack of jurisdiction once the shipments left the solar system .  she scrolled further and noted several other shipments lost .  all of them had been slated for settler companies .      you also complained about delays .         several times     holiye said expansively .     we thought it was a problem with our exit port so we tried to get it changed  but the request was tangled up and has still not been acted upon .     he pursed his lips .     this is one of the things i understood your office dealt with .  .  .         of course .  again  i apologize .  i   ll look into it immediately .  what port are you using .         petrabor .      ariel looked up .     was any reason given for the delays .         a number of times they claimed a routing glitch in their logistics programs .  once they simply said that the shipment had been overlooked by the dock crew .  i found that intolerable .         how long has this been going on .         we   ve always had a few problems     holiye said     but we expect some loss and delay .  space is vast and people are people .  but i   d say in the last two years it   s become chronic .         i see .  .  .     she handed back the manifest .     how long have you been working with imbitek .         years .          any problems .         no .  in fact  since the previous chairman was replaced  things have gotten even better .  the new ceo seems very dedicated to providing service .         mmm .  how is it you drew petrabor spaceport .         the main factory is in kiv sector  just south .  petrabor is the closest port capable of handling the quantities in a timely fashion .         of course if they keep losing or misplacing shipments .  .  .         exactly  the benefit of faster service from larger capacity is offset by the nuisance factor .         well  if i recall     ariel mused     the arkanleg port or even kyro should be able to handle the traffic .  i   ll look into getting you rerouted .     she stood .     um .  .  . the stolen shipments .  .  . is there any pattern .  anything about them that strikes you as consistent .         well  no .  we usually always use the same shipping line  as we always have .  the destinations are always different  too .         i see .  well  thank you .  i   ll look into that  too  but i can   t promise anything .       holiye stood .     i appreciate you taking an interest  ambassador .      finally  ariel heard in his voice .  she nodded  shook his hand  and let him see her out .     several hours later  ariel let herself reluctantly into derec   s apartment .  her head buzzed with too much information .  she had visited four more firms  following up the complaints .  between the sense of guilt over neglecting her duties and the amount of abuse these companies had suffered from lost shipments  unexplained delays  and shabby treatment by warehouse managers and shippers  ariel felt humiliated and angry .   all of them shipped out of petrabor .   terran authorities had paid no attention because they were spacers .   and the pattern included her .   negligence is a disease  she thought bitterly  and i caught it .   holiye   s assessment that the problem had become chronic in the last year appeared accurate .  someone was taking advantage of her truncated authority .  the abuse was clear and unmistakable  but since her office was the clearinghouse for the complaints  no one had bothered to put it all together .  why should they .  it was her job and she had stopped doing it .   time to straighten it all out .  .  .   she would have preferred transferring thales to her own rooms or even into a standard lab facility  but either option would have taken too long .  she considered running a realtime link from here to her apartment  but the more remote access existed  the greater the chance of eavesdropping .  the terrans  especially  as backward as their tech seemed in some areas  they were disconcertingly advanced in others .   she stood in the living room for a few minutes  quietly letting herself grow used to the idea of being here .  it surprised her sometimes how difficult it was to continue knowing derec .  they got along well enough  but there were limits  and she did not know them all .   she looked around .  too little furniture  she judged .  austere .  one sofa  one chair  a low table  and a subetheric .  no carpet  just a plain tile .  the table was still cluttered with glasses and dishes .  a flatscreen reader stood like a piece of sculpture amid the mess .  she placed a hand on the back of the sofa  the pillows showed the wrinkles and depressions of long use .  she imagined him here  studying  till sleep pulled him out lengthwise  still clothed .   she snatched her hand away .   the bedroom was neat and orderly .  a modest collection of clothes in the small closet  stark gray sheets  a clock and lamp on the lone nightstand .   more clutter in the kitchen sink  but virtually no food in the pantry .  she scrolled through the menu on his autochef  coffee  various potato and pasta recipes  eggs  three meat dishes  juice .  it was as abbreviated as his wardrobe .   the workroom  dominated by thales    console  exhibited the most debris of occupation  papers  disks  three chairs  four or five readers .  .  . no dishes  though .      hello  ambassador burgess      thales said .   ariel felt a wave of guilt .  she swallowed .     hello  thales .  status .         i am linked to a positronic analysis station on kopernik     the ri said .     we have ninety nine percent capable dataflow  time delay negligible through subetheric router .  subject has been connected to diagnostics and i am running an excavation now .  we have uncorrupted memory nodes isolated by collapsed positronic synaptic framework .  estimated retrieval time for first verifiable memories  two hours  twenty nine minutes .      fast work  derec  she thought  impressed despite herself .  having hofton no doubt had sped things along .  hofton   s absence disturbed her  which came as a surprise .  she felt vulnerable .     how much available memory do you and i have at our disposal  thales .         i am using the buffers on kopernik for the excavation  the commline buffer to maintain the link .  for all practical purposes  you have all my available on site memory .         i see .  don   t tell me anything precise  like a number .         would you prefer a specific .  i have available   x      kjc in three primary and six secondary nodes          that   s fine  thales .      it amused ariel at times  the way positronic entities tried to accommodate human wants  matching expectations with limitations .  flexible as they were  they sometimes provided either too little information or too much  their ability to accurately judge what constituted the necessary and the sufficient inadequate to the challenge of serving people .  all in all  they were remarkable creations  among the best things humans had ever devised .  but they were not flawless .  not flawless at all .   ariel sighed .     all right  then .  i want you to begin a records search  new file .  priority protect protocols in effect .  alert me to any attempt at eavesdropping .  i want all available data on the history of nova levis .  i also want to be kept updated on the excavation you   re doing on kopernik .         yes  ariel .  may i ask  what level of records search .         what do you mean .         do you wish me to confine myself to those records without confidentiality protects or shall i acquire any and all documents pertinent to your request .      ariel considered .  thales wanted permission to violate protected files .  she had no doubt it could do so .  privacy issues represented a gray area for robots  they required specific instructions in such cases  lacking any sense of how harm might attach to simple data .      do a survey of available documents of both kinds      she said finally .     give me a list  detailing their security status and source .  we   ll decide then .         yes  ariel .     a moment later     will you be staying here .      she hesitated .     i   m not sure  thales .  what would you prefer .         it would simplify the security standards you have requested if i did not have to contact you via external comm for updates .         hm .  true .  do you think derec would mind .         i see no reason why he should .       no  i don   t suppose you would .  .  .      in that case  yes .  i   ll leave for a short while to get some personal items .     she thought a few moments .     in fact  from time to time i may have to leave anyway  depending on what you find out for me .          i understand  ariel .      she went back to the kitchen .  perhaps she could bring r .  jennie down here .  on the other hand  vacating her apartment completely might be a mistake .  in either case  she needed to give jennie instructions .  .  .   details .  she needed food in the kitchen  changes of clothes  her personal datum .  she wondered if derec ever had visitors  then dismissed the thought .  she would have known  if nothing else  there would be signs here  in his living space  and she saw little enough even of derec .   what has he been doing this past year .   oddly  the idea that derec had spent all this time alone  except for those few instances when they had shared a meal or attended a meeting together  saddened her .  but then  she knew little enough of what he had been doing prior to last year .  perhaps this was his norm  the way he was used to living .   he had been bitterly angry over losing his company .  that he had nearly ended up in prison had seemed relatively unimportant to him .  had she not moved to reinstate his auroran citizenship  he might very well be living today in a private call in a terran penal facility  the charges ranging from violation of earther trade laws and the positronic prohibition acts to murder .  that he would have been no more guilty than any other auroran on earth made no difference  he would have been the perfect example .  even without a jail term  the phylaxis group  his firm  had been used as a club to beat the pro positronic movement into submission and undermine all the work that had been done over the last several years to bridge the gaps dividing earth and the spacer worlds .  not the only club  to be sure  but a most effective one  phylaxis had been held responsible for the failure of the entire union station positronics showcase and the subsequent events involving what the media had characterized as a    killer robot     bogard .   bogard .  derec   s attempt at building a bodyguard .  ariel still shuddered when she thought of it .  she had condemned the idea  unfairly  she realized .  bogard had worked .  it had been subverted  tricked  and attacked  no other robot of which she was aware could have possibly continued functioning under such stress .  and that had been ariel   s objection .  she did not want robots to function after failure .  if they did not adhere rigorously to the three laws  she wanted them incapacitated .  bogard had doggedly persisted in functioning  all the way up until the end  when it had taken a human life .  inadvertently  in the course of protecting derec  but even for its remarkably flexible criteria an intolerable violation .   the thought had occurred to her that derec might take the blame personally .  she believed him more resilient than that  but you never knew how or which events might overwhelm a psyche .  she was ashamed of herself that she had not checked  had left him alone while she embraced her own self pity .   maybe we can turn it all around with this  she thought .  baseless optimism irritated her as much as pointless cynicism  but sometimes the situation demanded an investment of faith .   she looked back at thales .  i could ask it what derec   s been doing .  .  .   but there were those privacy issues again .      ariel     thales said  startling her .     i have a question .  which nova levis did you wish me to research .           i have found two references under the heading    nova levis      thales explained .     the first concerns a settler colony  established thirty two years ago in the tau secordis system .  the second concerns a research laboratory here on earth established twenty eight years ago .         what sort of research .     ariel asked .      biomedical and prosthetics .         really .  what sort of prosthetics .         the shareholder pr  cis published upon issuance of initial shares refers to neurocortical extensions .  inferring from other references  i believe this pertains to artificial appendages linked directly to the nervous system .      ariel frowned .     that   s nothing new .  what were they researching .         that data is under seal .  the company closed after eight years of operation in the wake of a criminal investigation .          explain .         a global investigation initiated by the eurosector civil enforcement agency into kidnapping and infant brokerage produced charges of conspiracy to illegally traffic in orphaned and stolen children involving several orphanage institutions and several medical labs .  nova levis was part of the overall investigation  but no charges were filed against it .  it closed down several months after the case was declared closed .         any direct links to nova levis colony .         one of the chief researchers emigrated there a year after the laboratory was closed .          anyone else .  i mean  what about the other people who worked for the lab .         there were five department heads  all of them founding associates of the company .  three are now dead .  the fifth is listed officially as missing .  he was a theian native living on earth named kyas vol .         missing .  that could mean anything .  did anyone look into his disappearance .         not that i have been able to ascertain .      ariel wrestled with her curiosity .  earthers maintained profound prejudices regarding anything that suggested humaniform robotics  even prosthetic limbs .  prosthetics were available  certainly  but people never talked about them .  like any prejudice  it manifested in bizarre fashions and displayed many blind spots and innate hypocrisies .  artificial intelligences proliferated on earth  in many areas  and nonsentient robotics were employed liberally  so long as none of it came close to resembling a human .  prosthetics occupied a tolerated space within the complex hierarchies of terran bigotry .  she had no idea how advanced the technology was  or if any new research was currently underway .      stay with the colony  thales .  if you come across any more direct connections  explore them .         very well  ariel .         i   m going to my apartment now  thales .  i need some things .  i   ll be back .         i should have a preliminary report for you when you return .       she thanked the ri and left .     r .  jennie met her at the door .     welcome home  ariel .  you have a message from ambassador setaris .         thanks  jennie .  pack an overnight bag for me  would you .  i   ll be sleeping elsewhere tonight .         i had intended preparing crayfish almandine tonight  ariel .       ariel gave the robot a look  startled at the note of disappointment she thought she heard .  it was so easy to personalize robots  so easy to    inform     them with emotion and human expression  but it still caught her by surprise to detect it .      change of schedule  jennie .  place the menu on hold for the time being .          yes  ariel .      r .  jennie walked off to pack .  they had devised a standard kit a long time ago when ariel had spent more time away from the embassy  in the company of others  particularly jonis taprin  now senator taprin .  it had been over a year since their last tryst and ariel had spent most of her time confined to her suite of office .   ariel sat down at her comm and keyed the accept but ton .  setaris   s face appeared on the screen .      ariel  i   m giving a dinner party tonight  i thought you would like to come .  i   m appending a guest list .  i   d appreciate it if you   d put in an appearance .  we don   t see enough of you .         my my     ariel mused .     i must be coming up in the world .     she resisted the urge to call setaris back and ask why .  instead  she scrolled through the list of invitees  the usual collection of ambassadors and close aides  gale chassik of solaria  trinik hapellon of capella  frish ioseco of osiris  others  and a sprinkling of spacer   migr  s and industrialists .   and jonis taprin .      what the .  .  .     ariel stabbed the connect on her comm and tapped in setaris   s code .  a few moments later she worked through setaris   s secretary to sen setaris herself .      ariel  how are you .     the ambassador asked .      puzzled .  you   re serious about this invitation .         of course i am .         you   ve invited jonis taprin .         yes .  .  .     setaris frowned briefly  then her eyes widened knowingly .     ah  yes .  i forgot .  my apologies  ariel .  the event is partly for him .  he put out some feelers a few weeks ago to see if we might arrange some talks .         concerning .         concerning precisely the subject we spoke about earlier .  i thought it might be worthwhile to have you there .  if  however  you feel uncomfortable       ariel shook her head .     no .  i merely wanted clarification .         and you have it now .         yes .      setaris smiled condescendingly .     i envy you .  will we see you .         absolutely .         at twenty  then .  formal .         very good  ambassador .  i   m honored .      setaris smiled thinly .     till this evening  ariel .      the screen faded .   ariel leaned back in her chair and stretched .      just how much ass covering am i going to need .     she wondered aloud .      i packed the standard bag  ariel .  will it be too much .      ariel looked around to see r .  jennie standing there  holding the overnight bag .        i have a preliminary file on the requested material  ariel     thales said when she returned to derec   s apartment .   ariel set the bag down at the door to the bedroom .     go on .         nova levis was established as a settler   s colony thirty two years ago by special agreement between the vas domini trading company  a settler cooperative sponsored by private endowment through the church of organic sapiens  and solaria          solaria .  how do they figure in it .         the tau secordis system was originally developed as a mining franchise by three solarian corporations which eventually became insolvent and were subsumed by the solarian department of resource development .  the second planet  originally called cassus thole  after a modest amount of biosome intervention  is suitable for agriculture .  under the terms of a trade agreement with a limited corporation formed by six settler worlds  cassus thole was renamed nova levis and subcontracted for settlement and development .         why hasn   t solaria protested the blockade .         except for being the principal lien holder  solaria has no representation on nova levis and has remained aloof from its operations since the first colony was established .  there is still a small mining station with its own port used exclusively by solaria .  nova levis has for all intents and purposes represented itself as a sovereign world with rights and titles to its own territories .  the colonists themselves have not even admitted to solarian ownership and have engaged the current crisis as a duly constituted independent state .         so it   s not even common knowledge that solaria owned the system .         the conditions of ownership have been allowed to grow vague .  solaria    s holding is listed in public flies as cassus thole .  except for the mining concession  solaria officially conducts no business with the settler government .  nova levis has  since been regarded as a separate colony .      ariel laced her fingers together and tapped them lightly against her chin .  she felt foolish now at having paid so little attention to the events of the past year .  the nova levis blockade was the first and largest aftershock from the failed trade conference last year .      give me a brief on the blockade     she said .      two years ago  terran investigators traced a number of stolen shipments to ships making regular calls at nova levis .  this was discovered in the wake of the tiberius incident  which proved to be related to illegal traffic into and out of nova levis .  further investigation on the ground resulted in the deaths of three agents and partial evidence that nova levis is host to an unregistered spaceport .  at this point  warrants were solicited through the intersettlement judicial committee for a task force to visit and inspect all ports on nova levis .  the governor advocate of the colony refused and offered to conduct the investigation himself and report the findings .  this was rejected .  a further proposal was made that a joint task force of spacer  settler  and terran inspectors be deployed  and this  too  was rejected .  fifteen months ago  motions were placed before the committee to establish a permanent inspection base at the edge of the system with a mandate to forcibly inspect all ships entering and leaving the system .  this motion  of course  was rejected in due course when the spacer legation insisted that robotic inspections be instituted for all traffic to and from any spacer world .  the station was never authorized  but terran military ships began arbitrarily and at random stopping and searching ships entering and leaving the nova levis system .  a series of protests were filed .  the committee became tangled with delaying motions by the terran legation until a terran ship was fired upon by an unregistered freighter caught leaving nova levis .  upon inspection  it was discovered that the ship was carrying contraband .  the crew was arrested  the ship impounded  and the   rd squadron of the terran fleet moved in to blockade the planet .  that was eleven months ago .  subsequent negotiations have validated the blockade  although only one spacer world has added ships to the terran contingent  and no settler ships have joined it .         that   s how it stands today .         yes  ariel .         stolen shipments .  .  . any kind of manifest on what those shipments contained  or who they were stolen from .         that is a protected file .  it will take some time to open it .          do it .  what about solaria .  what did they say when all this happened .         they have made no official statement to date  content  apparently  to follow aurora   s lead .         are those auroran ships with the terran squadron .         no  they are theian ships .  aurora is remaining militarily aloof .       as usual  ariel thought wryly .     and no one has brought up solaria   s past ownership .         no  ariel     thales replied .      not even aurora .  .  . but solarian ships are still entering and leaving the system .  how is that possible .  as i understand it  a blockade like this is enforced at the port of origin as well .  solarian ships heading for nova levis would be stopped or at least noted and identified as blockade runners .          that is how the law reads .  i will look into it .       something else teased at ariel .     you said there were three solarian firms that initially had title to the system .  who .         strychos  incorporated  m   viavel corporation  and the kysler solar industries .         kysler .  .  . that sounds familiar .          kysler diversified industries  ariel .  they are a terran firm based on titan  though no longer terran owned .  the three solarian firms i mentioned have all been subsequently purchased by the hunter group .  only strychos remains as a semi independent corporation  dealing in agricultural products .         hunter owns kysler .         they own a controlling interest .         what did they do .  the terran firm  i mean .          primarily a holding company .  pharmaceuticals  raw material development  shipping  finance          stop .  any other correlations through their dependent companies .         no .  however  kysler purchased the physical plant in which nova levis was housed .         really .  what became of the rest .         after it closed down it was split up and sold .  the retd division went to imbitek  which folded it into a subsidiary  captras biomed .  various pieces of hardware went to a number of small firms .         imbitek owns the research and kysler owns the shell .  .  .  what did they do with it .     ariel asked .      unknown .  current data suggests that the structure is sealed and unused .  a retrofitting company was hired to convert it into a raw materials distribution plant a few years ago .  after that i find no records .         thales  i want a list of shareholders for each of those three companies  kysler diversified  hunter group  and nova levis .  prepare a hard copy for me .  let   s return to the colony .  you said that a settler cooperative took it over .         that is correct .  through private endowment .         through a church  though .  what was its name .         the church of organic sapiens .       she thought for a moment .     that   s rega looms    church .         it is currently the church with which rega looms is affiliated .  however  he has stepped down from its directorship for the duration of his senate campaign .  he was not its director at the time the colony was established .          did he belong to it .         i do not have access to those records .  would you like me to try to obtain them .         maybe .  hold off for now .     ariel drummed her fingers on the edge of the console .  she could not shake the feeling that she was missing something .     rega looms despises the whole idea of offworld colonization .  so does the cos  now .  i suppose it didn   t then .          the church of organic sapiens has undergone a number of fundamental changes in purpose in the sixty eight years of its existence .  the current one has been in place since rega looms became its director .          how long ago was that .         eighteen years ago .          display the exact dates .       numbers scrolled across one of thales    screens .  the settler colony of nova levis was established eleven years before rega looms took directorship of the church of organic sapiens .  ariel could see nothing significant about that  but she felt certain she should .      when was nova levis  the lab  incorporated .      the date appeared between the first two displayed .  nova levis incorporated opened forty two months after the colony .      closing date .      fourteen months before looms took charge of his church .      there is a correlation     thales said .     rega looms was one of the initial shareholders in nova levis incorporated .  not in kysler diversified .         all right .  .  . he couldn   t possibly have maintained it and represented a church that condemns prostheses .  when did he divest .         four years after its incorporation .         did he start a panic .         apparently not .  only three other shareholders divested in his wake  kyas vol  tenebra patis  and gale chassik .       ariel started .     ambassador chassik .         yes  ariel .         was he ambassador then .         no  ariel  he was chief attach   to ambassador masmo pedesor .      ariel frowned .     do you have those lists of shareholders .         yes  ariel .       another screen filled with names in three columns .  the one for nova levis  inc .  was the shortest  the one for kysler diversified the longest .  names were highlighted in bright blue .   ariel raised an eyebrow .     well  well .  some people just turn up everywhere  don   t they .      glowing brightly in all three columns were the names of alda mikels  gale chassik  and former senator clar eliton .      thales  get coren lanra for me  would you .  i think we need to talk before this goes much further .          thirteen    c  oren knocked on the office door labeled kelvy torans  accounts executive .  when the woman behind the large desk looked up  he smiled and waggled his fingers at her .      coren .     her grin dazzled .     come in .  you actually caught me with time on my hands .          i couldn   t be that lucky  could i .     he sat down across from her .   she touched a button  closing her door .     yes  you could .     she gazed with mock seductiveness at him until they both laughed .     what can i do for you  coren .         a little inside information .         nothing that will get me in trouble .         i don   t think so .  what do you know about myler towne .      she raised an eyebrow .     chairman protem of imbitek .         the very same .       she closed her eyes for a few seconds .  her face  still and framed by a close cut helmet of black hair  seemed almost childlike .  when she opened her eyes  she drew a deep breath .      joined imbitek eleven years ago  new accounts  and worked his way into mergers and acquisitions .  three years ago  he was on the logistics and projections board .  the assassinations last year opened a position on the board of directors .  he was nominated and elected within two weeks .  after alda mikels received his sentence  towne campaigned for the position of chairman  but it was given by the board reluctantly  and with the proviso that it was temporary  ending upon mikels    release .         how good is he .         not bad  considering that he   s spent most of the past year fending off lawsuits and dealing with tbi investigations into the company .  he   s actually turned imbitek around in the last few months  so i   m beginning to recommend it again as a primary investment .  they   re not as robust as they once were  but given this i can   t wait to see what they do when mikels is back at the helm .         i knew imbitek had taken a tumble       kelvy grunted eloquently .     they very nearly dropped out of the primary three hundred .  within three weeks after mikels was sentenced to prison  imbitek stock fell eighty points .  towne has it back up forty eight points .         how .      she shrugged .     wish i knew .  they   ve gone through a big restructuring  a lot of positions terminated  and he   s trimmed off some of the fat mikels kept on as pet projects .  but a big part is that imbitek is buying back its own stock .         it had the revenue for that .         apparently from the sale of offworld holdings .         why    apparently    .  wouldn   t it be in their shareholders    report .         of course .  but the convenient fact about offworld holdings is that local laws are flexible and there are a thousand ways to funnel money that can   t be traced .  i say    apparently    because you can never be sure if a holding on  say  revis logandi is real or just a fiction to hide funds .         so they sold holdings .  .  . no other way they might get the money .     coren asked .      sure .  the easiest way would be to borrow it .  but they   ve made no loans for it and according to their reports over the last few years  their credit has been limited .  banks aren   t quick to count those offworld holdings i mentioned as reliable collateral  so credit is based mainly on available terran assets and so on .  according to that  imbitek was overextended .  not dangerously so  but enough to limit them .  if they were hiding collateral  well .  .  . i   m sure it would have angered shareholders to know the company had that available credit hidden from them  but under the circumstances no one complained .  the policy kept those shareholders who had remained faithful from losing everything and even gaining a little .          so he   s a bright boy .  what happens when mikels gets out .         that   s what we   re all waiting for     kelvy said .     already there   s been nervous trading .  towne might have to pull another magic trick to keep the company from devouring itself in a proxy war if he decides to fight mikels .  he has managed to replace two of the board members with his own supporters .  the others .  .  . well  you just never know how these people will jump .  towne has proven himself .  mikels is bringing a lot of baggage to the table and may be unable to reclaim the chair .         do you think there will be a war .         towne is ambitious  mikels is the old bull .  you tell me .  the psychology is certainly volatile .       coren considered .     so how far has imbitek stock fallen since mikels    release was announced .      kelvy grinned at him appreciatively .     eighteen points .  not a disaster .  yet .         still .  is towne buying .      she shook her head .     not that i know of .  imbitek has started slowing down some its outside investment  too .  odd .  as of a month ago  their regular cash allocations for new stocks virtually dried up .  if i didn   t know better  i   d say they   re having serious cash flow problems .         why do you know better .         two months ago  imbitek sold off one of its subsidiaries for an enormous profit .  they haven   t paid a dividend on it yet because it was the beginning of the quarter  so all that money is just sitting somewhere .  towne gave himself and everyone on the board merit increases  modest ones  not the sort you see when a company is in trouble and the management is salting away the spoils before the end .         in other words  their expenses haven   t risen substantially .         right .  so i doubt they actually have a problem with cash .  they even paid back a couple of longterm loans .          war chest .      kelvy frowned .      myler towne wants to keep his new position      coren said .     he   s preparing for a war .  what are alda mikels    people doing while all this is going on .         a lot of them left the firm .  a lot of them were asked to leave .  those who left have been drumming up support among the shareholders  advocating mikels as the better choice as chairman .      coren tapped his fingers on the armrest .     what subsidiary did they sell off .         captras biomed .         who bought it .         a consortium of private investors .  i   d have to do some prying to find out who .  they bid anonymously .          could you  please .  i   m very interested .      kelvy nodded  frowning .      one more thing .  do you remember a bio research company called nova levis .         sounds familiar .  old  gone now .         yes .  it shut down several years ago .  i wondered if it might be possible to get a list of its investors .         that would be a matter of public record .         not the real names     coren said .     a lot of investors go on record through a front .  the fronts are public .  i want to know who really owned shares .         all right .  how soon do you need it .         same time i need to know who bought captras .      kelvy smiled .     ah hah .  yesterday .  do we have time  then  for dinner .         i   d like that .  .  .          .  .  . but not tonight .     she shrugged .     oh  well .  i   m just your broker  not anyone special .  your future lies in my hands every day  but you shouldn   t be over felicitous on that account .          have i ever pointed out that you use a very questionable technique .         several techniques  under the proper circumstances .  i hope to show you more of them sometime .     she smiled .     it   ll be worth the wait .  i   ll get you this information by tomorrow morning .  soon enough .         that will do nicely .  thank you .      kelvy pointed a finger at him .     we have plans .      coren grinned .     we have plans .         shoo  then .  i have work to do .      coren left her office .  the plaza fronting the brokerage was filling up with second shift on its way to work .  coren crossed to the walkways and stepped smoothly to the third lane .   he commed his office .      has jeta fromm contacted me yet .         no     replied the desk .   damn .     any other messages .         ambassador ariel burgess wishes you to call her as soon as possible .  mr .  doppler from data recovery systems wishes you to contact him at your convenience .      doppler .  .  .  .  data recovery systems was the clearing house that had originally supplied him with jeta fromm .  coren closed the link to his desk and tapped in doppler   s code .      this is lanra .          mr .  lanra  forgive the intrusion     replied a smooth  androgynous voice .     there has been a .  .  . complication with our recent service .  we   ve been trying to repair any possible harm that has resulted .     doppler   s hesitancy made it clear that he felt embarrassed .     i wish to confirm that our service to you was acceptable .  the operative your office has been attempting to locate          jeta fromm .         yes  sir .  um .  .  . this is quite awkward .  .  .         you haven   t been able to find her     coren guessed .      in fact  we haven   t even tried .  she has become no longer available  having ended her association with us three months ago .  we are trying to determine a chronology so that service to our clients is not compromised .          three months .  that was before i retained her .         yes  sir     doppler confirmed .      you    re telling me that she wasn   t even working for your company when she initially responded to my commission .  and no one thought to inform me .      doppler seemed to clear his throat .     regrettably so .  i realize that excuses fail to compensate in this circumstance  but our system suffered an .  .  . intrusion .  .  . which kept us from monitoring certain files adequately .  it wasn   t until recently that we were able to restore the data and determine the nature of all the errors .  i hope you understand .      coren briefly felt cold .     i do  indeed .  am i the only person she contacted after she broke her ties with you .         no  sir  there were several others .  i am not  of course  at liberty to discuss their files .          of course not .  discretion is your reputation .         something like that .  i also wanted to warn you that  under these unusual circumstances  whatever data you received from ms .  fromm would be highly questionable .  our usual reimbursement policy is in effect  of course  but we will not guarantee the quality of the product .         that   s .  .  . problematic .  thank you for the call  mr .  doppler .         i hope this will not put you off using us in future .         of course not .      the link broke .  coren pocketed the comm .  jeta fromm was dead .  the question was when .  had he even met with her to begin with .   he watched the warrens pass by  shops  offices  home kitchens  girders  plazas  balconies .  block upon cube upon struts  mounding up to a hazy murk high above .  the lights shone brilliant blue white through the mists that formed near the upper elevations  delimiting the volume by showing everyone the ceiling of the cave .  inside .  tunnels  corridors  a maze of interconnected structure  involuted and self cannibalizing over time  filling and refilling  home to billions  contained  giving the illusion of safety and accessibility .  so easy to get from one place to another  it was all in here  and the ways all clearly marked .  no part of the world was cut off from any other .  you could in principle reach anyone  anytime  by any of ten or a hundred pathways .   but not if they were dead .   if he had not lost his optam  he would have at least had something visual to run through  especially the humans that had accompanied the stealth robot .  odd  he was beginning to think of the robot as having been in charge .   going through damik had been the only way he could think of to find the people nyom might have gone through  but that had led him into areas that seemed unrelated to nyom   s death .   so why pursue them .  he wondered .   because it felt connected .  because he saw rega looms    name on a list of investors of a company that he would today condemn as a morally questionable enterprise  a company with the same name as the colony his daughter had been murdered while trying to emigrate to .  because looms had made the same remark as a man coren had never even heard of till today .  because all these unrelated details felt related .  he just could not see how .  yet .   the rule by which he had always worked was  when stuck for the next move  ask more questions .   why did damik go see wenithal .   coren certainly had names from the wenithal connection  but not the ones he had expected and none he could do anything with  at least not immediately .   unless i just can   t see it .  .  .   he glanced at his watch  then pulled out his comm again .   a few connections later  ariel burgess answered .      coren lanra  ambassador .         mr .  lanra  thank you for returning my call .  i think we need to talk .         i couldn   t agree more .  in person .         that would be best .     she paused .     are you busy this evening .         i have no way of knowing yet .  what did you have in mind .         i   ve been invited to an embassy dinner this evening .  i have the option of bringing a guest of my choosing .  would you be interested .         at your embassy .         the auroran embassy  yes .       coren hesitated .  this sounded like a complete waste of time  but he had no other ideas past talking to damik .     um .  .  .         there will be other terrans present  mr .  lanra  it isn   t that sort of dinner .  i believe it could be very interesting .  even informative .  it would be a favor to me if you   d agree .         will ambassador chassik be there .         yes .  why do you ask .         something i stumbled on today .  i suppose this will be formal .         of course .         i have an errand to run up in the baltimor district .  i   m not sure how long that will take and i   ll have to change before i meet you .         we have an excellent tailor on the premises  mr .  lanra .         two  three hours then .      a pause .     i can make that work .  there will be an escort in the main lobby to bring you to my apartment .         then i   ll see you later this evening .          thank you .       the link broke .  dinner with the enemy .  he mused .  he laughed softly to himself as he headed for a commuter station .     brun damik   s apartment was on the fourth level of an expensive block in what had once been an exclusive warren .  though other parts of the urban complex now superseded it as the place to live  it still bespoke class and elegance  and far more credit than damik ought to possess .   police lounged in the corridor .  coren felt a sudden hollowness .  one of the officers approached him  hand on the butt of her department issue stunner  and coren automatically held up his id with the investigator   s license appended .      inspector capel is in charge  mr .  lanra     she said  gesturing through the door .   the living room contained little furniture  but all of it looked expensive .  coren glimpsed the label on the entertainment array and quickly calculated the significant fraction of his annual income the system would have eaten .  forensic recorders drifted slowly over the stone tile floor .  a huddle of plainclothes police stood with their backs to a wall length image of black  white  gray  and ivory blocks of various proportions that gradually exchanged places .  the detectives stopped talking when coren approached .      coren lanra     he said  showing his id again .     i   m looking for inspector capel .      one of the men took his id and examined it casually .  he was slightly shorter than coren  grayish hair a fine dusting across his broad skull .  his eyes were a bright  almost artificial green .     private security     he said  handing it back .     do you have business here .         i   m not sure yet .  i   m an acquaintance of brun damik .      the inspector blinked twice  then nodded .     come with me     he said .     i   m capel .      he led coren to damik   s bedroom .  coren surveyed it quickly  noting the pair of uniformed police going through the wall length closet and the bank of drawers .  the bed was enormous  cobalt blue sheets rumpled .  coren saw no sign of blood .      in here     capel said  continuing on to the bathroom .   damik sat propped on the toilet  hands dangling .  coren stared  shocked at the condition of the body .  bruises covered most of damik   s torso and thighs  his eyes were swollen shut  lips black and inflated .  the head sat at an odd angle and coren noticed the thick line of purpling around the neck .  the only blood came from the holes where damik   s ears had been attached .      they   re in the sink     capel said  guessing coren   s question .     these apartments are completely soundproofed .  surveillance shows no one entering or leaving .  before or after brun damik came home last night .  preliminaries indicate that sixty to seventy percent of his bones are broken  the spine is holding him up  if you   re wondering  and several major organs are ruptured .     capel wheeled on him .     your card says special service  so i   m not even going to try to be clever with you .  let me ask right out  what are you doing here .      coren closed his eyes .  he had never grown the callouses other veterans claimed came after seeing enough dead bodies  but the nausea he once experienced no longer reached the point of muddling his thinking .  the hollowness he felt upon seeing police here acquired a sour tang  and his conscience suggested that this was his fault for having visited damik recently .  he drew a deep breath .      my employer is running for office     he said .     rega looms .  i   m following up possible embarrassments .      capel nodded as if coren had just passed a test .     what could brun damik have done to embarrass rega looms .         nothing  directly .         but .  .  .  .         but .  .  .     coren glanced over his shoulder as to make sure he and capel were out of earshot .  he stepped closer .     looms    daughter has been known to play at smuggling from time to time .         baleys .  we know .  so you   re covering for him by trying to find his daughter .     capel pursed his lips .     could this be the result of your investigation .         i honestly can   t see how .      capel stepped closer to damik   s body .     he was tortured .  somebody did this over a four  or five hour period .     he looked up .     how well did you know him .         we worked together in special service several years ago .  he was competent .  his tastes ran a little rich  though .          rich enough to accept perks .      coren made an inclusive gesture  indicating the opulence of the apartment .  capel grunted  agreeing .      was he supposed to have some information for you .         i don   t know .  i spoke to him yesterday .  he wasn   t very helpful .  i was coming back to try again .         somebody beat you to it .     capel sighed .     i don   t expect to get everything you might be able to tell me  mr .  lanra  and i don   t doubt you have a very good attorney  working for rega looms  so i won   t even think about detaining you .  i   m going to rely on your integrity as a former cop to tell me what i need to know .  i   m not naive enough to believe i   m even going to get that  so we   ll pretend for the moment that we   re actually working on the same side and that you wouldn   t obstruct my investigation .         believe me  inspector  i don   t have a clue who did this .  or why .       capel nodded .     it is excessive  especially for baleys .  but who knows .  this is politics  right .  maybe someone knows something about looms    daughter that could hurt him .     he shrugged .     it   s a stretch .  but all the other ideas i have don   t explain this any better .  some sadistic shit tortured this man .  that transcends jealousy  crime of passion  payback on a bad debt .  nothing explains it .  not even politics  really  unless he knew something .         torture is not a very reliable way of getting useful information .          that   s true .  so we   re left with revenge or someone sending a message .          a message .         the question is  from whom to who .  and why .  does rega looms know brun damik .         i seriously doubt it .          and i doubt rega looms knows the particulars of your work right now .  he   s busy campaigning .         correct .         so could this be a message for you .      coren studied damik   s corpse .  if this was a message  it failed .  graphic  certainly  but the intent was buried in the bruises .      if it is     he said     i can   t interpret it .  there is a third possibility .         yes .         pleasure .  someone enjoyed doing this .      capel shuddered .     i do not even want to consider that .  not yet  hopefully  not ever .      coren understood .  a truly sick mind was one of the most difficult to track down  and when caught  it was difficult to know what to do next .  but he agreed with capel  this was a message .      may i look around .     coren asked .   capel stared silently at damik for a long moment  till coren thought he had not heard .  then     sure .  you know better than to touch anything and so forth .          thank you .       he backed out of the bathroom and looked across the bedroom at the police still riffling through the immense closet .  not sure where to begin  coren walked around the bed and immediately touched something .   the sheets were expensive .  imports  coren guessed .  damik would have been in an ideal position to help himself to whatever black market goods came through .  who would challenge him  especially if he was reasonably careful and not too greedy .  he was not selling anything  as far as coren knew .  if he had been  he would have been living in a private enclave  with better security .  no  damik was not that corrupt .  it had been clear even in special service that damik was interested only in personal comfort  not the extra work illicit business would bring .  he was a taker  not a dealer .  it did not appear to coren that he could have affected anybody   s bottom line .  not enough to warrant an assassination .   coren tugged the sheets down .  stained .  sweat .  the coloration was wrong for anything else .  still  the possibility that someone had been in bed with him was not unreasonable .  what had he said about his contacts .      a woman named tresha and a man named gamelin .  i assume he   s just muscle  he   s big enough .      coren thought back to his last visit to jeta fromm   s hab  and the fact that a man and woman had come to see her  but she had already left .  what was the chronology .  a day .  two days .  things had happened so fast .  the warren rat had said the man was big  something wrong with him .  the same pair .   he wondered then if the woman who   d acted as his data troll had even been jeta fromm .  perhaps he   d been dealing with this    tresha     all along .  .  .   the sheets were skewed in the direction of the bathroom  but that did not necessarily mean damik had been dragged .  coren left the bedroom and almost stepped on a forensic recorder .  the compact  turtle shelled unit continued on  oblivious to coren   s presence  looking for the minutiae that might provide a clue  hairs  skin  fibers  fluids .   coren stopped before the large picture and watched the rectangles drift before and behind each other .  it was a very expensive piece  auroran  coren thought  and he wondered if it were an import as well .  he turned away after a few minutes and did a slow circuit of the living room .   a low table made from a sheet of thinly sliced granite stood between facing setees .  one glass stood in a drying pool of condensation  ice melted at the bottom .   one glass .   no clothes in the living room .   he entered the kitchen .  four glasses stood on the counter by the sink  all empty .   the place had been cleaned  he realized .  while damik had been tortured  four or five hours    worth  according to capel  someone had gone through the apartment and tidied up .   damik   s office showed a little more disorder  but none of it appeared significant .  a few papers scattered on the desk  disks stacked sloppily  a jacket draped over a chair back .   a few plaques decorated one wall .  coren smiled  seeing the special service certificate  and  beside it  a merit award for bravery .  he did not recall the action  but he could look it up .   damik had gone to university  nestern in the freno district  and graduated with a degree in art history .  coren grunted  surprised .  he would never have guessed .   the frame rested crookedly on the wall .  coren brought a fingertip against the lower left comer and pushed up to straighten it .  the hook on which it hung came loose and the entire plaque clattered to the floor .   it burst apart  frame  cover sheet  hook  and documents  and sprawled across coren   s feet .  damik had used the same display to hold several items  one atop the other .  coren knelt quickly .  he counted half a dozen certificates  which must have strained the capacity of the frame  stuffed past its meager limits .  coren gathered them up .   more graduation certificates .  damik had taken courses in a number of unrelated fields  cooking  the history of paleoanthropology  astronomy  microcircuit repair .  all them unexpected and  in their diversity  admirable .   coren stopped at the last document .  damik   s grammar school certificate  from the holmer foster gymnas cooperative .   brun was an orphan .  .  .  .   something else about the name of the facility seemed familiar .  later  he decided  he could look it up later .  he folded the certificate and tucked it into an inside pocket  then reassembled the frame .  he found the hook and pressed it back into the wall and carefully set the display on it  which then listed crookedly to the left .   capel waited in the living room .      anything .     he asked .      nothing obvious .  you realize that the place was sanitized .       capel scowled .     they had time .  where can i reach you if i need to ask further questions .      coren fished out a card and handed it to capel .      so have you found nyom looms yet .     capel asked .      i   m still looking     coren said smoothly .   capel nodded again .     we   ll be in touch .         even if you don   t need me  let me know  would you .  damik and i did work together once .      capel seemed to soften a little .     sure .         by the way  did he have any relatives .     it seemed likely that damik would have been adopted  but coren never heard him talk about anyone .  that omission now acquired significance .      i was going to ask you that .  none we   ve found .  he had a broker .  we   ll be talking to him .         hm .  too bad .      coren left .  he checked his watch .  he had less than forty minutes to get to the auroran embassy .  too little time  really  to sort out his thoughts  much less his feelings .   brun damik was an orphan .  .  .   he pulled out his comm .     desk  connect to the public records of the holmer foster gymnas cooperative .  alumni .      while he waited  coren teased at the reasons damik had been killed .  because of coren   s visit .  so soon .  that implied a surveillance network of remarkable scope .  had damik called someone  given himself away  or was this an unrelated matter .      connection complete     his desk said .      access records for damik  brun .         located .         list of kin or other relations .         parents  evlin mores and rolsin dynik  recorded as deceased .  institutional guardianship until age eleven .       mores and dynik .  .  . sound familiar .  .  . coren could not remember .     then what .         elective sponsorship .     .         name of sponsor .      under security lock .         hack it .  i want that name .         working .      damik   s parents seemed so familiar  as if he had met them or seen their names  the list of people in wenithal   s investigation .   he needed to check it again and verify  but now that he remembered he was sure .      finished     his desk reported .     sponsor listed as wenithal  ree  agent with eurosector police .           fourteen    a  dinner .     derec shook his head at the image on the comm screen .  ariel returned his cynical look .     i don   t get this     he continued .     two days ago we were all but persona non grata and now setaris is inviting you to embassy soirees .         it gets better     ariel said .      jonis will be there .         taprin .  .  . it occurs to me that you   re being used here .         really .     ariel intoned with mock dismay .     i asked lanra to be my guest .  one good surprise is worth another .         do you trust him .         of course not .  he hasn   t told us half of what he   s looking into .         fair is fair .  we aren   t telling him everything  either .      ariel shrugged .     do you want to take odds on whether the two lines of inquiry intersect .         i   m not sure i want them to .         well .  .  . lanra asked me if chassik would be there tonight .  i asked him why  and he said it was something he stumbled on .         chassik .  what could he possibly want with chassik .         i have some opinions .  did you know that solaria owns nova levis .         that hasn   t come out in the newsnets .         no  and it may not .  they owned it before it was nova levis  when it was no more than a solaria mining franchise called cassus thole .  the colony  a settler colony  is a lease agreement that was originally set up between solaria and the church of organic sapiens .      derec started .     looms    church .         the same  only back before they were so rabidly antispace .  now  just to heap coincidence upon coincidence  gale chassik was one of the initial investors in a biomed research lab called  are you ready .   nova levis  which was closed after having been investigated for infant brokering .      derec whistled .     convergence is imminent .         so it seems .  how   s it coming with the robot .      derec glanced across the small workspace at rana .  she stared  rapt  at the banks of screens  calibrating the myriad details of thales    link to facilitate a precise excavation .  the robot itself remained where it had been left  on its pallet  now connected to thales and rana   s console via several heavy cables .      i   d say another half hour  we   ll have the interface running at an acceptable level     he said .  a small icon in the upper left corner of the comm screen revealed thales    presence in the exchange  monitoring security and running an encryption routine .  ariel saw the same icon on her end  otherwise she would never speak so freely on a commline .      speaking of things robotic     derec said     the director here is a man named rotij polifos .  do you know anything about him .         no .  should i .         he   s been director for seven years .  i was just thinking   it   s kind of unusual for an auroran to stay in a terran posting like this for that long .  don   t they usually rotate out more regularly .         usually .  maybe he likes it .      derec frowned .     maybe .          is there a problem .         no  i just .  .  . it seems odd  that   s all .         have hofton look into it .  keep your mind on the robot  derec .          right  right .  you know  lanra wants us to prove a robot committed the murders .  there   s no way  ariel .  not this one  anyway .  it   s just a standard dw    with a few added modules  nothing i don   t recognize  and it   s showing a nearly textbook collapse pattern .  it couldn   t even have made the crack in the cargo bin  not without some tools .         oh  i don   t doubt the robot you have is innocent .  what i   m wondering is  why didn   t the robot prevent the deaths .  if a second robot had been involved  as unlikely as it sounds  this one should have intervened .  has sipha palen told you much yet .         no .  she wants us to run the excavation without any preconceptions .  i can understand that .         get it done asap .  i want to move this to the next level .      derec raised an eyebrow .     what next level .         i   m sending you a packet to go over in private     ariel replied .     about nova levis .  very interesting reading .         the colony  or the lab you mentioned .         both .  the list of shareholders in the lab is intriguing all by itself .  chassik isn   t the only surprise .     she looked away for a few seconds .  packet received appeared along the bottom of derec   s screen .      got it     he said .     be careful tonight  ariel .  we don   t want to be deported for bad taste .      ariel   s eyes widened in mock surprise .     derec  please .  i .  bad taste .      derec smiled .     forgive me .  i do know better .      she grinned .     have fun .      the screen went blank then  except for thales    icon and the notice of the data packet .  derec plugged his personal datum into the board .      download the packet for me  thales     he said .     i   ll look at it later .         i would recommend sooner     thales said .     i compiled the raw data .  it may be more relevant than you might think .             keep your mind on the robot     ariel said .  i   ll add it to the list  thanks .       lights winked on the datum   s pad .  he scooted his chair over by rana .  she worked with confidence  clearly in control  comfortable in her expertise .  better than derec remembered  and he remembered her as being very good .      i suppose     rana said slowly     that it   s occurred to you that you   re both being used .         you think so .         you   re being set up to take blame .         that would be consistent .         then why are you going along with it .         it   s a question of being deported now or later .  the longer we put it off  the more chance there is to avoid it completely .         you don   t believe that  do you .         shouldn   t i .     she shrugged .     i suppose you   re thinking that you might find something in this mess      she waved at the screens      that will make you so valuable to someone that they   ll intercede on your behalf and restore you to former glory .         something like that .      rana shook her head .     i can   t imagine why .  all i want to do is get away from this planet  and all you want to do is stay .     she turned to look at him .     why .         we   ve been over this before     derec said uncomfortably .      yes we have .  and you   ve never given me an answer .  excuses  reasons  justifications  but not an answer .     rana glanced toward the curtain that isolated them from the rest of the lab .     this planet has treated you pretty badly .  hell  it   s treated me badly and i was born here  you weren   t .  i grew up on earth and i have no place here .  i   m leaving first chance i get  to go somewhere i might be appreciated .         aurora is just as bad in different ways .         but it   s not personal the way it is here .         who told you that .         my co workers  for one .  after they got over the idea of a terran who understood positronics  they treated me as an equal .       derec shook his head .     no .  you just haven   t learned to read the signs .      rana cut the air with her hand .     stop .  it is different because i have skills they value .  maybe it will be only more of the same in a new way  but for now it feels like respect .  i already know what i don   t have on earth .          so what is your question .         why are you so set on trying to stay here .         you think there   s one answer .         no  but there   s usually one thing that validates all the rest .      derec stared at her  mind suddenly blank .     i never thought about it that way before     he heard himself say .  he no longer looked at rana  but at a point just past her right shoulder  as if waiting for something to resolve in the air behind her .      i don   t need an answer now  boss     rana said .  he refocussed on her .      um .  .  .         and i can manage this     she said  turning back to the console .   conversation abruptly terminated  derec went over to the gurney  annoyed and impressed by rana .   beyond the fabric curtain he could hear the other lab workers moving and speaking in low tones .  he leaned on the edge of the pallet and gazed down the length of the robot .      so where did you come from .     he muttered .   the torso showed age and use .  scratches gave the impression of a complicated urban map etched in bronze .  the metal gleamed dully through patches of tarnish and encrusted grime .  plates covered linkages thirty centimeters below its arms that allowed extra limbs to be connected .  the arms themselves  three jointed and thick  ended in finely articulated six digit hands .  the legs depended from a rotating platform beneath the torso shell .  derec noted more removable coverplates on the platform hiding assemblies to which secondary legs or support braces or tractor modules or one of several other modifications could be fitted .  the dw    was a large robot  two and a half meters tall  designed for a multiplicity of heavy tasks in conjunction with human workers  very adaptable  with an advanced positronic brain that allowed for considerable independence and problem solving capacity .   vaguely humaniform  the head was little more than a protective helmet curving over the intricate sensor array behind the mesh covered eyes .  a complex architecture of connections rose out of the torso and joined the brain that lay within the chest cavity to the communications and sensory apparatus beneath the headcap .  the normally thick column had been modified by the addition of accessory modules and cables .  normally  the    neck    would be covered by a smooth carapace  but the extra components jutted out like synthetic goiters  requiring a specially fitted casement no one had bothered to acquire .   derec frowned at the overall dirty appearance .  this robot had been worked hard for a long time .  hiding it  as would be necessary on earth  probably prevented the owner from caring for it as thoroughly as needed  but he would have expected palen   s forensics people to clean it up in the course of their inspection .   but no thorough examination had been made .   derec started going over it more carefully .   he felt beneath the headcap for the release and flipped the cover off  revealing the strutwork that caged the components .  he took a rag and small bottle of solvent from the workbench and lightly cleaned off grime from the smooth surfaces until he found the serial number .  he jotted it down and went to the comm  where he fed it to thales to be encrypted and sent to ariel .   derec made note of each component he recognized within the head .  optical and aural receptors and translators  uv and infrared telemetric assemblers  gas traps linked to interferometers  location and attitude modules  nothing unexpected .  he wanted to turn it over to get inside the torso shell  but not till thales finished the excavation .   on its right side  below the accessory limb coverplate  new metal shone brighter than the surrounding surface .  a fifteen centimeter square area had been replaced  the weld itself invisible but for the age difference in the material .  derec went over the rest of the body for signs of recent damage  but found none .   he tried to imagine its last minutes .  a chamber full of humans died around it .  what would its reaction have been .  derec tapped his finger arrhythmic ally on the pallet .   one human had been assaulted  nyom looms had suffered a broken neck .  and this robot had failed to protect her from an alleged second robot .   which had now disappeared .   ridiculous .   derec turned over first one robotic hand  then the other .   a dark substance filled the joints of three fingers  palm side  of the right hand .  derec tried to flex them open but the segments were too tight .  he found a small flathead screwdriver among the tools on the workbench .  he slid a sheet of paper beneath the hand  then pried one of the segments open and dug at the matter embedded within the joint .  flakes fell to the paper .   he looked around their workstation .  no magnifier .  derec carefully brushed the recovered material into a small dish  clapped a lid on it  and stepped from behind the blind .   three technicians worked at two stations across the chamber .  derec spotted the equipment he needed against the wall to his left  midway between the curtain and the techs .  he strode across the lab as if he did so every day and sat down at the console .   within seconds  he had the magnifier powered up and the dish in the drawer of the observation platform .  he keyed for a relatively low magnification     x  and let the machine perform .   the screen showed him three distinct substances  two clearly artificial  one crystalline and the other fibrous .  the third was blood .   he tapped a command to separate out the three materials and deposit them in separate dishes .  a few seconds later  a different drawer in the platform slid out bearing three dishes .  derec pocketed the one containing the blood and reinserted the one with the crystalline material .      may i help you  sir .      derec looked around at a young female technician standing anxiously behind him .      no  i have what i need .  thank you .         um .  .  .         it   s all right  i   ll clear it with your director .         did you find something .     another tech asked  suddenly leaning past the first and gazing at the image on the screen .   derec switched it off .  the man frowned .      i   m fine     derec said .     if i need help  i   ll ask .      the man met derec   s gaze coldly  without the scowl of offended dignity and violated territoriality derec expected .  derec sensed that it would be a mistake to look away  to yield at all to this one .  he would lose his samples and the presumed privileges he had just accorded himself  access to any and all parts of the lab .      i am qualified to ask for help     derec said .     i   ve had years of practice .      the tech smiled thinly .     of course  sir .  sorry to bother you .      the first technician watched her coworker retreat .      where   s the infirmary .     derec asked .  his legs trembled slightly .      next level     she replied  pointing downward .      thank you .     he removed the sample tray from the magnifier and wiped the machine   s log .     i want one of these in our area when i return .         yes  sir     she said uncertainly .      it is authorized .      he stepped closer to her and lowered his voice .     it wouldn   t do anyone any good for me to take this to director polifos .  would it .         no  sir .  no .     she glanced in the direction of the other tech .      don   t worry about him     derec said .     he   s an amateur .      she gave him a surprised smile .     yes  sir .  i   ll see to procuring you a magnifier .      samples in his pocket  derec walked out of the lab  feeling the male tech    s eyes on him all the way to the door .  he wondered what internal politics he had just upset and how  if at all  it applied to him .     an elderly auroran named greler attended the infirmary .  after a brief exchange of names  greler amiably ran a complete scan of the blood samples and handed a disk to derec along with his sample .      apologies for being unable to run the match for you     greler said .     this sort of thing must go through kopernik medical .  you can take it to them and have it done .         thanks .       derec returned to the positronics lab .   he walked in to find two more techs sitting with the first pair .  all of them fell silent when they saw him and watched as he crossed the floor to the curtained station .  derec felt a prickle up the back of his neck .   hofton waited with rana  along with rotij polifos and yart leri .   polifos wore a pinched expression .  ambassador leri looked concerned .  hofton and rana seemed mildly puzzled .      mr .  avery      leri began .      i would appreciate     polifos cut in immediately     that any and all requests for equipment or special analyses be made through me .  this is my lab .      derec did not respond .  polifos looked frustrated .  when he finally broke eye contact  derec looked at leri .      i was under the impression that we had your full cooperation .         of course     leri said  glaring briefly at polifos .     i apologize for any misunderstandings  but we are answerable to ambassador setaris and  through her  aurora itself .  we   re used to a more regular set of procedures .       polifos blinked in amazement at leri .     i should have been told what this was all about .  i am responsible to the calvin institute and the positronics commission  directly  and any and all matters concerning robots and other positronic entities within and involving this facility are my responsibility .  i   m required to report  oversee  and voucher all activities          you don   t have to quote the code to me     leri snapped .     this is  i repeat  an unusual circumstance          i have this authority precisely for unusual circumstances .  all due respect to mr .  avery  he is not the only roboticist on earth  and unless i have a very good reason to relinquish my responsibilities  i cannot allow him to simply take over          no one is taking over     leri said .      stop interrupting me .         stop jumping to conclusions .  you didn   t know about this because i didn   t know .  i didn   t know because ambassador setaris told me i wouldn   t know .  she has asked for the utmost discretion  and i will not tolerate petty fits of temper over personal slights .         i can   t cooperate with mr .  avery unless i know what he   s doing     polifos said .      i agree      hofton said .     can   t expect useful cooperation from ignorance .          perhaps i was remiss     leri admitted .     but i was told that your work was highly confidential and that a minimum of interference was in order .         misunderstandings are easy under these circumstances     derec said .     evidently  i was misinformed about protocol myself .       leri looked sheepish .     i  uh .  .  .         director polifos and i can work this out  i   m sure     derec said .      well .     leri gave polifos one last glare .   polifos did not look away this time .     i do not want palen   s goons tramping through here as if it were their office and we were criminals .          under the circumstances  we don   t have much choice     leri snapped .     now  straighten all this out with mr .  avery .  i   m too busy to do arbitration over bruised egos .     he looked at derec .     i   m sorry for the inconvenience  mr .  avery .  if you have any more trouble .  .  .      he stormed off .  huddled techs watched him leave .   derec turned to polifos .     chief palen .         one of our staff was arrested     polifos said .     nothing unusual in that  the man in question has a history of running afoul with palen .         doesn   t sound like someone you   d want to keep on staff     hofton observed .      we have personnel shortages     polifos said .  he seemed distracted .     but even so  i   ve tried to get this one rotated back to aurora and it simply doesn   t happen .     he shook his head impatiently .     that isn   t the real problem .  what is the problem is her people have been in and out of my lab since yesterday  questioning my staff .  then you show up  and the next thing i see is palen herself with your man hofton here bringing in a robot of which i had no knowledge .  i can   t help but think that it   s all connected .  your presence has changed our relationship with palen  and not for the better .      derec exchanged a look with hofton .     i   m afraid i don   t know anything about       polifos cut him off .     no  i don   t imagine you do  nor would you even if you did .  one of her police appears in the doorway  points  and expects to be followed .  our arrangement with the terran authorities here is peculiar to say the least  we were all required to concede that palen is in charge of all security throughout the station .  makes sense  i suppose  but          we were informed about none of this     hofton said .     when was the arrest made .      rana frowned at hofton but said nothing .      shortly before you arrived     rotij said .     naturally we   re nervous .          what are the charges .     hofton asked .      disorderly conduct .  but palen   s been questioning my people about smuggling .      polifos snorted in disbelief .     smuggling .  why would an auroran engage in smuggling .      derec looked across the lab and recognized the tense look in the eyes of the staff .   derec stepped close to polifos .     i want that equipment  director .  soon as possible .  the quicker we get done here  the sooner we   ll be out of your lab and away from your people .  but we want the equipment here .  i don   t want any more confusion over who   s responsible for what .         no  we don   t     polifos answered sharply .     all right .     he stepped around the blind .     hovis .      derec looked at hofton .     what   s this about .         you stepped on toes in your walk across hallowed ground     hofton said .     someone complained .  the accusation that we   re plants from palen materialized .  there   s a rather ugly atmosphere here .  also     he lowered his voice     i   m sorry i didn   t get a chance to tell you earlier .  i tried to look into director polifos   s record .  this posting and credentials from the calvin institute were all i could find .  there   s a security block on records older than kopernik .         terran security .         no  sir .  auroran .      derec stared at hofton  for a moment uncomprehending .  then he shook his head .     we   d better proceed on the assumption that we have even less time than we started with .     he showed the disk to hofton .     i had the blood sample screened and typed .         blood sample .     hofton asked .      the robot   s hand .  i found material in the finger joints .  some of it is blood .  the rest i   ll look at when i get the proper equipment .         blood .  wonderful .  that should help exonerate the robot .      derec slipped the disk into the comm console .     we   re going to need a complete autopsy report on all the victims  i think .  and i want to look at that cargo bin .  in person  not on a screen .         i   ll see what i can do     hofton said .      one way or the other  we need to see for ourselves .         i understand .       derec turned to address his ri .     thales  i   m sending a blood screen .  i want you to run a match through all available databases .         yes  derec .  that may take some time .         i can wait .      he pressed send and turned to rana .     how   s the link .         established .  thales is beginning the first level excavation now .  i   ve set up buffers to receive intact memory nodes as they   re found and retrieved .  we should be able to view them in isolation .         good  good .     derec went to the edge of the blind and watched a pair of technicians setting up a magnifier on a cart .     i want a complete scan for eyes and ears on all this equipment .  have thales do one on the lab itself .         all of it .     rana asked .      every bit .         derec     thales said     i have a consanguinity match .         already .         given the probable source of the sample  i began with the most obvious .  i am continuing through the rest of the databases on the chance of finding an exact match .          all right  what do you have .         there is a     match to nyom looms .          so .  .  . it   s her blood .         no .  i can display the details  but the distinction is clear .  this sample came from a male .         her father  perhaps .     rana suggested .      no  rana .  even given the unlikelihood that rega looms would permit a robot close enough to him to touch  i ran the same match against his genome and it remains only a close match  not identical .  the markers i used to verify distinctions number two hundred eighteen .  there is no significant margin for error .  the sample belongs to a male relative of both rega and nyom looms  probably a son and brother .         son .  .  .     derec mused .     looms never had a son .         the record would so substantiate .  however  there are always possible oversights .            oversights        hofton said .     interesting way to put it .  have you typed the sample against looms    wife .         yes .  the same degree of consanguinity .  the logical implication is that nyom looms had a brother .  however  no record of such a relative is forthcoming .         can you determine age  thales .     derec asked .      that is proving difficult  derec .  normally there are mutations over time in the chemistry and base dna .  proteins provide a reliable clock .  but this sample shows an incongruity of results .  certain proteins suggest an age of twenty nine  others an age of ten .         rehab treatments .     hofton suggested .      the requisite chemical signatures of all known rejuvenation or rehabilitation protocols are absent .  this does not preclude that one or more have not been employed that are unknown  but i cannot consequently give you an accurate estimate of age .          send this data to ariel  thales     derec said .     continue your search for an exact match .  add the databases of all rejuvenation clinics extending back a period of  oh  thirty five years  and see if anything turns up .          yes  derec .         nyom had a brother she didn   t know about .     hofton said .     amazing .  imagine that  from a man like looms .         call palen     derec said .     we need to see those bodies and all the autopsy reports .      he stared across the lab  watching the personnel  and realized after a moment that he was looking for something that did not fit .     thales  ask ariel to run a background on rotij polifos .           fifteen  y  ou   re late .      ariel nodded curtly to coren   s escort  who bowed formally and left .  ariel stood to one side  waving coren in .      your tailor took his time     coren said  entering the apartment .   ariel burgess wore a gown of graphite gray material that contained motes of color which sparkled delicately .  the cut had no sharp edges and  rather than encase her body  seemed to travel along with her .  coren kept expecting to see thigh or hip or breast or belly through the mist  but  though the fabric covered her reluctantly  it never failed to hide .   she wore no jewelry .  her black hair was braided thickly into a helix laced with silver  blue  and gold ribbons .  she appeared to be barefoot .  coren could not stop watching her  thoroughly caught by what he saw .      no matter     she said .     fashionably late is better than being too early .  have you ever been to one of these before .         no     coren said .     rega has never been invited .      she frowned .     oh  i doubt that .  setaris is always trying to persuade detractors to come see for themselves .     she shrugged  then gave him an open appraisal .  she nodded .     that will do .      coren bristled briefly at the inspection .  the auroran tailor complained that he was unused to working for terrans because they were so short and thick  all the while his lasers measured him and his robot did the cutting .  the suit  a midnight blue formal affair  fit beautifully  coren enjoyed fine clothes  especially new ones  and he had never owned an auroran outfit before .  the sleeves seemed a bit too loose  but nothing was too tight  and after the trip from the tailor   s to ariel   s apartment it felt as natural as skin .   then he felt foolish for resenting her .  he had been studying her  after all .      i   m glad i meet your standards      he said .   she cocked an eyebrow .     for tonight  at least .     she crossed the room to a comm console  dragging his gaze with her .  she retrieved a disk and brought it to him .     take this now  just in case .         what is it .         the subject of our evening   s discussion .  but later .  we have to go .       in the corridor  she frowned .     how well do you handle the open .         as in .  .  .  .         unroofed space  free air  stars in the sky .         i can manage well enough .      ariel looked dubious .  they reached a wide area lined with elevator doors .  she tapped a code into one .      well     she said     if it becomes too much  there are plenty of enclosed spaces in setaris   s residence .      the door opened on a comfortable car with a plush bench mounted in a semicircle .  coren barely felt it begin to move and after a few moments there was no discernable motion .   ariel slid briefly against him  thighs touching .  his nostrils filled with a subdued odor and he became instantly affected by her presence .      all right  we have a minute     ariel said .     do you have any questions about protocol .  have you been to any spacer functions .      coren set aside his growing distraction .     um .  .  . when i worked for special service  there were occasions  but i   ve never been a guest .       ariel nodded .     i have no idea yet what the occasion for this dinner is  but i have no doubt several guests will be recording it .  this will be a working dinner  so business will be done .  not openly  not blatantly  but arrangements will be made .  there   s a hierarchy which you   ll pick up on as the evening progresses .  who sits where at the table  who is served what kind of drink  even who gets to go home for the evening with whom  all this is a matter of protocol and negotiation .  don   t argue with anyone .  prod  suggest  imply  insinuate  that   s not only allowable but expected .  anything but an open disagreement .  follow my lead .         anyone i should be particularly wary of .         gale chassik  the solarian ambassador .  he has allies who mayor may not be sifting for information for him .  the keresians  for one .          gale chassik .  .  . i   ve come across that name recently .         so have i .  he   s involved in nova levis .         uh huh .         both of them  i believe .  the colony and the lab .      coren blinked at her .     the lab .         it   s in the disk     ariel said  smiling .     i   ve been doing a little homework .  anyway  one other you should know about .  jonis taprin will be there .         senator taprin .     coren frowned .     that could be awkward .         don   t worry about him using your presence there against looms .  terrans will resign office before admitting to petitioning spacers .  he sees you there  he   ll be more worried that you   ll use it .  if you do  then he   ll retaliate  but in my experience it   s automatic detente .         why is taprin going to be there .      ariel smirked .     looking for favors  sifting for data .  even the most rabidly anti spacer politician  if he or she is at all intelligent  knows that earth can   t do without us .  the trade with the settler colonies is too important to risk losing our shipping fleets as subcontractors .  besides  there   s the implicit threat of blockade .  earth also isn   t out there with the settlers  we are .  if there   s to be any kind of control          there are terran fleets     coren interrupted .     we aren   t all cloistered agoraphobics .         compared to the fifty worlds  earth   s presence is a token .  you can blockade one world  maybe two  cause enough damage to upset the balance of power  but .  .  .     she let it hang like that .  then     in any case  exercise discretion and say nothing about baleys .  that   s nothing but a sore point among all of us .  if it comes up  i   ll deal with it .         why did you ask me here .         efficiency .  setaris is playing a game and i don   t know what it is yet .  i haven   t exactly been in favor this last year .  now all of a sudden i   m being asked to embassy fetes again .  you    ii act as a wild card in the game .  accompanying me will suggest a lot to them .          and explain nothing .         exactly .  then afterward we can talk about our  we   re here .      coren had not noticed the car slowing .  the door slid aside and let them out in a wide arcade .   the air smelled different .  coren slowed as he neared the edge of the overhang  sensing the change before he saw anything .   through a dimly seen parkland with slim trees and thick grass  light came from the residence  warmly tracing the outlines of the intervening flora .  the sounds of conversation  occasional laughter  and the nearly overwhelming rhythm of music drifted  muted  toward him .   he forced his hands to unclench and stepped from beneath the shelter .       a breeze brushed his face .   he took a dozen steps and looked up .   stars salted the night sky  and for an instant he caught his breath .  they seemed so close that they formed a roof as solid as the urban shell beneath which he had lived all his life .  far more beautiful  though  and he understood why people wanted them  wanted to go to them  even why they wanted to see this same view from other worlds .  there was certainly nothing to fear .   between one step and the next  leaves fluttered in the comer of his vision and his perspective changed .  abruptly all of above became an infinity into which he felt he might fall .   coren jerked his gaze to the ground  shuddered briefly  and made himself look only at the light ahead .  ariel had stopped halfway across the grass  waiting for him .  he walked stolidly toward the party  pleased that he had not reclenched his fists .  ariel smoothly took his arm  and they continued on together .  he touched his face  and his fingers came away dry .   good .  he stepped from grass to flagstone .  he risked one more quick glimpse skyward .  the light around him occluded the view of stars and he relaxed .   he blinked at the startlingly clothed people .   the styles ranged from strips and patches of fabric that barely covered  and often intentionally failed to cover  to blousy  opaque suits that seemed large enough for two people .  the dance of color  shift of cloth and skin  the moil of distinct tastes from several cultures somehow blent into a single attribute  spacer .   even the terrans dressed in one or another spacer fashion  though they still stuck out .  coren thought he knew why  terrans dressed for personal status while spacers dressed purely for personal taste .  on a spacer  the quality and expense of the clothing said nothing of their place in the hierarchy  which kept terrans continually unable to rank them on sight  something terrans did among themselves habitually .      coren .      he followed his name and found ariel looking at him .  she stood with three people  two spacers  the other terran .  he recognized the terran .      coren     ariel said  taking his arm     may i introduce ambassador sen setaris of aurora .      coren bowed slightly and setaris returned it .  she was spacer tall and austerely attractive  her hair glowing white around a seamless face .  she could be fifty  or one hundred and fifty for all that coren could tell .      welcome  mr .  lanra     she said .     i trust you aren   t in any distress .         no  thank you .  i   m fine .         good .  make yourself comfortable  this is an informal gathering .  should you wish  my house is open .          i appreciate that  ambassador .         and this      ariel moved on     is ambassador gale chassik of solaria .       chassik looked very different from setaris .  heavier  dressed in the thick solarian manner  his head was nearly smooth .  he smiled broadly and the lines in his face were deep .  coren began to extend his hand  then remembered the solarian aversion to being touched .  he bowed again .      ambassador .         pleased  mr .  lanra .  it   s good to see ariel out of her shell again .  we   ve missed her .      ariel smiled .     i   ve missed you  as well .     she turned to the terran .     and this is senator jonis taprin of earth .         i recognize the senator  of course     coren said  extending his hand .     how do you do  sir .       taprin was pale and middle aged  lines in his forehead qualitatively different from those in chassik   s .  he was thin and nearly as tall as setaris .  he clasped coren    s hand .     this must be an unusual occasion for you  mr .  lanra .  i understood you worked for rega looms .          that   s true  sir .         what would he think of you consorting with spacers .     taprin grinned at chassik and setaris  including them in the joke .      no more than he would of you doing so  senator     coren said .   the spacers laughed softly .  coren noticed the quick resentment in taprin    s eyes  gone just as quickly .      honestly  though     coren said     i   m here at ambassador burgess   s invitation .  i   m currently on leave from mr .  looms    service .          isn   t that unusual .     chassik asked .     you are his chief of security  are you not .         i am .  but i have very capable people handling his day to day operations .  on the road as he is  i have to look after the home office .  but even i get a few days off from time to time .      more polite laughter .      enjoy yourself  mr .  lanra     setaris said .     if you   ll excuse ariel and me .  .  .  .   .      setaris took ariel   s arm and the two drifted off .      ambassador setaris sets a marvelous table     chassik said .     the buffet should not be missed .     he gestured toward a long table near the entrance to the house .      in that case     coren said     i should do the diplomatic thing and eat something .      taprin smiled .     stay away from the mauve buttons with the yellow cream sauce .  they sneak up on you at the most inconvenient times .      coren glanced back when he reached the long table filled with spacer delicacies .  taprin and chassik faced each other  talking intently .  he searched the crowd and spotted ariel and setaris  near the edge of the patio  also talking intently .   he surveyed the food arrayed down the length of the long table and saw almost nothing he recognized .  he located the buttons taprin had warned him about and  perversely  took one .  it possessed a faintly musty taste beneath a cinnamon sweet tang .  the sauce reminded him of buttered scallops .  nothing unfamiliar .      drink  sir .      he glimpsed a tray to his left containing several tall glasses .  he took one .      thanks .       the servor rolled away  then  and coren watched it  a robot shaped like a mobile table  moving deftly among the partiers .  he caught a glimpse of a few more spaced throughout the gathering .   the liquid in the glass shimmered golden and he wondered where it put him in the order of importance .  he sipped  tea with almond liqueur .  he popped the rest of the button in his mouth and washed it down .      i trust this isn   t going to become complicated .     taprin stood beside him .     complicated  senator .         you understand me  mr .  lanra .         i do .  i   m sure both of us understand the risks of unmanaged implication .      taprin winced .     just so we do .     he was not finished  though .  he fidgeted  sipped at his drink  and finally asked     have you and ariel known each other long .         we met last year .       taprin blinked  startled .     i wasn   t aware she   d been seeing anyone .  .  .         should you .      taprin frowned .      i   m sure  senator  whatever else gets discussed here tonight  ariel burgess   s personal relationships won   t be part of it .      taprin nodded .     excuse me .      coren watched him walk away  toward the house .  so much for being nonconfrontational .  .  .      do you think he can defeat your mr .  looms .      ambassador chassik stood beside him  also watching taprin retreat to the interior of setaris   s residence .      the election is still six weeks off     coren said .     anything can happen between now and then .          i know .  that   s always surprised me about you terrans .  given your temperament  one would think you   d find a less volatile way to choose your leaders .         for example .      chassik shrugged .     for example  on solaria the process is accomplished by a combination of appointment and annual assessment .  a vote of confidence keeps the appointed official in office .  too low a vote .  .  .     chassik drew a finger sharply across his own throat .  he grinned quickly .     politically speaking  of course .         who does the appointing .         there is a college of electors .  we never know who they are .         i see .  i think we   ll keep our volatility .      chassik laughed .      my question     he continued     is not academic  mr .  lanra .  should your employer defeat senator taprin  new arrangements must be made .  i would consider it a favor if you let mr .  looms know that solaria is open to a dialogue .          you do know rega   s position on earth spacer relations .      chassik nodded .     in spite of his public pronouncements  i   m sure he   s at base a reasonable man .         is senator taprin a reasonable man .         more than others  less than some .          when the time comes  i   ll pass that on     coren said .      thank you  mr .  lanra .         i would think  though  that you would tell him yourself .  you used to know him personally  didn   t you .      chassik   s eyes narrowed briefly .     i won   t insult your no doubt substantiated intelligence by denying it .  that was  however  a long time ago .         before you were ambassador  wasn   t it .         i was newly arrived on earth .  he was one of the few terrans who took any time to show me around .         i suppose it helped to be in business together .  i found that interesting .  it   s not very common these days  is it .         we were never    in business    together  mr .  lama .  you   re mistaken .          oh .  i apologize  perhaps i misunderstood .  you both owned shares in some of the same companies .       chassik shook his head .     even then  rega was not sanguine about mixing with spacers .  if we did have common investments  it was quite by accident .       coren nodded .     ah .  forgive me .  i was under the impression that he brought you in on a project .         what project might that have been .         something to do with prostheses  i believed .  i forget the name of the company .       chassik shrugged .     rega showed some interest in our medical technologies along those lines  but nothing ever came of it .  he found our procedures too invasive .  later on  his discomfort turned to fanaticism .  we haven   t spoken since he became head of that church of his .          which is why you   d like me to take your offer to him .         exactly  mr .  lama .  i  oh  ariel .  i was just discussing political systems with your friend .  the merits of terran populist mandates  as opposed to good old fashioned autocracy .         no meddling  gale     ariel said  stopping before them .      never .     chassik proclaimed with mock severity .     i   m so pleased to see you  ariel .  it   s about time setaris got over her snit and remembered your existence .         was it a snit .  i thought it was a well deserved vacation .  now i find i have to start working again .         if there   s anything i can do .  .  .         i think sen would be displeased if you helped me get another vacation .         you should come to work for us  ariel      chassik said .     we have a much more beneficent attitude toward sacrifice and service .         mmm .  the only problem with that would be the travel .       coren studied ariel while she sparred with chassik .  he noticed then how different she seemed compared to the spacers gathered here .  his first thought was that she looked younger  but that was wrong .  they all  for the most part  looked young  at least in that their skin was smooth  their eyes were clear  their hair thick and shimmering .  but that could be purchased at any competent rejuve clinic .  earthers managed cosmetic youth up till their eighties and nineties  when the repairs failed for lack of anything dependable to repair .   no  spacer youth was qualitatively different  something rejuve could never achieve .  instead  it was a static perfection  isolated in time  unchanging and unchanged .  they looked like icons of health instead of people  archetypes of agelessness .  instead of perpetually young they were perpetually the same .   but not ariel burgess .  for one thing  she was not young .  fine lines rayed from the comers of her eyes  and her laughlines were deep and permanent .  a single chiselled dash deepened between her eyebrows when she concentrated and her skin  rather than the smooth porcelain austerity of her fellow spacers  showed the reticulations of virgin  unrejuvenated or rehabbed derma .   she was not stuck in time .   coren surveyed the crowd  checking his newfound perception to see how it held up .  he saw exceptions  of course  and the earthers were distinct by virtue of their evident age and the use of makeup where nature let them down .  but for the most part observation confirmed expectation .        curious why you haven   t challenged the blockade     ariel was saying .   coren   s attention snapped back to ariel and chassik .   chassik looked puzzled .     what business would it be of solaria   s to get in between a dispute between earth and one of its unacknowledged offspring .         none  usually     ariel said .     except that solaria holds title to nova levis .  i assume  since you haven   t deeded it to the colony  you still have some interest in it .      chassik frowned .     i was unaware of any holdings by that name .  are you sure you have your facts correct .         it   s possible the record is just incomplete .  these things do get overlooked .  solaria owned the place outright about thirty five years ago .         really .  by that name .         no .         ah .  well  then you do have me at a disadvantage .      ariel cocked her eyebrows .     i   ve never known you to be at a disadvantage .  i   ll have to remember this .  especially where something you once personally owned shares in is involved .       chassik made a long show of assembling a plate of assorted delicacies  his lips pursed thoughtfully .     you   re probing  ariel .  i don   t think you know what it is you   re looking for .  you   ve heard a name  saw a bit of obsolete data  and you   re jumping to conclusions .  that got you in rather a lot of difficulty last year  didn   t it .         in a way .  difficulties don   t come from wrong conclusions .          oh  they can  though .  depends on how they   re wrong .  this nova levis thing .  .  . rather arcane subject for the calvin institute liaison to concern herself with     chassik said .      illicit traffic in positronics does concern me .      chassik blinked  startled .     accusations are beneath you  ariel .          i   m not making any  ambassador .         nova levis has been a de facto independent colony for nearly thirty years .  i believe aurora has sponsored a few such colonies itself  and i   m sure if you looked the actual ownership of those worlds may still be a matter of doubt .  does aurora meddle in the internal workings of these colonies .     he shrugged .     what the situation is on the ground rarely matches what you find on paper .  if solaria hasn   t signed over anything  it   s simply a clerical error .         was it a clerical error     coren asked     when you divested your personal holdings in nova levis .  if i recall correctly  you did so at the same time as rega looms sold his shares .  oh  but i forgot  you never did business together .       ambassador chassik   s reaction moved through stages  from genuine bafflement to comprehension to an abrupt resumption of a professional mask .      ariel     he said drolly     i rarely give advice  but in this case i think you need it .  i admire and respect you  but you   ve shown truly questionable taste in paramours .  you should be a little less reckless .      he smiled at coren .     please excuse me .       chassik sauntered away .      what was that .     ariel asked .      following your lead     coren said .     blind shooting .  i turned up some interesting facts concerning that research lab you mentioned  nova levis .  your ambassador chassik was a primary shareholder .  i wondered if maybe the two were related  the lab and the colony .         blind shooting .  i   d love to see what you can do with your eyes open .      she shook her head .     you guessed wrong  though .  i wasn   t shooting blind .  solaria still holds title to nova levis  the colony .  it wasn   t called that when they owned it .          what was it called .         cassus thole .      a chime cut through the air like crystal .      dinner      ariel said .     i hope the rest of the evening is as interesting as the hors d   oeuvres .        coren left ambassador setaris   s dinner gratefully .  through the excellent food and drink  the strain of trying to pay attention to everything gave him a mild headache .   ariel wore a vague smile during the ride to the embassy lobby .  coren had expected to return to her apartment or office to talk  but when he began to mention it she shook her head distantly .      later      she said .   in the lobby  coren became impatient .  he held his tongue in front of the auroran security guards  though  and let ariel take his arm and walk with him through the exit .   on the plaza fronting the embassy  she said     let   s get a car .  i haven   t been outside the embassy in months .  i want to go for a ride .      bewildered  coren ordered a cab .   once in the passenger section of the automated transport  her vagueness evaporated .      paranoia is a requirement for the job     she said  and punched in a series of random destinations in the cab   s datum .      who do you think is listening .         my own people  for one .  add chassik to the list .     she turned to face him as the cab moved off .     all right  tell me what you know about this lab .       coren recounted what he had discovered about nova levis research .  ariel listened silently .  when he finished she leaned her head back and gazed at the ceiling for a time .      alda mikels and gale chassik together in the same investor   s list makes sense     she said .     but rega looms .         odd  i agree .  but why would the colony be named for the lab .         you   re sure it is .  could be coincidence .         you could find out more about that than i could .      ariel nodded .     i   ll look into it .         what did you mean about illicit positronics traffic .      ariel waved her hand .     like you  blind shooting .  i thought i might get a reaction .  there has to be a reason solaria never relinquished claim to nova levis .  i thought perhaps they were using it as a transfer point for black market robotics .  that could still be it  but i   m not sure chassik knows anything about it .         the entire solarian government .     coren asked dubiously .      no  just factions .  and he was right about the independence of those colonies .  we lease the worlds  settlers come in  after a time the colony charters its own government  and independence is a fact .  there   s never been a reason before for any kind of intervention .  no precedent .  i haven   t checked yet  but maybe there   s some old agreement that keeps earth from demanding solaria exercise rights of ownership .  or it could be that the fact has been lost in the name change .  even if there isn   t  it may be that one department simply didn   t know what the other was doing .     oh  that business of the deed .  i thought you had taken care of that .  well  it isn   t my responsibility     she smiled at coren   s laugh .     contrary to what you terrans believe  we spacers are not of one mind .  on any subject .         that   s not something i ever believed .      she leaned forward .     rega looms had to have a reason to invest in a biotech lab .  did he have any other investments like that .         not that i know .  i   ll check  but i don   t think so .         so if it was just the one investment  the one lab  it seems logical he   d have a good reason .         i suppose .  but          probably a personal reason .         where are you going with this .         did he have any other children besides nyom .      coren hesitated .  a few days earlier he would have stated emphatically not  but now  after hearing the remarks of both looms and wenithal  he was less certain .   instead of answering  he said     there   s something else .  my errand to baltimor district .  the reason i was late .  the shipping container nyom used was routed out of petrabor .  shipping schedules had been rearranged to accommodate it .          petrabor .  .  .         the reschedule came out of the ite offices in baltimor .  i looked up an acquaintance from my service days  a man named brun damik  who was in charge of the inspector   s department of ite  figuring that if anyone would know how to get in touch with the people who run the whole baley operation  he would .  he led me to a retired cop named wenithal .  i found rega   s name in his old case logs  part of the same investigation that involved nova levis .  according to the public record  no charges were filed against nova levis  but the attention from the investigation must   ve been enough to sink it .  it was bought by the kysler group and dismantled .  tonight  when i went back to ask damik about his connection to wenithal  i found police there .  he   d been murdered .  tortured and murdered .       ariel winced .     what was the case .         a kidnapping .  it turned out to involve several orphanages and a couple of biotech labs  extending back several more years .  infants were being taken from orphanages  funneled through the labs  and shipped offplanet .  a slave trade  of sorts .         what did the labs have to do with it .            i don   t know yet .  but i found this      he handed her the certificate he had taken from damik   s apartment      hidden in damik   s office .      ariel opened the sheet and studied it .     he was an orphan .         interesting  isn   t it .  i never knew .  we worked together and i never knew .     he folded the document and put it back in his pocket .     ree wenithal sponsored him .         should you have known .      coren shrugged .     maybe  maybe not .  you don   t expect the people you work with to hide that kind of thing from you after you admit to them that you   re an orphan .          you .         seth canobil hospice and social rehabilitation center .  lifelong resident .  i graduated from there before entering the academy .      ariel seemed to think about that for a time .     all right  so you were both orphans .  this police officer  wenithal  was investigating a kidnapping .  children were stolen from orphanages and eventually sent offworld .  to nova levis .         maybe .      he stared out the window for a time .     what is it we   re supposed to be stopping nova levis from doing with this blockade .         you   re insisting you have the right to on ground inspection .  you   re looking for pirates .            you    .  i thought aurora was backing earth on this one .      ariel shrugged .     you notice we haven   t sent any ships .         point taken .          where was nyom looms taking her baleys .         nova levis .      ariel nodded .     i think we should have a talk to this police officer .          i agree .  but i   m not sure what good he is .  his information is a couple of decades old .          if spacers are involved  that   s meaningless .  they can be very patient .             they    .      she shrugged .     sometimes i don   t feel very much like one of them .     she frowned .     but this might be the very same case your mr .  wenithal was investigating .  it may be that whatever was going on then has just come back home .  if it ever really stopped .  why did he resign .         i don   t know .     coren sighed .     there   s something else .         always .       coren laughed .     no  i mean another coincidence .  i did a background on the warehouse where nyom connected to her killers .  i tried to find the dockworker who met them  a man named yuri pocivil .  i did a trace and found out he was a settler immigrant .  from a colony called cassus thole .      ariel stared at him .     the same as .         i don   t know .  interesting coincidence  don   t you think .  the fact is  he came to earth six years ago  from cassus thole .  along v nth a good number more who all work for the same company .  six years ago .  long after cassus thole supposedly became nova levis .  so either there are two colonies with the same name          or there   s a problem inside ite .  your acquaintance  brun damik  do you think .  .  .  .         it   s something i intend to check into now .         i think we need to find out what else this hunter group owns as well .  maybe we should ask mr .  wenithal what corporations came up in his investigation .         settlers  spacers  and terran companies .  rather unusual circumstances that could bring them all together .         in my experience  profit explains such anomalies nicely .         but profit from what .     coren asked .      kidnapping from orphanages .         but       ariel pointed .     that disk i gave you has a full screening of a blood sample taken from the finger joints of the robot nyom looms had with her .         blood .      she nodded .     we typed it  scanned it  and ran a match .  it seems nyom looms had a brother .          sixteen    t  he cab let them out in front of lanra   s building .  ariel followed him up the stairs to his office .  the building showed considerable age  the stairs worn where countless feet had pressed upon them  dust accrued in corners  an uncovered access to conduit and wiring long unrepaired  but it seemed moderately well maintained .  cleaner than she might have expected in this old neighborhood  which lay on the outskirts of the infant district  just off the southwest corridor of d . c .   a light glowed above lanra   s fourth floor office door  illuminating a nameplate  coren lanra  i . s . i .      do you have any neighbors here .     ariel asked .      an industrial cleaning firm     coren said  gesturing toward the other lighted door down the hall .     the floor below is empty .  three businesses on the one below that .  two below that .         and above .         storage .  past tenants left stuff  paid to have it stored .  or not  but management kept it all anyway .       he let them in .      it   s a more prosperous district than that     he continued     but there are only so many lawyers to fill available office space .     he shrugged .     a lot of tenants have left in the last year .  i don   t know why .         trends are merciless .      he nodded distractedly .     especially on real estate .  wait here a moment .     he pushed through the inner door  to a private office .  ariel heard a brief verbal exchange and wondered if he had a secretary .  the thought annoyed her for some reason .     all right  come in     coren called .   when she stepped through the door she found coren seated behind a broad desk  its surface illuminated by a touch sensitive grid .  he had taken off his jacket and was absently rubbing his left shoulder .  ariel studied the desk .      that   s impressive     she said .      and as expensive as it looks .  sit down .     he leaned over the desk then and started entering commands .  his fingers danced deftly .      ai .     she asked .      yes .  .  .     he inserted the disk ariel had given him into a reader slot .  a flatscreen extruded on one corner of the desk .  coren studied it .     the dna is a close match .  .  . what are these other things .  proteins .         derec hasn   t finished his analysis yet .  proteins  yes  but there are a few puzzles  for instance  a high concentration of myralar .          what   s that .         a polymer  synthetic .  a distant analog of nylon .  it   s used in robotics for joints  pivots  dry lubricant .  apparently the robot you found grabbed someone .  we found the blood samples mixed with these other materials in its fingers .       coren frowned at the screen .  his fingers worked .     not nyom  but .  .  .         very close .      coren    s glance flicked over her  a hint of irritation .     i didn   t think robots could hurt anyone .          not intentionally  no .         so where did the blood come from .      ariel shook her head .     we   ll have to wait for derec   s excavation before we know that .          you   re so sure it couldn   t have been the robot .         not that robot .         and you don   t believe in my second robot .         i didn   t say that .       coren grunted .  his eyes closed for several seconds .  ariel began to think he had just fallen asleep when he straightened abruptly in his chair .  he winced as he stood .      i   m sorry      he said     would you like something to drink .         you   re hurt .      coren nodded .     i was rolled in petrabor .         when was this .         the last time i saw nyom  when she left .      he walked stiffly toward another door .     i think i could stand a drink  if you don   t mind .          you didn   t say anything about being attacked .      he shrugged and went through the door .  ariel heard the faint sound of liquid on glass  then a deep groan .  silence stretched .  ariel went to the door and looked in .   coren sat on a long divan  a drink perched on his right thigh  eyes shut .  an open bottle sat on the low table before him .  she lifted it to her nose and sniffed .  bourbon .  she found a row of glasses on a shelf above a small liquor cabinet .  she poured three fingers and studied the room .   shelves  a pair of closet doors  another chair  a set of drawers .  it reminded her of the monk   s hole derec had kept on the premises at phylaxis .   last year .  .  . ages ago .  .  .   a box lay open on top of the table .  ariel stared down at a collection of images of a young woman  almost gaunt  but with a bright smile and large eyes .  she looked vaguely familiar .   looms  she realized .   coren cleared his throat .  ariel looked to see him watching her  a worried frown creasing his forehead .  she picked up the top image .      nyom .      he nodded .   ariel dropped the picture .     this isn   t a case file .         nyom wasn   t a case .         you   re not doing this for rega .         partly .  mostly i   m doing it for myself .         it   s personal  then .         very .      ariel pulled the chair close to the table and sat down across from him .     what   s that like .      coren pulled himself straighter and set the glass on the table .     i don   t think this is relevant .         maybe not to the universe at large      ariel said with mock gravity .     but i   m interested .         it   s not very interesting .  i resigned from special service almost six  no  seven years ago now .  i tried running my own private security company for a year or so  but my best clients were always police agencies who needed a little extra expertise .     he smiled grimly .     we private cops tend to be a little less constrained by legality than regular police .  anyway  it wasn   t turning out the way i wanted it to .  i   d quit because i didn   t like the compromises i had to make on behalf of official policy and now i found myself compromising everything else to pay the rent .  i started looking for a staff position in the private sector .  rega hired me about five years ago .  i met nyom seventeen months later .         you remember it that clearly .         a very memorable sequence of events .      ariel raised her glass to her mouth and said with mild sarcasm     i suppose it was love at first sight .     she took a sip .      don   t smirk .  it happens .     he shook his head .     the thing is  i didn   t know that till later .  i thought it was just lust .  both of us .  i thought she was doing it to irritate rega  but he never knew .  nyom was nonconformist to a fault  but she didn   t flaunt it .  she wasn   t looking for attention .  whatever else rega might have done  he instilled a sense of purpose in her .  she wanted her life to mean something .     he shook his head .     that sounds superficial  doesn   t it .  the ultimate clich   .          no .  not if it   s real .         oh  it was real .  that   s how she ended up running baleys .          now that sounds like something aimed at her father .         it   s easy to think that  too .  they didn   t really get along .  the truth is  nyom knew things were wrong  that the way everything is put together is all messed up  but she didn   t know how or why .  she didn   t know what would make it right .  if anything could .  so she moved from one cause to another  trying to find the formula for fixing the world .  rega just chose something that felt right and stuck with it .  nyom wasn   t confident enough with her judgment to think she knew which one .  mostly  she ended up trying to help people do what they wanted when official policy got in their way .          if it   s a law  it   s necessarily oppressive .         something like that .  baley running was a natural for her .         is that what ended it between you .     ariel asked .   coren nodded .     irreconcilable ideologies .         you don   t think anything is wrong .         no  no  not at all .  i just can   t see the use in tearing down everything you have until you can make it work .         very conservative .          that   s me .         what will you do if you find that nyom   s view was right .         i have no idea .     he leaned back .     rega looms has never lied to me before .          you   re referring to the possible existence of nyom   s brother .      coren nodded .     it doesn   t make sense .  rega only had one child .         that you know of .          that i know of .  nyom never said anything either .      he shook his head .     i hate being lied to .          maybe rega just neglected to mention it .  has he always told you everything .      coren looked uncomfortable .     that would be a very dangerous omission on his part .         granted .  but it   s those things that can hurt us most that we never reveal  even when we should .         is that experience talking or a spacer proverb .      ariel considered responding to the barb  but decided against it .     assuming he lied about that  why .  did the child die .         there would be no reason to hide that .  even assuming rega to be a callous opportunist  which he isn   t  having a child die in infancy could only be a subject for sympathy .  why would a dead child be something to hide .         it might depend on how it died .       coren shook his head .     no  if rega has hidden it  then the child didn   t die .     his eyes narrowed .     why are you interested in this .         my government          uh uh .  you .  there   s a difference between following orders and pursuing a goal .  you    re interested for your own reasons .  why .      ariel considered telling him about the note on her comm  we   re not finished with you  but balked  unwilling even now to admit how much it frightened her .      maybe later     she said .     it   s not important right now .         we never reveal the things that can hurt us most .         drop it     she said curtly .   coren raised his hands in mock surrender .     later  then .  but i think you   re going to have to tell me sometime .         then sometime i   ll tell you .         preferably before it   s too late to do you any good .         may i ask another personal question .      coren made a gesture to continue .      has there been anyone since nyom .      coren frowned thoughtfully  then picked up his glass .  he shook his head .     i haven   t made the time .         not interested  or just not ready .      he glanced at her speculatively .     are you making a suggestion .      ariel laughed  surprised .  am i .  thinking about it now  with coren watching her  waiting  she realized that the same question applied to her .  it   s been a year since jonis .  how long is long enough .      maybe     she said .     when we have more time .         ah .         nova levis     she said with emphasis .      yes .  our phantom research company .  or the colony .     the fragile mood broke and ariel felt mildly self conscious .      they could be connected     she said .   coren set down the glass and rubbed his eyes .     maybe .  probably .  nova levis  formerly cassus thole  is apparently involved in baleys in a big way .  warehouses  shipping  stolen cargo .  your complaining spacers and their delayed shipments .     he waved a hand .     too much .  i need sleep .         i   m not tired .         i can call you a cab if you want .      ariel studied him  realizing that she did not want to go back to the embassy .  perhaps it was just being away from other spacers and the confines of the mission precincts  but she was enjoying being here too much .  that thought surprised her  too .   coren looked at her .     is something wrong .         no .  if you don   t mind  i   d like to stay here .         don   t you have to report in .         not if i don   t want to .         senator taprin      coren began .      old business .         but is it over .         i thought it was .  it would be nice to know for certain .      coren coughed .     i am really  really tired .         do you have anything i can go over  then .     she smiled at him .     or you can sleep .  i   ll watch .      he pushed himself up .     let me finish up a couple of things .     he walked woodenly into his office .  ariel could see him from where she sat .  she wondered at herself  just what it was she intended with coren lanra  what she would do  and why .  for the moment she was content to let her feelings run their course .  it had been months since she had been interested in anything beyond her own self denigration .  right now she felt in control  free to act instead of waiting for something to react against .      desk     coren said     have you completed compilation of the case files of ree wenithal .         i am sorry      the desk said     i have no record of such a request .       coren   s face went blank .     desk  run review .  i requested a survey of relevant material concerning the investigations of ree wenithal  reference downloaded material from disk yesterday .      a moment passed .     no such material is extant in memory .         run diagnostic .      ariel felt her pulse quicken .     your system is buffered  i assume .         of course .  the whole office is          diagnostic complete .  reference nine one oh .       coren snatched ariel   s disk from the reader and tossed it to her .  he worked furiously over the surface  then stood .  he came back into the private room and went to the shelves .      something   s infiltrated your system     ariel said .      that   s the code reference you heard .     he tucked small objects into his pockets  then grabbed an overcoat and a soft travel bag .  he piled things in quickly  slammed the drawers  and returned to his desk .  he studied readouts  nodded once  and entered more commands .      what   .      he raised a hand and shook his head .  ariel fell silent .  finally  he shrugged on the overcoat  shut down the desk  and indicated the exit .  ariel preceded him through the door  across the reception area  and waited .   coren lanra pulled out a handgun .  ariel suppressed a shudder at the sight  the weapon looked compact and heavy  with an ominous green light on the frame just above the trigger guard .  she was guessing  but it seemed lethal .   he leaned out into the hall  looked left and right  then took her arm .  he guided her in the direction of the stairs and gave her a slight push .   ariel stepped onto the stairwell landing and waited for coren .  when he emerged into the dusty gloom of the shaft  she asked quietly     do i get one of those .      he studied her intently .     you know how to use one .         it   s been known to happen .      he reached within the voluminous overcoat .  a second later he pressed a fatal shape into her hand .   ariel held it gingerly for a few seconds  studying it .  a modified stunner with an extra powerpack and an amplifier along the generator coils .  at close range  it would probably kill .  she thumbed it on  felt the energy as a faint  numbing surge against her palm .  she sited along the barrel a couple of times to get the feel of it  then nodded to coren .   coren led the way down the stairs .  they had not seemed so dark on the way up  but now the shadows oppressed  the turns threatened .  ariel   s pulse was racing by the time they reached the bottom .      stay here     coren said  and stepped quickly out the door .  a few seconds later he came back in .     this way .      beneath the stairs he turned on a handflash .  ariel saw a heavy metal door with a keypad upon which coren deftly entered a command .  old bolts lurched back and the door swung away from them .   in the light of coren   s flash ariel made out another landing and a flight of skeletal stairs leading down to a sublevel .  coren closed the door behind them and shined the light above and around .  a few cobwebs had gathered in high comers but not so many as might be expected .   their feet clattered loudly on the bare metal steps .  at the bottom  reddish orange light pooled .  coren switched off his flash .      that way     he said  pointing down one corridor     leads to the garage .  this way      he indicated the passage leading straight from the stairs      runs under the next several buildings in this block .  there   s access to lower levels .         do you own transport .         no .         then .  .  .      he headed toward the garage .   halfway down the passage a sound stopped ariel .  she glanced back  trying to comprehend what she had heard  a rasping noise  like rough cloth over gravel  or the hissing of water against a hot surface  yet fearing to see what could make it .  but the narrow corridor was empty .  she hurried to catch up to coren .   they entered a storeroom .  in the light of coren   s flash  she saw bins stacked high to the ceiling  filled with packages and angular shapes  and clusters of components and discarded parts .  a workbench held a complicated mechanism that had been thoroughly dismantled .   through another door they emerged into one of the garage levels .  bright lights imbedded in the ceiling painted sharp highlights upon the sleeping transports sitting in rows .  coren strode quickly along them  head swiveling  until he came to the end of one row .  he dug in his jacket for something  then inserted a card into the reader on the transport door .  he tapped a code into the lock .  a moment later the door slid open .      get in .       ariel went around to the passenger door .   coren powered up the transport and eased it out of the slot .   ariel glimpsed movement off to the right .  before she could speak  a large shape shot out in front of them  bounced off the hood  and landed heavily on the roof .      what   .     coren began .   his window burst in  spraying bits of shattered plastic across them .  ariel clutched the pistol while her free hand came up to protect her face .   the transport lurched to a halt .   coren was half out the window when she looked again .  he hooked his left leg awkwardly under the steering column and his right hand clutched at the frame separating the front and rear sections .  an ugly hacking sound came from where she imagined his head must be .   ariel opened her door .  she gave the line of nearby transports a quick survey  then rolled out .  she came up facing the vehicle and brought her weapon to bear .   the shape on the roof of the transport looked human .  it was large  mostly covered in a long  colorless overcoat  one leg thrust back for balance along the front screen  foot sheathed in a heavy black boot .   she aimed .   a head appeared over the hunched shoulder .  eyes fixed her  unblinking and sharp .  the face .  .  . the skin looked rough  disfigured .  .  . the hair was a ragged growth of oily brown and red .   it grinned at her .   it moved with alarming speed  turning toward her  crouching to spring  ariel fired .   the weapon felt warmer in her hand .  the bolt of energy  nearly invisible  slammed into the assailant and tossed him from the roof of the transport like a mass of compressed air buffeting a rag .   he hit the pavement with a solid  meaty impact and a puff of air .   he sat up  shook his head  and looked at her .   terrified  ariel fired again .   the head snapped back  so savagely that it must have broken the neck .  a few moments later  though  he began to stand .   ariel watched  seized by amazement and fear  as he rose  to his full height .   shoot it again  she thought  but her finger did not flex against the stud .   he took a step toward her .   a brilliant splash of crimson white burst against him .  she glanced back toward the bolt   s source  coren had managed to get off a shot .  the attacker screamed  a sound like a million sheets of paper ripping at once  and staggered back .   ariel fired a third time .  a pungent burnt odor filled the air .   the attacker fell to his knees  rose  then ran away .   all at once the stillness engulfed her .   coren coughed .   ariel came around the transport and found him lying on the pavement  holding his throat in one hand and his pistol in the other .  she set her weapon down and helped him sit up with his back to the transport .  he coughed and hacked for a minute  spit out a gob of phlegm  and sucked air in huge gasps .      i know that hand     he said finally .     son of a        he got to his feet shakily and looked around .      get your weapon     he rasped .   ariel snatched up the stunner .   coren accessed a different transport .  he drove fast now  taking the turns recklessly until they made the avenue .  ariel waited till he slowed down to a normal speed before saying anything .   before she could speak  though  coren made an ugly throat clearing noise and said     he should   ve died .  only thing i can think of that could resist a shot like that is a robot .  so tell me  ambassador burgess of the goddamned calvin institute  when did you people start making humanoid robots .         it wasn   t a robot .         no .  then what the hell was it .         something we stopped playing with a very long time ago     she said .     a cyborg .        ariel   s hands trembled .   figures  she thought wryly  now that we   re safe .   relatively safe  anyway  she added .  her eyes ached from trying to see all around her and into the darkness of third shift faux night .  coren drove them out of d . c .   southwest  past industrial enclaves and private neighborhoods  through abandoned sections  and into an area ariel had never been to .  she recognized the main building from the subetheric  dimly  an old memory  as the headquarters for dynan manual industries .   coren got through all the security checks  sent the transport back where it belonged  and took her through unpopulated corridors to a suite of offices .   she watched him work a desk that was similar to the one in his private office  though  from the attention he gave to each command  it was far less sophisticated  not even close to an ai .  her pulse slowed  adrenalin drained away  and her fears took over in the form of the shakes .   coren glanced her way and stopped what he was doing long enough to pour her a drink .  gratefully she sipped at the dark liquid .  she had never been sure why alcohol helped at times like this  perhaps it was the care with which one had to take it in that distracted the mind from its own terrors  but she finished the tumbler of whiskey at the same time coren sat down across from her .      we   re secure for the time being     he said .   ariel nodded toward his desk .     smart matrix .         an old one .         your desk is an ai .          was .  rega would never allow one on his property .         i don   t understand .  if you   re willing to use one  how do you .         life is a compromise .  i prefer working for rega to working for anyone else .  that doesn   t mean i agree with everything he says or believes .     he smiled thinly .     much like you  i imagine .          ah  well .  to coin a phrase     that   s different         really .  well  i won   t argue .  how are you feeling .         better     she said  raising the empty glass .      want another one .         yes  but later .  too much comfort dulls the reflexes .  how are you .      coren shook his head .      let me see your shoulder     ariel said .  she reached for his shirt .   coren leaned away from her .     i   m all right .         of course you are .  let me see .      with obvious reluctance  coren unzipped his shirt and pulled the left half away  revealing his shoulder .  ugly bruising spread from the base of his neck down to his clavicle .      have you seen a doctor .     she asked .      in my spare time     he said grumpily and pulled the shirt back on .     painblock .         you   ll pay for that .         i know .     he shrugged .     i made an appointment  but .  .  .      he went to a sofa and sat down heavily  letting his head fall back .      your desk     ariel said .     what happened .         something got through my buffers     he said .     i had the ai doing a lot of in depth searches .  it was spread fairly thin and it must   ve become vulnerable .         or some of the files it was accessing were corrupted .         sleeper programs .         maybe .  if i could look at the software i could tell you .  but bringing it here            would corrupt this system .  unless we knew exactly what had gotten through .         go to the head of the class .      coren rubbed his shoulder  frowning .     this .  .  . cyborg .  he   s the one who rolled me in petrabor .         you   re certain .         i think i   d remember a deathgrip like that .     he frowned at her .     unless there   s more than one .         no     ariel said suddenly  hoping it was true .     let   s not get more paranoid than we need to .          you said it was a cyborg .         i was guessing .  i could be wrong          but if you   re not  what is it you   re talking about .         a composite .  an organic machine .         i   ve seen some pretty impressive soldiers come out of       ariel shook her head .     no  this different .  i   ve seen those people  too  and they aren   t like this .         you said an organic machine .  like augmentation .  prostheses .         far more intimately involved than that .  yes  you could claim that people with artificial limbs  organs  new skin  bone replacements are cyborgs  but it   s a much too limited use of the term .  no  people like that are still fundamentally human  there   s a clear line of separation between the organic and the augmentation .  you haven   t replaced their basic being with a full partner robotic symbiote .  a cyborg is a blend of the two into a third kind of being .          i don   t quite follow .         neither did we .  that   s why we stopped fooling with them .      coren scowled skeptically .     i thought aurorans were the experts on robotic intelligence .      ariel sat forward .     we are .  that   s what i mean .  this isn   t robotic intelligence .  it   s .  .  . something else .  and we couldn   t figure out what .      his disdain faded to a guarded respect .  ariel sat back  mollified .      all right     he said .     i   m listening .         a positronic brain     ariel said     is basically a sensory data receiver collator that operates by a collection of discrete parameters arranged in constellations that shift in response to new data .  that   s a gross simplification  but accurate enough for our purposes .  we   re talking about a few billion discrete parameters and nanosecond processing time  and a complete lack of an unconscious  and a few other additions and subtractions that allow us to actually program it while granting it a modicum of creative responses       coren held up his hand .     i get the idea .  i think .  but that sounds like any other ai system .         true .  the key defining factor is in self perception .  a positronic brain is aware of itself .  it is also aware of others as both distinct and collective entities that possess similar attributes .          but          i   m using the word    aware    in exactly the way you would use it to describe yourself .  an ai  no matter how sophisticated  is not aware .  the best of them have fully mapped models of their own make up and function  a reference  if you will  that tells them what they are .  but the relationship is always and only one of data referencing data in a strict modular process .  a positronic brain possesses a sense of self that is independent of models  it will continue to perceive itself as a self even with extensive reprogramming that might in any other respect change the nature of what it does and what it knows  and a basic understanding of self in others .  that opens a huge gulf between an ai and a positronic brain .  for instance  you could never infiltrate a positronic brain the way your desk was infiltrated .  an ai  unless specifically commanded  will regard that infiltration as a problem in programming .  it   s just data .  the more sophisticated the infiltration  the less likely it is to be aware of anything wrong .  a positronic brain would immediately detect the attempt not as data but as damage .  it would respond to it by treating it more or less as an infection .  it would feel wrong .  and if the infiltration were inimical to its loyalties  then the three laws would come into play .  if it could not purge the infiltration  it would collapse .  it would not tolerate a violation of its self .         humans don   t even do that      coren said .      not as effectively  no     ariel agreed .     but we have far fewer hardwired parameters and far more self reprogramming parameters .  we have both a sub  and an un conscious .  we can dream  we can imagine  we can lie  we can hallucinate .  reality is a conditional set of perceptions .  the plasticity of our minds enables us to function even through gross distortions in our initial parameters .  we imagine more richly and much faster than we process information .  we   re inextricably linked to our environment  but our perceptions of our environment are fluid .  we can be fooled  deceived  manipulated .  but it   s a two way exchange  the manipulator will be manipulated in turn through the interaction  but we can still function in the midst of deception and illusion .  we can set aside our moral restrictions if need be  and we define our own need  and resume them later .  if we choose .  humans  in short  can remake who they are at will .  a positronic brain cannot .      coren   s face showed the effort to understand .  ariel stopped  unsure how much he followed .      it borders on metaphysics     he said .          borders .     hell  it is metaphysics .  all the philosophical speculation of ten thousand years became concrete when the first positronic robot sat up and said hello to its makers .      coren nodded slowly .     and a cyborg .      ariel sighed .     positronic intelligence gave us another self aware entity we could compare our own to and ask questions about the differences .  it gave us the measuring stick to determine what is human and what is not .  cyborgs .  .  . break the measuring sticks and dump all those questions back in our laps .      she leaned forward again .     imagine a positronic brain with all its capacity to analyze data and perceive the world as a material whole all at once  joined to something that can set its own parameters .  there is no buffer  no unconscious to help process excess data or unpalatable information  and no preset responses to conditions .  it has no basis for behavior other than what it chooses to have at any given moment .          you   ve described a sociopath .         a very  very fast  smart sociopath .  a sociopath we can   t begin to understand because we don   t have a model for its mental processes .         why did you stop working with them .         we discovered that we couldn   t program in the three laws .  something in the mix  probably  undoubtedly  from the organic side kept overwriting them .  the one consistent attribute that emerged was self preservation .  beyond that  we had no idea how to cope with them .  after a while it seemed immoral to continue the experiments .         immoral .  you actually shut down a line of research on moral grounds .         why not .  spacers don   t get to be moral .      coren shook his head .     no  it   s not that .  i  never mind .  so you   re saying that we were attacked by a cyborg .          that   s my first guess .  a robot would never have done that .  i doubt a human  even one of your military modifications  could have survived those shots .  i   d like to hope i   m wrong  but .  .  .     ariel blinked at him  suddenly understanding something .     i see .  you earthers wouldn   t have shut down the experiments .  you didn   t .  the only thing that kept you from building cyborgs was the fact that you   d outlawed positronics .       coren   s expression showed his ill ease .  he did not like what she had said but he could not deny it .  ariel had always been puzzled by terran perversity  the apparent willingness to do what clearly should not be done .  but perhaps the real puzzle was why spacers chose not to do those things .  maybe their long lives gave them a better understanding of consequences .  maybe their smaller populations made them less willing to take risks on questionable projects .  terrans seemed only to care in hindsight  when things went wrong .   one of their spasms of late conscience banished positronics .  .  .      how     coren said finally     does this relate to nyom looms .         that robot you saw .      coren nodded .     cyborg .         more than likely .          and the blood avery found on nyom   s robot .  .  .         a cyborg composed partly of a relative .      coren   s face contorted in harsh distaste .     where .  how .  we can   t build them here  you won   t build them there .  .  .     his eyes widened .     pirates .  black market .          a reasonable guess .     which would explain aurora   s sudden interest in helping the terran authorities with the baley problem .  where are all those baleys going .      could someone somewhere be converting baleys   .         no .  a cyborg doesn   t work that way .  you couldn   t take a full grown human and make the conversion .     ariel thought about that .     at least  i don   t think you could .  from what i recall  a cyborg has to be grown .  the mix has to mature in symbiosis  so ideally you   d start with a fetus .         a newborn .         possibly .  the organic system is still in transition through puberty  so i suppose children could be used  but the older the material the more difficult the process .         but where would they get all the raw material .     coren asked .      i said at the beginning of this evening that we need to talk to this retired policeman .          wenithal .     he blinked .     orphanages .          seventeen    c  oren slept for an hour  then showered  swallowed more painblock  and found a change of clothes for ariel .  dressed now in plain pants  work boots  and a dull blue jacket  she looked like any other t rated office worker just off third shift  going home or shopping .  he took her to the mall where rw enterprises was and they waited in an open kitchen across from the entrance .  twenty minutes later  wenithal emerged and trudged wearily down the concourse .   ariel drifted away  quickly and unobtrusively falling several meters behind wenithal on the way out of the mall .  coren was mildly surprised and impressed at how quickly and easily she blended with terrans .  the more time he spent with her the less spacer she seemed .   he sat at a table at the edge of the pantry  nibbling on a meat pastry and sipping a cup of acrid coffee .  after about ten minutes  he crumpled up the wrapper and dropped it and the half full cup into the waste .   at the door to rw enterprises  he took out his palm monitor and a small device that he pressed to the wall just below the lock .  while it worked to decode the access sequence  coren pulled out a few of his little devices and activated them .  he glanced around .  the mall was pretty deserted  but a few people milled around .  the trick was to gain entry as fast as possible  making it look as if he had been admitted .  the longer it took the more conspicuous he became .   the palm monitor chirped at him .  he had the code .  he entered a command that turned the id scan on the door into a recorder  pocketed the reader  and pressed his right hand against the panel above the lock .  a second later  the door slid open for him .   he snatched his decoder from the wall and dropped his devices just inside the doorway .  they scurried off to run interference for him as he proceeded on  into the plant .   machinery hummed .  coren went directly to wenithal   s private office .  as he stepped through the door  he thumbed his hemisphere for a little added security  set it in the middle of wenithal   s cluttered desk  and paused .   where to start .   coren did a slow turn .   it was a working office  that was clear .  a few changes of clothes lay scattered over chairs  stacks of paper and disks filled corners  three empty cups sat on the desk .   coren looked for a personal datum .  he found it tucked in a desk drawer .   he took a disk from his pocket and inserted it into the datum   s reader .  the screen scrolled up  went cloudy  then blank .  coren waited  listening intently to the distant sounds of automated machinery .   less than a minute later  a long time for the decryption    ware coren used  the screen presented a menu .   letters  memos  profiles on clients  quarterly reports .  coren opened the latest of these and perused rw enterprise   s profits and losses statements .  one of the largest customers  he noted  was a solarian firm  strychos  that bought nearly half a million meters of a synthetic fabric a year .  the lot was identified only by a batch number .  coren opened his palm monitor  switched it to record  and began taking notes .   far down the menu he found a file named gratuites .  coren grunted in surprise .  well  he never thought anyone would open this .  .  .   the file contained what it suggested  a list of people to whom wenithal paid bribes .   brun damik was halfway down .  a very generous allocation .   gale chassik appeared several lines further .   coren copied the list and closed the file .  studying the menu  he wondered how much more he needed to know about ree wenithal .   why you resigned after becoming a hero would be useful .  .  .   he saw nothing that would seem to contain the answer to that  so he closed the datum down and returned it to the desk drawer .   so wenithal was paying bribes to damik .  coren still did not understand what any of this had to do with baleys .  .  .  though he felt he should know .   there were several files of correspondence .  coren opened each one and perused addresses .  he found several to a location in petrabor .  the documents themselves proved cryptic  evidently a code coren did not recognize .  still  messages to someone in petrabor seemed suggestive enough .  he looked for replies and found them attached to each document  all of them were initialed either t . r .  or y . p .   yuri pocivil    .   coren swiveled in the chair  searching the office walls .  nothing .   he closed up his palm monitor and left the office .  sitting down at one of the secretarial stations  he accessed the production records .  he located the batch number for the synthetic  and went into the main plant to look for it .   the synthesizers looked like huge columns of dark gray segments piled high to the ceiling .  heavy conduits ran from their bases back into the shadows of the cavernous chamber .  they hummed with activity  though only a few seemed to be outputting product into the deep troughs below their extrusion slots .   coren followed the row of machines to the one marked    line       and stopped .  it was on  they all were  it cost too much to shut them down completely and restart them  but nothing was coming out .  coren studied the control panel .      imbitek     he noted  recognizing the logo .  he keyed for access .  the screen gave him a list of options .  he entered the code for a sample .   less than a minute later  a meter of black fabric oozed from the    machine into the trough .  the cutter came down with a heavy thud to chop it off  and coren picked up the sample .   it was remarkably thin  almost insubstantial  and he found it difficult to hold  its surface friction nearly nonexistent .  he managed to fold it down to a square that fit into his pocket with no more bulge than a handkerchief .   he walked away from rw enterprises as if he were late for an appointment  briskly but not so fast as to look culpable .  outside the mall  he called ariel .     ree wenithal lived modestly for his income .  his apartments occupied two floors of an old warren complex that had once been a barracks for factory workers  then converted into luxury apartments nearly a century ago  and now had evolved into many things  apartments  clinics  retail shops  storerooms  offices .  coren was amused to find two private investigation agencies listed .   ariel waited across from the arched entry to wenithal   s warren  sitting at an autochef with a cup of hot cocoa  doing a reasonably effective imitation of someone who had just gotten off shift and on her way to well earned sleep .      did you follow him all the way in .     coren asked  sliding onto the stool beside her .      no .  i   m not altogether certain he didn   t see me  so i thought i   d better not .  did you find anything .         some  but i   m not sure if it means much .  he runs a business .     coren shrugged .     he   s paying bribes to chassik .      ariel frowned .     he does business with solarians .         a couple .  pretty big accounts .         solaria manufactures its own textiles .  what are they buying from earth .         a half million meters a year of a synthetic .     he showed her the sample .     if i   m not mistaken  this is myralar .      ariel ran a finger over its slippery surface .     i   d have to analyze it  but it feels right .  hm .  half a million meters a year .  that   s a lot  but not enormous .     she shook her head .     maybe i   ll ask chassik .      coren drummed his fingers on the counter .     i   ve got his p l records  we can go over them later .  i don   t think we   ll find anything conclusive  though .  he was bribing damik  too .  the bribe is unusually large  more than i would have guessed damik would be worth .         did damik have something over wenithal .         it   s a thought .  .  . but that   s not the feeling i got when i followed damik to his meeting with wenithal .  everything about it said wenithal was the one in charge .     he glanced at her cup .     are you done .      ariel held up the cocoa and wrinkled her nose .     before i started .  let   s go talk to your ex policeman .      they passed under the archway and started down a path lined with poorly tended shrubbery .  a number of the growl amps above them were out .  coren glanced around the area  and frowned .      what   s wrong .     ariel asked .      hm .  oh .  nothing .  .  .     he glanced up at the tall windows to his right .  balconies and walkways hung higher up .     that   s not true .  i   m not sure if i can explain it .         try .  i   m always eager to learn new things .      coren looked at her .  he saw no sign of sarcasm in her expression .  indeed  she seemed intent only on their surroundings .      well     he said     usually when someone has a connection to a case  i   m talking like service now  you might find someone through one source  one link  but when you look  if there is a connection  there   s more than just one .         and with ree wenithal .         there are suggestions of more connections  but i still have only one  brun damik .  and his connection was tenuous .         until he died .         that was a pretty strong hint  but not really a connection .      she frowned at him .      just what do you count as a connection .         something with steel cables tying it to something else .         isn   t that a bit unrealistic .      coren stopped .  ariel continued on a few more steps  then turned to him .      early on     he said     i arrested an innocent man .  it wasn   t a big deal  nothing bad happened to him  he just spent a few nights in confinement  went through a lot of humiliating interrogations and filled out a lot of forms .  it was a mistake .  i think i felt worse about it than he did .         so you vowed never to make a mistake again .         no  but i got into certain habits after that .  i made fewer mistakes .  i became pretty good at it .  and i got overconfident .          and made a big mistake .         very .  it cost me the life of a friend .         you   re talking about nyom looms .      coren nodded .   ariel pursed her lips .     high standards are good .      they continued on to wenithal   s apartment in silence .   the door stood open .      come in     wenithal called .     i was beginning to wonder if you   d ever get here .      .     ree wenithal sat on a long couch  slippered feet propped on a low table  a glass in his left hand and a pistol in his right .  he scowled at them for a long moment  then laughed .      you .  i thought it would be someone else .     he set the pistol aside .     close the door if you   re staying .      ariel pressed the contact .  .  the light from the balcony shrank to a narrow line and vanished .   the room smelled of alcohol .      so     wenithal said     did you go through my files .      coren hesitated .      my career     wenithal said  stressing each syllable .     my exploits .  they   re all in the public record .  they   ll tell you all about me  about my life  my accomplishments  my .  .  . my .  .  .     he waved a hand vaguely .     everything .         i looked at them     coren said .   wenithal waited .  when coren said nothing more  he got ponderously to his feet .     are you going to introduce me to your partner .  oh  if you want a drink  help yourselves .  i keep a good stock .  even some spacer stuff .         brun damik is dead     coren said .   wenithal nodded .     i was questioned about it .         uh huh .  do you have any idea why he was killed .         do you .      coren crossed the room in four strides and snapped his palm into wenithal   s chest .  the older man sat back down heavily  his wind wheezing from his mouth .      we were attacked earlier tonight     coren said .     i   m in no mood for repartee  mister wenithal  so do me the courtesy of answering my questions directly .         i don   t have to tell you shit     wenithal said breathily .      fine .  then when the people you were expecting come to kill you  i hope you have some friends to attend the services .      wenithal glared up at coren  but his eyes wavered moistly and coren caught the distant shimmer of fear behind them .      something killed nyom looms and brun damik and fifty baleys who just wanted to get off earth     he continued .     something tried to kill me tonight  and something is coming after you .  you used to be a cop .  pretend you still are for the next ten minutes and do the right thing .     he paused .     or do you already know who these people are .      wenithal tried to heave himself up  but coren rapped him in the sternum again .     you   re a bastard     wenithal hissed .      do you know that for a fact  or just speculating .      wenithal slapped at coren half  heartedly  missing .  coren watched the old man warily  but it was obvious wenithal would do very little now .      what do you want .     he asked grumpily .      the same thing i wanted the first time we spoke  information .         i don   t have any to give you .         bullshit .     coren wanted to shake wenithal .     how long would you have played games like this when you were a cop .         when i wasn   t pretending  you mean .     wenithal grunted .     i wouldn   t have played them at all .      he shrugged  tried to sit up straighter  then nodded .     all right .  .  . what do  you want to know first .      coren picked up wenithal   s glass and smelled it  akvet .  a theian drink  a variation on absinthe .  no wonder wenithal was so intoxicated so quickly .      what were you going to do when the bad guys came .     coren asked .     play dead .         very funny .  .  .      coren looked at ariel .     would you see if there   s any stimulant around .  coffee  capvitane  sniff  whatever .      ariel raised an eyebrow speculatively  then nodded and headed further into the apartment .      there   s coffee     wenithal called after her .  he looked up at coren .     what do you want to know .         first  why did damik see you after i talked to him .         what did you ask him for .         i wanted to know who ran the whole baley enterprise .  the real managers  not the dockside people .         ah .     wenithal grinned again .     that   s clever .  he never believed he could get caught .  ex special service  you know about that .  so he wasn   t ready when someone came asking the right questions .  of course  you realize  it got him killed .          we were screened .  no one overheard our conversation .         so .  it   s all connections .  people looking for other people .  links get made  conclusions drawn .  brun was killed on spec .      ariel returned with a cup of steaming coffee and set it down on the table before wenithal .  he stared at it for a long time  then lurched forward to grasp it .      i don   t drink much anymore     he said .     not used to it .         seems a suicidal habit to start up again just now     ariel said .      if i   m drunk enough it might not hurt so much .     he lifted the cup to his lips and held it there  poised .      brun was an orphan     coren said .     you sponsored him .  why .  did you know his parents .      wenithal stared at him .      the holmer foster gymnas cooperative     coren said .   wenithal focussed on him .     you knew .         we did work together once     coren said evasively .      mm .  i suppose that counts for something .     he took another drink and scowled .     something about the acids never mix right with the wormwood .  .  .     he set the cup down and rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands .     there was a kidnapping .  oh .  .  . when was that .  .  .  .  twenty something .  .  . a long time ago .  a district manager for a company that no longer exists .  very high profile .  like an idiot he went to the news nets first  made everything very difficult for us .  the thing was  no ransom demand ever came .  the child just disappeared and that was it .  it wasn   t my case initially  i was called in later  but .  i .  anyway  we had nothing to go on  no thread to follow through the maze .  when we started looking through the database for similar cases  a pattern began to emerge .  hundreds of unsolved kidnappings allover the world over the previous decade  none of them with a common denominator other than the complete absence of further contact .      wenithal grinned crookedly .     the problem with databases  ais  smart matrices  logic systems  is that if you don   t ask just the right question you never get the answer you need .          hundreds     ariel said .     that many  they had to be going somewhere .      wenithal raised a finger .     absolutely .  but where .  after canvassing and recanvassing witnesses  acquaintances  associates  total strangers who might possibly have seen or heard something  anything  i started expanding the search .  i started looking at schools  hospitals  orphanages .          you found the link in orphanages .      wenithal nodded .     not all of them  though .  special ones  ones that took in and maintained    problem    children .  infants with defects  genetic problems  congenital and chronic illnesses .  children turned over to the institution and their records sealed or  in some cases  erased .  it was difficult to detect  actually  but i found several of them doing a backdoor business in what they delicately termed    material .            selling the children .     ariel asked .      basically .  oh  they claimed they were selling cadavers  but the numbers were too high and the age groups too coincidental .  it took a long time to finally prove what i knew was going on .          and brun .     coren urged .      i didn   t know his parents very well .  they were part of a series of interviews i conducted in relation to the case  but they didn   t really have anything to do with it .  they   d tried to adopt  that was all .  after brun they   d been told not to try another natural birth  not without a complicated gene therapy they couldn   t afford .  shortly afterward  there was an accident .  a semiballistic struck an old piece of orbital debris .  ninety or so passengers and crew .  holmer foster was the local institution .  i felt .  .  . an interest  i suppose .  brun was bright  nine years old .  when i checked on him two years later  he was running a kind of black market in his facility  using smuggled in recordings  access codes  food allotments .  i thought it was a waste of natural talent .  so i sponsored him .         you didn   t adopt him .         a police officer .  where would i find the time .  no  sponsoring was about the best i could do .  it was actually brun who told me about the missing upds .          upds .     ariel asked .      untreatable physiological dysfunction .  children with disorders that can only be watched .  often they can   t even stop their pain .  those were the ones i found out were going missing the most .         that doesn   t make sense     ariel said .     what use   .  oh .      wenithal glanced at her .     research  spare parts  other things i never cared to think about .         you    re sure they were being shipped offplanet .     coren asked .      that   s where the trail went cold .  we traced them to four or five labs .  they all funneled the    material    through a single lab that i could never really prove was involved .         let me guess     coren said .     nova levis .         very good .  you must   ve been a decent cop .          i still am .  who was running the operation .         very corporate .  but i could never prove it .  i know it  but i can   t take it to court .         imbitek     ariel said .   wenithal shrugged .      how did that tie in with the kidnapping that brought you into it .     coren asked .      that was the most perverse component .  the boy that was kidnapped was just a normal boy .  it didn   t make sense in light of what i had found out about these .  .  . these .  .  .  flesh mills .  so i took a closer look at my concerned parents and found that they had had two previous children .  one had died shortly after birth  the other .  .  . the records had been manipulated .  the claimed death was not a death .  they relegated it to one of these orphanages .  there was a connection .     wenithal frowned at coren .     do you even want to know .  you work for rega looms  how much do you know about him .         i       the door chimed .   wenithal groped for his pistol .      take it easy     coren said quietly  easing his own weapon out .  he looked at ariel and gestured for her to move to the far side of the room .  coren moved quickly to the wall alongside the door .  he nodded to wenithal  who brought his pistol into his lap .      enter .      coren tensed as the door slid open .  light from the balcony outside spilled across the carpet  outlining a shadow .  wenithal raised the pistol .   coren stepped away from the wall  aiming at head height .   a sharp hiss and a muffled    shit .     came from the person standing in wenithal   s entryway .   the light in the room brightened  revealing a woman in dark clothes with a heavy pack slung over her left shoulder .  she gaped at coren  stunned .      jeta fromm     coren said .     i   ve been looking allover for you .           eighteen    t  he lab datum has been compromised  derec      thales announced .   derec looked up from the screen and blinked .     what .         the lab datum has been compromised     the ri repeated .     i have detected nine gates placed at various locations within the system that are diverting information to an external source .          what about you .         i have already detected and blocked an attempt to establish a gate in the immediate array .  judging from the other gates  this will not be a problem  they are sophisticated but limited .  however  the longer i block implementation  the more likely other measures will be taken .          in other words  they   re not just giving up and going away .         essentially  yes .      derec went to the end of the blind and looked across the lab .  only one tech was on duty  this late in the third shift .  derec returned to his chair and rubbed his eyes .  he had been at it since arriving  nearly eighteen hours now .  the excavation was proceeding more slowly than he had expected due to a series of defensive modifications someone had added to the dw    .  it took rana several hours to tease through them with thales    help .  once they understood that bypassing them would not corrupt the matrix any further  everything went smoothly  but making sure ate up a lot of time .      how soon .     derec asked .      regarding what .         the excavation .  when do we start getting useful data .         i have isolated the constellation of memory nodes we need  and i am beginning a chronological assignment .  another hour .         i want your findings copied directly to ariel   s datum .         that precaution is already in place .         are you able to trace the gates to their external source .         the risk of detection is high .  i suggest completing the task at hand first before attempting any further action .       derec reached for the cup of cold coffee on the workbench .  he needed sleep .  he had sent rana to her apartment hours ago .   he felt the passing of time acutely .  ariel had not commed in over five hours .  sipha palen estimated she could keep the deaths out of the news nets for another day  two days at most  before someone figured out that she was hiding something .  or  and derec thought this more likely  someone who already knew would sell the information .  in either case  this needed to be done quickly .      i would like to talk to you about another matter  derec     thales said .      hm .  what  thales .         i have taken advantage of the access here to larger memory buffers to set up my examination of bogard   s positronic matrix .  i have run six attempts at reestablishing a functional template .       i forgot all about that  derec thought uneasily .     i didn   t know you   d done that .         it has not interfered with the performance of any other task     thales said .     as we do not know if another opportunity may occur  i thought it best to use this one .         that   s fine  thales .  um .  .  . six attempts .  i gather none of them have been successful .         in achieving a stable matrix  no .  however  i believe i have achieved something positive .  i now know that we cannot do more in simulation .  the convolutions in the error log indicate the presence of a reifying condition .          i   m not sure i understand .          basically  there is a command error which repeatedly instructs the matrix to disassemble at the same point .  i could not be sure of this before because i was forced to continually reconfigure the parameters to accommodate the lack of memory .  now that this is no longer a problem  i see that the breakdown occurs at the same point each time .      derec leaned forward  curiosity cutting through weariness .     can you identify that point .         that is the difficulty .  it seems to be in the checksum routine that oversees the data interface with the physical plant .         seems to be .         it is possible the error precedes that point  which is why i am unwilling to be more confident .  but in each case the breakdown occurs at the place where the program attempts to command the actual body .  there is no body  of course  and i am studying the options to construct one in simulation  but i am not convinced this can be solved that way .  i am of the opinion that the error is tied to the violation that caused the initial collapse .  it may be that what i am seeing is not an error at all but an irreconcilable dilemma .  in either case  the error effectively orders a new collapse each time .  available memory is not the problem .  the matrix itself is self destructive .          that doesn   t make any sense  thales .  that would suggest intent on some level .  there isn   t enough coherence for that to be the case .         under normal circumstances  i would agree with that assessment .  however  bogard was unusual in several respects and its termination was singularly traumatic .         all right .  the next question  obviously  is what do you propose we do about it .         it is possible that the error can be resolved by loading a partially reestablished matrix into a blank positronic brain and tracing the final connections through to see if the error persists .         treat it like a hardware problem  you mean .          essentially  derec .      derec smiled .     and where do you propose we obtain a blank positronic brain .         we have one at hand  after i have completed my excavation .      derec looked at the dw    lying on the table  cables snaking from it  connecting it to the board thales was using .      it   s not at all what bogard would be used to     he said .     that assumes we   re allowed to use it at all .         if i may point out the obvious  the owner is no longer a matter of concern .         heirs  thales .          i have considered that .  do you really think rega looms will want it .      derec laughed dryly .     no  i don   t imagine so .  but sipha palen has authority .  it   s station security property .         with all due respect  derec  chief palen has procured the robot under false pretext .  she has filed no official records that it even exists on kopernik .  effectively  the robot occupies a legal void .  it belongs technically to no one .  i believe my position is defensible in terran court .         it may be  but .  .  .     derec sighed .  his brief spurt of energy was ebbing .  he needed sleep .     i can   t make this decision now  thales .  we have other matters to resolve first .         would you object if i created an implementation program in the event that we do make use of the robot .         no  of course not .  right now  though  we need that excavation .         it will be completed in fifty two minutes .         good  good .     he regarded the screens before him speculatively .  somewhere in all that machinery was a consciousness .  it surprised him sometimes how easily he disregarded the inorganic nature of positronic entities .     thales  why are you so interested in bogard .         why .         yes  why .         bogard is a problem you set me to solve .         true  but  never mind now .  thales  i may doze off sitting here .  if anything happens that i need to know about  wake me .         of course  derec .      he closed his eyes .  he did not fall immediately to sleep  though .  he could not shake the feeling  tenuous  barely identifiable  that thales had just evaded answering his question .      the question of will in a positronic matrix is and may remain one of the unsolved  and unsolvable  mysteries about these minds we have created .  we built them to serve us and in that matter they have no choice .  but we then gave them an imperative to serve not our commands but our morality .  to assume this makes them thrall to human will to exclusion of their own may be an error .       who said that .  derec fished through his memory until he found it .  ariel had said that  in her graduate thesis from the calvin institute .   something to that .  .  .   a constant question in positronics  one most positronic specialists toyed with but never wanted to discuss  concerned the hardware  how much of a robot   s    personality    depended on the actual mechanism  and how much on what was called    accrued experiential associations    .  the easy answer  always  was that a positronic brain was entirely a matter of physical linkages and connections  tied directly to its sensory apparatus  the    real world    model that allowed them to make deterministic decisions based on the three law parameters encoded into the pathways .   but that begged the question  it did not address the problem of mind .  derec had come up against it with bogard and now with thales  why  he wondered  could thales not simply construct a matrix very much like bogard   s .  evidently  thales could not .  bogard   s physical modifications had been an integral part of its consciousness .  thales    suggestion that the entire matrix be reinserted in a blank brain reinforced the obvious  that a robot was inextricably mechanistic  even though it demonstrated consciousness very similar to a human .   how many humans willingly admitted that they were as much meat as mind .   derec yawned  and sparks danced at the edge of his vision .  too much  too deep .  he waited for sleep .  but his mind writhed with questions .        mr .  avery .      derec opened one eye and looked up at hofton .     mmm .             we have a problem .     hofton nodded toward the lab .   derec stood slowly .  a huddle of people crowded at the entrance .  he recognized palen  leri  and polifos  all apparently on one side of an argument  facing four terrans  two men  two women  whose clothes  neatly cut  unadorned  and severe  suggested authority .  they spoke in low  terse tones that even without knowing the subject made derec apprehensive .      thales  how far along are we with the excavation .         i require a few more minutes  derec .         who are they  hofton .         tbi     hofton said .     leri  to his credit  is fending them off with implied threats of    political repercussions    and    violation of sovereignty  but they aren   t really backing down .  they want the robot .  my sense is that they intend to take it regardless of the consequences .       derec glanced at the dw    .     why would they want a robot .         not a robot  that robot .  they know exactly where it came from and what it is .         thales  those leaks          it is possible they were tbi monitors     thales said .     i did not trace them for the reasons we discussed .       derec studied the group .     palen looks upset .         i would be  too .  evidently her authority is being challenged .  i suspect she   ll lose  but she may be able to delay any immediate action .          it may be a moot point  anyway .     he leaned over the console .     thales  complete the excavation  copy all material to ariel   s office  then start tracing those monitors .  be careful not to reveal your presence as more than a security trace .         yes  derec .      derec smoothed his shirt and ran a hand through his hair .  hofton watched him speculatively .      shall we .     derec gestured toward the confrontation .     your lead  sir .      derec approached  hofton a pace behind .  polifos noticed him first and tapped ambassador leri   s arm .  the discussion died immediately with everyone looking at derec .      excuse me  but i couldn   t help noticing      derec said .     tbi .      one agent nodded slowly .     you are .  .  .  .         derec avery .  i gather you   ve come about the matter of the robot .      palen glared at him  outraged .  the tbi agents frowned uncertainly .      you have in your possession      the first agent began .      pardon me     derec interrupted     you are .  .  .  .         agent harwol .         pleased to meet you .  and these others .      harwol waved a hand in the direction of his male partner  then each of the women .     um .  .  . agent gent  agent jallimolan  agent cranert .  .  .         pleased .     derec gestured toward hofton .     this is liaison officer hofton of the auroran embassy  d . c .      awkward nods passed around the group .  derec noticed that polifos looked baffled  but leri was suppressing a smile .      now     derec continued     i   m the positronic specialist in charge of examining that robot .  i have authority from ambassador sen setaris to do so .  it   s my understanding that diplomatic considerations require that you have a proper warrant  countersigned by ambassador setaris  before i can turn any of our property over to you .       agent harwol made a chopping motion with his hand .     not in matters concerning the death of tbi or other terran police personnel .  we have an overriding interest in that robot  which we   ll be happy to take up at a later date in court with ambassador setaris .  but right now we insist that you turn over the robot in question .         for what purpose .      agent harwol frowned .      what do you intend to do with it  agent harwol .  it   s a collapsed positronic robot .  basically  so much scrap as it is .  what do you propose to do with it .         that   s not germane to this situation          but it might be .  you see  if you intend to turn it over to your own specialists for examination  then we may be able to save you time .       harwol exchanged looks with his fellow agents .      what do you propose .     he asked .      we   re already doing the only examination that might produce results .  i   m sure that sharing our data with you wouldn   t be out of the question .  ambassador leri .         well  under the circumstances  it would be unusual     leri replied .     i   d have to vett it through ambassador setaris  of course  but i don   t see a significant problem .  cooperation with terran authority is always preferable to confrontation .      chief palen no longer seemed angry  but derec felt uneasy under her gaze .      we   ll have to post an agent with the robot     harwol said .      that   s out of the question      polifos began .   leri jabbed his elbow into polifos   s ribs .     in company with one of our own security officers     he said     i don   t see a problem with that .      harwol looked miserable .  derec guessed that his orders had been vague but succinct .  he was ill prepared to negotiate  and he knew his presence in auroran embassy precincts was questionable at best .      we require full disclosure     he said .      we would probably require your help in any case     hofton said .     i am curious  though .  you said in the case of a death of a terran agent .  what terran agent .      harwol clasped his hands behind his back and shook his head .   derec stared at him .     you had agents in that group of baleys .      harwol met his stare stoically .  finally  though  he nodded .      shit     palen hissed .      well     hofton said     that changes a few things .      derec stepped up to palen .     maybe you should show us the crime scene now .  i think it   s time we all see for ourselves .        derec gazed up at the cargo bin .  till now  he had only seen it on a screen .  small and manipulable on his desktop  it lacked any impact .  here  though  it disturbed him .  it was both larger and smaller than he had expected .   people were going to travel to another star system in this .  .  .  .   lights shone within the container .  folding tables held portable datums  but no one paid any attention to them .  derec looked at the office where palen and harwol talked with leri and hofton .  derec feared a jurisdictional fight  the worst kind of battle .  hofton  at least  was capable of steering the situation past that  if he was allowed to .   derec wandered to the row of datums  keeping watch out of the comer of his eyes for any move from the armed officers spaced around the bay to stop him .  he occupied a fuzzy zone in the hierarchy  so the odds were even that he could do nearly anything he wanted .   most of the screens showed blank .  two contained schematics of the interior of the bin .  a third showed a chemical analysis of some kind .  to derec  it looked like a crystalline structure  but he could not identify it .  he stepped closer to one of the schematics .   cages supported acceleration couches arrayed around the inside surface of the bin .  a very simple design  easily modified  completely modular .  the rebreather unit sat bolted to what was now the floor but in freefall would be just another bulkhead .   fifty three couches .   how many bodies .   fifty two .  logically  the empty couch would have held the murderer .   who got out how  exactly .  derec wondered .   the only evidence of escape was the crack in the hull in which nyom looms    body had caught .  but that hole was far too small for anyone to slip through .   so that meant the killer did everything before lift off and remained on earth .   that did not follow  either .  what would have prevented the robot from opening the hatch and saving the baleys by just admitting fresh air .  no  the only time the poison would have been effective  and the robot ineffective  would have been in freefall  in vacuum .   therefore  the killer was in the container and committed the murders en route to kopernik .   the crack let out the atmosphere  forcing the baleys to stay on the rebreather  which eventually poisoned them .  the robot had attempted to intervene  hence the blood and material in its hands  and failed .  it would have been forced to do what .  whatever it could .  it was found trying to shut off the rebreather .   which would have meant suffocation for the baleys .   either way  they would be dead .   so one of the bodies removed from the bin had to be the killer .  easy enough to check  just find one with tom clothes .   but how could the dw    attack a human .   and what about that empty couch .  derec assumed they would have known how many passengers  so what good would one extra couch be unless it was for someone who intended to get out before discovery .   or for someone who never showed .  .  .   he crossed the bay to the cargo bin .  no one stopped him as he entered .   lights brightly illuminated the inside .  he climbed up the scaffolding that supported the couches to the crack in the ceiling .  the metal showed a clear curve where something had gouged it from the interior and pushed it out .  derec ran his hand over the surface and found a number of indentations on either side .  a hand .      sir .      derec looked at the entrance .  a uniform stood there  sidearm out .      i have to ask you to leave     she said .     you aren   t supposed to be in here .         really .     derec climbed down .     why is that .         this is a crime scene  sir .       he stepped past her .     it is  indeed .  thank you for pointing that out .      derec entered the office  and walked straight into a full blown argument between palen and harwol .   harwol was fuming .       what in hell you thought you were doing  but you overstepped you authority by a considerable margin .         this is my station  harwol     palen shot back .     it is my margin .         excuse me     derec said .   everyone looked at him .  palen and harwol both were breathing hard .      i was wondering      derec continued     if anyone had bothered to count the bodies .         of course we did  avery     palen snapped .     we counted them as we carried them out .         yes  but have you counted them since .      palen frowned at him  mouth open .      i didn   t think so     derec said .     maybe we should .          nineteen    c  oren almost reached for her  to pull her into wenithal   s apartment .  jeta fromm tensed  looked left and right  then  with a harsh sigh of frustration  stepped forward .      shut the damn door  gato     she muttered .   she stopped halfway between coren and wenithal  who still held his pistol in her direction .  coren closed the door  the soft snik bringing her around to face him again .  her long  almost gaunt face showed anger and fear .  she blinked nervously .  coren glanced at wenithal  who now looked away  hands clasped in his lap .      you   ve wrecked my life     jeta said suddenly .     that   s going to cost a bit more than my usual fee .          where   ve you been .     coren asked .     i tried to find you right after          right after you gave me away to the sanitaries .  what happened  did they offer you more credits than your wildest imagination .  or did you just decide to piss on some warren rat for fun and see how long it took her to die .         the    sanitaries    .     ariel asked .   jeta glared over her shoulder .     who are you .      coren cleared his throat loudly .     sanitaries are enforcers .  they clean up things .  sanitation workers .      ariel made a silent    oh    and nodded .     how clever     she said .     i   m ambassador ariel burgess from the auroran embassy .  pleased to meet you  ms .  .  .  .  .         this is jeta fromm     coren announced .     the freelance data troll who found nyom for me .  .  . then vanished before i could thank her for doing basically what she   s accusing me of .         me .     jeta shouted .     you vatdrip .  someone   s tried to kill me twice since i talked to you  once right after you left with the data i got you .  second time was at the lyzig tube station  morning after i took off .         did cobbel and renz tell you i was looking for you .      jeta frowned uncertainly  just for a moment  then looked away .     i was looking for you myself .      coren caught ariel   s eye and gave a slight shake of his head .      who did you tell about the baleys .     he asked .      you     jeta said .      who else .     coren took two quick steps toward her .  she backed up only one .     they were all murdered  jeta .  fifty two dead baleys .  someone knew they   d been found  and killed any possible witnesses .  if i   m the only one you told  then how did they know .         i   m asking you the same question .  how did they find me .         i don   t know who    they    are .  and if i   m one of them  why would i have to ask    them    .  you   re not making sense .      jeta glanced from ariel to wenithal  then back to coren .     i didn   t tell anybody .         then you were traced .       she scowled .     i   m better than that  there   s no way          my system was compromised  and i can afford a hell of a lot better protection than you can .      jeta shook her head .     don   t brag on it  gato  that   s how i found you .       it took coren several moments to understand her meaning .     you broke into my system .      she nodded .     it was hard  you   ve got a good one  but .  .  .      coren looked at ariel .     but          someone piggybacked in with you     ariel said .     your system   s still compromised .         who are they  jeta .     coren asked .     who   s trying to kill you .         ask them  gato  i got my own problems .         i   d love to  but it could be fatal .  who are they .      jeta swallowed loudly .     all i know is  i handed over the data to you and went back to my hole .  two of    em were waiting for me before i got there .     she looked at him narrowly .     i thought you   d had them standing by for after you got what you wanted .      coren shook his head .     then why follow me .  if i set you up  this is the surest way to get yourself killed .         i said that   s what i thought .  i thought it then  not now .         what changed your mind .         i checked you out .  it   s not too often you find an honest cop .         then          good cops go bad .         that still doesn   t explain why you   re here .     he looked at wenithal  who seemed to be pointedly ignoring them  drinking his coffee .     if i went bad          i didn   t know where else to go .  all right .  i don   t trust any of my usual contacts .  i thought i could make an arrangement with you .          if i were still a good cop  i   d help you .  if i were bad  we could do business .         something like that .         i   ve been trying to find you for over three days .         i know .  why .         i thought you   d double marketed the data .      jeta   s face hardened .     i don   t do that .         then how did they know about the baley shipment .      jeta let out her breath slowly .     i   m a good troll  mr .  lanra  very good  but i   m not the only one .  if i could find out  so could a dozen others  easy .  if i was you  though  i   d ask the people running the baleys to begin with .  if anyone   d know           i thought about that .  i   ve been trying to find them .          no luck .     a mocking smile tugged at her thin lips  even though her eyes still showed fear .     maybe you need to hire a professional .          fine  then     coren said tersely .     you   re hired .         my fee   s doubled     jeta said .      i don   t mind  i have an expense account .         i have expenses  we   re even .  what you want to know first .         first .  what are you doing here .         following you .         so you say .  you want to tell me why .  the truth this time .      jeta looked around .     do you mind if i put my stash down .  thanks .     she set her pack on the end of the table by the sofa  then dropped into the cushions with a loud  relieved exhalation .     you botched my ride  gato .  then you almost got me killed .  i thought that  anyway .  i figured if anyone could solve my problems  it   d be the gato who caused them all to begin with .         what do you mean  i botched your ride .     she gave him a guilty look .     confession time  i found that data for you as fast as i did    cause i already had it .  i was slated to go on that shipment .  i had a berth with them .            i   ve been trolling for almost sixteen years     jeta explained .     it   s not a bad life if you don   t mind the occasional hassle from police  public and private  and planning for the very long term .  some of us get good enough that we get hired as staff somewhere  go completely legitimate .  finding lost data is a full time industry in some quarters .  can i have something to drink .      ariel went into the kitchen again and returned with a glass of water .  jeta sniffed at it  frowned  then shrugged and drank .      anyway  you have to understand how much data there is on this planet .  i   m talking centuries of accrual .  it never entirely disappears .  overwritten  archaic storage media  just plain misplaced  misfiled  or misremembered .  it sits in layers  piling up  lumping together .  whole ai systems are devoted to sifting through it all  but it occasionally takes a deft hand  intuition  a lucky guess  human qualities you just don   t find in a machine .  there are specialists who do it  going through stuff that   s really old .  some of them start out legit and move into freelance  but for most of us it   s the other way around .  there   s a hardcore bunch that never go legit .      mostly though  it   s not much more dangerous usually than any other job .  it   s been understood for a long time that the troll isn   t a target  you don   t damn well shoot the messenger .  killing us hurts everyone .  and then there are the clearing houses that offer protection and anonymity  and some corporations keep their best trolls on retainer and offer defence .  worrying about sanitizers is just not a big issue .  i   ve been beaten up a couple of times  but no one has ever  ever  threatened my life .      till now .  about three months ago i was retained to find some old minutes from a board of directors that no longer exists .  this kind of thing isn   t my most common job  but i   ve done a few .  it   s surprising how careless some corporations are with old data like this .  i think it   s just arrogance  that was the old board  they didn   t do anything right  why bother keeping the minutes around  and if there   s no legal reason to do so  they just shove them somewhere .  a new board is like a new government and anything that happened before them is by definition full of error .  nothing unusual  standard fee  i got a few leads where to start  and i went trolling .  turned about to be a real challenge .  i could find traces of it  but it was obvious someone had gone to some trouble to hide it .  took me nearly a month to recover enough of it to make any kind of sense .  i found it hiding in stockholder reports  maintenance logs  spread out through portfolio surveys  resumes  spread sheets .  bits of it even turned up in vacation itineraries .  the program that hid it was sophisticated enough to actually reconstruct it all with the right command sequence  so it was obvious someone wanted to be able to recover it  otherwise a lot of it would have been corrupted beyond recognition .      jeta grinned proudly .     but i did it .  i found it all and reassembled it and put it into a package for the client .  i was finishing it all up when i got a message on my comm that said     if you deliver what you have  we will kill you .     very simple  very direct .  somehow  i didn   t think it was crank .  we don   t get them often  but we do get threats  and there are procedures for dealing with them .  i turned it over to my controller at the clearing house and delivered my package per our contract .  when i got back to my hole i found a new message     you were given fair warning .     that   s all it said .          no signature .     ariel asked .     no source .         that   s all it had to say     cause it wasn   t the words that scared me  but the timing .  i knew then i was being monitored  closely  and that my own system had been hacked .         did you try to trace it .     coren asked .   jeta scowled .     of course i did .  it ate at me .  i   ve been scared before  especially back when i started out  but this was different  this had an edge to it .  after a couple of days and i was still scared  i started making plans to disappear .  i did my accounts  added things up  and it looked like i could make it work .  i reconfigured my system three times to purge the intruders  then made inquiries to emigrate .  i always wanted to  anyway  it was one of my two or three top retirement options .  this decided the issue for me .      no way i   d get my assets through ite .  i   d have to go baley and smuggle what i could .  meantime  i just kept on as always  living my life  doing business like i always had  making no moves i   d never made before .  no flags  no warnings  nothing to tell anyone that anything had changed .  the final vetting came through baltimor for the petrabor egress  that   s what they called it  and i started arranging everything to be ready to transfer at a heartbeat .      then you showed up with your request for data on the same baley group .  i knew if i refused  you   d just use another troll and in the end it   d be the same result .  i had to change my plans .  i thought first maybe you were working for the gatos who   d threatened me .  so i ran your profile .  imagine my surprise when i saw    special service    pop up  then dynan manual industries .  what i saw  it didn   t make sense you   d be hunting down a troll for anybody .         i appreciate that     coren said with mock sincerity .      that didn   t change anything .  i couldn   t know what i   d find if i turned up for my ride out .         you might have asked me for help .       jeta shrugged .     couldn   t .  not then .      coren nodded .     i understand .         yes  well .  so i left everything as it was  kept the arrangements intact  and made different plans .  i did your job  handed over the data  and headed home to disappear .  that   s when i was attacked .  i got away by being just small enough for some crannies others can   t use .      no one waited for me at my hole  so i cleaned up  packed my stash  and ran .  i made plans to go to the bering port .  i don   t know how they figured that one  but the same gato found me at the tube in lyzig .         how did you escape that time .     ariel asked after a long silence .      screamed .     jeta gave them a wan smile .     too many people  too much attention .  he walked away .  i felt like a fool standing there in the middle of the platform yelling at the top of my lungs .  but not so foolish i wouldn   t do it again if i had to .  that   s when i decided to find mr .  lanra here .  i thought to myself     he started all this  he can fix it          i wish i could  jeta     coren said .     i had no idea .         i saw that pretty quick  you weren   t part of those gatos trying to kill me .  but you fouled up my egress .  you drew attention to it .  for all i knew  you were going to show up with immigration cops and arrest them all .  i couldn   t take the chance .  now .  .  .     she swallowed loudly .     i want out  mr .  lanra .  i want away from earth .  i want my life .  i   ll work for you till you can do all that for me .          i   ll try  jeta .  i can   t promise .  i don   t even know who these people are .  they hacked my system  too .      jeta blinked  her eyes moist .  she nodded calmly and looked at wenithal .     who are you .         forgive me  i   ve been remiss .  i   m ree wenithal .  this is my apartment .         ah .  nice place .         thank you .          jeta .     ariel leaned on the back of the sofa .     that job you did  the minutes .  .  . who was it for .         umm .  .  . there   s a small matter of confidentiality involved .  i   m not sure          someone is trying to kill you over those minutes     ariel said  her voice intensely reasonable .     i think it would be understandable for you to set confidentiality aside in this instance .      jeta nodded .     yeah  well .  .  . it was an intermediary  you understand  but i checked into him before i accepted .  the contract was from myler towne of imbitek .        jeta claimed to be dead tired .  wenithal showed her into his bedroom and let her sleep .  he went into the kitchen and returned with another cup of coffee .  his hand shook slightly as he poured it .   coren said nothing .  he joined ariel on the sofa and spoke quietly .      that   s not jeta     he said .      then who is she .      coren shrugged .     maybe we   ll find out .  it   s interesting  though  towne tried to hire me away from looms .  someone tried to assassinate towne .  he doesn   t trust his own security anymore .      wenithal came back into the room and  cup in hand  sat down in a chair .      alda mikels is being released from prison in a couple of days      ariel said .      if you   re wondering if there   s a connection  i   ve been wondering that  too .  but what would a disagreement between mikels and towne have to do with a bunch of baleys .         perhaps     wenithal said ponderously     the connection is sleeping in the next room .         seems rather heavy handed     ariel said     to murder fifty innocent people just to get one .  especially after the thing you   re trying to prevent has already occurred .         you mean the delivery of the data she found .     coren asked .     it doesn   t make a lot of sense  but .  .  . we have more murders to explain  though .         brun   s     wenithal said .     ms .  fromm said she went through the baltimor district to set up her egress .         she said that  yes     ariel confirmed .      brun headed the ite customs office in baltimor      coren said .     but .  .  .         ghost connections     wenithal said .     implications  suggestions  hints  nothing solid .  except that brun is dead .     he stared down at his coffee  eyes narrowed .      nyom had nothing to do with any of them     coren said .      but her father did     ariel said .     maybe nyom   s mystery brother did  too .         oh  definitely     wenithal said .   coren looked at him .     when i told you nyom had died  you said something about    both of them now  what did you mean .      wenithal scowled .     you heard that .         i cheat a lot     coren said .     you   re not denying it .  what did you mean .         rega looms did have a child before nyom .  a son .  a very sick son .  a upd .         i   ve heard that abbreviation before     ariel said     but i   ve never been clear on what it means .         untreatable physiological dysfunction     coren said .      i know what it stands for .  but what   s untreatable .  even if terran medicine can   t deal with something  we have some agreements covering humanitarian aid .  spacer medicine is          unable to deal with these     wenithal said .     i   m not clear myself on what they are  but some of them are horrible .  most are just chronically debilitating illnesses  a good portion of them are transmissible .  the only recourse is quarantine .  looms    first child contracted one when he was barely a year old .         so it was institutionalized .         had to be .  the law .  and it died shortly thereafter .  i imagine it crushed him .  it would me .         how did you come to know about it .     coren asked .      rega looms was one of the principle investors in nova levis     wenithal explained .     a research firm established to take advantage of some of the first influxes of spacer med tech .  everyone thought it would take off on the market  but it didn   t do well the first couple of years .  then  suddenly  it had almost unlimited cash flow .         black market .     ariel asked .      worse .  it turned out to be the main channel for all those missing babies .  we shut it down .         that   s not what the record says     coren pointed out .     nova levis was cleared and operated long after your investigation .          the record often disagrees with reality     wenithal said .     the truth was that too many important people had invested in it and too many of them had embarrassing connections with it .  very simple  we turned off the pipeline  told the public it was clear  and then put it on the market .  we disassembled it without harming any of the major shareholders .         that must have been an impressive list of shareholders      ariel said .      oh  it was .  you   d be shocked .         looms divested early  though     coren said .     quite some time before it closed .         i think he did it out of extreme disappointment .  they couldn   t cure his child  so he wanted nothing to do with it .  i can   t imagine how he must feel right now .         why did you retire after all that .     coren asked .      because i wasn   t finished and they weren   t going to let me finish .  i traced the kidnappings to nova levis  but they were going somewhere .  i thought it had to be offworld .  to save those prominent citizens    reputations  i was not allowed to follow the leads .  i was feted  medaled  and promoted  and basically told to drop it .  it ate at me till i couldn   t stand it anymore .  i presented an ultimatum  either i   m allowed to pursue the case or i quit .     he raised his hands  palms up  and let them fall .      you didn   t try to look into it yourself .         not very aggressively .  i was already known to those involved .  i knew i wouldn   t be very effective .     wenithal shook his head .     no  this was the only way  wait for someone new  with no attachments to the old case .  we couldn   t go looking for anyone because that might set off alarms in all the wrong places .       coren turned all this over in his mind .  it sounded just a bit glib  rehearsed  but that did not make it less true .  to be sure  ree wenithal had been living with this for a long time .  in his place  coren believed he might have it well worked out by now .   but coren found it unconvincing .  it did not explain wenithal   s connection to brun damik  or why damik would go to wenithal after coren confronted him .      where was nova levis .     he asked .      hmm .  somewhere in the pacific ocean  one of the undine enclaves .  um .  .  . teluk tolo  indones sector .         maybe it would be worthwhile to take another look at it     coren said .      it   s gone .  there   s nothing there anymore  just a shell .  it was all sold off .  i think it was converted to a processing plant for raw materials or something .         you won   t mind if we try  will you .      wenithal sneered .     don   t be sarcastic .  i   m doing you a favor telling you any of this .         of course     coren said .     you   re such a model citizen .  if i had more time i   d be more polite about it .         mr .  wenithal      ariel cut in  frowning at coren     you   re expecting trouble .  have you been followed .         not that i know of  but they killed brun .  i   m next  logically .  what would you think .         i think you should move somewhere safer .         and where might that be .         the auroran embassy .  i don   t think you can be gotten to there .         you think .         i don   t know what exactly we   re up against .  do you want me to lie and guarantee your safety .         we wouldn   t want you to do that .      wenithal shook his head .     i   ve never run from a fight .  besides  it might look odd .         you   d look very odd crushed to death     coren said .      crushed .         judging from the victims we   ve seen  it looks like crushing is the favored method .      wenithal considered that and shuddered .     i   ve never been to the auroran embassy .     he shrugged .     if it would put your minds at ease .  .  .         i could always leave you here with jeta     coren said then .   wenithal frowned at him .      how long have you known her .     coren asked .      i don   t          stop it .  she didn   t follow me here .  she came to see you .      wenithal laughed .     why would a data troll want to see me .         i can   t think of a single reason .  but she   s not a data troll .  you were waiting for someone to show up tonight  someone you thought might kill you .  so far  we   ve shown up  and jeta fromm has shown up .      coren held up his hands .     is there a mistake in my logic .         you   re guessing     wenithal said .      so  do you stay here  or do we go to the auroran embassy .      wenithal sighed .     all of us .         i   m not letting jeta  or whatever her name is  get away from us .         if she   s not jeta     ariel said     then who   .         i   m guessing a woman named tresha     coren said .     you   ve done business with her before  mr .  wenithal .  but i imagine you   ve never done any with her partner  gamelin .       wenithal stared at coren now with undisguised resentment .     like i said  i   ve never been to the auroran embassy before .          if i   m right  getting there might be an interesting problem     coren said .   ariel smiled at him .     leave that part to me .      coren turned away  muttering under his breath     i knew you were going to say that .  .  .          twenty    t  he morgue was a bit cooler  though derec wondered how much of that was simply psychosomatic illusion .  he stood to one side  near the big entrance  while sipha palen and her chief forensic specialist  baxin  went through the logs .      fifty one     baxin said finally .  he looked at palen .     there were fifty two when we brought them in here .         so a corpse got up when you weren   t looking and walked out .     palen   s voice made everyone cringe .   baxin shook his head  less intimidated than bewildered .      not only that     palen went on     but it cleaned up its container and put it back in storage .     she wheeled around at the pair of security men nearby .     didn   t anybody pay attention to the monitors .  nobody saw a thing out of the ordinary .      derec leaned back against the wall .  the tbi agents stood nearby  looking slightly embarrassed on palen   s behalf .  but derec could see the impatience in their faces .   palen stopped herself before she continued her rant .  with sudden and surprising calm  she said     i want the monitor records gone over .  i want to know when the dead got up and walked out .      her two officers  with evident relief  left quickly .  palen came up to the tbi agents .      i   m disinclined to turn anything over to you     she said     but under the circumstances  maybe we can share resources .  avery here has been working on recovering the memory from that robot .  if he succeeds  we   ll all know what happened .  if you remove it now  all his work will be lost and you   ll be starting from scratch .          that   s not      one of the agents began .   halwor raised his hand and cut her off .     as you say  chief palen     under the circumstances .         he looked at derec .     how soon  mr .  avery .         we were less than an hour away from the first recoveries when you showed up .          then  let   s go see what you have .        rana was waiting for them when they arrived in the lab .  she frowned upon seeing the tbi agents trailing behind derec and palen .  she came forward  stopping right in front of derec .      boss  we have a problem     she said .      yes  i know .  there   s a discrepancy in the bodycount .         yes  there is .  the robot is gone .      it seemed to take a long time for the information to register .  derec stared at rana .     what .         the dw    .  .  . left .      derec pushed past her and entered the workstation .  the pallet was empty  the cables all neatly removed and retracted into the diagnostic link .      when   .         what happened  avery .     harwol asked .     what did you do with the robot .         nothing .  obviously  i   ve been with you .  rana .      rana looked embarrassed .     i had some personal business to attend .  when i came back  the unit was gone .          thales .     derec asked .      yes  derec .         where   s the dw    .         at this precise moment  i do not know .         did someone remove it .     harwol demanded .      no     thales said .     however  i have everything requested from it .  i have organized the recovered memories and prepared them in a linear scroll for viewing .      derec  uncertain and nervous  sat down at the console .     the excavation is complete  then .         i have a complete document of the robot   s memory  derec .       the tbi agents looked uneasy .      um .  .  . any preferred mode of replay .         all options available  derec .         flatscreen and full auditory will be fine  thales .      derec turned to the gathered audience .     if you   ll all spread out along the blind  please  we can put this on a few screens and you can all see .         i want an explanation  avery     harwol said .     that robot is evidence          maybe we should pay attention to the main question      palen said     of what happened to those people .      harwol frowned  unmollifled  but he nodded curtly .     very well .      while they arranged themselves  derec made sure the link was feeding to ariel through thales .  he glanced back to see that everyone was ready .      okay  thales     he said     let   s see what you have .      four screens above the console cleared simultaneously .  a few seconds later  a single view filled them all .     the group of baleys gathered around the two people facing each other in their midst .  the woman  nyom looms  looked angry  impatient .  the man  dressed in dockworker   s dull yellow togs  faced her stoically  arms folded  waiting for her to finish .       is there audio .     one of the tbi agents asked .     thales     derec prompted .     incomplete .  i am working on filling gaps .       nyom looms raised one hand  finger aimed at the dockworker  and almost jabbed him .  he dropped his arms and said something .       pocivil     palen mused .     what   s that .     harwol asked .     nothing     palen said .         forming you now  have backup  prepared .  it   s the same as it was  only different .  a new canister .  we are professionals .       the robot turned toward the group .  someone was working his way forward and had come to a halt at the very edge of the half circle .   a window appeared at the lower right corner of the screen  and a series of faces scrolled quickly by  matching text on the left .  the words no match appeared in place of the faces .  the robot moved toward the stranger .       that   s coren     palen said .     who .     one of the tbi agents asked .     later      palen said .       all right     nyom said .     but if this turns out to be anything but copasetic  i   ll peel your skin off with pliers .  tell your people we   re ready .      suddenly  coren stepped forward  a half smile on his face .  the robot reached him at that point and gripped his right arm .  coren looked up angrily  but his expression changed quickly to fear .      i apologize  sir  but i must ask that you come with me .     the robot walked him back through the crowd of baleys  who looked frightened and angry themselves .   they emerged from the crowd and continued on to the next bay .  the robot stopped .  coren gave it another nervous glance  then turned abruptly .      damnit  coren .      coren smiled wanly .     good to see you  too  nyom .      she hissed through clenched teeth .      don   t tell me you   re surprised to see me     coren said .      i   m not .  that   s what bothers me .      coren nodded toward the robot .     umm .  .  .         coffee  go see to our arrangements .         yes  nyom     the robot said .   the robot  coffee  released coren and returned to the group of baleys .  it worked its way through them .  some cringed from it  but most stood their ground with stolid expressions  afraid but unwilling to show it .   coffee emerged from the huddled refugees just as the dockworker returned  followed by four individuals .  the window appeared at the lower left again as coffee attempted to find matches .   one of the four was another robot .       looks like a dm        rana whispered .     but what   s that .       one of the four looked distinctly artificial  surface a smooth  dull gray  but it was far more humaniform than either of the other two robots .  coffee gave this one a close examination .  the view zoomed in on its head .  human imitation eyes peered back .  it wore close fitting black  shirt  pants  and soft boots  which seemed silly for a robot .       look at the way it moves     derec said .       everybody ready .     the dockworker called out .  he turned to coffee .     where   s your boss .         one moment .      coffee made his way back to where nyom and coren stood talking .  it stopped a short distance from them .     nyom .      coren started and nyom laughed .  she began to reach toward him .     coffee won   t hurt you .  what is it  coffee .         time .         i   ll be right there .      coffee returned once more to the group of baleys .     she is on her way      it told the dockworker .      all right     nyom   s voice snapped .     let   s get this boat sailing  shall we .     she stopped upon seeing the newcomers  frowning .     who are these .         my dock crew     the first dockworker informed her .     it wasn   t hard to get everybody else to go out for a drink  but i think they   d draw the line at longshoring an illicit bin and loading up a bunch of baleys  don   t you think .      nervous laughter came from the group of baleys .  nyom nodded  her eyes on the strange robot .      this way     the dockworker said  leading them through the open bay .   they passed through the huge doorway .  the baleys stopped on the broad apron between the warehouse doors and the maze of tracks upon which cargo bins scurried en route to and from the shuttle fields of petrabor port .  one bin came almost directly at them  stopping abruptly on its magnetic rails less than five meters away .  its door folded down .      okay  folks     the dockworker said  clapping his hands .     here   s the drill .  inside you will find an array of bunks  acceleration couches  each one with a breather mask attached to a rebreather .  there   s enough air in the bin for the ride up to kopernik and the transfer to the ship that   ll take you on to nova levis  as long as you use the rebreather .  one of my associates here will ride up with you and make sure you know how to use the masks and will stay as security till you make the transfer to the ship .  once aboard ship  you will be released from the bin and provided regular berths for the main leg of the voyage .  once you are secured in your couches  do not  i repeat  do not  get out of them .  there isn   t enough room for floating around  and you could injure yourselves .  any questions .      he looked around .  coffee was paying attention mainly to the unusual robot .   abruptly  that robot stepped forward  approached coffee  and made a show of examining it .  it moved with a sinuous fluidity that belied its artificial nature  making one slow circuit around coffee and coming to a halt directly before it .   the skin seemed to ripple briefly .  suddenly  it looked to its left .  as coffee watched  the skin changed hue and texture  dappling and darkening .      nyom     coffee said     i recommend against this .  we should abort and try another avenue .         why  coffee .      the strange robot regarded coffee with an attitude of almost human curiosity  as if to say yes  coffee  why .      i am unable to define my reasons      coffee said .     the situation has too many unexpected variables .  for instance  i do not know what this is .     coffee aimed a digit at the robot before it .      come on      the dockworker said  exasperated .     we don   t have time for this shit .  the crew will be back any minute  you take it or leave it .  you drop this ride  your chances of getting another one go way down .      nyom turned to her group .     it   s up to you     she said .     do we go .      the refugees murmured among themselves briefly  then hands went up .     we go     most of them said .   nyom frowned as she turned to the dockworker .     i repeat  anything goes wrong on this  i   ll have parts of you as souvenirs .          what  you think we   re going to ruin our reputation .  come on  we   re professionals  we do this all the time .  now  can be get a move on .         coffee     nyom said     you just pay close attention to everything .          yes  nyom .      the robot facing it spun gracefully and walked up the ramp  into the bin .  the baleys filed in  one by one .   nyom hung back  close to coffee .     what   s wrong  coffee .         that robot      coffee began .      the tally doesn   t add up     the dockworker interrupted .  he held up a pad .     i did a head count .  we   re missing one .         i know     nyom said .     it happens .  someone gets cold feet at the last minute  they don   t show .  can   t call it off on account of one or two who change their minds  can you .         no  i suppose not .  but my people don   t like it .         i don   t care what they don   t like .      the dockworker shrugged .     so we have one extra couch .  everyone else showed  though .         everyone else did .     nyom gestured .     where   d you get that robot .         gamelin .  didn   t get him anywhere .  he   s part of the connection on the other end .         he   s .  .  . different .         he is that .  well  you ready .  everyone else is on board .      nyom nodded and walked up the ramp .  coffee followed .   within  the light was dim  provided mainly by a single flash held by the robot  gamelin  and the readylights on the hulking rebreather unit in the middle of the deck .  gamelin was helping people settle into the couches that were stacked to the ceiling  and answering questions in a quiet  raspy voice .  coffee began checking those already settled in .   the hatch came up  then  and gamelin activated the internal seals .  coffee squatted by the control panel of the rebreather and began running a diagnostic .      don   t you trust me .     gamelin asked .      what model are you .     nyom asked .     i   ve never seen one like you .          you won   t again     gamelin said  turning toward her .     better get into your couch .       the bin lurched and nyom nearly fell .  gamelin caught her arm and steadied her .      no talking     gamelin announced .     uses too much air .      coffee did a second check on the rebreather .  everything read optimal .  it straightened and watched gamelin help nyom with her straps .      and the mask          i have my own     nyom said .   gamelin hesitated .     very efficient .      coffee approached gamelin .     you did not answer nyom   s question .  what model are you .         i   m a prototype .  i don   t have a model designation .          are you solarian .  i am unfamiliar with any auroran design even in the planning stage from which you might be derived .          how long   s it been since you were on aurora .         thirty six years .         things might   ve changed  don   t you think .         very probably .  that is why i ask .         solarian .  now get to your ready station .  we   ve got ten minutes before the shuttle lifts .      coffee returned to a place beside the rebreather .  gamelin climbed lithely into one of the couches .       what happened .  the scene shifted .  .  .     one of the agents complained .     coffee shifted briefly to standby     derec explained .     nothing recorded during an essentially uneventful period .  all telemetry is on  but .  .  .       the cargo bin was in freefall  on a trajectory to kopernik on board a shuttle .  two or three people groaned .  coffee bent to the rebreather control panel and checked the readings on individual respiration .      there is a problem     it said .      what .     nyom asked .  she pulled herself out of the couch and swam quickly to coffee .       where   d she learn to do that .     rana wondered .       the monitor indicates distress     coffee said .     breathing is becoming impaired .         what the  we have a defective rebreather .         nothing   s defective     gamelin said  sliding across the bin .     everything   s working fine .         i disagree     coffee said .     according to this          shut up  tinhead .  time to put on a standard mask  ms .  looms .      nyom shot a look at gamelin .     what are you       gamelin reached for her .  she writhed in mid air and slammed a foot against its chest  launching herself backward .  her shoulders banged into the strutwork supporting a bank of couches .   gamelin pursued  one arm extended  reaching .      stop     coffee said .     you will cause injury .         exactly      gamelin said .   coffee twisted around and grabbed gamelin   s shoulder .  coffee   s grip closed on softer material than expected .  gamelin jerked around beneath the grip and pulled free  hissing in clear pain .   coffee opened its hand and saw  in its enhanced vision  a mass of fabric and dermis mingled thickly with blood .   the scene lurched .  coffee watched  immobile  as gamelin chased nyom looms around the bin  while all around people were moaning louder .  several had ripped off their masks  gasping .  coffee looked down at the rebreather .       why doesn   t it do something .     one of the agents asked .     it   s caught in a dilemma     rana said .     it just hurt something that might be human .  it doesn   t know what to do .        human .       suddenly  gamelin caught nyom .  coffee looked up to see her struggle briefly while gamelin got a grip on her head and gave a short  sharp yank .  the snap of bone sounded horribly loud .   gamelin let nyom   s body go and pulled something from its belt .  it went to one of the clear surfaces and aimed the tool .  a brilliant spark leapt at the bulkhead .      stop     coffee ordered .     you will breach the integrity of the container .         stop me  tinhead     gamelin said .     if you can .         i       suddenly  gamelin drew back and punched up .  the loud bang filled the chamber .  a moment later  he pushed both hands through the crack he had made and heaved .  blood oozed from the wound on his shoulder .  air whistled through the hole .   gamelin swam back to the robot and came close to its face .      they   ll suffocate if they don   t put their masks back on     he said .  then he returned to his couch .   coffee went from person to person  urging them to replace their masks .  some were already dead  though .  coffee seemed to realize then that the rebreather was poisoning them .   it knelt by the unit and tried to run a systems purge .  that did not work  so it began stabbing the disconnect  all the while the air inexorably leaked from the small chamber .     everyone stared at the now blank screens  mute  the shock clear on their faces .  derec let out his breath slowly .  he looked at rana .      what   .         so where did that thing go .     agent harwol demanded explosively .     obviously  that   s what walked out of your morgue  chief palen  right under the noses of your staff and your surveillance .         coren said it was invisible to his optam     she said .      invisible to your security systems  too .     derec asked .   she looked frightened .     what is it  mr .  avery .  you   re the roboticist .  tell us .         i have no idea .  i   ve never seen anything like it .  coffee couldn   t stop it because it was human .  or seemed human .          that .     harwol exclaimed .      it bled  agent harwol .  it was  is  organic .  up to that point  coffee assumed  as did everyone  that it was a robot .  .  .     he blinked .     a cyborg .         a what .     rana asked .     i didn   t think those were possible .         aurora stopped research on them a long time ago .  not because they aren   t possible  on the contrary  they are very possible .  and much too unpredictable .          we   re impounding all this material     agent harwol declared .     i want every bit of it turned over to us before any more of it goes missing .          to do what with .     derec demanded .     you don   t have the first idea what any of this means .          and you do .  no arguments  mr .  avery  this material is  now under tbi jurisdiction  and you are under arrest .         for what .         criminal negligence  for a start .  until we find that robot  i   m holding you responsible .  you were working for us on this and an important piece of evidence is missing .         for the sake of      palen said .     stop it .  just what do you think you   re accomplishing by all this .         i   m putting the lid on a bad situation on its way to becoming worse  chief palen     harwol barked .     you   re suspended  pending an investigation into abuse of authority .  you had no mandate to indulge in this sort of an investigation          you   re going to make a mess of this whole thing          enough .  i want this lab quarantined and everything in it held in stasis till i decide what to do with it .  you have overstepped your authority in this matter  and the tbi is now taking over the investigation .         damn it   .     palen began .   harwol aimed a finger at her as if it were a weapon .      another word  chief palen     he said .     one more .      she restrained herself with a visible effort .      you   re an idiot     derec said .     you could   ve just asked .         i   m afraid  agent harwol      hofton said then     that you lack the authority to make arrests on auroran territory .         kopernik station is an earth incorporated zone     harwol said .     security is handled by terran authority under specific treaty  which is why chief palen here has the authority to police even the spacer and settler areas .  i am relieving her of that position and assuming that authority .         that   s thin  harwol     palen said .     really  really thin .         maybe  but that   s what i   m doing .  i can damn well make arrests here  and i damn well will .  you may file a complaint through proper channels and it will be considered at that time  but till then i am in charge of station security and you      he pointed at derec      are under arrest .           i   m sorry  sir .  i didn   t know .  i was under the impression that auroran embassy grounds were accorded the same privileges as the main mission .       hofton looked agonized .  derec had never seen the man so distraught .  he sat on the other side of the narrow holding cell  elbows on knees  shoulders hunched  his face stretched by internal doubt and self loathing .      you can   t be expected to know everything  hofton     derec said .      i don   t     hofton said .     but i should know everything about my job .      derec looked across  through the mesh of his cell door  to the cell opposite his .  the spacer who had been arrested the day derec had arrived still waited within it .  in all the confusion  he had been forgotten .      it   s understandable     derec said .     harwol and the others saw something they don   t understand .  naturally  their reaction is to put anything they don   t understand in a cell .         all expectations for rational action and maturity notwithstanding     hofton said gloomily .      doesn   t matter .  the relevant point is  you still have a job .  i accept your apology .  now  let   s figure out how to solve our problems .      hofton continued to stare at a spot on the floor for several seconds .  then he drew a deep breath  straightened  and nodded .      you   re right  of course     he said .     what do you propose .         thales withheld information for some reason .  there   s no way that robot could have done anything with thales knowing .     derec thought about that .     scratch that .  without thales instigating it .  assuming for the moment thales won   t say anything to anyone but us  then the first opportunity we get to question it alone          that may be very difficult .  harwol has an agent in the lab at all times .         hmm .  all right  then the first thing we have to do is get some idea of what that thing is we saw in the recovered memories .  they all saw that  there   s nothing left to hide from the tbi .  contact ariel  go over it with her .         you said it   s a cyborg .         that   s my best guess  but i wouldn   t mind being contradicted .  if somebody has a better idea  i   d love to hear it .         assuming you   re correct  though  what then .         then we have a real problem .  harwol and his people have no idea .  if it   s a cyborg  it was certainly not created out of thin air .  there   s infrastructure behind it  industry  an impressive application of technology .  which means money .  more than likely  if there   s one  there are more .         whose money .         that   s one good question .  the other is  what do they have to do with baleys .         baleys in general  or those going to nova levis specifically .         right now it could be either one .  when you talk to ariel  find out if lanra has any statistics on the number of baleys going out each year that arrive dead .  or just disappear .         with all due respect to mr .  lanra  how would he get such statistics .  the settler colonies are not all willing to provide earth with data .  census figures alone represent a major problem .         mmm .  well  maybe he knows someone who can get those numbers .  i just need to know if one colony above any other is having a problem with this .      hofton nodded .     i   ll see what i can find out .  anything else .         can you go in and out of the lab .         for the time being .     he grinned wryly .     i   m a bit of a gray area for them .  they don   t quite know how to handle me .  i   ve threatened them with ambassador setaris .         then get me an update from thales .         yes  sir .  shall i see about getting you out of here .         eventually  yes .  for now  though  i   ve got some thinking to do  and this is as good a place as any .          yes  sir .  anything else .         call me derec .      hofton stood .     i   ll see what i can do .  sir .      hofton placed his hand against the lock pad .  the door opened for him  after he passed through  the mesh slid back into place .  if derec had tried to follow hofton a stunner would have knocked him back very firmly .   a few minutes later  the main door opened again and two of palen   s uniforms brought a man into the block .  they escorted him into a cell at the opposite end from the main door  locked him in  and left without glancing at derec or the other prisoner .   derec strained to see into the cell of the new inmate  but the man had flopped onto his cot .   derec looked across the concourse at the other spacer .      so what did you do that got you thrown in here .     derec called .   the spacer sat up .  after a few seconds of contemplation  the man went to his cell door  placed his hand on the lock  and walked out .  with a glance in the direction of the newcomer  he came quietly up to derec   s door  opened it  and entered the cell .  the door slid shut and the spacer sat down where hofton had been sitting .   derec stared at him .     you   re one of palen   s people .      he grinned .     right on the first guess .  they didn   t lie when they said you were bright .     he extended his hand .     masid vorian  station security .      derec shook masid   s hand .     so i suppose you heard everything we discussed .         most of it .  don   t worry about the tbi  though .  the cell monitoring system is keyed to sipha   s password .  she shut it down after harwol and his eager fools showed up .  so they   ll never know what you discussed with your man  or what you and i talk about now .      derec nodded toward the door .     what about the new prisoner .         must be a legitimate arrest .  his escorts would   ve given me some kind of warning if he was a plant or something .  don   t worry  i doubt he can hear our conversation  either .         and what are we talking about now .         the same thing .     masid leaned forward earnestly .     you need to understand one thing  sipha palen is a good cop .  she   s honest  dedicated  and a magnificent pain in the ass to work for as a result  but she   s sincere about the job .         i never doubted it .      masid nodded once .     but it gets her in trouble .  that   s the reason she   s up here and not running a department on the ground .          honest to a fault .         she doesn   t always know when to shut up .     he grinned .     in certain circles  it can be a real deficit .         she planted you in the lab .         no  i was already there .  i   m a turned agent .  i used to work for settler security .  sipha found out and made a deal with me  work for her  at least part time  or she   d expose me .         forgive me  but you look like a spacer .      masid made a mock bow .     native of proclas .         then how   .         it   s a long story .  the short version is  i was trained as an information specialist  but  frankly  it   s boring work .  proclans are agrarian by temperament  but you can   t maintain much of a civilization growing vegetables .  i started freelancing .  the government called it treason and i had to leave .  i ran an independent merchant ship for a while  then went to work for the theian intelligence service on pax commari          that   s a settler colony .         yes  it is .  theia sponsored it .  anyway  i decided that what i was doing was crass and unethical  so i turned myself in to the local intelligence people .  they had absolutely no use for me  but  lucky me    .  . they knew someone who did .  i ended up working for the settler coalition .          i didn   t know they had an intelligence arm .          not very many people do .  their biggest concern is smuggling .  post to post to post  i ended up here .      he raised his arms .     that   s the short version .  some day when we have time and a good deal to drink  i   ll give you the full version  which is a lot more interesting .          so you work for palen part of the time .         at this point  i   d have to say i work for palen all of the time .  she made me a good deal .  over the last few years  i   ve found myself with a growing case of loyalty to her .          that impressive .         i respect her     masid said .   the way he said it  derec got the immediate sense of a vast and profound commitment  that respect was something masid vorian esteemed above all else .      all right     derec said slowly .     i presume that the arrangement is  you work with the aurorans for a time and when you have something to report you get yourself arrested .         basically .  most of the time information is easily sent through a secured comm channel .  but sometimes something comes up that requires a personal meet .         what prompted this one .         baleys .  lots of very dead baleys .           there   s a regular route  always has been     masid explained .     the bays change  but usually they   re settler .  baleys have been leaving kopernik for years via the same avenues  fifty  a hundred years .  we estimated that on an average year maybe five  six thousand people leave earth through clandestine channels .  occasionally  the number goes as high as ten or twelve thousand .  ite cracks down periodically  the numbers drop to less than a thousand  then pick back up .      a couple of years ago we started seeing a massive surge  twelve  thirteen  fifteen thousand a year .  i think this had to do with the politics  eliton   s whole concessionism kick  and then the collapse of talks last year .  i think a lot of baleys are afraid all the avenues are about to be shut down .      in the middle of this frantic running  though  we started hearing rumors from some of the settler crews that a number of shipments went missing .  i started doing a little digging among my old settler contacts .  i found out that transfers were being made mid journey by certain ships  destinations changed  baleys offloaded and sent somewhere else .  too many claims to ignore .          pirates .     derec asked .      that   s an easy accusation to make .  tell me  what is pirate .  black market  certainly .  but fine  let   s assume for the sake of this discussion we   re talking about pirates .  then what are they doing .  a lot of so called pirate ships are already dealing in baley running .  a lot of them have quasilegal status and come into port regularly .  no warrants  no evidence to hold them  we let them go .  the ships offloading the baleys aren   t doing so under duress  so it   s a business deal .  but for who .  the money being paid by baleys and some of the recipient colonies is a lot  but i don   t see how the margin makes it worthwhile stealing the baleys after they   re already en route .  so where are they being taken .         you found out .      masid shook his head .     not exactly .  a lot of talk has them going to nova levis .  of course  that   s quarantined  so it   s not likely we   re going to find any ship   s owners willing to admit they   re making runs there .  the pirate ships taking the baleys on never come to kopernik .  but let   s assume that one or two colonies have hired mercenary shippers and are paying premiums to steal baleys .  why .  what do baleys have that could be marketable under illicit conditions .         labor .  possibly blackmail of family .         no blackmail  not a single demand .  labor  sure .  but you can buy cheap labor from companies like imbitek and morris and some of the others .  there are some colonies buying robots from spacers .  so  if it   s not labor  what is it .      derec shook his head .      bodies .         organs .         what else .  on spec i recommended that a shipload of baleys be traced and intercepted en route .  a joint auroran terran venture was set up .  it took four tries to find a transfer  but we found one and the ship was taken .  the baleys were already dead  in stasis .  medical quality stasis .  eighty three of them .  we had a few arriving shipments intercepted here and at least three of them contained already dead baleys .         why didn   t you shut it all down if you knew about the shipments .         two reasons  we don   t know about all the shipments  and we still don   t know who   s killing them and selling the corpses .  ongoing investigation  we need to keep it quiet till we can shut down the source .  i know  it   s terrible .  people are dying .  but that   s the way it is .         how many .     derec asked .      so far  three hundred plus .  we   ve been trying to infiltrate baley groups  see where they   re going .  our agents have been turning up dead  too .  some of them in very unpleasant ways .  the worst was chiava .         chiava .         the brethe dealer you heard about .  right here  in her holding cell .          chief palen worked her the same way she works you .      masid nodded .     she worked dockside vice mostly  not this .  she found something related to my investigation .          did she have time to tell palen .         no .  she was brought in while sipha was away .  by the time sipha returned .  .  .         what i don   t understand     derec said     is where the market for this is .  organs can be grown  you don   t have to do gross transplants .          spacer medical tech is expensive .          that   s facile .  it   s also safer .  the only reason .  .  .     derec caught his breath .     the baleys in question .  you identified them .         as many as we could .  some had bought very expensive privacy locks on their pasts .         how many of them were orphans .         orphans .         yes  orphans .      masid blinked and shrugged .     i don   t know .         find out .         you have an idea what   s going on .         just an idea .  a very tenuous idea .       masid nodded .     you look like you hope you   re wrong .          that  too .     derec studied masid for a time .     so what are you still doing in here .         oh  that .  well .     masid smiled sheepishly .     i   m bait .          twenty one    i     ve called for an embassy limousine     ariel said .     it should be here shortly .      ree wenithal gave her a gloomy look  as if now regretting to go along with them .  he had drunk four cups of coffee and swallowed a stimulant pill  and his mood had grown ever more somber .   coren scowled at him .     don   t tell us you   ve changed your mind and don   t want to go .  would you rather wait for tresha and gamelin .      wenithal looked startled .     who .      coren almost smiled .     your collectors .  the ones you   ve been waiting for .      ariel watched them regard each other  ree wenithal clearly unsettled and coren smugly observant .      we standing around playing who knows     jeta fromm asked     or moving somewhere safer .      coren laughed .     come on .  is there anything else you want to bring .         no     wenithal said grudgingly  and stepped to the door .   ariel touched coren   s elbow .  when he looked at her  she pointed to his shoulder .     are you all right .         i could use some painblock and a stimulant right now     he said     but i can move .       they exited onto the balcony warily  ariel coming out last .  third shift was still a few hours from ending and the quiet made the warren seem deserted .  coren led the way down the steps to the courtyard and out to the avenue .  ariel went last  glancing anxiously over her shoulder  trying unsuccessfully to see into the shadows .  she gripped the stunner in her pocket  knowing it would be next to useless against the thing that attacked them earlier  but unwilling to release its illusion of effectiveness .   far to the right  at the end of the avenue  music and laughter reached them from a bar  otherwise  the area was still .  they pressed back against the wall and waited in silence .   ariel jumped when the limousine pulled onto the avenue .  the long black vehicle stopped and the rear door slid open .  as they neared the vehicle  two men emerged and quickly flanked wenithal and jeta .  wenithal stopped short  but jeta whirled around  glaring .      what is this  gato .     she demanded .   coren stopped before her .     it   s for everyone   s piece of mind .  .  . tresha .      she frowned at him .     my name is jeta fromm .         i doubt it     coren said .     but we can sort it out later  when we   re in comfort and security .     he looked at ariel .     is this going to cause problems .         nothing i   m not used to     ariel said .  she addressed the guards .     screen them .      one of the men took out a pad and walked around the pair .  he reached inside jeta tresha   s jacket and removed a pistol .     that   s all  ambassador .         good .  in the limousine  please .       the guard took tresha   s pack  then wenithal and tresha were ushered into the capacious backseat .  the guards watched them from the facing seat .  ariel went around to the passenger side front and got in .   coren closed the door and leaned against the jamb .      i   m going somewhere else     he said .   ariel wanted to protest  but held back .     i see .  i   ll stay with these people  then  and set them up at the embassy .      he nodded .  his eyes shut briefly .     when i get there  i think i   d better sleep .         you wouldn   t want to tell me where you   re going  would you .         not now .     he smiled wearily .     deniability and all that .  besides  i really don   t know just exactly where .  .  .     he shook his head .     get them to the embassy and safe .  i   ll comm when i   m finished .       he pushed away from the limo .  the door closed .  ariel watched him walk wearily away .  she felt a sharp reluctance to let him out of her sight .  for a moment she wanted to get out of the limousine and go with him  trusting the limo and the guards to get her passengers to the embassy .   not very responsible  she thought peevishly .   coren rounded a distant comer  disappearing from sight .  ariel leaned back in the seat  wondering at her uneasy mix of emotions .      embassy     ariel said .  she glanced over her shoulder at tresha and wenithal  and wondered idly how much of a diplomatic mess she had just created .  only i they complain  she thought .      yes  ambassador     the car replied and rolled on .      this is nonsense     wenithal said .      what   s changed .     ariel asked .     you were prepared to shoot whoever came through your door earlier .      he glowered  then let his head fall back .  within a couple of minutes his eyes closed and his breathing deepened .  ariel wondered just how much alcohol he had drunk before they had arrived .  then she wondered how often people had thought that about her .   tresha glared at ariel  straight backed and on edge  hands pressed against her thighs .  her backpack lay on the seat between the guards .      that looks heavy     ariel said .     what do you have in there .         why .         just curious .       tresha frowned .     my chops .  code bummer  datum  decrypter .  some clothes .      ariel waited to see if tresha would volunteer more .  when she remained silent  ariel asked     why nova levis .         time .  there   s a list and a schedule .  nova levis had the earliest opening .  besides  you hear there   s a lot of tech there .         you do .         they say  sure .         it was an agrarian colony  started up by the church of organic sapiens .      tresha blinked at her .     they changed  then .     she shrugged .     so  do you believe mr .  lanra .  that i   m not who i say i am .         does it matter .  either you are and you need our help  or you aren   t and we need to keep you under guard .       tresha shook her head .     meddling .  spacers are always meddling .  why is that .  what   s all this to you .      ariel considered giving tresha a glib answer  predigested and politic .  it   s my job  i was ordered to help .  true as far as it went  but ariel had never done anything purely for surface reasons .  in this case  she felt she would have been justified to tell setaris no and let herself be rotated back to aurora as she expected to be .   she understood derec   s motives  he wanted to get his hands on a positronics lab one more time .  the ground mission   s lab was denied him and  though he still retained thales  he simply could not do the research he wanted .  and he wanted to stay on earth  a desire about which she had grown ambivalent in the last year .   she understood coren lanra   s motives  though she suspected there was more than he had admitted .   ariel even understood sen setaris and the policy under which she had delegated the assignment .   but her own motives for going along with it .      until two hours ago i didn   t know     she said .     then i saw the enemy .         when they arrived at the embassy  ariel summoned an extra security team to escort wenithal and tresha to separate apartments .     i want someone watching them full time  highest level surveillance .      she went directly to her own apartment  then .      any messages  jennie .     ariel asked .      thales requests that you check in as soon as possible .          thank you  jennie .     she tapped a code for the embassy security office .     i want an id run  please .  there is a woman just installed in the secure apartments calling herself jeta fromm .  verify .  check against records for a woman named tresha  last name unknown .      as she stepped into the corridor  she felt a brief wave of weariness .  she had been going for too long a stretch without more than ten minutes    sleep .  ariel shrugged it off and headed to derec   s apartment .      thales  do you have something for me .     she asked as she entered derec   s workspace .      a number of items  ariel .  i have completed the recovery from the subject .  derec and hofton have already viewed the relevant memories .      ariel   s pulse quickened .  she sat down .     then show me .      ariel watched the entire episode  from the point where nyom looms confronted the dockworker to the point when collapse occurred after the murders of all the baleys .  she did not move when it was done  staring at the screen .  she felt warm  and a distant anger she knew would only grow with time .      do you wish to review any part of the material  ariel .     thales finally asked .      no .  where   s derec .         in custody .  the tbi have intervened and assumed authority over the investigation on kopernik .      ariel stood .     wait .     she went to derec   s bathroom and found a container of stim pills .  she swallowed two and returned to thales .     all right  thales  tell me what   s happened .         she took the embassy shunt to setaris   s offices .   unexpectedly  ambassador setaris was in .      come in  ariel  come in     setaris said as ariel walked in .     my door is always open for interesting people  and you   ve been so very interesting lately .       setaris sat behind her desk  gazing at the subetheric .  ariel glanced at it and saw jonis taprin speaking to a reporter in a formal interview setting .  the sound was off .      derec avery is in custody     setaris said .     the tbi have seized control of kopernik security from chief sipha palen and are making very loud noises about security leaks and subversion .  i have a protest filed from ambassador chassik demanding you be censured and dismissed from all embassy duties  pending an investigation of your fitness for executive responsibilities .     she gestured at the subetheric .     senator taprin has been making very obnoxious noises about the treaties concerning our embassy missions .  what did you do to him  ariel .  he   s been almost shrill about reviewing spacer presence on earth .         nothing recently .      setaris smiled wanly .     it   s been a very long day .  you   ve been excessively diligent in your assignment .         why is derec in custody .         the tbi said something about evidence tampering and hindering an investigation .  it   s the sort of charge they make when they don   t know what really has them angry .  you two have stirred up a lot of trouble .         i don   t see how .  we haven   t done all that much yet .         yes  but you   ve done it in all the right places .  you two have the damnedest luck .  gale basically wants you to stop looking into nova levis .     setaris frowned .     you didn   t know derec avery was under arrest .         i just got back in     ariel said evasively .      then why did you come here .  i expected a barrage of protest and a demand to have him released .         maybe later .     she leaned on setaris   s desk .     why are we hiding a solarian national .      setaris frowned .     i   m sorry  would you repeat that .         rotij polifos .      setaris nodded slowly .     what do you know about him .         derec got suspicious of him .  neither of us knew much about him  except that he   s been director of the lab on kopernik for six  almost seven years .  that   s a long time for an auroran to hold a post here .          i   ve been here nearly twelve years  ariel .         we   re diplomats  we   re different .  for someone like polifos  it   s an eternity .  when i checked  i discovered that he had never once requested rotation to another post .  no one from any office has questioned his long residency on kopernik .  nothing you   d expect to happen in his position has happened .  his stipend hasn   t even changed in six years .          and why did you conclude he   s a solarian national .         a couple of things .  a background check on his name came up with an old solarian family  for one  but there are no birth records or citizenship papers for him .  the family itself has only two remaining members and  like most solarians  they   re recluses .  the other thing is that all his auroran documentation originated here .         how did you manage to learn that .         i   m very good at my job .  the third detail is precedent .  we   ve done this before with defectors who may be subject to extradition under the fifty worlds mutual accords .  did i guess wrong .         no .  but          i   m not finished .  i did another search then  one i wouldn   t have thought to do .  we   ve been so busy tracking down who used to own nova levis we never thought to find out who worked there .  five researchers were senior staff they ran the research protocols .  it was their lab .  four of them are dead .      setaris regarded her quietly .     and the fifth .         was a solarian .  he vanished .  interestingly enough  the document trail for rotij polifos begins shortly before nova levis was closed down .  the solarian presumably returned to solaria  but i could find no evidence that he ever got there .  a couple years later  polifos assumes directorship of the positronics lab on kopernik .       setaris nodded .     as you say  you   re very good at what you do .  though this isn   t exactly your job .         it has become my job     ariel said .      point taken .  anything else .      ariel felt herself get angry then .  setaris was being    diplomatic    and neutral  superficially uninvolved     professional     she would say .  ariel decided to thoroughly ruin her day .     did you know about the cyborgs .      setaris   s face lost all expression for a moment .  her skin paled then .     you   re joking .         i wish i were .       setaris   s face flexed with comprehension  brow furrowing deeply  mouth opening and closing wordlessly  eyes scanning the surface of the desk as if for something lost .  it took less than a minute for her to regain composure .  when she did  though  all the casual annoyance and alloyed humor were gone  replaced by pragmatic professionalism .      tell me what you know     she said .      what i know isn   t much .  what i saw .  .  . coren lanra claimed he saw a robot with masking capabilities .  what i saw tonight could only be a cyborg .  it   s entirely probable that it   s what he saw as well .  the blood sample derec took from the collapsed robot   s hand is more than likely a close relative of nyom looms .  the material mixed with the sample  myralar  suggests robotics  but until tonight it made no sense to me .       she blew out a breath .     nova levis is still technically owned by solaria .  it was renamed after a settler colony leased it from them  but the original title never transferred .  there is also an old research lab  here on earth  called nova levis  among which i found gale chassik listed as an original shareholder .  plus rega looms and alda mikels .  tonight i met a retired policeman who was investigating kidnappings twenty some years ago who says that  among other things  a number of infants were taken from orphanages here and transported offworld .  he suspected a slave trade .  but several of these infants were hopelessly handicapped .  .  . upds  he called them .  nova levis was one of the labs he   d investigated  but he claims that it was clear of any culpability .      setaris shook her head .     what did the lab do .  and what does all this have to do with cyborgs .         i don   t know .  nova levis the lab was involved in prosthetics research  though .          why did it fail .  prosthetics is a fairly lucrative field on earth .          i don   t know that  either      ariel replied .     what i want to know is if this blockade around nova levis has anything to do with it .  with cyborgs .  i want to know if you knew .          why would i have known .         because you gave me some pathetic reasons to start this investigation .       setaris raised an eyebrow .     assuming i did  why wouldn   t i tell you .         oh  some sort of attempt at objectification .  maybe  though  you knew but had no proof .  you wanted me to verify your suspicions .         rather shabby use of my people  wouldn   t you think .         it wouldn   t have been the first time .      setaris narrowed her eyes .     when this is over  ariel  i will sit you down and give you a lesson in the realities of the diplomat   s life .  you   ve been able to function largely unaffected by them since you   ve been here .  in the meantime          in the meantime     ariel interjected     i need derec out of jail  and i want a little cooperation from the tbi .  i don   t think diplomacy will solve this particular problem .      setaris frowned  and gestured toward the guest chairs .     sit down  ariel .  shut your mouth while i tell you what the situation actually is .  then  if you want to make demands  i   ll listen .          twenty two    c  oren leaned against the wall and gently kneaded his neck and shoulder .  the pain was growing worse  on top of his lack of sleep  he wondered if he could manage what he intended to do .  he pulled his comm out and stared at the keypad  trying to think .  he still lacked necessary information .   he tapped in kelvy torans    code .  he almost gave up just as she finally answered .      kelvy  it   s coren .         please tell me you   re near my apartment     she said brightly .      actually  no .  i   m sorry to bother you so late          i wasn   t sleeping  anyway .  something it sounds like you should be doing .  are you all right .         just tired .  long hours .  i   m never letting rega run for office again .      she laughed .     in that case  i suppose you   re calling to see if i have that information you wanted .         do you .         as a matter of fact .  .  . hold on a moment .  .  .      coren listened to indistinct noises for a few seconds .  then      okay  we have lots of good stuff     kelvy said .     once i started looking into this  i found all kinds of things i can use  so i suppose i owe you part of my commission .  captras biomed  bought by the hunter group .  it wasn   t exactly a voluntary sale  myler towne and his faction actually tried to block it .  he nearly lost the chairmanship over it .  now  hunter bought it through one of its subsidiaries  kysler diversified  who also bought that research lab you mentioned  nova levis .  one very interesting detail i found was that towne   s mother was on the original shareholders board of nova levis  she   s since deceased .  what makes a lot of this interesting is in the dispersal of the company assets .  a good portion of the research documentation went to captras biomed  which was a small start up back then  and later was bought out by imbitek .  it was alda mikels    first acquisition upon becoming a board member of imbitek .         mikels was an original shareholder of nova levis .             very good .  indeed he was .  as was rega looms .  in fact  there was a bidding war over captras between looms and mikels .         why would rega have wanted it .         you   d have to ask him .  very uncharacteristic of him .     coren mentally added it to the list of things he intended to ask rega .     all right  so myler towne got rid of captras  but he didn   t want hunter to have it .  why not .         alda mikels is  was  a board member of kysler diversified .         is there any other connection between kysler and imbitek .         kysler once made an offer to acquire controlling ownership of imbitek  but it failed .         and when did mikels buy into kysler .         about two years after that attempt .         so mikels bought the company that bought nova levis   s research material  and now is trying to reacquire that material through a competitor to his own company .         my guess .  this is insurance  in case mikels can   t defeat towne in a shareholder vote .         was captras that lucrative .         as a percentage of imbitek .     kelvy replied .     it performed a few points better than most imbitek holdings  but not spectacularly so .  however  the hunter group owns a number of other biomed companies on settler colonies .  recently  they consolidated some of them under kysler management .  add what captras could bring to the fold  you have a very large and progressive biotech industry with established markets on several worlds .  what all those companies lacked till now was a licensed vendor on earth .  captras gives them that .         so that   s what made you so happy .         i   m already moving on kysler stock .         assuming mikels loses to towne  he has a ready made position with this new company .         new company .  what new company .         at a guess  he   ll call it nova levis     coren said .      maybe .  .  . which brings up another thing .  nova levis was not unprofitable .  there was no reason for it to shut down .         i thought it had been under suspicion in a police investigation .       kelvy made a harsh sound .     companies get investigated all the time  they don   t close up shop and sell their assets over it .  often such an investigation benefits them .  when they   re cleared of any charges  it   s like getting a recommendation from the police .  their market value rises .          nova levis .  .  .  .         increased in value .  the investigation did not shut it down .  a year afterward  the board began buying up out standing shares .  it took six months for them to gain the necessary control to sell  over the loud protests of a number of shareholders .         what happened to the rest of the shares .         over time kysler bought them all out .  even after nova levis ceased to be a corporate entity  kysler paid options and bought off the last few until no outstanding stock remained .  but now here   s the thing .  when captras biomed sold to kysler  it did so through a blind .  at least a dozen former nova levis shareholders made up that blind  all of whom were shareholders in imbitek  all of whom sold their shares in imbitek and bought shares in kysler .         so they bought their own company .         in essence .          one thing .  .  . what was the primary focus of nova levis .         ah  now that took some digging .  you know me  i   m not the most tech literate .  primarily  they were doing research and development on chronic inorganic infectious syndromes .      coren wrestled with the term for a few moment .     what .      kelvy chuckled .     my words exactly .  i   m not sure exactly what they are  but i get the impression that these are diseases caused by allergic reactions to certain technologies  old nanotech  specifically .  you don   t hear about them much anymore because we pretty much beat them  but once in a while some poor child is born with a dysfunction that   s basically untreatable .         upds .  .  .         that   s one term  yes .  do you know something about this .         no  not really .  i   ve just heard about it  i don   t know what it is .  how many children .         it varies .  between ten and a hundred a year .  most of them don   t live very long .  quarantine is about the only thing to do .      coren thought about that .     you said we beat them .  how .         that would take a little more research than i thought you wanted .     she paused .     what do you think .         i think .  .  . dinner at rhiomay   s and a foot massage afterward .         that good .  i hope you don   t stop at the feet .      coren grunted .     how long have you known me .         not long enough  coren  love .  not nearly long enough .         thanks  kelvy  this has been a great help .  um .  .  . by the way  have you ever heard of something called a    decompiler    .         sure .  curiously enough  given what we   ve been talking about  they   re a class molecular reagent .  nanotech  used mainly for terraforming on colonies .      coren blinked .     you knew that off the top of your head .         i didn   t two days ago .  it   s one of captras biomed   s main exports .  they   re banned on earth .         i see .  well .  this definitely extends things to the calves and thighs  too .      kelvy laughed languorously .     can   t wait .  call me when you   re done doing whatever it is you   re doing .  i   m dying to hear the details .          no doubt .  talk to you soon .      coren broke the connection and pocketed the comm .   all the lists began to make sense now .  shareholders .  follow the credits .  coren had always relied on the money trail to tell him which way to turn  who to look at .  this one was nearly a maze  an ouroboros swallowing its own tail .   rega .  .  . how deeply into all this are you .  .  .  .   one or two questions remained  besides the big one .  who had killed nyom .  and why .   coren lanra shuddered  from weariness and despair .   nyom .  .  .   the hunter group owned the warehouses .  they owned kysler diversified  which now owned nova levis .  apparently they also owned the colony nova levis  or cassus thole  whichever name it went by .  alda mikels owned a good piece of that .   coren rubbed his eyes and looked down the avenue to the innocuous entrance at the t crossing .  myler towne lived behind that door .  coren fished a pill from another pocket and popped it into his mouth .  he had waited till he knew what he wanted from towne before taking the stim .  now he was ready .  he waited for the clarity and temporary strength and the illusion of rested power .   it came like a coolness over his skin  a slight increase in hearing sensitivity  and an internal rush in his muscles .  he pushed away from the wall and started down the street .     towne wore a deep green dressing gown and sat in an enormous wingbacked chair that he still managed to dwarf .   del socras stood within arm   s length of coren .  he had supervised a very thorough search of coren before bringing him to see towne .  coren felt uneasy without any weapons .      unusual hour for you  mr .  lanra     towne said .     or maybe not .  it is for me  certainly .          sorry if this is inconvenient for you     coren said .     but i think we need to talk .          i agree .  have you given my proposal further consideration .         some .  i   m afraid i have to turn you down for the most part .      towne raised his eyebrows .         the most part    .  intriguing choice of words .         i find that i   ve done work for you in the course of doing my job .  i need to know a few things  though  to be sure .         are you suggesting i owe you compensation .         i may send you a bill .  but for now  let   s just see how much what i   ve done is worth to you .      towne waved his hand as if to say    continue    and eased further back in his chair .      alda mikels is trying to oust you from the chairmanship of imbitek .  he may also be trying to kill you  but he   s certainly trying to frighten you .      towne frowned and glanced at socras .  coren felt the bodyguard   s presence fade .  when he glanced back  socras was gone .      how did you arrive at this conclusion .         circuitously .  someone killed rega looms    daughter .  i   m trying to find out who .         do you think mikels is involved in that .         directly .  no .  but it was his people .         and who are they .         i don   t have names .  .  . yet .  but they all work for the hunter group  in one way or another .  so does mikels .      towne steepled his fingers below his chin and stared at coren for a long time .     you are either very diligent or very lucky  mr .  lanra .  the hunter group wants to buy imbitek .  i   ve no doubt alda is behind the attempt .  even for them  we   re a bit too large and perhaps too dangerous .         who are they .         on earth .  they own shipping companies and warehouses  that   s about it .  off earth  however  they are one of the largest consortiums in the settlers    worlds .  fewer rules  more places to move things when the law tries to compensate for the newness of the colonies .  they own a little of every kind of industry .  no one worried about it two or three centuries ago  before terrans began to go out to space once more  and only spacers existed away from the homeworld .  it   s fairly brutal business out there now .  mind you  i don   t quite understand why hunter wants us  they own comparable firms on several worlds .  maybe it was a prize for alda .         he got them captras biomed .       towne sighed and dropped his hands .     you are very well informed .  that   s disappointing .  i spent a lot of money trying to keep that news from spreading .         why did you want to get rid of captras in the first place .         no real applications .  i   m trying to consolidate imbitek  streamline the company  get us back to our base product .  most of the things captras produces have no use here  they   re all exports .         there   s money in that .         there was money in it for alda  he had the connections .  we   ve been running into higher and higher losses .         hunter .     coren asked .      it   s my opinion that hunter is the legitimate face of the pirate consortiums .  alda has been doing business with them for years  perhaps decades .  alda wants the chair back  but i won   t give it to him .  i have the shareholders on my side .         but he has hunter .         exactly .  so i thought  just to irritate him and give us a better position in the field  it would be smart to get rid of our albatrosses .  i set up a sale for the company with what i had thought was an independent group of investors .  too late i found out that hunter was backing them .     he shrugged .     i still got my price  imbitek shares increased in value  and the last poll among shareholders showed a higher degree of confidence in my leadership .         so now he   s trying to kill you .         it appears that way .     towne narrowed his eyes .     what did nyom looms have to do with all this .         she was running baleys .       towne   s face went slack .     i see .  that   s unfortunate .         you hired a data troll to find some minutes of old board meetings mikels chaired .  she was threatened when she started looking  so she planned to leave earth .  the group of baleys she intended going with was murdered  including nyom .         then i can only say that she was collateral damage .  i can   t imagine anyone would want to kill her .  not anyone involved in all this .         no .  did you know rega looms was an initial investor in nova levis .      another shock registered on towne   s face .     no  i did not .  i know almost nothing about nova levis .         but you know which one i   m talking about .       towne shrugged .     the colony holds no interest for me .         it   s interesting that you don   t have more concern for nova levis  though .  your mother was also a primary shareholder .         so .  that doesn   t mean i was ever privy to the company   s workings .         the company   s material became captras biomed .      towne pursed his lips .     a little knowledge .  .  . the minutes i hired the troll to find concerned exactly that transaction .  i know what products captras started out with  but there was more to nova levis than that  and those records were missing by the time i joined imbitek .  captras was alda   s pet project  and apparently it has returned to its owner .         the minutes .         concerned several topics of a clandestine nature  but none of them nova levis .  quite a bit concerned hunter .         oh .  what connection was that .         weapons  apparently .  hunter deals in arms among the colonies .      coren nodded .     and now they have a very good bioweapons company .          they already had one .         decompilers .          you saw the results of one such misapplication the other day .     towne heaved himself out of his chair .     so .  are you working for me now or not .         i   m working for myself at the moment .  when i   ve finished  maybe we can talk .          good .  what changed your mind about mr .  looms .         i don   t take well to being lied to     coren said .      i see .  then  with that in mind  let me tell you this  one of imbitek   s many .  .  . subsidiary interests .  .  . is in baleys .  i learned upon assuming the chairmanship that we  plus two or three other firms  run illicit trade through a variety of avenues .  nothing direct  purely through ancillary personnel  many of whom do not even know they work for us .  i   ve been looking into shutting all this down  but not fast enough .  alda   s people have been attacking several of our illicit ventures  including the baley running .  in the last ten months we   ve lost eighteen shipments of baleys .  we recovered three of them .  they were all dead .      he stepped closer to coren .     your mr .  looms    daughter was apparently using one of our egresses .  the murderers were attacking me  mr .  lanra .     he blinked furiously .     i   m .  .  . sorry .      for a few seconds  coren felt something like pity for towne .  he believed that the man truly was sorry .     i appreciate your honesty  mr .  towne .         one more thing  then .  i didn   t acquire those minutes through the data troll i hired  she never returned to me with the requested information .  i used another source to obtain them .  i have no idea where that troll went .         her name was jeta fromm .         yes .         how long ago did you hire her .         almost four months ago .      coren nodded .     that   s useful to know  too .         i hope we can do business soon  mr .  lanra .        coren walked away from the warren  hands in his pockets  unsatisfied .  he knew more now  but  though it made sense on the surface  he felt he still did not know enough .   where did nyom   s brother come into all this .   he stopped across from a walkway access and looked around at the nearly deserted plaza .  third shift would be ending soon and people would be filling the moving walks and the corridors and their way home or to work .   his comm chirped .      lanra .         ariel  coren .  where are you .         um .  .  .         you need to come here .  things have changed .  your friend palen is no longer in charge  and the tbi have assumed command of the investigation on kopernik .  derec   s in detention .      coren sighed .     i need sleep .  do you think that can be arranged .         as long as you do it quickly .         i   ll do what i can .  i   ll be there soon .           twenty three    d  erec opened his eyes in the half light of sleep mode .  the lights had dimmed shortly after masid had left his cell .  derec lay awake for some time  mulling over what masid had told him  and had gradually drifted off to sleep .   he raised himself on his elbows and stared across the corridor to masid   s cell .  masid seemed still asleep on his cot .  derec sat up and rubbed his eyes  wondering what had awakened him .  he yawned .  he went to the bowl in the corner and relieved himself .   he turned around  resealing his pants  and started at the shape staring at him through the cell door .   it was tall  broad across the shoulders  with long arms that hung to the sides .  a pale halo outlined a bald head but left the face in darkness .  it wore a long overcoat that fell nearly to its ankles .   it .  derec could not consider it otherwise .  his subconscious labeled it as kindred to what coffee had witnessed in the cargo bin  even though it bore no overt resemblance .   derec swallowed hard .   it walked away from the door .  derec rushed forward and pressed his face to the mesh .  he saw it walking toward the far end  to the cell of the new inmate .      hey .     derec shouted .     somebody .  intruder .      with startling speed  it spun around and returned to derec   s cell .  derec staggered back .   it placed a hand against the door  fingers splayed .  the air suddenly smelled faintly of ozone .  the door slid open with a sudden crack .      shit     derec breathed .   it seemed to fill the cell  head nearly brushing the ceiling .  derec wanted to yell  to argue  deny it the right to do this .  he imagined slipping past it  breaking into the corridor  and fleeing  he was smaller and it seemed to be moving so slowly .  coolness spread over his thighs  down his calves  then across his shoulders  up his neck and across his scalp .  he felt the beginnings of quivering somewhere around his spine .   it raised one arm and opened a hand  took another step forward .  derec could make out details in its face now and he thought he recognized it .  human face  but wrong  damaged .  .  .      looking for me .     masid suddenly called out .   it frowned  then whirled about and stepped toward the cell door .   a brilliant scalding flash erupted around it .  it dropped to one knee  staggered  and started to rise .  another flash .  derec flinched and backed up against the wall .  the ozone smell was gone  replaced now by burning .  he heard a roar  deep throated and grainy  as if sound were being forced through too small a larynx  and heard the crackle then of a blaster  saw the reddish glow through closed eyelids .  dark ness .  crackle  glow .  .  . and stillness .      derec .      he blinked furiously  trying to focus on the voice .  masid .  derec looked at the door of his cell .  a man stood there now  the angled shape of a weapon in one hand .      are you all right .     derec asked .   masid snorted  amused .     i   m supposed to ask you that .         um .  .  .     derec pushed away from the wall .  his legs felt slightly disconnected from his hips  but he could walk .  glad i pissed first  he thought  and laughed at himself .     sure .  i   m .  .  . not hurt .  .  .      he caught the edge of the cell door and gripped it tightly .   masid smelled faintly of sweat .  he nodded toward a shape on the corridor floor .   the cyborg lay crookedly sprawled  its coat spread out beneath it like a pool of blood in the half light .  smoke wafted from its shoulders and chest .      my apologies     masid said .     i was asleep till you yelled .     he frowned .     was it coming for you .         no  it .  .  .     derec swallowed again and gestured toward the far end of the block .     it was heading for the new inmate .         that   s not what was supposed to happen     masid said grumpily .     we expected someone to come for me .       the lights came full on then .   the sound of running feet filled the corridor .  masid turned suddenly and hissed .      well  my cover   s blown     he said sotto voce to derec .   derec pointed at the corpse .     they can see it now .      people flooded around them .  palen stopped at the foot of the dead thing .  harwol stared from a few steps back .   derec managed to walk toward it .  the quivering centered now in his chest  along his sides  and over his pelvis  but he could move reasonably well .   masid had shot it four times .  each hit was clear by the ugly burn on left shoulder  sternum  right side of the neck  and scalp .  bloody red patches mingled with ashen black .  fibers curled out of the wounds .  cloth and skin were seared together and blue  gray  and worm white veins shot through the bubbled centers of the patches .  derec felt acid at the back of his throat  but swallowed it back .   the eyes were open .  they looked strangely perfect  like exquisite copies of real eyes .  no moisture  no veins in the whites  and now the irises were slightly different sizes .  but the radial patterns of the dull gray pupils seemed precisely symmetrical .   the skin showed irregularities  like acne scars or old injuries that still contained fragments of whatever had done damage .      is this like the thing we saw in the recovered memories .     palen asked .      i      derec had to swallow again .     i wouldn   t be surprised .  it opened my cell door by shorting out the lock .       reluctantly  he lifted the hand that had done the job and turned it over .  wires showed  spread over the palm .  derec pushed back the sleeve  the wiring ran up the arm .      it shouldn   t have been able to open it     palen said .      was your brethe dealer   s door shorted .      palen nodded .     we reprogrammed them then to remain shut in the event of a short .         what did you see on surveillance .         nothing .  until your door opened .  then masid came out of his cell .  but this .  .  .     she gestured at the body between them .     nothing .         it would be interesting to know how .  .  .      derec pulled the coat back from its shoulder .  a small control box was attached to the shirt .      damn     agent harwol said .      what .     palen asked .      that     harwol pointed at the box .     you said masking technology  mr .  avery .  that   s it .  military spec  alternating wavelength .  .  . stolen .         black market .     palen asked .   harwol nodded solemnly .      stolen military tech isn   t the worrisome part     derec said .     whoever supplied it is also dealing in cyborgs .      they all stared at him  expressions carefully neutral  the studied look of law enforcement unwilling to show worry when they were likely more than a little scared .  derec tasted acid once more and walked away  willing himself to not throw up in front of such pointless professionalism .   he stopped  staring at the cell at the far end .  the man there sat on his cot  watching  face pale .  after a few seconds  derec went up to his cell door .      so  who are you .     derec asked .  this close  he looked familiar .      who wants to know .     the man snapped back .   the voice  combined with that face .  .  . it took a few seconds for derec to put it all together .   it was the dockworker from petrabor .  the one shown in the memories of the dw    .      why was gamelin coming to kill you .     he asked .   the man   s face turned even paler .  he stood abruptly and went to the back of his cell .      what   s going on .     masid asked  coming up alongside him .   derec gestured at the inmate .     this one worked the dock in petrabor  middleman to those dead baleys .  who is he .         yuri pocivil     palen said  joining them .     coren sent me his records .  he   s been looking for him .  we picked him up in the settler section .         you mean      masid said  with mock indignation     that thing was coming to kill you and not me .  all my careful planning and baiting went for nothing .      pocivil just glared back at them .      we have to talk      masid said to him .     what did you do to piss these people off .         i   m not saying anything to you     pocivil said .      then maybe we should just release you now     palen said     and let you take your chances .      pocivil looked away .  suddenly  he lurched to his toilet and began heaving .  the sound reminded derec of his own urge .  he walked quickly away .   he managed to suppress it  though he kept walking .  no one called out or tried to stop him from leaving the cell block .  he emerged into the security station .  everyone had gone into the corridor  leaving the consoles untended .  derec sat down before a bank of monitors  grateful to be off his feet .   masid joined him .      he   ll talk     masid predicted .     he   s terrified .  i think it will occur to him that his best chance to stay alive now is to cooperate with us .         he might wonder if we can really protect him     derec said .      can   t we .  seems to me i managed to kill that thing pretty dead .          it took a bit  though  didn   t it .      masid shrugged .     cyborgs  occlusion tech  dead baleys     he said .     any suspects in mind .         that   s your job  isn   t it .         so they keep telling me .  there are a few arms dealers big enough to handle this kind of thing .         we just need one .          all right .  kynig parapoyos .          why him .         he   s the great bogeyman of the galaxy .  anything you can   t pin down to someone else gets blamed on him .  but he does have his fingers deeper into military tech than the others  and the widest distribution network .  he runs an intelligence agency that   s as good as anything a legitimate government can field .  if nothing else  he   s the most logical choice .      derec nodded .     for the sake of argument  let   s say that .         all right .  then the next question is  what does he want with cyborgs .         the ideal soldiers .         he sells weapons to soldiers .          so .  how profitable would it be to have something that could do it all .         ideal mercenaries .     masid shrugged .     i   m less impressed with mercenaries than with dedicated patriots and fanatics .  mercenaries are practical  miss a payment  they go away .  they have a cost analysis attitude .  if the cost is too high  they go away .  what would make cyborgs different .         depends .  research into them was suspended because they were unpredictable .         like people .      derec shook his head .     no .  people are predictable  at least in certain broad patterns .          so a cyborg would be a weapon that might turn and shoot its owner .         maybe .  if i recall correctly  they couldn   t be programmed with the three laws .  something in the organic side of things that kept sliding around them .          they   re positronic  then .         the ones the calvin institute worked with were  yes .  these .  i don   t know .         how quickly could you find out .         get me back to the lab .      masid nodded and straightened .     i   ll see what i can do .      derec watched him go back into the cell block .   too many questions to answer .  where would cyborgs be manufactured .  nova levis .  could an industry be hidden there .  a whole world .  why not .  was that perhaps the real reason behind the embargo .   but the technology .  .  .      derec .       rana stood in the doorway to the guard room .     director polifos is missing .           did that robot take director polifos .      harwol spoke with a solid dispassion belied only by the glint of impatience in his eyes .   derec  harwol  and rana stood in the positronics lab  facing each other .      why would you think that .     derec asked .      the robot is missing  polifos is missing .  i don   t know  but in my policeman   s way of looking at things that suggests a connection .         a robot wouldn   t do that     derec said .      really .  you know that for sure .  you also said it was collapsed .          it was     rana answered .      which means that it couldn   t just get up and walk out     harwol said .      normally  yes .         what does that mean     normally    .  could it or couldn   t it .         on its own     derec said     no .  it had to have been removed .  by someone who knew something about robotics .         anyone working in this lab could have taken it  then .  perhaps even polifos himself .      it was not a question .  derec turned toward harwol .  behind him  hofton stood beside ambassador leri .  two of polifos   s techs stood further back  watching anxiously .      i don   t think it   s reasonable anymore to assume     derec said     that the people working in this lab are the only ones on kopernik familiar with robotics .      harwol regarded him steadily  then nodded .     do you think there could be another cyborg .         do you mean did a cyborg steal the robot .     derec did not want to contemplate the possibility of more than one cyborg .     but why .      harwol shrugged .  he was out of his depth  but refused to show it .     the thing we saw from the recovered memories     he said  stepping toward the console     didn   t look like what we caught tonight .      we .  derec thought sourly .     no  it didn   t .  but then it changed by the time palen   s people opened the bin .  no one remarked on anything unusual when the bodies were carried out  so it must have looked human .          is that possible .         malleable materials are common enough .  i can imagine  though i can   t describe  how you might make something that could do that .     he thought of bogard  brand new and newly aware  in its amalloy body  capable of changing shape to meet circumstances .  but it never looked anything but artificial  always appeared to be what it was  a robot .  derec glanced at the monitors  then .  thales had said nothing so far .   harwol rounded on derec .     if i find out you had anything to do with this          why would i .         you didn   t want us to have the robot .  maybe you had legitimate reasons  maybe not .         don   t waste your time suspecting me .  i was in a cell  remember .      harwol suddenly grabbed derec   s shirt and walked him back against the examination table .  he pressed derec against the hard surface .  harwol   s breath flowed hot across his face .      i don   t have time to be diplomatic .  i have dead agents and a lot of interference and now a piece of evidence is missing .  i do not need self important spacer attitude .       derec braced himself on the table .     i used to be of the opinion that violence was the last refuge of the incompetent .      harwol   s eyes narrowed .     and now .         now .  i think it   s the first choice of an idiot .      harwol   s grip tightened  and he lifted derec slightly from the floor .      beat it out of me     derec said .     that   s always the best way to solve a problem .  works for me all the time .         agent harwol .      palen   s voice cut through the sudden stillness .  her voice was calm  authoritative .     i want to see you privately .       derec   s heart hammered .  slowly  harwol eased his grip .  derec   s feet touched the floor .  harwol stepped back .      i want that robot     he said .     i want it found and returned .      derec cleared his throat .     and if i can   t do that .         then we   ll see how big an idiot i am .      harwol turned to glare at palen  who stood nearby  hands on hips .      now      she said .   derec watched them all leave  then sat down .     if i live through the night .  .  .         sir      hofton began .   derec held up a finger .     where   s polifos .         i don   t know     hofton said .     no one seems to remember when they saw him last .         rana .      she shrugged .      all right  never mind .     he looked over the console .     we have another subject to do an excavation on .         another robot .     rana asked .      no  not quite .  a cyborg .     derec turned to hofton .     get palen   s pathologist  what   s his name .  baxin .  i think he should assist with this one .  in the meantime  where the hell did coffee go .         i can answer that question  derec     thales said .     coffee walked out of here after i reloaded a functional matrix .            what did he do .     rana asked  leaning over derec   s shoulder to peer at the displays .      we talked about this possibility     derec said .  he looked from one screen to another  trying to follow the ri   s step trees .     thales has been working at recovering bogard   s matrix so we could find out what happened when it collapsed .  because i   d built so many peripherals onto bogard  it partly became a hardware problem .  thales thought it was a question of raw memory  not enough  but when he got to use this system  he had enough  and realized that wasn   t the whole problem .         a positronic brain     thales said     is not simply programming .  programming can be corrupted .  the physical pathways are as necessary to its function as the matrix being run on them .  therefore  i determined that in order to successfully recover bogard i needed to load its matrix into a brain .         you had no way of knowing     derec said     if this would maintain its integrity .         i was reasonably confident .  but  no  i had no way to be certain other than to load it and see .         you gambled .         there was an imperative .         explain .         the situation has evolved     thales said .     ariel and coren lanra have been attacked .  both are safe and ariel is back at the embassy .  she has been requesting that you contact her as soon as possible .  however  there is a local problem which may pose a threat .  i have traced the gates i found in the lab systems .  there are two destinations .  most of them go directly to a location in the settler sections .  one  however  feeds directly to director rotij polifos   s apartments .         what does that have to do with coffee .     rana asked .      three law imperative  rana     thales replied .     i am required to protect .  i cannot effectively do so as a stationery system .         what     derec asked     is coffee now .         the unit previously designated    coffee    is contained in a memory buffer within my system .  the robot now contains a composite matrix of myself and bogard .  it is effectively what you initially intended in designing bogard .      derec felt excited and worried .     it   s functional .         after running several diagnostics and situation simulations  i was confident in disconnecting it from the link .      derec   s hands curled into fists .     so where is it .         in the settler section .  it went to follow up on the gates we discovered  and to attempt to locate director polifos .      thales paused .     it seemed the most reasonable avenue of action .     another pause .     did i err .          twenty four    a  ll we have to do  coren thought as he rode the walk way toward the embassy district  is find them .  or let them find us .  .  .   neither thought inspired him .  he started to raise a hand to his eyes  to rub them  and his shoulder spasmed .  when the pain subsided  he resigned himself to standing as motionless as possible till he reached his destination .   he thought about what towne had told him .   the idea that nyom was no more than an incidental casualty grated  but it made a kind of deeply banal sense .  rega entertained conspiracy theories  believing the universe was being manipulated by unseen cartels and malevolent forces .  but coren had worked for the government  he knew better .  things were a mess most of the time .  coren took compensatory comfort in that  after he thought about it for a while .  it meant  finally  that no one was really in charge  and in the end he preferred it that way .   but it was intellectual comfort .  in his gut  he wanted very much to blame someone when things went wrong .  he very much wanted to hold vast powers responsible and perhaps try to bum them down to atone for their misdeeds .   he wanted nyom   s death to mean something .   it did not .  except to him .  it was difficult seeing that as sufficient .   coren glanced around .  the walkway carried him now through an office district .  stairs led up and down into a jumbled landscape of boxy office complexes  some with windows  most with illuminated signs giving the name of the company or just a number .  walkways and enclosed corridors crossed above him  connecting one side to the other  and above that were the larger stained surfaces of higher levels .  he saw a grid marker pass by and started moving to the slower lanes .   he still had another person to question  tresha .  what to ask her  though .   to begin with  why kill a data troll and take her place .  perhaps the information towne had commissioned her to find related directly to the baleys .  but how .   and he was not not certain that the woman was this mysterious tresha .  it was simply a conclusion  a logical one  but not something upon which he could be absolutely certain .  by the time he got back to the embassy  perhaps ariel would have made the final determination .   two more exits .  three people came from the opposite direction .  coren followed them with his eyes as they passed by and continued on  twenty or so meters behind him two people rode his lane .  a man and a woman .  immediately his fatigue seemed to subside  replaced by a wary tension .  he kept his posture unchanged and looked ahead .  a corridor split off from the avenue  but too close to make his exit look natural .  he was four exits from the most direct route to the auroran embassy .   perhaps it was only coincidence .  he was fairly sure tresha was under guard at the auroran embassy  but that left her    muscle     gamelin  still loose .  coren had no valid reason to feel that he was being followed  but .  .  .   he watched the corridor pass by and casually stepped over to the next slower lane .  only one separated him now from the stationery lanes .  he glanced back .  the couple had moved closer .   coren stepped to the slowest lane .  he saw an archway approaching that opened on a public mall .  at five meters  he left the moving lane and strode purposefully toward the arch .  he heard footsteps behind him .   he passed beneath the arch and ran .   the mall was a collection of cafes and clubs .  the urgent throb of music pushed at the air .  people looked up from tables nearby as he sprinted past .   he reached the far end to be confronted by a broad stair heading up .  behind him  the two people came running .   coren bounded up the steps  three and four at a time .  his breathing was heavy at the top  where he came to a large plaza with a holographic fountain in the center .  color and shape danced and shimmered thickly in the air .   he skirted the perimeter of the fountain and palmed a stunner .  he thumbed off the safety and searched for an open door  but there were only windows encircling the plaza .  on the opposite side  another staircase led up to the next level .   coren judged the distance  took long strides  and hit the rim of the fountain .  he closed his eyes tightly as he jumped across two meters of water to land on the edge of the central display platform .  one more step and he slitted open one eye .  he stood in the middle of the holographic display .  all around him color prismed  split  washed one into the other .  he glimpsed the top of the stairs he had ascended through brief gaps in the imaging .  crouching  he watched .   the pair came into the plaza and stopped .  they exchanged glances and drew weapons  but through the dance of light coren could not tell what kind of pistols they held .  each one circled the fountain in the opposite direction .  coren watched the woman  turning as she moved .   they joined on the other side of the fountain  spoke briefly  then hurried up the next staircase .  coren counted to ten and jumped out the far side of the display .   he wanted to continue running  reach the embassy  and worry about these two later  but that would be sloppy .  he did not know if others waited further along the way  a second team waiting to pick up where the first left off .  slowly he walked around the fountain until he could see the landing above .  empty .   silently  he walked up the stairs .   at the top  just beyond the wall that rose on either side of the landing  he found a boulevard .  residential warrens lined the far side .  personal transports sped by in both directions .  he saw a moving walkway across the six lanes .  a bridge spanned the trafficway to his right .  he leaned cautiously out and glanced down the walkway  left and right .   the woman stood about three meters along  pressed against the wall .  she seemed to be watching the footbridge .  a moment later  coren saw movement on it  the man .   it was a clear shot .  he aimed carefully and fired .  the man spasmed briefly and fell .   the woman made a move in the direction of the bridge .  coren rushed up behind her .  she started to turn  bringing her own weapon up  when he reached her .  he grabbed her gun hand and pushed it down sharply  bending the hand forward against the underside of the wrist .  her fingers loosened automatically and the weapon fell .   but then she drove her foot back against his shin .  the pain surprised him .  he lost his grip and she broke free .  she spun around and slammed the heel of her hand against his collarbone .  coren snapped back against the wall .  he saw her arm go back  preparing for another blow .  gracelessly  he kicked her across the ribs .  she staggered back and fell to the sidewalk .   she sat up  began to rise .  coren dropped to one knee between her legs and pushed his pistol against her cheek .      tresha .     he asked on spec .   she frowned .     who .      he saw a shoulder holster beneath her jacket  and pushed the short coat off her .  the rig held a commlink  restraints  and an id folder .  he plucked the little black case out and flipped it open .     you   re a cop .         chavez .  homicide .  and you   re in a lot of trouble     she managed to say  her voice shaking .      why are you following me .      she glared at him .  coren dropped the id wallet in her lap and stood .      i don   t have time for this .  you tell your          put down the weapon .      coren turned .  a uniform cruiser stood ten meters off now  two officers alongside the vehicle  weapons drawn .      it   s all right     he called  raising his weapon  fingers spread .     i have            time to wake up .  you weren   t stunned that badly .  come on .      coren resisted opening his eyes .  he had been aware of sounds around him for some time  though it was hard to judge how long he had actually been awake .  neural stuns did odd things to time sense  among other things .   he recognized the voice  though .  he blinked .  the light was low  for which he was grateful .   a broad shouldered man with short  graying hair stood above him  watching  his bright green eyes intent .      inspector   capel .         very good  mr .  lanra .  let   s hope the rest of your memory works as well .  can you sit up .      coren closed his eyes  trying to orient himself .  he was lying on a cot .  he sat up slowly  levering himself with his arm .  his left shoulder throbbed with deep pain and he sucked air between his teeth .      here     capel said .   hands grasped his arms  capel pulled his right side around  and coren swung his legs over the edge of the cot .      oh  that hurts     coren groaned .      you   re bruised .  hairline fracture on the clavicle  no wonder the painkillers you   ve been taking don   t work .  you should take better care of yourself  mr .  lanra .  stop doing foolish things .  like running from the police .      coren looked up at capel .     i was surrendering to the uniforms .         they saw a weapon     capel said reasonably .     you   d already shot one officer and had the other under threat .         i was checking her id .  they were following me .         you have some reason to be running from strangers .         strangers usually don   t follow me .         here .      capel offered a glass of amber liquid .  coren automatically accepted it and straightened .     how long .         they brought you in an hour ago .  if you hadn   t been so beaten up you   d have been awake by then .  since you weren   t  we brought you to the infirmary first .         thanks .     coren lifted the glass and sniffed .  he recognized the acid smell of the standard enhancer cocktail used by people in high stress occupations  like emergency medical techs and the military and police  to provide quick  temporary revitalization .  he would sleep later  sleep deeply  if he drank this now  and he was not sure he liked that .  but his head felt wrapped in thick wadding and his thoughts came sluggishly .  he drank down half the liquid .      who did you think we were .     capel asked after a minute .   coren felt sharper already .  one drawback was that the pain in his shoulder was more acute .      first  were you following me  or did i stumble into something .         we were looking for ree wenithal .  you were seen leaving his apartment warren  so i assigned a team to follow you .  after you left myler towne  i decided we needed to have a talk .          ah .  you found out wenithal was damik   s sponsor .      capel nodded .     do you know where he is .         last i knew  in the auroran embassy .      capel frowned .     what   s he doing there .         it   s a long story .      capel backed away from the cot and sat down .  he crossed his left leg over his right  propped his head on his left hand .     you aren   t leaving till i hear it all .      coren finished the glass of unpleasant fluid  looked around the sterile infirmary room  and decided that he had no real choice .  still  he felt compelled to bargain .      quid pro quo .     he asked .      we   ll see .     capel smiled .     you go first .        in his years as a government agent  coren had found that lying to the authorities only gained time  and not very much at that .  if you were not part of the center of their attention  a lie could pass almost unnoticed  but if you entered their field of interest even a little bit  lying never proved a sound policy .  the only people who could get away with it were those who could afford to hire people to lie for them .   coren doubted he could talk his way past capel with anything less than a complete disclosure .  at this point  it might be worth it to see what capel knew .  besides  he had no time for anything else .   when coren finished  capel was leaning forward  arms on his knees  listening intently .  after a time  capel straightened and pushed a button on the wall behind him .      coffee  two     capel said  then folded his hands in his lap and looked at coren .     i suppose it   s occurred to you to wonder why damik ran to wenithal in the first place .         i was coming to ask him that the night you and i met .      capel   s face flexed in a half smile .  the door opened  and a uniformed officer brought in a tray bearing two cups and a carafe .  he placed it on the table beside capel and left .  capel poured and handed a cup to coren .  after the revitalizer  it smelled wonderful .      we dug up wenithal   s case logs after we found the connection     capel said .     he was a reliable cop for most of his career  nothing special .  that last case was his entree to bigger things .  very high profile .  and very successful  as far as it went .         that   s rather ambivalent .         he didn   t finish .  arrests were made  several facilities were closed down  a big media event  resulted making him out to be a hero .  it benefitted everyone more than not  so wenithal was allowed to quietly resign .  but he wasn   t guilt free  and some people wondered if his success hadn   t been just a little too convenient .          you   re saying he was corrupt .      capel shrugged .     my personal take  after reviewing the logs  is that eurosector enforcement agent ree wenithal was handed that success as a reward to stop looking .  the missing children that were recovered comprised less than one percent of the total  which is still a considerable number .  but he was far from over when he started arresting people .  you know and i know that once you start making arrests  those you don   t get in the first wave go to ground and get harder to find .  if they   re adequately resourced  you never get them .  they leave earth and you lose them .         and he lost some .         i   d say he probably lost the core perpetrators .  nobody who served time as a result of that case damaged the organization by their absence .  there was a four  or five year hiatus and the abductions began again .  the market wasn   t shut down  the routes weren   t closed .  what happened afterward was all public relations  and no one was willing to look foolish by calling it into question .          no other agents followed up .         two of wenithal   s partners from those days died shortly thereafter  one from natural causes  the other in an accident .  there were three people in the civil advocate   s office connected to the case who died .     capel waved a hand .     all the deaths were explained  and from what i can tell the explanations were legitimate  but the fact remains that those closest to events either died or quickly found new careers .  i   m reading all this and i   m thinking coverup .  call me paranoid .  it   s ancient history  though  so there   s no way to find out for sure .       coren sipped his coffee .     and damik .         damik is a little less problematic .  he was definitely receiving bribes .  most of them were coming through wenithal .  nothing large by some standards  a lot of gray market material  adjusted tariff stamps  relabelled goods  that kind of stuff .  but he was also plugged into the baley network .  one of them  anyway .         which one .      capel shook his head .     does it matter .  as it turns out  the one being run by imbitek under alda mikels .  oh  yes  we knew about it  but we could never get enough evidence for warrants .  besides  baley running is generally considered a victimless crime .  these people want to leave  who are we to say no .  the laws are more symbolic than anything .  what   s relevant here is that ten months ago wenithal cut damik off .  within a month  damik had found other sources of income  and was finding more  but it hadn   t yet equaled what he   d been getting from wenithal .         i saw reported payments in wenithal   s records to damik up till a few weeks ago .          really .  where did you see those .      coren cleared his throat .     something wenithal left lying open on his desk .      capel smiled wryly .     in any case  there had apparently been a falling out between them .  maybe wenithal had started paying him again  but we know he had stopped payments for several months .          how do you know they were bribes .         because of the source of wenithal   s funds .         may i guess .  either the hunter group or kysler diversified .          no .  imbitek .  or was .  this new guy  towne  has been trying to clean the company up  shutting down a lot of its illicit ventures .  but under mikels they   d been buying from wenithal for years  except they paid him five times market value for what he supplied them .  half that money ended up going directly to damik .         imbitek .  .  .         something else  though .     capel took a folder off the table beside him and handed it to coren .     look at this and tell me what you think .      coren pulled an image out of the folder .  it showed a naked female body  horribly bruised from face to shins .     same kind of lividity as damik .         that   s my thought .  i did a records search for similar cases .  that one was the closest match .          who was she .         we don   t know .  no id .  found her in lyzig district six days ago .     capel retrieved the print and returned it to the folder .     you were in lyzig not long ago yourself  weren   t you .         yes .         maybe a coincidence .  i hoped maybe you could identify her .         run a match for    jeta fromm  she was a data troll .      capel blinked  then pressed the button again .  an officer appeared  and capel told her to run a check on that id .      if it comes up positive     coren asked     does that make me a suspect .         if i thought that  you   d be in custody .  no  but you   re close to this .  closer than i am  anyway .         that   s your feeling .         that   s my feeling .     capel finished his coffee and set the cup down .     if you could talk to anyone you wanted to right now  who would it be .      coren thought for a moment .     alda mikels .         he gets released tomorrow morning .  we have till then to interview him .         privately .     coren asked with emphasis .      very .  interested .         very .     coren stood .     why .      capel raised his eyebrows .     you mean  why am i letting you into this .  very simple .  some of the people who were around when wenithal closed his last case are still around  only in even higher positions than they were then .  if this goes where i think it will  i may need someone outside the department .          do you trust me .         i looked at your record .     capel pressed the button to be let out .     shall we .        marland reformatory and social reclamation center occupied a huge area north of d . c .  capel took coren through the security passage that linked directly to police headquarters  a ten minute ride in a car designed to carry prisoners behind a transparent security shield that separated them from their guards .   coren waited while capel arranged an interview room .  silently  the two men followed a uniformed escort up four levels and down a long hall .  the interview room was comfortable  with plush chairs all around and a writing desk .  coren was surprised to find it open  with no indication of any security wall to keep prisoners from interviewers .   capel noticed his reaction .     we have no surveillance  either .      coren took his hemisphere from his pocket .     what happens if i switch this on .         nothing .  you don   t trust me .         you  yes .      coren thumbed the field damper on and returned it to his pocket .   capel nodded and took a seat .      how much freedom do i get .     coren asked .      don   t abuse your welcome      capel said .     keep it within reason .       a few minutes later  the opposite door slid open and alda mikels stepped through .   he had lost weight  coren saw  and his thick mane of white hair seemed thinner .  the lines in his face sank deeper and his skin looked slightly waxen .      mr .  mikels     capel said .     i appreciate you taking the time to see us .  please  sit .       alda mikels frowned at coren as he eased himself into a chair .     you   re welcome  i   m sure  inspector .  do i know you .         i   m inspector capel  homicide division .  this is coren lanra  head of security for          for rega looms .  yes  i thought you looked familiar .  is there a reason for this visit  or just a last chance to see me in prison .         we have a few questions we thought you might help us with      capel said .   mikels focussed on capel .     homicide .  i haven   t killed anyone .  not in here  at least .         that remains to be seen      capel said .     do you know ree wenithal .         should i .         you   ve been overpaying him for textiles for years     capel said .     from the amounts  we thought perhaps you had a personal relationship with him .          a good supplier  then .     mikels said  shrugging .     i don   t remember .          odd .  he remembers you     coren said .     even kept a special log of all your transactions .         really .         he was cut off by your successor     capel said .      i wouldn   t know anything about it .  what towne is doing to my company .  .  . well  i   ll find out all about it soon enough .         you   re being modest     coren said .     i think you know all about it now .         and why would that be .         you   re waging a war for control of your company .  i   m impressed with your resources  it must be very difficult to conduct business from a cell .  but it   s not a very precise way to do it .  some people have died as a result .  according to tresha  the orders went through wenithal  along with his monthly stipend from imbitek .  .  . until towne took over and started cutting up your empire .      mikels glowered .     this is all supposition  of course .      coren said nothing .  mikels blinked and looked at capel .      is it standard procedure for the police to allow private security to harass wards of the state .         coren     capel said     you   re just supposed to observe .      coren nodded  but continued to stare at mikels .  he felt anxious  which was a problem  an interview like this needed a finesse he did not feel willing to accord .  he realized then that he had decided to blame mikels for nyom   s death  it was his war  after all  that had gotten her killed .      now  mr .  mikels     capel said     we know you   re a busy man .  we won   t keep you very long .  but i wondered if you could explain those payments to mr .  wenithal .  the amounts were quite generous .  it seems fiscally irresponsible  at least to me  that you   d pay him those amounts when you could easily have switched vendors and saved yourself all that extra expenditure .  unless he was blackmailing you  that is .  was he .      mikels laughed .     you   re more imaginative than most of your colleagues  inspector capel .         then he was working for you in other capacities .      mikels stood .     i don   t have to talk to you .         i think it would be a good idea  though     coren said .  he took a couple of steps toward mikels .     you have a problem  and it could be very dangerous .       mikels laughed .     are you threatening me  mr .  lanra .      coren smiled with mock innocence .     me .  not at all .  i   m trying to help you .       mikels glanced toward the detective .     inspector capel          sit down  lanra     capel said tersely .   coren looked at capel .  he saw nothing but a warning in the inspector   s eyes  and the expectation of obedience .  coren gave mikels a long look before he grudgingly returned to his chair .      it seems  mr .  mikels     capel said     that your replacement at imbitek may have gotten himself into some legal problems .  certain clandestine operations have surfaced and you could help us clear them up .  i just thought we could help each other .         towne .     mikels sounded incredulous  but he sat down .     what do you have .         it seems he   s been running baleys .  some of them have gotten killed .  we think reprisals have been made and will continue to be made .          baleys .     mikels looked from coren to capel .     you   re here about baleys .         anything you might have that could help us .  .  .     capel said  obviously trying to lead him .      is this off the record .         we don   t have anything official pending in your case .  we   re hoping you   ll help as a good citizen .      mikels pursed his lips and folded his hands in his lap .     well  it isn   t my desire to see towne hurt .         could you vouch or him  then  substantiate his innocence .      mikels smiled .     i don   t think so .     he sighed wearily .     i knew this would hurt the company in the long run .  there has always been a faction at imbitek involved in extra legal matters .  i shut down three divisions during my chairmanship that dealt in contraband .  but imbitek is large  and favors are passed in a variety of ways .  it   s difficult to keep track of everyone and everything .  towne .  .  . well  he   s been tangled up with the settler coalition for a long time .  if he   s running baleys  i   m not surprised .         wenithal .     coren prompted .      i was not aware we were still doing business with him .  those three divisions i mentioned all used him to fix customs .  wenithal had an associate in ite  an adopted son  i think  through whom he got special considerations .  when i shut them down  i thought i   d cut him off .         the payments .     capel asked .      wenithal owns a textiles manufacturing firm .  it would be safest to mask the payments as business as usual .         you said you didn   t know him     coren said .   mikels glared at him .     do i look like an idiot  mr .  lanra .  i don   t know him personally  but in this connection i remember the name .       capel pointedly frowned at coren .   coren ignored him and pressed on .     and the association .  is there any reason you could think of that towne would have either of them killed .         not unless they were about to turn against him .         might they .      mikels shrugged .     i can   t see that wenithal would gain anything  but damik might .  after all  he would have the most to lose in any kind of official inquiry .         so you knew brun damik  too .     capel asked .      i didn   t say that          were damik and wenithal about to go freelance .  or was it just damik who thought he could set up his own operation from your leftovers .  is that why you had him killed .      mikels laughed .     i   m a businessman  inspector .  i don   t have people killed .  i have no idea who murdered damik .          so you did know he was dead .     coren asked .   mikels started to stand again .     i think our talk is over  gentlemen       coren took the folder capel had brought with him .  before the inspector could stop him  he walked quickly up to mikels  slid the picture out  and held it before the industrialist .  mikels stared at it for a long time .      do you know her .     coren asked .      no .     mikels looked worried now .      have you ever seen a body look like that .  i   ve seen a few recently .  something  or someone  crushed them .  must be an incredibly painful way to die .         what does this have to do with me .         whoever did this can slip in and out of secured areas undetected .  some kind of military grade masking tech .  i even know of one victim who was in jail  and no records exist of her death .  none .      mikel   s eyes flicked to capel .      why don   t you sit down again  mr .  mikels     the inspector said .   mikels sank back to the chair .   coren turned to capel .     here   s what i think .  i think mr .  mikels has been paying his way through customs by way of wenithal and brun damik .  i think myler towne found out about it when he took over and started straightening imbitek out .     he turned back to mikels .     i think you did a quick estimate of how much this was going to cost you in future revenue and decided to oust towne .  it   s backfiring  though  and he   s more popular now than ten months ago  when he took over .  so you   ve been cleaning up all the loose ends that could tie you up in litigation and further prison time if they come to light .  you    re shutting down the baleys before he does  and you   re doing it so that it looks like it was his fault  because  after all  imbitek is the one in charge of them  isn   t it .  and you   re in jail  so how could you be doing any of it .         you have no proof     mikels said haltingly .      oh  but it gets better .  when it looked like there was no way you could win a shareholder vote  you arranged to take over part of imbitek  the part most profitable off earth .  you used the same people you used to funnel baleys all these years to fund the purchase of captras biomed .  towne tried to block the sale when he found out who was behind the purchase  but he couldn   t .  to cap it off  you tried to kill him .  leave imbitek headless and  after you get out of prison  leave the planet .  imbitek falters  you use captras as a plat form through which to buy it out  and you end up owning it outright .     coren grinned wolfishly .     stock transactions leave a pretty good trail for those who can read it .       mikels grunted .     you have an excellent imagination .  why should any of this cause me to help you .         because i think you may become a loose end yourself .  all this is going on and the profits are rolling and you   re still in jail .  someone is going to be thinking pretty soon that you   re superfluous .          why would they think that .         because it just might occur to them that they already have captras biomed .  what do they need you for .  to run it .  at this point  you   re waging a private war  against myler towne  to hurt a company that your backers no longer want .  this isn   t good for profits .      now mikels reacted nervously .      the only thing that bothers me     coren continued     that i don   t understand  is where all the baleys are going and what nova levis has to do with any of this .         what does rega want to know this for .     mikels demanded .      why do you think .      mikels shook his head .     i don   t know .  he   s been out of it for years .  why now .         maybe     coren said slowly  taking a gamble     it   s a family matter .      mikels grew still .  only the sound of breathing filled the room .  when he did not answer  coren leaned close to his ear .      this isn   t rega     coren said .     this is me .  i want to know .     he leaned closer still and whispered .     your little vendetta killed a friend of mine .  a good friend .  this is personal for me .         just because you and damik served together       coren straightened .     not damik .  but if you know that  then you know the rest .  you killed nyom looms  you fuck .      he snarled .     i   m sure you know about nyom and me .  she   s dead .         lanra .     capel bellowed .     back off  now .      mikel   s eyes widened .     i see .  that   s unfortunate  ms .  looms    death  but .  .  .         cyborgs     coren said flatly .   mikels started .     what .         cyborgs .  what do you know about them .      mikels wiped a hand over his mouth .     may i give you some advice  mr .  lanra .  you should let this go now .  you won   t help nyom looms anymore .  all you could do would be to put yourself  your friends  and your family in danger .         not really a problem .  i don   t have any friends and i   m an orphan .  just like damik .      mikels sighed and shook his head .     i don   t have to talk to you .  but wenithal knows everything .  you can ask him .  i   ve never been directly involved .          is that why you   ve gone to all the trouble to buy nova levis .      capel grasped coren   s arm .  coren shrugged him off .   mikels looked startled  then laughed .  he stood  then .     my  but you are impressive .  if i thought you   d accept it  i   d offer you a job .     he walked toward the door .     if you know that much  then you know the rest .  you figure it out .         why infants .      mikels stopped .     excuse me .         the thing i can   t figure out  why infants .      mikels shook his head .     this interview is over .      mikels rang the bell for release .  a few moments later  the guard took him away  leaving coren and capel alone .      damn     coren hissed .      what do you want to do now .     capel asked sarcastically .     is there anyone else you want to roust tonight before i get the full story .         i don   t know .     coren stared at the door  then looked at capel .     don   t wait for an apology .          i won   t .  i just wish i understood what just happened here .     he pressed a hand against coren   s chest .     you can explain it to me  can   t you .         maybe .  where do you want me to start .         first things first     capel said .     given mikel   s reaction to it  what   s a cyborg .      coren flashed a half smile .     well  as i understand it .  .  .  .          twenty five    t  he corpse on the table smelled cloyingly sweet .  baxin  sipha palen   s pathologist  directed a squad of devices while speaking aloud his findings for the recorders .        lungs are permeated by clusters of nodes which seem to function as storage systems for long term oxygenation .  secondary vascular system routed through what appears to be a secondary spleen suggests waste gas disposal follows complimentary pathways for storage in .  .  . what the hell is that .      he fidgeted nervously and glanced at derec and palen  who watched from the other side of the isolation screen .  baxin was perspiring slightly .  his fingers worked a keypad  and the small scavengers moved on and through the body of the cyborg .      the muscle structure is a complex interleaving of polymers and protein .  molecular bonding seems to be cyclodextrous .  .  . we have polyamide bonding along single chain amine nitrogen .  .  . looks like it uses adipic acids to facilitate the protein interactions .  .  .      baxin looked at derec and shook his head .      i have no idea what i   m looking at     he said .     this thing looks like it   s made of nylon and nylon analogs .         myralar .         yes  i   m finding a lot of that in the joints and the valves .  a second pancreas that looks like an organic polymer factory .  .  . it   s producing hexamethyline diamine instead of insulin .  .  . i don   t even know why it was brought here .         this doesn   t look like the being in the recovered memories     palen said .     the skin looks .  .  . normal  i suppose .         oh  that     baxin said .  he took a pair of forceps and lifted a layer of skin from one pectoral .  instead of the red and gray of organic tissue  the underside looked like graphite .     there   s a layer of composite that seems to be electrolytically active .  if i run a small charge through it  the material shifts to the exterior derma .     he dropped the layer and shook his head .     it causes problems  skin irritation and infections from the look of it .  that   s the source of the rough complexion .         in your opinion     palen asked     is it at all human .      baxin shrugged elaborately and surveyed the body .     sure .  there   s blood  oxygenation  amino acids .  .  . i   m seeing some alternate building blocks in part of the dna  like fluorotryptophan .  .  . but it   s at least as much a machine .  .  .  a very odd machine .  .  .     he grabbed a hand and held it up .     the musculature in key areas has an underlying carbon isotope structure that responds to pressure by forming a kind of sheathe .  the best comparison i have is calcium deposition in bones under stress .  but that takes days or months .  according to the projections i   ve got here      he pointed at his monitors      this responds instantly by creating a kind of exoskeleton which can be reabsorbed .     he shook his head .     in my opinion  the only thing that would define this as primarily organic is that you   d have to grow all this .  you couldn   t add it onto an already extant organic structure .         not at all .     derec asked .     i mean  how early would you have to start .      baxin sighed and glanced at the readouts on the bank on monitors beside him .     well  there are some problems .  i   ve got an organ here that looks like a gall bladder  but as far as i can tell it   s strictly for the isolation of ammonia  which seems to be produced as a byproduct of a polymerization process .  the ammonia would still be toxic if released generally  so it   s flensed from the system and fed back into the one of the spleens for venting .  it   s not a perfect system  i   m seeing excess carbonic carbonyl in the duodenum that seems to be ingested to compensate for an imbalance .  i   m thinking that most of this secondary polymer system was introduced before puberty  probably in infancy .  you could overcome some of these problems by starting with a base genetic template and growing one from scratch  but i wouldn   t be able to tell you how .  probably the rate of breakdown would overwhelm it at that stage  so starting later might compensate for some of the flaws .          you don   t sound too certain      palen said .      there   d have to be certain preconditions     baxin said .     i   m not good enough for this  chief .  i   m guessing .  you need someone who understands sequencing and gene therapy .         what about the brain .     derec asked .     is it wholly organic .         no .  .  . well  yes .  .  . i mean  it   s oxygenated  but what i   m seeing is the presence of protonated oxygen .  that would limit cell absorption considerably  except that there   s a monomer fiber strung along the vasal matrix that   s drawing particles from a small isotopic shunt in the hypothalamus .          what kind of particles .     derec pressed .      positrons .      derec sensed palen looking at him .     all right     he said .     when you finish  i want the brain sent to the positronics lab .         the whole thing should   ve been sent there to begin with     baxin complained .     sorry .  i   ll let you know when i   ve completed my autopsy .          thanks  doctor     palen said .     by the way  the masking ability       baxin laughed sourly .     that   s the only thing that   s easy to explain .  the clothing .  it doesn   t have it built into itself .  it just wore military tech .       derec walked away from the theater .  masid leaned against the wall by the exit  arms folded over his chest .  derec heard palen   s heavy tread catching up to him .      your assistant      masid said     just called to say you should come to the lab asap .     derec nodded in response .      so  just what is that thing .     palen demanded as the three of them stepped into the corridor outside the morgue .      a cyborg     derec said .     what i was afraid of .         where did it come from .         i have no idea .         are there more of them .         there   s no reason to think this one is the prototype .  why use it for something as risky as slipping into a police station to murder someone if it   s the only one .  no  there are others .      he glanced at palen .     what did your brethe dealer find that got her killed by one .      palen glared at masid .     i don   t know     she said .     we didn   t get a chance to debrief her .         where was she when you picked her up .     derec asked .      settler section  dockside     masid said .     she used to keep a flop there  in the service section .         has anybody looked at it since she died .      palen nodded .     it had been tossed  pretty thoroughly .  none of her associates shed any light on what she was into .         was she actually dealing brethe .     derec asked .      absolutely     palen said .     only way to keep her cover valid .          who was her supplier  then .      masid nodded .     a local boss named metresha  who also has a finger or two in the baley traffic .         has anybody talked to her .         not yet     palen said .     she   s offstation right now .  i didn   t want to move on her till we had some solid information about these deaths .         does anybody know when she   s coming back .      masid shrugged .     metresha is rather hard to keep track of .  no one is really sure what she looks like  she tends to work through intermediaries a great deal .  i gather the docks are being watched .         the settler ship that was supposed to pick up those baleys is in dock now     palen said .     metresha always shows up when a cargo is being moved .         have you heard from lanra .         not since yesterday .         i want to talk to ariel     derec said .      i want to know where that robot is     palen said .   derec glared at her .     you might want to ask your new prisoner about the cyborg .  he knew its name  after all .         we   re letting him think things through a while longer     palen said .     do you want to be there when we question him .         it might be useful to have someone there who knows a little about robots     derec said sardonically .   the three of them took the next shunt to the spacer quarters in stony silence .  derec found himself slightly in the lead as they strode toward the lab .  agent harwol and one of his people stood outside the lab  talking quietly .  when he spotted derec  he came forward .      we have a situation  avery          talk to the ambassador     derec said irritably  brushing past the tbi agent .      avery       derec entered the lab and stopped abruptly .   the dw    stood in the center of the space  most of the resident techs standing in a loose circle around it .  director polifos sat  arms folded indignantly  before the robot .  when he saw derec  his scowl deepened and he tried to stand .  the robot placed a hand on his shoulder and urged the director back into the chair .      damn it  you cannot do that .     he shouted .     what is wrong with this robot .  doesn   t it know that it has to take my orders .         it knows it has to keep you here     derec said .     for your own protection .         i   m in no danger .         then  why were you running .         i wasn   t .      derec looked at the robot .     thales .         the director had booked passage on a settler transport     the robot said .     i found him in a dockside tavern in section forty nine  carrying a pack of personal belongings .      polifos glared up at the robot .      what is this thing .     he asked quietly .      never mind that     palen said .     why don   t you tell us where you were going .  and why .      polifos looked at her  anger and fear working at his expression .  he shook his head .      what ship .     palen asked .      the reyatta     thales answered .   palen pulled out her comm and stepped away  speaking softly .  a few seconds later  she came back .      interesting choice of ships  director     palen said .     the reyatta is a known blockade runner .  where were you going  director polifos .      polifos shook his head and studied the floor .   derec searched the lab until he saw rana over by the workstation they had been using .  she waved him over .      ariel needs to talk to you     she said .   derec stepped up to the console .     thales  are we secure .         yes  derec .  i have traced all the gates in place .  one of them fed directly to director polifos   s quarters .  another went to chief palen   s office .  one  however  i have a location for but no identification  in the settler   s section .         where   s ariel .         back in the embassy     thales said .     but not for long .  there have been developments .         connect me .        derec stopped before polifos and waited for the man to look up .     director .      polifos frowned .      what kind of work did you do for nova levis .      polifos blinked and went pale .   derec turned to palen  who had been talking intently with masid  away from the others .     i want to bring him down to the morgue .       palen looked intrigued .     all right .      thales bogard urged polifos to his feet .  harwol and two of his agents came forward .     what are we doing .     harwol asked .      a demonstration     derec said .     thales .         please follow derec avery     the robot said .      agent harwol  if you could have your people guard our flanks on the way down .  .  .  .      reluctantly  harwol agreed .  the entourage emerged from the lab and headed back down to palen   s morgue .   baxin still worked on the body .  he looked up at the approach of this new group  his brow knitting .  derec glanced at polifos .   when the director saw the corpse  he stopped  then tried to back up .  thales bogard blocked his escape .  derec reached for him  took his shirt sleeve  and dragged him close to the transparency .      what do you think of that  director polifos .         i      he shook his head .     please .         recognize it .  perhaps some of it is your own work .         i don   t know .         you don   t know .  then why are you frightened .  why were you running .  is this what you were running from .         you don   t understand       derec tightened his hand on polifos   s arm .     then make me understand .          please .         is this what you   ve been hiding from for the last twenty years .  did you make that .         no .  i don   t know what that is .  let me be .      polifos squirmed loose from derec only to encounter palen  masid  harwol  and thales bogard .      talk to us  director     palen said .     we   ve got a lot of dead people we need explanations for .         i didn   t have anything to do with that     polifos said .      what did you do in nova levis .     derec asked .  he pointed at the cyborg .     is that a direct result of your work .      polifos tried not to look at it .      is that your work  kyas vol .      polifos paled visibly then .     you know .         you   ve been hiding here under the protection of the auroran government since disappearing from earth after nova levis closed down .  why .  what were you doing there .         i   m trying not to die  damn it .     he whirled around  shoving derec away .  he backed against the transparency .     they killed everyone .  anyone who knew anything about it .  fos and holani .  .  . cortem .  .  . the documentation staff .  .  .     he was shaking now .     i went to the aurorans because they were the only ones not involved .  terran authority  solarians  corporates .  .  . aurora had nothing to do with it .         with what .     harwol demanded .   polifos started sobbing .  he slid to the floor  eyes streaming .      we never really knew who we were working for      he said finally .     the lab took subscriptions for stock .  it was supposed to be a public corporation  we didn   t know .  .  .         your mission     derec said .     what was your mission .         the plague .  stop the plague .         what plague .     palen asked .   polifos shook his head .     there wasn   t one .  we succeeded .     he sat there  crying for a time  until he finally got control of himself .  he stood and looked at the corpse .  baxin stood away from the body now  waiting .  polifos turned away .     please .  i don   t want to look at it anymore .      palen led them all to baxin   s office .  one of harwol   s people got polifos a cup of water .  the director sat in a chair  trembling and sipping .      what plague .     derec prompted .      old  old nanotech     polifos said .     do you know what upds are .         i know the term     derec said .     i   m still not sure what it means .          untreatable physiological dysfunction     polifos said .     the term covers a lot of ground .  some of it is organic illnesses  chronic systemic dysfunctions  things we can only watch .  we can   t cure them .  in some cases  we can provide a little relief  but they   re all fatal  and usually pretty quickly .  ninety eight percent of the cases are infants .  the worst of them are nonorganic .  we used to call them vonooman plagues .     he shrugged .     i don   t know why .      he drank again  coughed  and set the cup down .     before we outlawed robots  long time ago  we played with everything .  one of our developments was nanotech .  we still have a lot of it .  food production is a result of old nanotech .  some medical treatments  manufacturing  but most of it got thrown out with the robots .  largely because a few experiments went wrong and we created self sustaining inorganic colonies .  parasites  really .  they disassembled extant structures and used the material .  there was a huge panic when the first of them erupted a few hundred years ago .  but the fact is  they ate themselves out .  it was fast and furious and so fatal that within ten  twenty years they died out all on their own  except for a few aberrant strains that stayed in the ecosystem and caused relatively minor problems since .         upds      derec said .   polifos nodded .     poor kids .  they   d be born with a minor problem and through some vector we   ve never been able to trace  a colony of these things would take advantage and set up within the system .  within extreme intervention  death would be quick .  we set up hospice centers for them .          they aren   t very well advertised      palen said .     this is the first i   ve heard of them .         nobody wants to know about them .  anonymity is almost always desired by the parents  so it works out comfortably for everyone but the victim .         so what changed .     derec asked .      we found strains that were sustaining the victim .  they were adapting .  why now and not before .  don   t know .  and not in very many cases .  but when we diagnosed the first adult cases of new infection  we knew we had a big problem .         terrans .     derec asked .      settlers     polifos said .     we needed to find a cure .  to do that we needed to find the vectors and we needed to understand the nature of the host system .  we set up nova levis as a research lab in prostheses to cover the actual research into the new plague .         and what was the vector .     harwol asked .      only certain colonies .  we found a series of enzyme deficiencies that produced chronic conditions that were treatable but rendered the system vulnerable to opportunistic infections .  those colonies tended to be the smallest and most isolationist .  the influx of new colonists had been cut off for a variety of reasons  diplomatic  financial  other things .  we were afraid that the plagues might adapt sufficiently well to become generally virulent and infect us .  it was a small population that was at risk .  we found a vaccine that was communicable by touch and could be spread through viral transfer .         how did you get around the immigration barriers .     harwol asked .      baleys     derec said .   polifos nodded .     slipped them in through the back door .         what about the infants .     masid asked .      we continued our research on them .  we found that the diseases had reworked their basic genetic structure in some cases  demanding augmentation in key organs .  we thought we were finding a cure .  we found that the disease had left us with an organic system perfectly suited to the introduction of symbiotic machine prostheses .  but it was a holistic approach .  we couldn   t fix one organ  we had to address the entire system .         you started playing with positronics     derec said .   polifos nodded .     we got them through our solarian contacts .         that means you .  you   re solarian .      polifos shook his head .     i was born here  on earth .  my parents were solarian and i kept my citizenship  but i   ve never been there .          then who was your solarian contact .         through the embassy mission .  i never knew who .         why was the lab shut down .     palen asked .          we started getting infants in large numbers .  we   d developed a method of introducing self sustaining support into the organic matrix  freeing them from the massive support systems they   d been forced to live in .  the babies showed up  we   d refit them  and then they   d disappear .  director holani was our head of staff .  she found out they were going offplanet .  she started demanding to know what was going on .  she threatened to go public .  that   s when everything was closed down .         so how does this explain that thing baxin   s working on .     palen demanded  gesturing in the direction of the cyborg   s remains .      we stumbled on a process that would enable us to fuse machine and organic systems .  the vonooman infection opened the way for the introduction of fully symbiotic artificial components .  puberty alters too much for reintroduction  a lot of it is mitigated by viral infections  rna recompositions  stuff like that  but from infancy  we found we could grow a composite organism to adulthood .  that   s when the traffic in infants increased .         so that thing may have been one of your patients .         may have     polifos admitted .     i went to the aurorans when my colleagues started dying .  i told them what was going on .  they took me in and hid me .     he looked around at them .     i don   t want to die .         where   s the work being done now .     derec asked .   polifos frowned .      where are the cyborgs being grown now .         a sister lab was built on cassus thole     polifos said .     a transfer point for baleys to the other colonies where the plague was taking root .         cassus thole .     palen asked .     i never heard of that one .         it   s an old name     masid said .     it   s now called nova levis .         yuri pocivil did not try to run when he saw the cyborg corpse .  he swallowed  hard  and stared at it .  slowly  he turned to palen .      i don   t know anything     he said .      you worked the baley run out of petrabor     palen said .     you worked with this thing .  we have documentation on it  so don   t bother lying .          i   m just a dockworker  that   s all     pocivil said .      running baleys .     masid asked .      baleys  drygoods  food  manufactured components  it   s all just cargo .  my job is strictly dockside .  i don   t know anything .         you know who pays you     palen said .     you know your contacts .  you get your assignments from somewhere .         i also know what    dead    means     he said .      you should      derec agreed .     you already are .  that was coming to kill you .      he nodded toward the cyborg .     you know that .       after a time  pocivil nodded .     i got caught .  that   s against the rules .          so why protect them .     palen asked .   pocivil shrugged .     a gato   s got to have standards .         pretty low ones  in your case      masid said .     you know all those baleys were murdered .  the last shipment you sent up here .      pocivil sighed .     shit .  i guess it doesn   t matter .  you won   t find them  anyway .          why not .     palen asked .      because the operation is over .  it   s being shut down .  i was on my way home when your people grabbed me .         shut down     derec said .     you mean  no more baley runs .  no more          nothing  no more anything .  they   re closing up shop .  it   s over .         why don   t you tell us where and who  then .     palen asked .   pocivil let out a long  shuddering breath and turned away from the autopsy theater .     what do you want to know first .        derec watched through the transparency as polifos assisted baxin in removing the brain and brain stem from the cyborg body .  he finally realized what bothered him about the scene  the colors were all wrong .  the blood was nearly purple  organs were gray or bronze colored  nothing looked like it came out of a human body .   he glanced back at the robot .  thales bogard remained nearby  silently observing the same operation .      what do you think  thales .     derec asked .     or should i call you bogard .         either  both  or some new name     the robot replied .     what do i think about what  derec .         this     derec said  gesturing at the cyborg .      i have not decided yet .         what do you mean .         the cause of coffee   s collapse was due to a misidentification .  it believed that it was intervening against a robot .  when he injured the being and realized that it had just assaulted an organic form  it naturally recoiled  assuming it had just attacked a human .         assuming .          i am not certain this construct qualifies as human .      derec felt a disquieting coldness form around his thoughts .  he stared at the robot for a long time .      you be sure to let me know when and what you decide     he said finally .      i shall  derec .          twenty six    a  riel felt intense relief upon seeing coren lanra .   he slumped in one of her sofas  head propped on one hand  elbow on the sofa arm  eyes half lidded .  he looked profoundly weary  fighting sleep .  he smiled crookedly when he saw her  and made an effort to sit straight .  he put weight on his left arm and winced .      as long as you   re here     ariel said     we   re getting that shoulder looked at .         no time     coren protested .     i had an interesting talk with the police last night .          don   t avoid the issue  you have no choice .  i won   t continue this with a damaged partner .      his eyebrows raised .     when did we become partners .         i   m not sure .  am i assuming too much .         that depends .      ariel ignored a spike of annoyance .     it always does .     she started unsealing his shirt .     you    re still getting looked at .          that was never a question .      he smiled .   ariel hesitated .  then  impulsively  she leaned forward and kissed him  very quickly and lightly  on the mouth .  coren stared at her  startled and  she thought  pleased .  she continued removing his shirt .      what have you been doing since taprin .     he asked .      hiding for the most part .  turn around .         the police surgeon said it   s cracked .          the bruise was spectacular .     is there some point you need to prove by finishing this in pain .      coren laughed sharply .     i told you i made an appointment with my doctor .  you didn   t answer my question .         nor did you .     she stood  his shirt in one hand .     but you will have that looked at .      he shook his head .     i need to talk to jeta .  tresha .  whatever her name is .  where is she .         three floors down  under guard .  she   ll wait .      he tried to stand .     then i have to go to nova levis .      ariel frowned .     the colony .         no  the lab .      she pressed down on his shoulder .  he winced but sat back down .     don   t bother .  it really was dismantled .     she turned toward her robot .      jennie .  who   s working the infirmary now .         i don   t suppose i can reason with you     coren said .      dr .  jerios     the robot replied .      of course you can     ariel told coren .      just do what i say .  thank you  jennie .  let her know i have a patient for her  we   ll be right down .  and bring me a robe  please .      coren let his head fall back .     can   t she come here .         she can  her equipment can   t .  come on .  up .  one more trip before you can sleep .         make up your mind  will you .  up or down .     coren grunted as he got to his feet .  he stumbled .     oops .  one stim too many  i think .  what do you mean  nova levis was dismantled .         what i said .  after it was closed down  the facility was gutted and converted to its present use .  there   s nothing there .     ariel took his right arm and guided him toward the door .      jennie  route my calls to the infirmary .         what about wenithal .     coren asked .      he   s fine .  same floor  separate quarters  under guard .         guard .         infirmary first .          i need to talk to tresha first .          no  first          she   s not jeta fromm .     coren disengaged from ariel .     the police identified jeta   s body in lyzig .  we need to speak to tresha now .      ariel regarded him for a moment .     all right .  we can stop there on the way .          fine .      they continued on down the corridor to the elevator .      ambassador burgess .     he said .      yes .         thank you .          for what .      coren smiled .     the list is too long .  just say    you   re welcome .            you    re welcome .       the elevator let them out on the guest floor .  ariel led the way to the rooms .   a tall  uniformed auroran stood outside each of two doors along the corridor .  ariel led coren to the nearest .  the guard bowed slightly and stepped aside .   tresha sat on the bed  pillows behind her  watching the subetheric across the room .  ariel glanced at what was being broadcast  it was a very old hyperwave drama  she remembered it vaguely  something based loosely on the first modern terran permitted to visit a spacer world after the long quarantine of earth  and stepped in front of the set  blocking the woman   s view .      i hope you   re here to apologize     tresha said as she touched the remote to switch off the subetheric .      for what .     coren asked .     not recognizing you sooner .      the woman laughed .      just who is this    tresha    person you keep talking about .         you tell me     coren said .     i   d like to know why she killed jeta fromm .         tresha shook her head .     look          jeta   s body was found .  .  . and identified .      tresha stared at him  eyes narrowed .  finally  she shrugged .      why kill her .     coren asked .     she was just a data troll .         why worry about her .     tresha returned .     she was  as you say  just a data troll .         did mikels order it .      her eyes widened briefly .  then she shrugged again .     if you know so much .  .  .      ariel said     we have both kyas vol and yuri pocivil in custody .  your cyborg is dead  it   s being dissected even as we speak .  so  if you want to play guessing games  it   s all right with me  but we don   t have to participate .      tresha pursed her lips .     you    re talking to the wrong person  gato .  i don   t know anything .         nonsense     coren said .     you were the contact for damik and wenithal .  you handle all the legwork on the ground .         so the messenger is supposed to know what the message is .      ariel waited for coren   s move .  he said nothing .  tresha looked at him  then at ariel  her eyes no longer so certain .      ask     tresha said .      why   d you kill jeta .         she was nosy .  she poked around into the wrong places .         how   d you pass for her in lyzig .         they didn   t know her .  i moved in there shortly after we terminated fromm .         why take her place .     ariel asked .      common sense .  if one commission for that data had come her way  more might .  i wanted to find out how many vectors there were leading to that information .          and the baleys .     coren asked quietly .   another shrug .     i don   t think i   ll answer that .         do you think you   re getting out of here without answering it .     ariel asked .   tresha smiled thinly in response  then looked at coren .     i understand your ex lover died on that last run .  for what it   s worth  i apologize .  it wasn   t personal .         that   s very comforting     coren said tightly .     you   ve been tidying up  haven   t you .  closing things down .  were you going to kill wenithal when you showed up at his apartment .      tresha touched the remote again and turned up the volume .  music swelled .      your cyborg is dead .     coren shouted .   tresha looked at him and shook her head .     we   re done .     she smiled briefly  then ignored him .   coren stalked out of the room .      who   s the solarian in charge .     ariel asked .  when tresha continued to ignore her  she spun around and jabbed the off on the subetheric .  the sound died instantly .     the solarian in charge     she repeated .     who is it .      tresha sighed .     you    re not as bright as i thought .          do you have any idea what it is you   re playing with .      tresha snorted derisively .     oh  please .  is this going to be an appeal to my naivety  or just my conscience .     she sat forward .     it   s all power  ambassador  raw  absolute  overwhelming  carnal  irreducible power .  do i know what i   m playing with .     she grinned .     i   m not playing  ambassador .      she stabbed the remote again  once more filling the room with sound .   ariel found coren waiting in the corridor  his back to the wall .      do you want to talk to wenithal .     she asked .      no .  let   s get my shoulder looked at first .        he said no more till they arrived in the embassy infirmary  where two robots placed him on a gurney and pushed him into a diagnostics bay .      what   s the problem  ariel .     dr .  jerios asked as she tapped commands into her console .     he looks like he needs about three days    sleep .     jerios frowned at her .     so do you  by the way .         that would be a good start .  but i need him up and alert by morning .  he   s been running on stims and painblock for about four days now .  his left shoulder is          cracked     jerios said .     my word  how did this happen .         he was grabbed by a very strong hand .      dr .  jerios shook her head skeptically  gazing at the scan image .     some hand .  i can see why he   s in pain .  all right  i can pump healant and accelerant into this .  actually  the stim saturation will be harder to deal with .  he should be allowed to sleep it off .      ariel shook her head .     no time .         then he   s going to be very grumpy .         as long as he   s alert .         oh  he   ll be alert .  i hope you get along well if you have to work together tomorrow .      ariel looked at coren through the transparency separating them .  he looked asleep now  his face relaxed as the robots carried out jerios   s instructions .      i think we get along well enough      ariel said .  in a whisper  she said to the sleeping lanra     you    re very welcome .            ariel  there is an emergency comm message for you     r .  jennie said .   ariel opened her eyes .  for a moment  she did not remember where she was  then realization came .  she was in her own apartment  still fully dressed .  coren was asleep in the guest bedroom .  she blinked at her robot .      a message from .  .  .  .     she asked groggily .      security .      ariel snapped to her feet and crossed the room .  she slapped the accept on her comm .     ambassador burgess here .         we   ve had a break in  ambassador     the security officer said .     two guards have been found unconscious  a third dead .  we   re sealing the embassy grounds and alerting staff .  please stay in your apartment          negative .  send extra security to the protected apartments .  the two people i brought in last night          we   ve already dispatched extra personnel there .  i am to advise you       she broke the link and ran out the door .     the scene she found when she stepped onto that floor shocked her .  at least five guards lay broken along the corridor .  both apartment doors stood open .   tresha was missing .  no real surprise there  ariel thought angrily .   she found wenithal in his bathroom .  he was dead  eyes staring blindly  head tilted at an awkward angle .      damn .     she shouted .   behind her  more security officers rushed by in the corridor .  she knew  though  that tresha was long gone .     the security recordings of the corridor showed the guards entering the hallway .  they joined the two already on station .  minutes later  something caught their attention from the direction of the elevator .  their hands  almost as one  went to their sidearms  but they began falling  one by one  twisting around  writhing in pain  thrown to the floor .  two of the guards managed to fire shots  but they  too  were suddenly seized by some spectral force and crushed .   after they had all been subdued  tresha   s door opened  and she emerged .  she rushed up the corridor to wenithal   s room and entered .   the view showed no one emerging .      masked     coren said .      but before or after the attack .     ariel asked .      after     coren said .     we never saw her leave the room before the attack  so that means she had help .      they watched the recording on ariel   s subetheric .  coren lay propped up in her bed  his left shoulder covered by a thick pad .  he had slept nearly six hours .  ariel knew he was angry that she had let him sleep while her people had scoured the embassy for the woman who had pretended to be jeta fromm  but he had said nothing in rebuke .      no one saw her leave the embassy     ariel said     but we can assume she   s gone .  the question is  where did she  or they  go .         petrabor maybe      coren said glumly .     tell me about nova levis .         i had a long talk with ambassador setaris last night .  i hate it when i   m treated like a child who can   t be told the truth .     ariel let herself experience the anger and irritation  she had felt during and after her meeting with setaris .  just for a few moments  while she composed her thoughts .      we   ve known that solaria has a compound on the ground on nova levis for several years  but until now we had no idea what it was or what they were doing .  just an enclave on an island  away from the settler towns and cities .  a lot of traffic in and out .  nothing we could do anything about .  it was a solarian holding originally  and they then let it to a settler colony  so we had no legal grounds to go in there to investigate .  several years ago  though  when the first talks began between earth and aurora to try to reconcile our differences  we were able to share data on black market trade .  nova levis was interesting because it seemed to be acting as a haven for several of the ships suspected to be regular contraband runners .  aurora made a few tentative inquiries with solaria  solaria offered to look into it  and what followed was a series of reports telling us that nothing illegal was happening on nova levis .  then the tiberius incident happened .         that   s what precipitated last year   s conference .     coren asked .   ariel nodded .     one of the things .  a terran smuggler challenged by an auroran police cruiser .  for whatever reason  it had drifted into our space and we insisted on inspection rights .  they refused and were fired upon .  the tiberius was on its way to nova levis .  among the facts that did not become public was that several solarian nationals were on board  primarily positronics specialists  but also a few geneticists .  we decided then to push for more cooperation with earth as a first step toward forcing solaria to open up .         which blew up in everyone   s face .         solaria will not allow ground inspections of nova levis .          i thought nova levis was refusing .         same thing  as far as we   re concerned .         so why hasn   t solaria   s involvement been made public .         games .  aurora can   t risk war with solaria until we know who our allies are .  or how much of the solarian government is involved .  we have to pretend to accept everything at face value until we have the proof necessary to convene a general council of the fifty worlds .         and the theians .         we   re using them as a potential cause for convening that council on other grounds if we can   t get it any other way .  if solaria moves to interdict a theian ship  we have the excuse .  if nova levis fires on a theian ship  we have the excuse .         and if earth actually gets permission to do the ground inspections .     coren asked .      what we find will give us the excuse     ariel replied .      in the meantime  the dance goes on until someone steps wrong .         the wonderful world of diplomacy .          i suppose that   s preferable to arbitrarily getting several hundred thousand people killed .          is it any different in the corporate world .         worse .  you can   t ever declare open war on each other .  at the end of all the games  you still have to sleep with the enemy .      she smiled .     i suppose even that could have its pleasant moments .      coren shot her a look .     i   m sorry  ambassador  but i don   t find any of this particularly amusing .      ariel jerked as if she had been struck .     i didn   t mean          someone very special to me is dead because you people are playing games .  i understand them  but that doesn   t make it any more acceptable .       ariel   s expression hardened .     don   t bleed too much  mr .  lanra .  you might pass out when i need you .       coren looked away  reddening .  he visibly controlled himself  then cleared his throat .     so what does aurora think solaria is doing on nova levis .            until this  we had no idea .  black market trade is too vague to really attack them with  to one extent or another  we all participate  or at least our citizens do .     she spoke evenly  the same tone of voice as before  as if their disagreement had not occurred .      until now .  you mean the cyborgs .         settlers couldn   t build them .  solaria has to be behind it .      she took a deep breath .     which means that  if part of the research and development was done here  there had to be a solarian contact on earth to funnel materials and technologies and manage the program .      coren blinked .     gale chassik was one of the original shareholders in nova levis .         but he divested before assuming head of the solarian mission .          which would make sense .  .  . but  why .         that   s a very good question .  i       coren   s comm chirped .  he snatched it up from the table at his right and stabbed at it .     lanra .     he listened for a time .  gradually  his face lost its composure .  he looked momentarily confused  then shocked .     i   ll talk to him .  where is he now .  good .  no  don   t tell him i   m coming .  thanks .         what is it .         come with me .  we have to see someone .         you need more          now  ariel .  please .        they took an embassy limo to the dynan compound  where coren easily passed them through security .  he led the way to the elevator  and tapped in the destination  a minute later  they stepped into a spacious  comfortably furnished suite .   someone was sitting in a chair  watching the subetheric .  coren held a hand up and felt ariel bump into it .   the subetheric showed rega looms at a press conference .         decision has not been taken lightly or capriciously .  for personal reasons i choose not to go into at this time  i must announce my withdrawal from this campaign .  i apologize to all those who have shown me their support through the last several months .  i know all our hopes have been compromised  but i trust they have not been destroyed .  there are others  more qualified than myself  to step into office and carry on the work to which i have pledged myself my entire life .  i do not       the screen went blank .  the man who had been watching now stood and turned .   coren stared .     rega .      rega looms looked at them both  his face expressionless and pale .      what are you doing  coren .     he asked quietly .     why are you here .         trying to find out why your daughter was murdered .      looms shook his head .     i want you to stop .  i don   t want you to go any further .  i want this ended .  now .         why .      looms shook his head again .     i don   t choose to discuss it .         that   s not good enough  rega .      looms looked mildly puzzled for a moment  then scowled .     you work for me  coren .  this investigation is over .         why .         i told you          why didn   t you tell me you had a son before nyom .      rega looms turned his back on coren and faced the dead subetheric .  coren waited till it seemed looms would say nothing more and reached down for his pack .      i   ve withdrawn from the campaign     looms said .     i was contacted by someone who threatened to release the fact you   ve just mentioned to the public and tie me in with people and concerns i broke from years ago .  of course  in the public   s imagination  nothing is ever finished  if i had once been in league with the enemy  i must still be so .  without even a chance to explain  my ability to function would be compromised and my reputation crippled .         do you know who sent it .         no .  not specifically .         when did this happen .         yesterday afternoon .  i tried to comm you  but you were unavailable .  i decided late last night to withdraw rather than hurt the church .      coren wanted to argue with him  tell him that people would understand  that they would support him because blackmail was so odious .  but he knew better .  the appearance of hypocrisy and the suggestion of a lie  even one of omission  turned people crudely incapable of compassion and robbed them of the ability to think when it came to politics .  coren had worked for the government  seen too many politicians go down in a mangle of innuendo simply because their constituency thought they had been betrayed by a promise compromised .  there was nothing else looms could do .      why didn   t you tell me .     coren repeated .      i didn   t tell anyone .  it was nobody else   s business .  it was my own grief  my own horror .  no one else has a right to that .         ree wenithal knew .      looms turned toward him .     wenithal .  what in god   s name are you doing with him .         he came up .  there was a kidnapping case and evidently you were part of it .          wenithal is a corrupt policeman who failed to follow through on that investigation .  i was peripheral to his case at the time  but we had several interviews because of jerem .         jerem .  that was your child   s name .      suddenly  looms    eyes flowed with tears .  his hands curled into fists and he looked toward the ceiling .     why won   t you let this end .      coren waited again .  looms sighed shakily and sat down on the edge of a couch .      jerem was born with a compromised immune system .  unusual  but not unknown  standard treatments exist for it .  but they didn   t work .  it got worse .  when he was a year old  it was obvious something was killing him .  finally  he was diagnosed with a nonorganic system infection .  a nanotech disease .  a leftover .      he glared suddenly at ariel .     a gift from our flirtation with technologies we should never have allowed .      the fury waned as quickly as it had emerged  and his gaze returned to the floor .     no treatment .  life support was available in certain institutions  but we had to .  .  . surrender him into their care .  .  .      he sobbed loudly .     it was easier .  they offered anonymity and promised to make him comfortable till he died .          did they tell you when he died .     coren asked .      no .  that was part of it .  we had to walk away .  in return  we guaranteed that it would never be made public .         what about birth records .         security locks .  the system has been in place for a long time .         locks can be picked  mr .  looms     ariel said .     this one was .         let me guess     coren said .     you bought shares in nova levis because they offered research into exactly what killed jerem .         oh  much more than that .  i named the place .  nova levis .     new light .     something i   d .  .  . borrowed .  .  . from the church .     looms shook his head .     i was naive .  i hadn   t yet realized that the original anti robot movement had been absolutely correct in their analysis that any concession on the issue of nonorganic life was nothing but a danger  a complete betrayal of all things human .  that this idea was fundamentally destructive and could never be controlled .          we   ve proven them wrong     ariel said .      have you .  you   re so utterly dependent on your robots that you   re dying out .  you don   t even reproduce anymore .         that   s          what .  untrue .  what is the average birthrate on a spacer world .  is it sufficient for replacement .  or are your populations dwindling .      ariel said nothing .      life is good among the spacers     looms went on  warming now to his own arguments .     two  three hundred years to explore the insides of your own psyches to the exclusion of all else  even the future .  the possibilities of self indulgence are so wonderful that you forget the most basic necessity of organic life  to breed .  it   s seen as an oddity  a curiosity  a peculiarity .  solarians don   t even share the same households  they can   t stand to be near others .  they breed ex utero .  aurorans find children too undignified and simply avoid the whole embarrassing thing .  but you compensate  you make life through your robots .  i imagine that this goes quite a distance in fulfilling the void in your hearts by the absence of real children .         we don   t have orphanages to warehouse the unwanted and uncounted     ariel said .   looms stared at her .      why did you sell your shares .     coren asked .      um .  .  . the research took a direction that repulsed me .     he frowned .     they began developing symbiotic prostheses  nonorganic augmentation that combined with organic systems  became essentially one with them .  i found this .  .  .  unacceptable .       that   s a lie     coren said .     you got out because jerem died .      looms glared at coren .     i know my own mind .  jerem died two years before i sold my holdings .         but it frightened you     ariel said .     the research .         yes  ms .  burgess  it did .  to preserve the few  we were threatening the very definition of    human .             isn   t that a little extreme .         is it .  where   s the line .  do you know where it is .  would you call your positronic creations    living  ms .  burgess .  i wouldn   t .  and i saw no good in blurring the distinctions further  no matter how many suffering infants it saved .          so you bailed out     coren said .     did you know there was a sister lab on a settler colony .         no .  but that wouldn   t have changed my decision .      coren sighed wearily .     it   s too late to stop this  rega .  i have to finish .          why .  i left it alone for almost thirty years  why can   t you drop it now .         i .  .  .     coren coughed .     i loved nyom .  this is personal for me .         you work for me .         i quit .       looms    face reddened .      this is out of your hands anyway  mr .  looms     ariel said .     aurora has a joint interest in this with terran authorities .  nova levis is the source of a problem to which your naivety may well have given birth .          you can   t make me responsible for any of this .         no .  try this  if you hadn   t turned your back on what you did and pretended since that it never happened  maybe what   s happened now would never have gotten this far .  you surrendered any chance of control over it when you surrendered your responsibility .         i did not act alone .         none of us ever do .  some of us forget that  though .  then there   s a mess to clean up .     she stepped up to coren .     mr .  lanra  aurora offers you a job working on our behalf in this matter .  along with that comes our sanction and protection .      coren could not look away from looms  even when he said     i accept  ambassador burgess .      a day earlier  the expression of betrayal he saw on looms    face would have broken his heart .  now it only annoyed him .      very well     looms said finally .     if you insist on going ahead .  use whatever facilities dynan has .  both of you .  any assistance my company may offer  feel free to use  ms .  burgess .      he walked past coren  to the door .  for a moment  coren thought he might look back .  but looms passed through  out of the suite .      you didn   t tell him that his son is still alive     ariel said .      i see no purpose in cruelty now .     coren looked around the office as if trying to memorize its details .     besides      he said at length     is it really his son anymore .          twenty seven    t  he configurations in the memory buffers are nonstandard  derec .       derec glanced at the console .     that   s what i expected  thales .  can you access them .         yes  but i cannot guarantee any degree of coherence .      everyone had gathered around the platform on which lay the slightly viscous mass of cyborg brain tissue and nearly fifty centimeters of what resembled spinal column .  instead of distinct vertebrae separated by disks  the spine was composed of overlapping sheathes that attached on clusters of bearing like spheres .   derec had found positronic nodes within the brain mass  though their links to the actual neurons of the brain were difficult to determine .  fine cables now entered the tissue  feeding back into the interface  connecting it to thales .   derec looked around at the others .  rana sat at the main board  monitoring the link .  palen  harwol  masid  and polifos stood on the opposite side of the platform .  baxin sat nearby  with two of harwol   s agents .   thales bogard stood behind them .      whatever you can give us  thales     derec said .      very well .  i am translating through my own language processors .  stand by .      silence stretched .   a loud hiss emerged from the speakers .  three screens flickered to life .  the far left hand screen displayed alphanumerics .  derec recognized the symbology  inferential calculus and asymptotic series  standard approaches to positronic interactions  but the groupings did not appear logical .  as the symbols flowed by  he spotted an equation that startled him       then       he recognized it out of combinatorial topology  but its use here baffled him .     you   re copying this to ariel  thales .         yes  derec .     thales paused .     i am seeing invariant topologies expressed in poincar   sets .  i surmise these are serving as anchor points between the organic neuronal structural and the positronic matrix .          i   m glad you have some idea what it means .       the second screen showed abstract shapes broken at intervals by recognizable objects  faces  buildings  rooms .  a catalogue of visual memory  delivered in a form derec comprehended from ordinary positronic excavations .   the third screen seemed to be nothing more than lists .  places  names  things .   the speakers popped loudly .  then     my owaaaaaaaaaaa .      the hiss seemed to modulate  then fade .   in a faint voice  sexless and tired     make it stop .      derec took a step toward rana .      it moves .  that   s what i like  more juice  give me some of that and that and turn it around again  stop it .         thales .     derec prompted .      the memory is stored nonhierarchically     thales said .     more like a human brain  although storage is discreet rather than undifferentiated .  i am trying other nodes .      the speaker crackled .     kill it .  what business does it have doing like that .  i came here expecting nothing .  pull that or put it away i can do better than          derec     thales said     i have identified a structure that seems to be a positronic external interface .          we can talk to it .     rana asked  surprised .      you can   t have that  it   s too complex and i   m too one thing or another .  get out of my borrowed          perhaps     thales said .     it depends on how reliable the connections are to the rest of the brain .  it is presently generating conceptual axioms similar to an organic condition known as korsakov   s syndrome .  imposing order may not be possible .         let   s try it     derec said .     it is now active .         can you hear me .     derec called out .  silence .      do you have a name .         several     the speaker said .     call me shit for brains  like greeshal does when i don   t answer right away  nice guy greeshal  should see me now  what do you want .         i want the name you prefer .          cordios .         what are you  cordios .         the answer to your problem .         do i have a problem .         a lot of problems .  main one  you   re alive .         so are you .  is that a problem  too .         wrong .  wrong .  error .  sorry .         you aren   t alive .         not since i was born .         when was that .         before i died .         cordios  do you remember becoming what you are .         do you remember being born .     it asked .      no .         then you must be human .         do you remember being born .     derec asked .      light  fade  pinpricks all through my head  i have now taken up the heat .  little nits chasing around through my spleen  see them run  see them caught and added to the dog .  everything hurts it feels right  for once i   m growing  i hear  i see  i touch when i want to .  .  . no  i don   t remember being born  just being reborn .  the clarity .  look  at  that .  if you made this then you must be good for something .  little shits can   t even reflect light  but boy do they inspire .  watch me mommy while i kill the cat .  if you don   t want me to break my toys then don   t give them to me  hypocrite  liar  that   s human  too .  left me here and all i did was breathe .  now i don   t even have to do that .  some things are worth dying for  you should see it from the other side .          what is this .     harwol asked .     this doesn   t make any sense .         you want sense  tissue .  try this  evolution has infinite vectors  most of them unrecognized  a lot of them artificial .  evolution by design only happens when design evolves .  riddle  riddles  junior piddles  spank him nice and kill him twice .  you   re all obsolete .  look at me  i   m the new standard .      thunder burst from the speaker then  fading quickly to a whisper  then silence .      the interface has been deactivated  derec     thales said .     why .         i do not know .         you had no reason   .         i did not deactivate it .  the subject did .         what does that mean .     palen asked .      it means     derec said     that this thing is still self aware .  it shut down the interface .         is that possible  boss .     rana asked .      i wouldn   t have thought so .  but .  .  . thales  see what you can salvage  then terminate the subject .         i may have a problem with that  derec .         what   s that .         is it human .      derec considered the question .     i see .  then just terminate the excavation .  i   ll deal with the remains .         yes  derec .       the names still danced across the third screen  but now the other two showed nothing .      thales  do you have any identification on the names being displayed .         yes  derec .  they are several lists combined .  i have names of people currently employed in warehouses  shipping departments  and ite offices .  dockworkers .  transportation specialists .  there is a separate list of merchant ships .  a considerable amount validates the information given by yuri pocivil .  another list of people and places which i infer from the locations are on settler colonies .  there is also a list matching files ariel instructed me to locate regarding the kidnappings which precipitated the investigation that closed nova levis .         they   re all the victims .         yes  derec .         i see .  copy all this to ariel .      derec walked away from the station .  he could feel everyone watching him .      so  now what .     masid asked .      we have to find them     derec said .         them     .         the rest .  the cyborgs .         so  now you   re convinced there   s more than one     harwol said .      something like this .  .  . yes  i am .  and we have to find them and stop them .          stop them from what .     palen asked .      taking our place .        coren  ariel  and ambassador setaris filled separate screens mounted on the wall of palen   s private office .  harwol  hofton  masid  and derec filled chairs around her desk .      pocivil hasn   t shut up since he agreed to talk      palen said .     so far we   ve identified twenty six locations for contraband  illegal transport  and warehousing on the ground  and seven bays here that are regular stops for the black market .         has he said anything about the operations being shut down .     coren asked .      that   s why he was heading back to cassus thole     palen replied .     operations on earth are finished  so he says  anyway .  frankly  i doubt that .         maybe a temporary hiatus     ariel said .     they ceased before  after wenithal   s investigation .         we   re prepared to move on all the sites     harwol said .     some of them are spacer owned  ambassador burgess .  we   re waiting on you to clear us .      ariel frowned .     derec  the cyborg  i went over the autopsy and excavation reports a little while ago .  how many of these do you think there could be .         i have no way of knowing     derec said .     seems safe to assume at least two of them  the one we have and the one down there .  blood scans confirm that this one here is not the same one that was in the cargo bin with the baleys .  but as for how many there might be .  .  .     he shrugged .      we will sign off on the raids  agent harwol     setaris said     under the condition that any cyborgs found  captured  or killed will be turned over to us for study .      harwol looked unhappy  but he nodded .     agreed .         and i want my people to have access to the sites after they   re secured .         i   ll see what i can do  ambassador .          this isn   t a good time to play things too close  agent harwol     setaris stressed .     your people know next to nothing about robots in the first place .  you won   t know what you    re looking at if these sites contain positronic equipment  you won   t know how to deal with any robots on hand  and you certainly won   t know what to do with any of it afterward .  if you encounter any cyborgs  you   ll be even less prepared .      harwol cleared his throat .     i understand .  how soon can you have people available to accompany our teams .         ariel .     setaris asked .      give the word     ariel said .   harwol was surprised .     do you have that many .         enough for what we consider the key sites .  i   ll copy the list to you .  you have people on kopernik who can fill the same roles there .         very well .  i want to move on this within the next six hours  ambassador .  the sooner we do  the more of these people we can catch .      ariel nodded .     agreed .  coren and i will be going in with the petrabor team .  coren has been there before .         mr .  lanra     harwol said     you are aware of the possible risks .  you aren   t an active agent   are you willing to submit to the team leader .         my status is problematic  agent harwol     coren said .     let   s stop talking and move .         very well .  all agreed  on my authority .  chief palen will coordinate the station raids .  if we time this well  we can shut it down all at once .       palen gave harwol a dubious look but said nothing .      one more thing     derec said .     these cyborgs  if there are more  will not succumb to stuns .  you       have to use lethal force  a lot of it  and that means some humans will probably be killed as well .  i suggest .  .  .     he hesitated  unsettled by his own thoughts .     i suggest you don   t worry about the human casualties .  these things  loose  are far more dangerous .       everyone stared at him for a time .  he felt acutely uncomfortable .   masid spoke then .     ambassador  what about the spacer end .         pardon me .     setaris asked .      obviously  there   s a spacer connection .  probably solarian  most likely an embassy official .  what will be done about that .         we   re already working on that .  we will take care of it .      masid nodded .      all right  then     palen said  standing .     let   s move .          twenty eight    c  oren watched the tbi team sort and ready their equipment for the third time .  the comm unit bead in his ear fed him updates on the status of all the other teams .  he still could not quite believe they expected to pull this off  the final count had been thirty one sites on the ground  and eight on kopernik  all targeted to be hit simultaneously .  it was ambitious .   but the clearances had come through from the aurorans  which  no doubt  would cause a furor within spacer circles  several sites were solarian  or keresian owned .   coren   s own pack lay at his feet  he had arrived prepared  and had never been one to check and recheck his equipment in nervous anticipation .  he glanced around the edge of the bay  toward the warehouse across the alley  the same one where all this had begun .  he distrusted tidy closures like this  but it seemed the most logical place for tresha to go .  she was either here waiting transport  or she was already on kopernik  in which case  sipha would grab her .   at least this time i don   t feel like i need a bath .  .  .   ariel sat nearby  her back to the wall  eyes closed  arms folded over her chest  legs outstretched with ankles crossed .  she gave the appearance  at least  of a seasoned field agent practicing patience  waiting for the go signal .  at this point  for all coren knew  she was  everything he had assumed about her had turned out to be insufficient for any reasonable assessment .  ariel burgess did not conform to easy descriptions or predictable definitions .   like nyom  he thought  only completely different .  .  .   the tbi team leader approached her  and squatted down to talk .  she spoke quietly and intently  instructing the ambassador on what she was expected to do .  ariel nodded and rose smoothly to her feet  then crossed the ancient floor of the bay and sat down .  a dozen agents huddled around her for one more question and answer session .   telemetry chittered in coren   s ear .  suddenly  he heard     set .  good to go .      he looked up and met the team leader   s eyes .  she nodded .  the huddle broke up into scurrying efficiency .  in less than a minute  everyone was loaded up and waiting for the word .   coren pulled his mask down  hoisted the pack onto his shoulders  and jumped from the edge of the bay .  he sprinted across the alley and leapt onto the apron of a mirror image bay .  he pressed against the wall and waited while the tbi team flowed throughout the alley  taking positions to cover him .   coren took a five centimeter square chit from his thigh pocket and slid it into the reader set in the wall .  the bay door rumbled up and he ducked inside .   three dockworkers looked up from the workstation around which they stood  shocked by the sudden intrusion .  automatically  their hands went up as tbi agents rushed in  aiming weapons at them .      down .     coren hissed at the workers .  they dropped to the floor obediently .     how many inside .  where .         um .  .  . short staffed     one of the workers said .     don   t  uh .  .  . there   s a special shipment  private .  .  . uh .  .  .         okay     coren said  tapping the man   s head .     quiet .      coren set the pack down on the loading dock .  the sounds of the warehouse and the distant port thrummed in the vast open spaces  constant and oddly reassuring .  trucks  dollies  crates  containers  all furnished the area .   he scooped out a handful of vonoomans and began methodically activating them .  upon release  they scampered into the recesses of the warehouse .  he sealed the pack then took out his palm monitor .      give them a few minutes     he said to the team leader .  he waved to an agent and pointed to the three workers .  immediately  they were restrained and moved out of the way .  the team leader spoke intently into her comm .   coren unfolded the monitor .  within seconds  a map of the interior sketched itself .  the little machines showed bright green on the schematic .  at no point did they change color to indicate human presence  not until one reached the transfer bays on the far side  where the bins for the shuttles came and went on automated tracks .  then several blue points appeared  huddled just outside one of the bay doors .  coren tapped ariel   s arm and pointed .      that   s them  then .     she asked .      i assume so .     coren refolded the monitor and stood .  he looked at the team leader .     ready .      she nodded silently .   vehicles rolled into the alley outside .   shouldering the pack  coren started forward .  now he felt anxious .  he wanted to get out there and find tresha and whoever else she had with her .   he was beginning to accept that nyom had died coincidentally  the result of a power struggle between forces that in all likelihood had not even been aware of her existence .  accept it  yes  but he would never be at peace with it .  all that remained for him now was to find those responsible .  after that .  .  .   he would never be able to work for rega again  even if looms were willing to have him .   i wonder if ariel   s offer is real .  .  .   at the rear of the bay  they ascended a short staircase .  the door at the top let them into an office area .  the squad seemed to fill it .   coren was unconcerned about tripping warehouse security monitors  he doubted any of the normal internal systems were on right now  but his targets might have placed alarms at various points .  he opened his pack again and took out another mass of tiny machines .  he keyed them and let them out in the corridor beyond the office .  scavengers  they would hunt down and eradicate any telltale devices they found .   he sat down before a comm and waited  watching his monitor .  when all the lights showed green  he nodded to the team leader .   swiftly and efficiently  the agents poured from the room and disappeared into the warehouse  each member with a preassigned location .  one of them remained behind .   the bead gave him new updates  reports from the various locations .  ariel listened to the same data  nodding silently to herself .   coren inserted a decrypter into the console before him and initiated the invasive routines .  within seconds  the data stored in the warehouse systems was isolated from the delete protocols that would have erased everything upon a single command  a command  coren noted  which had not yet been given .  secured  he opened a comm channel and began sending all this information to another site .      done     he announced .     let   s go .      the trap was closing as coren and ariel hurried through the administrative areas of the warehouse .  with palen coordinating on kopernik and agent harwol coordinating on the ground  the global sweep was underway .  warehouses  shipping firms  and ships were being seized .  executives were being picked up for questioning .   alda mikels was about to be arrested again .   he entered the same office area he had been in five days ago  overlooking the gridlike expanse of the warehouse proper .  so familiar and so strange  things rarely formed neat closures or elegant symmetries in his profession .  there was a mirror like quality to this  though  that gave him a sense of validation  confirming his choices and assuring him that his purpose was necessary and sufficient .  perhaps this feeling was wrong  an illusion  but he could use it .  he moved unhesitantly .   halfway across the grid they heard the first blaster shots .  then shouting .  coren recognized the stentorian timbre of tbi commands .  arrests were underway .   he crossed the apron to one of the open doors leading out to the transport grid .  agents stood above eight people who lay face down on the floor  hands clasped behind their heads .  nearby sprawled three corpses  smoke still coiling listlessly from their wounds .   coren went from prisoner to prisoner  then to the bodies .  no tresha .   the maze of cargo bins beyond was motionless  the power cut .  huge cubes scattered across the vast field hovered on their self contained antigravity cushions .   in his ear  coren continued to hear reports of successful raids  arrests  a few casualties .   but no cyborgs .   he pulled out his optam and scanned the field of inert blocks .  no movement .  he strode onto the grid .      coren       ariel came after him  the tbi agent trailing behind .     where     she asked     are you going .         they   re here     coren said .     they have to be .     he turned away and continued walking .      there are agents at the other end     ariel called .      i know .      the tbi were very good at these sorts of things  they rarely botched a raid  but coren wanted the confrontation .  things were going too well  the sites were being taken efficiently  arrests made quickly  few fatalities  but he wanted more of a mess  an excuse to get angry and desperate and violent .   he moved quickly  though cautiously  among the eerily still cargo bins .  the air smelled of ozone  and he felt a faint  dry tingle over his skin .  the maze stretched a good two kilometers to where the port machinery sorted out the containers  those arriving and those departing going to separate chutes to the correct shuttles .   he stopped .  he could not see the warehouse end now through the forest of cubes .      gamelin .     he called  voice echoing .     did you know who she was .  the baley runner you killed .     he listened to the answering silence .     nyom looms .  do you remember that name .      he continued walking .     she was your sister  gamelin .  did you know you had family .      coren stopped and looked to his left .  he glimpsed a tall shape  dull gray  slightly crouched  standing outlined against one of the bins .   coren raised his blaster .   suddenly  the shape came toward him faster than coren had ever seen anyone move .  if it were not moving directly at him  coren doubted he would have been able to discern a single detail .   but the moment seemed infinite in what he could see   a face  pockmarked as if by horrible disease .  wide set unblinking eyes .  a hairless skull .  wide shoulders .  a runner   s build .  a dead alive intensity  unchanging  mutated into an expression of profound resentment .   coren wanted more than anything to run .   he fired  too late .  the charge slammed into the cyborg   s torso  but momentum carried it into coren .  he felt as if his entire body had been slapped all at once .  he flew back  into one of the cargo bins  and dropped onto his buttocks painfully .   coren rolled and slowly rose to his feet .   when he turned again  the cyborg stood less than a meter away .  he suppressed the impulse to try to shoot it  he doubted he could raise his weapon fast enough .      gamelin .     coren said .      pleased to make your acquaintance  human     it said  its voice a rasp like dried paper scraps and crushed bone .     we don   t know each other  do we  gato .         maybe  in a way .  is that your only name .         only need one .         how about jerem .      it cocked its head quizzically .     you have a name .         coren lanra .         that   s two names .  never figured that .  what  humans got to have more than one of everything .  how come you never give anything else more than one name .         you know better than that .  look at your homeworld .  it   s got four names  nova levis  and cassus thole .         don   t forget the star now .  tau secordis .  six names .  but other living things .  one name .         are you a living thing .      gamelin shook its head .     not really .  but i don   t mind .  it   s not so bad being dead .  you should try it .     he took a step forward .     what was that you said about a sister .         you killed her .         not possible  gato .  i don   t even have parents .         you did .      gamelin looked puzzled .     how   d i kill her .         broke her neck when she wouldn   t breathe your poisoned air .      gamelin   s eyes blinked  very slowly .  coren could not read its expression .  the cyborg   s eyes narrowed briefly .      not acceptable     it said .      coren .     ariel   s voice called .   gamelin looked around .  coren gripped his weapon and brought it up .   the cyborg moved fast  laterally .  coren fired .  the bolt struck a cargo bin  punching a hole in it .  something within it had been under pressure and now shot out of the wound  sending the entire container careening off its track into another one .  within seconds  they dominoed off and into each other  and coren watched  stunned  at the sudden pile up .   the grid   s ai tried to compensate .  bins that had been immobile now began precipitously changing tracks and rearranging to avoid the collisions .  enormous piles of metal rammed each other .  bins bounced around like toys .  the drumming of colliding bins filled the vast chamber .  somewhere the violent hiss of escaping gas cut through the thunder  the bin he had punctured .   what was i thinking about this being too neat and efficient .  .  .  .  coren wondered .   through the din  four harsh blaster shots  like air tearing  focussed his attention .      ariel .      he looked around for her  just as gamelin grabbed him .   coren felt a bolt of terror pulse through him as he was lifted off his feet by one arm .  the hand that gripped him compressed muscle and bone on his forearm  impossibly strong  and he understood how jeta and damik and the brethe dealer and others unnamed had died .  the blaster fell from his hand .   now  was all he thought as he looked into gamelin   s face .     ariel ran .  cargo bins careened in her wake  seeming to chase her .  when the inert cubes had begun to move to compensate for the sudden threat to property  restarted by a watchful but uncreative ai  she expected to be crushed between them .   she glanced back .  one bin bounced randomly among the others  a thick spray of gas squirting powerfully from a hole in its side .  she considered shooting it again  but that might only make it worse .  she kept running .   finally  near the warehouse end of the transport maze  the banging ended and the shifting bins stopped shifting .  ariel looked back into the altered landscape and thought  even if very little is damaged  getting all this straightened out is going to take some doing .  .  .   when it was clear that nothing else was moving  she started back .      ambassador .     the tbi team leader came up alongside her .     the warehouse is secured  we have nine people in custody  and we found four robots in stand by niches .  your assistance is required to secure them .          are they moving .     ariel asked .      no          then they already are secured .  forget about them .  coren   s out here .         ambassador .      the woman stepped in front of ariel and stopped .  ariel came up against her outstretched hand .     please go back .  we   ll find mr .  lanra .         you can accompany me .          please  i insist          something started this disaster     ariel said  waving her hand around at the jumbled bins .     coren   s vonoomans located no other people than those you already have in custody .  which means .         ambassador          which means you can accompany me  but i   m going .       ariel stepped around the agent .  she heard a sharp hiss of breath  a signal  and then running feet .  two more agents joined her  along with the team leader .   they spread out laterally and worked their way through the labyrinth of containers .   the number of damaged bins grew the further they went .  clusters of toppled containers formed tangles .  ariel held her blaster in both hands  her pulse racing .   i must remember in the future that i don   t really have to do this  she thought .   she heard voices .  moving toward them  it became clear that one of them was coren  but the other  rasping and low  was not even clearly human .   ariel came around a pair of mashed bins and saw coren dangling by one arm from the grip of the cyborg .  coren nodded as the cyborg spoke to him  its head tilted forward on enormous shoulders .   ariel licked her lips .  now what .   in those seconds of indecision  the cyborg suddenly straightened and looked around .  it saw ariel .   indifferently  it dropped coren .   in that instant  a blaster shot splashed against its back .     no .     ariel shouted  then pressed the stud on her own weapon .   gamelin   s pain came out like dust laden wind .  the cyborg took a few more steps  and fell .  coren squirmed and pushed and managed to crawl away .  the stench of scorched fabric  melted plastic  and meat filled ariel   s nostrils .   ariel hurried forward  along with the tbi agents .  one of them grabbed coren   s jacket and dragged him further from the cyborg .   ariel stopped a meter from it  keeping her weapon aimed at its head .  it lay face down .  smoke wafted up from three burns on its back and shoulders .   the team leader took its arm and heaved  turning it over .   gamelin surged up suddenly  brushing away her weapon and clutching her jacket .      oh  kill me slow  gato     it said .     it   s the only thing i have left to feel .      it placed one enormous hand over her face and squeezed .  bone snapped with sickening delicacy  and the team leader screamed .   ariel jerked the trigger of her blaster  the shot grazed gamelin   s arm .  the cyborg stood and tossed the body of the team leader at the other agent  turned  and fled .  ariel tried to hit it again  firing repeatedly .  but none of the shots found a target  and gamelin soon disappeared among the cargo bins .   ariel   s breathing came heavy as she went to coren .  sweat covered his face  but he was conscious .      it knows     he said .     i told it .         how bad are you .     ariel ran her gaze over him  settling on his right arm .  she reached for it .   his other arm came up and stopped her .     hurts .         we   ll get help .         tresha must already be in transit     coren said .     contact sipha .  .  . make sure .  .  .      ariel felt momentarily frantic about his injuries  but she nodded and stood .  she went to the other agent  who held the team leader in his arms .  her face was turning black already .  one eye bulged hideously .   somehow  though  she was still alive .   ariel raised her comm and started issuing orders .     derec listened absently to the tense comm traffic being monitored behind him .  he gazed out of the office across the empty dock  waiting for the instant the bay doors opened and the shuttle for which they waited slid into the station .   masid came up beside him .      reports from groundside indicate a rousing success      masid said .   derec glanced at him .     how come you don   t sound pleased .      masid raised his eyebrows .     it   s not finished .  i   m never happy till it   s over .         all the settler bays in question have been seized     derec mused .     we have prisoners  some of whom are already giving up information          ah  but they don   t really know a lot .  most of it won   t amount to very much unless we can persuade this one      he nodded toward the bay below them      to talk .  tresha   s the key to the whole thing .         you never struck me as a pessimist .          pragmatist .  big difference .         coren   s been hurt     palen announced .   derec and masid turned toward the room .  harwol sat behind one desk  hand to his ear .  palen occupied another desk opposite him .  she looked at derec .      ambassador burgess is all right     she said .     the cyborg got away .         damn     masid said .      is lanra hurt badly .     derec asked .      crushed forearm     palen said .     reparable .  tresha is in transit .     she touched a contact .     look sharp  people  the main fish is coming into our net .       derec turned away .  one cyborg still loose .  they had found no others .  part of him was reassured  at least they would not have to deal with any more right now  but he could not convince himself that these represented the only two .  from what polifos had told them  it was an old and ongoing program .  somewhere  there were more .   maybe tresha could tell them .      damn it .     palen shouted .     her shuttle is changing vector .  it   s heading to another bay .  who gave clearance for that .      harwol looked up .     i   m moving my people now .  do you have the new destination .      palen listened intently .     working on it .  .  . come on .  .  .  shit  it   s going to a solarian dock .      masid leaned close to derec .     what did i tell you .      derec went to an empty chair and pulled himself to a comm .  he tapped in a code and waited .  ambassador setaris appeared on his screen .      ambassador     he said     we have a new situation .  our last target has switched destination from the settler dock she was scheduled for to the solarian section .      setaris   s eyes widened .     what do you need  mr .  avery .         we   re moving on her regardless     derec said  glancing at palen and harwol  who both nodded .     you might want to start working on smoothing things over with ambassador chassik now .         thank you for the warning .  good luck .          move      harwol said  looking at palen .     your station  your arrest .       palen jumped up and headed for the exit .   masid nodded for derec to come along .     when they reached the dock in question  solarian security  keresians  blocked access .  palen pushed her way through the knot of tbi and station security .  she brought her face close to the chief of solarian security .      chief palen     she said .     stand aside .  this is a lawful entry .         i have orders      the keresian started .   palen shoved him to one side and stabbed the access panel .  the door opened .   her people poured through .   they crowded into the control booth .  operators started to abandon their positions .      sit down .     palen shouted .     you   re receiving an unauthorized shuttle .  when will it be in the bay .         your pardon  chief palen      one of the operators said     but we received authorization fifteen minutes ago .         from who .         our embassy  of course .      palen stared at the man .     are you going to tell me that this shuttle is under diplomatic protection .         i  well          entering the cradle now     another operator said .      bring it in     palen ordered .     embassy clearance or not  that shuttle is impounded .      below  the huge doors opened .  tractor lines drew the sleek  bullet shaped shuttle into the  bay .  once it had cleared the opening  the doors sealed and the bay started pressurizing .   palen moved to the access hatch .     security  with me .  avery  you get on the comm and do liaison with your people .  masid  you do the same with harwol .         pressurization complete      an operator announced .   derec went to the comm console and tapped in a code .  the channel to the auroran embassy  earthside  showed open .   the hatch slid aside and palen led her squad of police down the stairs .  the hatch closed behind them .  derec went to the window and watched the security teams spread out around the shuttle .   masid joined derec .     now maybe i   ll start being optimistic     he said .   derec looked at the chief operator .     who issued the clearance .         i   m not at liberty to          don   t .  a name .  was it chassik .      the man looked embarrassed and uncertain .     derec     masid said .   below  the shuttle hatch opened .  palen took a position at the base of the ramp  hands on hips .  a woman appeared in the hatchway .  for a long  long moment  she gazed down at the security people and palen .   there was a faint series of flashes around the bay door .  and then  between one instant and the next  the door itself blew outward .   derec flinched back .  the shuttle lurched off its cradle  the prow rolling over palen .  bodies lifted off the deck and sailed out the gaping hole .  the shuttle itself caught against the sides of the dock  wedged briefly .   then it exploded .   there was no sound .  derec fell to the floor .  he could hear the walls of the control booth creaking under enormous stress  but they did not yield .   minutes later  he managed to stand .   the bay was empty of anything that might have been loose .  the walls were stained black  and the hatch itself was buckled outward .  the shuttle was gone  and no one remained in the now airless space .       epilogue    d  erec watched masid pack .  the man wore the clothes of someone used to moving around  comfortable  lots of pockets  simply cut .  the pack  though  contained tools and devices no baley would carry .      you   re sure about this .     derec asked .      i   ve got the best chance of getting to nova levis of anyone     masid said .     already worked it out with the tbi and the aurorans  so don   t even try talking me out of it .          is there anything i can do .      derec had grown quite fond of masid in the last few days  since the world had changed .  derec had few enough friends .  the thought of losing a new one disturbed him .   but palen   s death had affected masid profoundly .  he was angry and felt the need to do something .  derec believed going off like that was a bad idea  but he could think of no convincing argument to stop masid .      you   ve got your hands full here     masid said .  he glanced significantly at the robot standing near the door .     you wouldn   t want to loan that to me  would you .      derec started .     that could be awkward  don   t you think .  having a robot with you wouldn   t be the most inconspicuous thing you could do .         true  but i think i   m going to miss it .      the dw    did not react .  derec needed to schedule a complete diagnostic for it .  thales was unable to tell him very much about its make up  everything was guesswork and projection .  for a time  it had insisted on accompanying masid .  it took a good deal of insistent talk to convince it to stay with derec .  he recognized bogard   s attachment to duty  certainly  but its facility at debate was all thales .  derec doubted he would win every argument with this new creation  this composite .      you   re right     derec admitted .     besides  ariel asked me to help her do the analysis on the cyborg we acquired .            acquired    .  interesting term .     killed and captured    would be more accurate .          if you destroy a robot  do you kill it .      masid frowned .      it   s a good question     derec continued .     i   d say no .  they aren   t  strictly speaking  alive .  can you make the same statement about a cyborg .  they   re organic  certainly  but are they human .         or human enough .     masid nodded .     too much philosophy for me .  i   m just a spy .     he finished packing and sealed the bag  then turned back to derec .     we need to say goodbye .  it   ll take me a few days to work myself back under cover so i can do this with any expectation of success .  i   ll be on kopernik for a time still  but after this we can   t know each other .      derec took masid   s hand .     be safe .         always my intention .      masid shouldered the pack and walked quickly out .   derec looked at the dw    .     what am i going to do with you .         whatever you wish     the robot replied .     within limits .      derec started  then laughed out loud .     what do i call you .         the preponderance of my matrix is based on bogard .         in that case  welcome back  bogard .  we have a lot to talk about .  .  .  .        derec found hofton in the positronics lab with rana .  they looked up at him dourly when he entered .      now who died .     derec asked .   neither smiled .      ariel can   t get you permission to bring bogard down     hofton said .   derec considered the news for a moment  then shrugged .     so i expected .         she   s also being seconded to auroran intelligence .      he started .     what .         the cyborg is being shipped back to aurora .  they want her to work on it .  classified work  of course .          i thought          she wants you  boss     rana said .     but if you leave earth .  .  .         i won   t get back .         it is unlikely     hofton admitted .      i see .         boss       derec held up a hand .     we   ve got a little time  don   t we .         a few days     hofton said .     not much more  i   m sure .         we   ll work something out .     derec looked around the lab .     i need a workstation set up for a full diagnostic .  is thales still linked up .      rana nodded .     no one   s shut it down yet .         fine .      work would take his mind off the situation for a time .  perhaps he could come to terms with what amounted to exile .   yart leri strode into the lab .  he gazed about  eyes wide  until he saw derec  rana  and hofton .      there you are     he said  coming up to them .     have you heard .  no  of course you haven   t .  i just found out myself .         rega looms has won the election despite having withdrawn .     hofton said dryly .   leri frowned at him .     no  of course not .         sorry  ambassador     derec said  giving hofton a look .     what haven   t we heard .         nova levis .  a blockade runner has fired on a theian perimeter ship .  we may have a war on our hands .        ariel   s lower back ached from the too stiff posture .  she could not make herself relax  and the chair simply could not compensate for her tension .   the room felt cold  too .  she was not entirely sure that was not an illusion  her own projection .  no one around the conference table smiled  the mood was sepulchral .  for the last four hours  setaris had conducted the meeting  hearing  really  with all the warmth of a stone slab .  after the first hour  gale chassik had stopped looking at anyone .  he answered the questions put to him in monosyllables when possible  offering as little detail as he could get away with .   the clearance that had allowed the shuttle carrying tresha to switch destinations to the solarian section of kopernik had come from his office .  he refused to acknowledge responsibility  but he could not deny the evidence .   he had stopped responding to questions at all nearly an hour ago .  ariel had been asked a few questions concerning details of the raid  but otherwise had not participated in the proceedings .      in view of the circumstances     setaris said finally     i cannot in good conscience overlook the potential culpability in this matter on the part of ambassador chassik .  therefore  as head of the joint legation of the fifty worlds on earth  i revoke his ambassadorial authority pending a hearing to review charges of abuse of office and negligence .  such hearing will be held on aurora at a date to be determined by the auroran legislature .  until then  ambassador chassik is remanded to house arrest  and his duties shall be assumed by another mission to be chosen by mutual agreement of this body .      chassik looked up .     you    re making a vast mistake  sen .          possibly     setaris said .     but a vastly smaller one than i would be making were i to allow you to continue as ambassador .  any questions .     she surveyed the table .     good .  this meeting is adjourned .      ariel gratefully pushed away from the table and stood .   chassik met her at the door and blocked her way .      and  indeed  we have not finished  ambassador     he said .   ariel glanced at the two security guards flanking him .  they stepped closer .  chassik glared at them  then left the room .      he   ll probably be recalled     setaris said .   ariel turned .      i   ll see to it he leaves before you do     setaris continued .     i apologize  ariel .  i know you wanted to remain on earth  but .  .  .         but i   m much more valuable where i can be kept an eye on     ariel said .     i understand .         ariel  i actually envy you leaving so soon .  i don   t imagine that we   ll have a mission here for much longer .  once the terran senate finishes casting us in the role of the devil for having spawned a new menace  we   ll be asked to leave .  if war actually breaks out .  .  . well  i don   t look forward to leaving under those conditions .          why would earth make war on us .  it was a settler ship that fired on a spacer ship .         prejudice .  we   ll be assuming control of the blockade  earth will feel some perverse sympathy for the settlers that we are then blockading  and the situation will degenerate from there .     setaris shrugged .     i may be too cynical  though .  perhaps none of this will actually happen .  if not  perhaps you can return .       ariel could think of no response .  she wanted to go back to her apartment and have a drink .   or go see coren .   which would be more dangerous right now .  she wondered .      we can talk again before you leave      setaris said .     arrangements need to be made and so forth .  till then  as a favor to me  be careful .      as she watched setaris walk away  ariel thought  i   m not happy about leaving earth  but it will be a relief to get away from her .     rega looms finished the meeting and sat behind his desk  eyes closed  trying to find the satisfaction he once enjoyed from business well concluded .  nothing .  after a time  he sighed and wondered if anything  ever again  would give him any joy .   melodramatic thought .  .  .   he poured himself a glass of brandy and drank it slowly .  when it was finished  he left the office and ascended to his private chambers .   on the desk in his residential office lay the draft of his next sermon .  he was alone now  wife dead  both children dead .  he had nothing left but his company and his church .  politics was over for him  at least as a personal activity .   he toyed with the ancient pen he always used to hand write these pieces  but  looking down the lines of neatly calligraphed words  he could think of nothing more to add just now .   the world was ending and he had said everything .  .  .   looms shook his head .  ridiculous .  still  he felt that way often .  what if  tomorrow  time stopped and the end came .  would he have done all he needed to do .   some things he no longer could finish .   there were words he had needed to say to nyom .  .  .   he walked into his bedroom .   someone sat on the edge of the bed .  a large man  dressed darkly  bare head bowed .      who are you .     looms asked automatically .  he thought of the gun in his nightstand .   the man raised his head .  the room   s lighting played off of pale skin  rough  scarred complexion  and large eyes that seemed somehow artificial .  he grinned .      hello  daddy     said gamelin .     so nice to see you after all these years .   .  .
