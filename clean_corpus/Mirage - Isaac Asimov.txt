last meeting before the arrival of the humadros legation and the start of the conference .  if there are any other issues which need to be discussed or added to the agenda  now is the time to put them on the table .  i think it best that there be no surprises from any of us .      the thick man with amber tinged white hair looked around the table at the eighteen others .  all of them appeared here  in this non place  altered or enhanced .  younger  slimmer  more hair  fewer lines  opportunistic vanity .  even the chairman tweaked his appearance here .  it was a running joke among them outside the maui construct .   when no one raised any new issues  he nodded solemnly .     i thought not .  we   ve pretty much talked this thing to death over the last year .  how we failed to kill it is beyond me .      the laughter that rippled around the table was light  though sharpened with an edge of nervousness .  the chairman reached out and touched a button on the table .      i   m uploading the final draft of our platform .  in four days the spacers arrive at kopernik station .  the day after  they shuttle down to union station in washington  d .  c .   for the mediafest senator eliton has planned .  there will be a grand reception that evening .  after that  the negotiations begin .  i want us all well versed on our agenda .  i don   t think i   m overstating it to say that these talks will be the most significant this century  possibly this millennia .  a great deal is at stake .  i don   t want anyone breaking ranks on this at the last minute .         just how much  if anything  do you really think we   re going to lose .      the chairman looked at the man at the far end of the table .     i don   t expect to lose very much at all .  ambassador humadros hopes to alter our traditions and change history by offering more open markets  exchange of technologies  better policing along the shipping routes  lower tariffs  the usual package of incentives intended to force policy to change .  not that it isn   t a tempting package  i expect that we   ll end up signing off on some of it  maybe even a lot of it .  in fact  i imagine it would be very profitable in the short term .  but she hopes to break our resistance to positronics .  i expect her to go home disappointed .      anxious looks crossed the table .  not everyone on the committee  he knew  agreed that positronics was a bad thing  but all of them understood how the markets and their future holdings could be effected .  the chairman was always impressed at the degree of nuance the program translated .  he could always tell  no matter what each member did to modify their own projection  who was genuinely comfortable with the setting and who still felt uneasy .  the chamber did not exist outside the buffers of the data module  but it was patterned on one that had once jutted from the side of a tower built just below the summit of puu kukul  on the island of maui in the hawaiian chain .  the view was spectacular  overlooking a meandering valley through which the honokahua stream ran on its way to the pacific ocean .  the openness of it challenged them .  the suggestion of limitless sky unnerved the average terran  but none of the members of this forum considered themselves average .  a little agoraphobia would not  they claimed  dictate to them .   still  it was a construct  and they all knew it .  the chairman wondered if they could so bravely attend meetings in the flesh outside the walls that defined their existence and their identities as citizens of earth .      in my view     he continued after a pause     we have come to a consensus on this matter .  are we  in fact  agreed .      nods rippled all around .      good .  the upload is complete .  please be thoroughly familiar with all the points before the conference begins .  i know i can depend on you .      singly and in groups of two and three the attendees faded from the table .  alone finally  the chairman stood and walked to the window .  he felt his pulse increase  a tremulous thrill in his groin and behind his sternum  as he stood at the edge of the view and confronted it .  it was lovely .  the ocean far in the distance formed a sharp  straight horizon above which the blue  blue sky arched .  he wondered at times what had driven people to hide from the universe and burrow into the earth .  it surprised him sometimes to realize that in this he had much in common with both spacers and settlers .   some  at any rate .  he knew of settler worlds where the warrens of earth had been and were being duplicated in alien soil under other suns .  what  he wondered  was the point of leaving a place only to bring it with you .   his heartrate regulated finally .  he reached into his jacket pocket and found the small square .  he gave it a squeeze and the windows opaqued to black .  it was a good illusion  this chamber .  he sometimes forgot for a few seconds that he was not standing in anything  that it was all a construct of numbers and electrons .  a mirage .   he turned back toward the table and squeezed the square in his pocket again .  there was barely a flicker .  the scene seemed to skip sideways a centimeter or two  hardly noticeable unless anticipated and expected .  the automated recorders were now being fed a secondary illusion  one that showed the chairman sitting in a chair  gazing out at the lovely  frightening vista of naked earth  the way he often did .   the deception was necessary because of the redundant monitors the entire committee maintained on the site .  time records  the comings and goings of members  the alternate uses of the chamber  all recorded for the benefit of mutual distrust and mutual oversight .  the committee conducted official business here and so the construct was always running .  of course  they could meet in public  but there were other monitoring and recording systems in many of those places  it was much safer to say certain things here  within the sphere of their own complimentary suspicions  where only they could get at the records .  the system had been built to prevent exactly what the chairman was now doing .      secured     he said .   two figures reappeared at the table .  they ran their own masking programs  so their faces were difficult to see clearly  and their voices were altered into unrecognizability .  but the chairman knew who they were  and they knew him .      where   s our judas .     the chairman asked .      he wished to be absent during the final preparations     the indistinct apparition to the chairman   s right said .     he   s in agreement  but wants to remain free of the actual planning .  deniability  he says .         a true politician     the other figure said .   the chairman suppressed a disgusted response .  he sat down .      very well .     he drew a loud  dramatic breath .     briefly  everything is in place on my end .  the program is running and we   ll have fifteen minutes of operational time .  what about security .         taken care of     the left hand ghost said .     my people are in place and ready .         and the operations team .         set     answered the right hand ghost .     give the word and we go .      the chairman leaned back  enjoying a sensation of accomplishment .  he sighed .     ambassador galiel humadros of aurora believes she can change the face of terran policy and tradition .  she has our own senator clar eliton to thank for validating that illusion .     he looked across the table to the ghost on his right .  after a few seconds  the indistinct face looked away .      you know     the other ghost said     there are elements of this treaty that aren   t terrible .         which elements do you mean .     the chairman   s voice became blunt  almost monotonal in its derision .     the part where spacer industry is allowed to set up factories on earth as cooperatives with native companies .  or the reduced tariffs that could cut government revenues in half  which would mean that our government would be forced to make up the shortfall through increased local taxes .  or is it the limited reintroduction of positronics to the open market .      his tone turned mocking .     or could it be the sentiment of reconciliation that permeates every clause and paragraph of the draft proposal .  how does the preamble go .     the people of earth and the people of the settled worlds share a common heritage and should not be separated by ideology or divided over commerce .      do you wish to sit down to break bread with our lost children of aurora and solaria and reminisce over the branching past .  what parts of this treaty    aren   t terrible    .  educate me .         that   s enough     said the left hand ghost .     sometimes i wonder if you aren   t a fanatic .  the fact is we stand to lose a great deal of money if positronic inspections are instituted for interstellar shipping .  the black markets have been too lucrative and we   re bound to them now  but it   s just profit .  i don   t think we should forget that .  we   re doing this to protect our margins  period .  i don   t have any ideological axes to grind .  nobody  not earth  not settler  and especially not spacer  is going to damage my business .  that should be enough .  this isn   t a holy war .         no .     the chairman asked .     perhaps not .  but you should study history more .  you might find yourself agreeing with the fanatics more than you   d expect .     he settled back in the chair .     that brings me to another point .  the tiberius incident which precipitated this conference was nothing but sloppy handling on the part of the captain .  it should never have escalated to the point of provoking the auroran ship .  once we get through the upcoming event  i think a restructuring of our smuggling operations is in order .  shipments have been cut to less than half their former size because of this nonsense .  a year of this is too much .  but i don   t want a repeat of that mess .         do you think after the conference we   ll still be doing any business with spacers .     the left hand ghost asked .      oh  yes .  more .  they won   t be able to get terran products through legitimate channels .  not as easily  at any rate .  possibly  depending on how angry their governments are  not at all .  the market won   t go away and we   ll be able to raise prices due to any embargo .  business will continue  make no mistake .  i   ve already made inquiries into alternate routes and methods .  i think  once the dust settles  we can look forward to doubling our former revenues .         we   ve heard none of this     the left hand ghost complained .      of course not .  i   m waiting till afterward  so that if anything goes wrong  you will all have deniability .         or anything to take to the authorities .      the chairman frowned .     why do you goad me so much .      the ghost shrugged .  the indistinct form made the gesture seem liquid  like the slap of water against a wall .      it   s best     said the ghost     that we never forget the nature of what we   re doing .         we   re putting a stop to a bad idea     the chairman said .     risks are necessary to do so .  speaking of which  you      he pointed to the right hand ghost      are taking the greatest risk .         so .         any second thoughts .         all the time .  but it   s necessary .      the chairman nodded .     then we won   t speak again .         true .     the ghost sighed  a papery sound that seemed ancient .     flesh  not steel .         flesh  not steel     the other two repeated .      good bye .      the ghost faded out  leaving only two .      will he go through with it .     the left hand ghost asked .      the beauty of this is that once the reception at union station begins  he won   t have any choice     the chairman replied .     but i think we should make absolutely sure he doesn   t suffer a crisis of conscience .  before or after .         my people will keep a watch on him .  as for after .  .  .         see to it .         done .     the ghost paused .     you asked why i goad you so much .         a rhetorical question .  i actually enjoy it  in a way .         good .  but i don   t do it for your pleasure  ky .  we   ve known each other for a long time .  i   ve always found in you the desire to act on passion alone .  you never do  but you want to .  i worry sometimes that one day you   ll ditch your practicality and turn zealot .      the chairman raised an eyebrow .     how do you know i haven   t .         you pay attention to costs too closely .      the chairman laughed .  when he finished  he gazed at the wavering  masked form across from him .     as a matter of fact  i do believe positronic robots represent a real threat  beyond the fiscal .  when you study history          i know about the riots .         we all do  we   re endlessly told about them  by commentators and in our dramas .  riots don   t frighten me  though .         you   re not worried that a reintroduction of positronic robots would bring them back .         no .  i   m worried that this time they won   t .  and then it   s allover for us .      the two shimmery figures sat together in silence for a time  the space around them growing thick with contemplation .      well     the ghost said at last     i have details to chase down and kill .         so do i .  i think we   re as prepared as we   re going to be .         i agree .  till afterward then .         flesh  not steel .      the ghost chuckled .     if you insist .      the form faded out  leaving the chairman alone in his generated conference chamber .  after a time  he reached in his pocket again and squeezed the square .      recording complete .     he asked .      recording complete     answered a flat  genderless voice .     decoding routines in place  descrambler active .  bubble memory established under file    zealots  inc .      minutes retrieved  stored  coded to password release .      the chairman felt a wry aversion to that label  but it fit .  he did not feel like a zealot  not in the sense of an irrational fanatic single mindedly devoted to a cause .  rather  he felt supremely rational  a practical man in an impractical universe  presented with an opportunity to make a small adjustment and guarantee the sanity of a small part of history .   a zealot .  no .  ambitious  perhaps  and  he admitted  even a little vain .   but it was necessary .      very good .  end routine .      the room faded away  leaving nothing .      one    mia daventri listened to the stream of com chatter in her left ear and surveyed the crowd gathered at the archway .  on an average day  union station d .  c .  was thick with travelers and their entourages of well wishers and connections .  now it seemed to contain half the residents of the city .      wing three     a voice whispered to her .     parcel is arriving .  are you established .         copy  one     she said quietly  glancing around .  no one looked like anything other than a fascinated spectator .     gate is open .         very good     one replied .  it was unusual for the head of special service to operate as general dispatcher  but today was an unusual day .   union station always impressed mia .  the main gallery seemed to grow out of the earth itself  huge arching ribs reaching up and overhead to support the roof  the columns carved in delicate fractal patterns .  the floor shined like polished starglow .  the hall lay at the center of a network of tunnels to and from the shuttle port .  archways lined the walls  glowing signs set into the synthetic stone above each directing people to transportation  shops  restaurants  com booths  and the station hotels .  between those columns that did not flank an exit stood statuary  representative pieces from several periods extending back to preindustrial times .  sounds caught in the air  contoured  slightly magnified  and lingered high above .  union station was a showpiece for d .  c .   sprawling and elegant and  it seemed  ever incomplete .  mia had seen a view of it from outside .  it looked like a giant mushroom cap  a thick set of tunnels linking the landing field to the secrets beneath its penumbra .   beginning at the apron before the main entrance  two rows of station security robots formed a sort of honor guard that continued down the length of the concourse into the station   s great hall .  arms extended and linked  they kept the crowds back by a combination of presence and cordial cajoling .  union station was one of the few places on earth where positronic robots were in such public use  which  mia felt  was a shame .  she liked them  which set her apart from the vast majority of her fellow terrans  and could not see the evil they supposedly represented .  they were here because so many offworlders came through  spacers who not only were used to a clear robotic presence  but depended on it .  union station was a kind of international zone in which all jurisdictions had representation  containing embassy offices of the spacer missions  satellites to the main embassies east in anacostia district .   but beyond the diplomatic necessities  mia thought the use of robots was ideal for crowd control during events like this .  earther distaste  earther fear  for robots kept most people from getting too close to them .  mia could hear the insistent  genderless robotic requests to    please stay back    and    do not cross the line    even over the din .  if anyone actually got past that line  it was up to a human to usher them  gently or otherwise  back behind it .  for that  regular police and station security stood ready .   even so  these robots were not entirely independent units .  they were all slaved to union station   s resident intelligence .  the ri handled the complex coordination among the various units .  besides mia   s own special service team  the police  and station security  several of the representative bodies from industry and political interest groups had brought along their own small security teams .  in the unlikely event of a security breach or other emergency  the ri would deploy these units more efficiently than any human coordinator might manage .      moving up now     one said .   mia caught sight of her two team partners on the other side of the archway .  each of them  mattu and gel  gave her a nod and returned their attention to the avenue .   the moving strips immediately fronting the union station entrance had been shut down today .  the strips on the other side of the independent traffic lanes still moved  but they were empty .   the oversized limo rolled silently into sight  small flags fluttering at its corners  and pulled up against the curb .  mia strode to the doors and tapped a code into the lock .  a section of polished black metal slid back and mia stepped away .   a robot emerged first .  standing nearly two meters tall  it nevertheless appeared almost toy like .  smooth jointed  its arms hung to its sides  little more than tubes that ended in clumsy looking three fingered hands .  it seemed too thin for its height .  the rounded head possessed ill formed ear shells  a faint depression where a mouth ought to be  above that was a single slit that glowed white  its optical array .  its bronze skin dully reflected the station   s lights .      agent daventri     it said through her link     it is good to see you again .  is all secured .         hi  bogard .  yes  we   re fine .     she glanced at the gathered spectators and saw a number of round eyed stares .  despite the robot   s innocuous appearance  they were clearly afraid of it .     bogard  please link to ri network now .         one moment     bogard replied .     linking .  link complete .  security net  sensory net  and related peripherals realtime linked to union station resident intelligence .  telemetry optimal  agent daventri .         very good  bogard .  proceed .      bogard took two steps forward  then turned smartly .  senator clar eliton stepped from the limo .  he seemed taller than he actually was  his high forehead crowned by thick waves of greying black hair .  the beginnings of a double chin and the dense webbing of creases around his eyes betrayed his age and the wear of office  but the rest of him appeared fit and energetic .  boos and angry shouts peppered the air as his personal staff emerged behind him .  eliton  seemingly oblivious to them  smiled and waved as though on a campaign stump  and started down the entry tunnel .   bogard fell into step behind and to the senator   s right .  mia and her teammates ranged out ahead  she to the left  gel on the opposite side  and mattu on point .  she spotted other members of the on site security sprinkled along the way and through the crowd as they brought senator eliton into the main gallery .   the line of robots on either side saluted .  mia felt herself grin .   who   s idea was that .  she glanced back at bogard  but it seemed unaffected .      we   re ahead of schedule     mattu said through the link .     the auroran legation is still enroute from kopernik .  three minutes .         do we let him talk .     gel asked  his voice tinged with sarcasm .      one says no     mattu replied  his own voice revealing none of his feelings .  mattu  team leader  was the oldest of them  the most experienced  and he had repeatedly cautioned them against letting their sentiments show .     you have a job to do     he often said     despite the politics .      they slowed down .  the senator picked up on the signal and made more smiles and handwaves .  the catcalls diminished as the party neared the other end of the tunnel  the crowd had been screened so that more supporters than detractors filled the gallery .  even so  mia was grateful eliton   s vice senator  taprin  had had other commitments today .  the antipathy toward eliton was bad enough .  having both of them present would only have increased the negative reactions .      flesh  not steel .     someone yelled  voice amplified .  station security waded into the crowd  looking for the speaker .   mia   s nerves danced upon hearing the popular motto of the current radical reform movement .  she had heard rumors that eliton had attempted to invite representatives from the order for the supremacy of man again  trying to be as inclusive as possible  but the managins had refused .  .  .  to the relief of eliton   s handlers .  that did not mean  though  that they would not show up .   more dignitaries arrived  forming a brief parade of politics and commerce .  several others waited on the platform that dominated the floor by the arrival gate .   within the gallery  ropes held the crowd in check .  fewer robots stood at wider intervals  since human security did most of the work here .  mia caught brief squirts of comspeak from the officers  all of it reassuring  everything positive .  even with the advance screening  mia had expected more hecklers and protestors .  a group of police passed her  on its way somewhere  faces intent .  out of the possibility for so much chaos  it amazed her how much order prevailed .   the entourage reached the base of the raised platform .  mattu mounted the broad steps  eyes roving intently .  he stood for a few seconds at the top  frowned briefly  then gave the all clear  and senator eliton came up .      looks like a walk in the park     gel said .     stay sharp     mattu cautioned .   the assembly on the platform was a cross section of earthly power .  mia recognized a few lobbyists from various coalitions  but mostly she saw industrialists .  alda mikels of imbitek stood in the midst of his own cadre of functionaries and security  which looked lighter than mia expected .  nearby  rega looms  ceo of dynan manual industries  and his handful of aides milled among themselves  appearing uncomfortable and out of place .  mia was surprised to see a face she recognized hovering on their periphery .  she had not seen coren lanra for over a year  since he had resigned from the service .  she caught his eye and he smiled and nodded .      wouldn   t you know     gel commented through the link     lanra would be babysitting luddite  inc .      mia ignored the remark .  as with most of gel   s observations it held more acid than substance .   it was curious  though .  coren had quit over protest at bringing robots like bogard into special service  though bogard was the first and so far the only one .  she had heard that lanra had opened his own agency  a small office somewhere in the southeast corridor  but if he was doing security for dynan she wondered if perhaps he had given that up for a corporate sinecure .  though he had made his feelings about robots clear  mia had not thought him sympathetic to looms and his radical notions of a return to some sort of premechanized idyllic past .  but a job is a job  she supposed  and turned her attention back to her own .   she recognized ambassador gale chassik of the solarian embassy in the midst of his entourage of six .  ambassador sen setaris of the auroran embassy was absent  but her chief aides  lys morglen and daril falnyk  as well as her other senior aides  were present .  mia thought that odd  but who could tell about spacer protocol .   among the rest of the assembled dignitaries were several representatives from much smaller firms  able to get only one  at most two  people on the reception stand .  functionaries from a number of government offices weaved among them .  mia glanced out at the field of faces below .  she could never find the feeling of trust gel managed when he decided security was perfect .  instead  she always looked for what had been missed  thankful when she did not find it .  she paused at the sight of another group of security guards moving off through the crowd .  a couple of newscams moved closer then  hovering above  angling for the best views .      wing three here     mia said into her com .     how close do we let the subetherics get .         they have full clearance  three     one said .     just don   t let them clobber the parcel .         copy  one .      eliton moved among the guests  shaking hands and engaging in the expressive banter mia could never quite accommodate .  she had listened once  closely  as he worked a roomful of supporters  smiling with a sincerity he seemed able to turn on at will  and mouthing a stream of engaging nonsense that pleased those around him enormously .  he made a point of knowing everyone   s name and at least one personal fact about them  and he possessed a superb memory .  mia put it down to the requirements of office and stopped trying to analyze it .   eliton hesitated at one person  only a second  but mia caught it .  then the smile  partially dimmed  brightened to full and his hand shot out as usual .  mia wondered who the woman was .  she looked familiar  something to do with settlers .      bogard  identify person now shaking hands with senator eliton     she subvocalized through the link .      viansa risher  settlers    coalition .         ah .  thank you  bogard .     she had been a last minute inclusion  mia remembered  though the settlers had petitioned for representation here for months .      one minute     mattu announced  then moved alongside eliton to inform him .   mia did a last sweep of the gallery  more security movements caught her attention  then closed with gel and mattu to stay near eliton .      did anybody copy what the ri is doing with crowd control .     she asked .     i didn   t hear anything .      mattu frowned again  looking past her .     i don   t      he listened to his link  then turned toward the debarkation tunnel .     they   re here .      in the air  like a ghostly chimera  the announcement of the kopernik shuttle   s arrival carrying the auroran legation appeared over the concourse entrance .  everyone   s attention turned to the concourse  even the din of babble from the gallery lessened expectantly .  the media news cams buzzed above the crowd  concentrating on the arriving spacers as they emerged onto the platform .   their clothes seemed brighter  their complexions fairer  eyes clearer  they averaged slightly taller than earthers .  galiel humadros  ambassador extraordinary  led the procession of auroran representatives onto the platform .  her hair glimmered  golden and thick  and her face exhibited the kind of placid confidence mia associated with wisdom and experience .  a step or two behind her walked her aides  and behind them came the bulk of the legation  the counterparts of the terrans they now met under the full gaze of the planet .   mia felt there was something strange about the way they looked  as though something was missing .  then she realized that they were without their robots .  every image  every real life encounter  every report she had ever seen about spacers showed their ubiquitous robots .  now  apparently  as a gesture of good will  they were without them .  it made the spacers seem naked  vulnerable .  mia   s respect for them increased  even though she knew it was little more than the politics of image  public relations  a token to help ease the tensions their coming raised .   eliton stepped forward to bow in greeting and extend his hands to the ambassador  matching the auroran poise .  mia felt a brief surge of pride .      welcome to earth  ambassador humadros     eliton said  his voice amplified now to echo across the gallery .     it is an honor and a privilege to have you walk upon our soil       mia blinked  catching a movement from the corner of her vision .  she turned and saw bogard   s head suddenly pivot a moment before she heard through her link     something is wrong .  the ri       in the next instant  as she reached for her sidearm  the first explosions thundered across the chamber .      two    mia dropped to a crouch under the sound of the blasts .  bright bursts of light and thick roiling smoke erupted all around the perimeter of the gallery .  the constant noise of the crowd turned to a cacophony of screams and panicked shouts .  mia could not hear her link over the onslaught of noise .  she searched the front ranks of spectators as they alternately dropped to the floor or tried to rush for the exits .  the station robots stood motionless as if suddenly switched off .   security  everyone   s  ordered the assembled dignitaries to get to the floor .  as mia turned  she could not immediately locate eliton .  he had been clasping hands with ambassador humadros  who now stood right there  looking around  confused .   mattu rushed toward her  waving his arms like great wings .     down .  down .  down .      mia flinched at the sharp percussive sounds of projectile weapons fire .  as she began to wheel around once more she saw several people on the platform jerk and dance in a macabre ballet  their clothes erupting in splotches of red .  she continued turning  dropping to one knee  blaster coming to bear .  she saw people in black standing in the thick of the crowd  aiming weapons at the platform  the barrels jerking spasmodically .  she heard the highpitched whine of projectiles cutting the air around her  to left and right .   mia aimed automatically  picking one target after another  partly hypnotized by her own efficiency as they fell .   but there were so many .  .  .   and some did not fall  even though she knew she had hit them .  .  .      we have total penetration .     she heard mattu yell through the link .     total   .      silence .  more explosions .  the mob was in full terrified retreat  jamming itself against the exits  bottling itself in its mindless haste .  the immobile station robots fell  trampled by the stampede .   all comlinks had been routed through the ri  but it seemed now that the ri had shut down .      bogard  switch to team link     she shouted  hoping the robot could hear her over the noise .     do you have parcel .      bogard did not answer immediately  and a swift brush of fear trailed down mia   s spine .      bogard  respond .         agent daventri .  i require assistance .     bogard   s voice came through clearly  deceptively calm  on the team channel .   mia risked a glance over her shoulder .  bogard stared back at her  shorter now  its torso flared out into an encircling shield  and she knew eliton was in the center of that small but impenetrable enclosure of amalloy .      ambassador humadros     bogard said .     senator eliton is demanding i protect her .      mia scanned the crowd around them and found the ambassador  huddling about five meters to bogard   s right  her hands hovering uselessly about her head .  she looked completely abandoned by reason  eyes wide and staring  unseeing .  mia started toward her .   a body collided with her and she staggered back  bringing her free hand up defensively to fend off an attack .  but it was no assault  only one of the unfortunate dead  caught by gunfire  his falling  lifeless body torn up and bleeding .   in that moment  she saw bogard retract its shield from around eliton .  the senator staggered away from it  redfaced and shouting  pointing at ambassador humadros .   that should have been impossible  she knew .  eliton was bogard   s primary concern  and only a specifically coded command could change that .  nevertheless  bogard moved away from eliton  toward the spacers .  it moved slowly  uncertainly  as if resisting the instruction .   but now  eliton was exposed .  mia moved toward him  turning around to face the assault .  her heel suddenly caught on something and she raised her leg to step over it  then glanced down at the obstruction  the body of one of the aurorans .  it surprised her  the woman looked like she was sleeping  eyes closed easily  lips slightly parted .  mia shuddered and forced her attention back on the edge of the platform .   black masked gunmen leaned against it now  spraying the assembly .  mia began taking them out  one by one  down the line  walking backward as she did  waiting for the inevitable projectile that would stop her .   when it did  she stumbled  falling over  and found herself staring up at the ceiling arching high above .   i   m hit  she thought .  i   m dying .  .  .   then she rolled over .  she pressed a hand against the soreness spreading across her left side .  her ribs ached  but her hand came away from the bruised    area dry .  she blinked and looked around and found that another body had struck her  its head still in her lap  eyes staring emptily upward .  she shoved it away and scooted back .   far more people than seemed possible still stood  huddling against each other .  as she watched  a few more fell  bodies twitching under the deafening gunfire .  mia had never seen anything like this .  training simulations covered lone target situations  energy weapons  area wide toxins    why hasn   t the tranq gas been released .  she wondered .   the points along the rib supports for the walls and ceiling that housed the nonlethal gas dispensers appeared unopened .  the gallery security system had failed  union station   s positronic resident intelligence apparently was not functioning .      one .     mia yelled .     wing three here .  we have systems failure  we have      .   her earpiece remained dully silent .  all com was down .  then she remembered that it also had been routed through the ri for convenience  so the positronic brain could manage all the coordination without the complications of competing com systems .  the only com she had was the direct link to bogard and it  too  had been linked to the ri .   mia recovered her blaster and got to her feet .  she looked for eliton .   she found him lying in a heap  blood spattered across his chest .  bogard stood over him  immobile .  nearby  she saw ambassador humadros  also dead .   she tried the com anyway  scanning the massacre for her teammates .     wing two  wing one  this is wing three .  parcel is down .  repeat  parcel is down .      all she heard was the faint hiss of a disconnected link .      wing one  wing two     she called .  nothing .     bogard  respond .      there was a click .  then     i  i  i       the staccato skipping in the link added to the fear rising in her .      bogard  reestablish     she commanded .     local parameter  mia respond .  confirm .         con  confirm  mia  i          bogard  new priority  on me .  omega five catalogue reset .  respond .         priority reestablish  mi mia .         discontinue uplink to union station resident intelligence .         uplinking  up  uplink incomplete .  protocol rejected .  discontinued .      abruptly  the assassins began to retreat .  mia watched  dismayed  as they backed from the edge of the platform .  it seemed to her that some of them vanished even as she stared directly at them .  they fired their weapons over their heads  driving people away from them  opening paths .  she saw one of them grab a man by the arm and toss him against several others  using him as a ram to force his way through .  the mound of people crushed together near her still comprised many survivors  the dead sprawled around the perimeter of the huddle as though discarded from its midst .      what the   .     she muttered .     bogard  with me .  track assailants .  locate likeliest apprehension .      she felt bogard alongside her before she saw it move .  it towered over her and she could feel its attention directed at the retreating forms .      three confirmed .     a bright red tracer beam reached out over the heads of the still rippling crowd to identify three figures in black .      with me     she repeated and jumped to the floor .  her ribcage throbbed .   she struck the edge of the mob and began shoving .  it was like trying to do sculpture in water .  panicked faces stared at her  brief glimpses of the hidden parts of strangers that she might never have seen  might never see again  stripped of their calm civility and complacent sophistication .  she thought she understood .  their systems had failed them  the world that coddled and protected them now showed them how much they depended on what they could not do for themselves .  they were vulnerable  probably for the first time in any of their lives  and there were no rules to follow  no plan  no direction .  hands reached for her  eyes begged her  she seemed the only one acting in all this chaos  able to choose  to decide  but mia batted and brushed them all aside and forced her way through .   in truth  these people had nowhere to go .  they were packed together .  as she neared the far wall she saw why .  the doors were sealed .  the preparatory phase for pacification had occurred and all the exits had been closed  waiting for phase two  the release of the gas .   suddenly  people simply backed away from her  jamming themselves against each other in renewed hysteria .  she glanced back and saw bogard  right at her heels  its shoulders stretching wide  presenting a visible though false menace .      still have them  bogard .         locked on .         great .      finally  mia broke free of the press .  before her rose an expanse of wall mottled by the rich veining of blue marble .  off to the right  another wall stood away from the main wall  making a passage which gave access to the service warrens .   the door was open .      through here  bogard .         correct .      mia hesitated at the service door and peered around .  bogard touched her shoulder gently and drew her back  then moved through the access .      clear .      she rounded the edge  weapon ready .   to her immediate right were office cubicles  to the left  storage lockers .  directly ahead  a conveyor ran from a large turntable deeper into a sporadically lit maze down a short corridor .  a confusing jumble of conduit  cable  and assemblages filled the space  hanging from the ceiling or rising from the floor  creating mosaics of light and shadow .   the sound of many feet marching in quicktime echoed around the labyrinth .  mia pressed against the short wall of the first cubicle and waited .   a column of maintenance robots filed by  in almost comic imitation of a military drill .  they pivoted precisely at the turntable and continued on into the depths .      bogard  do you still have a track on our targets .         faint ir trace on the floor .  clear but fading .         lead on .      the robot seemed to flow across the floor  its torso leaning forward into a streamline profile  feet appearing to glide as if on rollers .  soundless .  in the mottling illumination  it seemed to alter its shape  and as she fell in behind it  she saw that its angle and configuration could cover her own silhouette .   it turned left down a narrower passage  along a line of ready niches for robots .  many were vacant  but several still contained robots  stiffly cradled like corpses  giving no outward sign of activity .   bogard stopped .  mia squeezed alongside it  crouching low .   tables and cargo cubes had been shoved together to open up a fairly large area of floor .  within the loose ring formed  several robots moved in and out of patterns that resembled fighting in progress .  they swung their limbs  kicked  ducked  jabbed  rushed and retreated  but none of them ever connected with a blow .  like a dance set to no rhythm  highly choreographed  they weaved through the mock combat with machine precision .      bogard  what   s happening .         i still cannot access the resident intelligence .  i have no explanation .      bogard started again  skirting the edge of the scene .  abruptly  two robots broke away from the fight and blocked its way .      halt     one demanded .     stand and declare       in a single  fluid motion  bogard brushed one robot into its companion and hurled them back into the dance .  mia saw several others move deftly to avoid them as they clattered across the floor .   at the next junction  bogard hesitated again .      they have divided     it said .     one went that direction    it indicated a twisting path through a canyon of machine housings to the left      two went this way .     the right hand trail led down a short flight of stairs to another service corridor .     just a moment .  i have com traffic which i presume is between our targets .         let me hear .      the receiver in her ear snapped sharply to life .        lost in the service section .  we don   t have an egress .         your orders were to stay off com until outside the facility .         fine  but we can   t get outside the damn facility if we can   t find a way out .         stand by .      a few seconds later  a new voice came on .      this is platoon one .  what   s the problem .         platoon one  this is lemus .  we got separated from the main body  we   re in the service section  no egress .  we lost wollins  and the tinheads are dancing like crazies back here        you stay off com from this point     platoon one ordered .     you find a corridor marked    exd    and follow it without deviation .  do you copy .         sure  bok          and stop using names on the com .  no further communications will be accepted until we link up .  platoon one out .      the receiver went dead .   bok .  lemus .   mia indicated the service corridor .     bogard  find them .  apprehend and subdue .  can you locate that corridor .         yes .     it took only a moment for bogard to weigh the command against its first law imperative .     you will go after the remaining target .         i will .  i will exercise extreme caution .  we want them alive  bogard .         you risk injury .         personal prerogative  acceptable level of risk .  they are dangerous .        personal prerogative  acceptable level of risk  they are dangerous  assignation of priority levels to establish response protocols as follows

second law requirements shift locus then to hypothetical threats posed by failure to accept revised protocols  necessitate risk accommodation  temporary and contingent upon verification of status  daventri mia    mia waited less than a second for bogard to prioritize the instruction .      i understand     it said .     you will indicate changed risk status .         yes .      it flowed down the stairs  into the service corridor  and disappeared .   mia sighed  relieved .  bogard processed situations according to a complex set of risk protocols that allowed it to function more creatively than its more rigidly structured cousins  but she still expected it to be a three law purist when it had to allow a human to take a personal risk .  this time it had to be assured that if she got into trouble she would call for help .   pulse beating insistently in her ears  she entered the claustrophobic pathway .  if these three had split up  then everything was not going as smoothly as they had probably planned .   the passage seemed to be a space between large ventilator funnels and bundles of communication threads  part of the ubiquitous resident intelligence system which supposedly oversaw all aspects of facility operation  and the bulkier conveyor system that transported all nonliving material throughout the complex .   she passed a skinny opening that led into the wider main passage  then came to a cluster of machine forms  spheres  boxes  conduit  braces  impossible to slip through .  she backed up to the opening and eased through .   across from her  the kitchen that served the entire complex ran the width of the space  from the wall of the main gallery to the outer shell .  bright  mirrored surfaces reflected color coding and the geometries of cookery  a fully automated food processing plant with only a few robots to supervise and troubleshoot the occasional problem .  at the moment  nothing within the kitchen area moved .  mia spotted a robot  frozen in place before a flickering monitor .   in there .  .  .   she sprinted across the floor and dropped to one knee by the low wall that marked the kitchen   s boundary .  if the resident intelligence were functioning  she could have used it to track her target .  but the com in her ear remained silent  a thick empty nonsound .   mia glanced over the top of the wall  then scurried to the nearest access and around the edge .  the air smelled of yeast and oil and warm flour .  she crept along to the robot she had seen and looked up at the monitor it stared into .   manifests scrolled over it  one after another  too fast for her to read  but she caught references to food stuffs  medical supplies  and clothing  in enormous quantities .  as she watched  the monitor went blank .  then the bright green words please wait appeared and a few seconds later  a request form for several lunch items filled the screen .  the robot seemed to waver  then stepped back .        report now .  we have people down .     broke in her ear .  mia winced  startled .      this is a restricted area     the robot said  turning to face her .     humans are not       a burst of gunfire ricochetted around them  staggering the robot .  mia spun away  but her right arm suddenly snapped back  taking her with it  knocking her to the floor .  two more impacts caught her in the right leg and ribs  the wind left her lungs painfully .   is this when i should call for help .  .  .  .  she dragged herself across the floor with her uninjured arm till she came to a space beneath a food preparation table  and pulled herself under the metal expanse .   she touched her earpiece and reduced the volume of her link .  she heard feet running toward her .      sir  this is a restricted area      another drone began to say .   mia craned her head and saw the base of a small transport drone .  then booted  human feet .  the drone shifted to block the human and repeated its message .   mia still held her pistol  limply  and managed to shift it to her left hand .  she pushed herself close to the edge of the crawlspace  next to one of the support legs .  she set the pistol down and took hold of the metal shaft .      back away .     the human ordered the drone .   the human bolted around the robot and started forward .  mia braced  then swung her legs out from beneath her cover .  she caught him across the shins and he tumbled  arms spread wide  and slapped the floor .   she snatched her pistol and wriggled out  coming up on her knees  weapon leveled .  her right leg burned hideously  the muscle trembling .  black pinpoints seemed to pulse at the periphery of her vision .   the man also recovered  turning toward her with a short  black weapon cradled in both hands .      stop .     she shouted .   he brought his weapon up .   mia fired .  the bolt of energy smacked against his head  kicking him backward .  his weapon rattled across the floor .   mia slumped against the cabinet  her right arm a length of agony  each breath like the pinch of giant fingers .  she felt clammy  and the bright black and silver pinpoints danced more frantically  growing in number .      ma   am  do you require assistance .      the transport drone had rolled alongside her .  she blinked at it  wondering at the slight panic she heard in its voice  and wondered why a drone would panic .  then she remembered that it was being run by the ri  which was positronic .  but the ri was not responding  had gone off line for some reason .  was it back now  along with everything else that no longer made sense .      ma   am  do you require assistance .     the drone repeated .      yes  i      she dropped her pistol and touched fingertips to her arm  they came away damp .  she swallowed hard and looked at the bright red liquid on them .  a chill scraped down her neck  across her back .  when did that happen .  she tried to catalogue her injuries  struggling for consciousness  but she kept forgetting where she started .  leg  ribs  arm  ribs  arm  leg .  .  .   the renewed com chattered in her ear insistently .        ambulances right now .  we   ve got at least twenty down .  get us priority       she touched the button  changing the channel .      bogard .         yes  mia .         status .         both targets apprehended and subdued .  returning to your position .         good   hurry   i   m        she had never passed out before  and it came as a surprise and a frustration and a peculiar anger that she was losing control so fast .   the transport robot asked again     ma   am  do you require assistance .  ma   am .  .  .  .         three    derec heard the wailing of the injured even before he entered the tunnel to the main gallery .  mingled with the clinical noises of paramedics and ambulances  the controlled urgency of shouted orders and sirens  the sound cut through him  sharper than any cold wind  and he shuddered .  as he emerged beneath the high arched ceiling  his two aides close at his heels  he saw bedlam and pain .      sir     a harried security guard challenged him     this area is restricted .  i       derec held up his id and the man stopped  blinking at it as if momentarily unable to recognize it .      oh .  phylaxis group .     he nodded  suddenly relieved .     you   re expected .  let me .  .  .     he stepped back and spoke quietly into his comlink .   derec did a slow survey of the scene .  so many robots trampled and broken  frozen in place  or wandering about purposelessly  in advanced stages of positronic collapse  and human paramedics and security people shouting at them or pushing them out of the way .  derec felt a chill at the sight  these robots all should have been linked through the ri and if they were breaking down  then the ri must be having trouble .  the only other robotic presence were the service drones  nonsentient automatons that did the grunt work for the emergency personnel .  they did not even call them robots here .  he wondered briefly if bogard was still here  if it had survived  if it had functioned  if .  .  .   he turned to his team .      get to the mid stage breakdowns first     he told the people with him .  only two specialists from the group had accompanied him  caro and amson  his best field team .  from the look of things  he wished he could have brought a dozen .  but the phylaxis group   s limited resources allowed only a small team  other specialists were too far away  in the spacer districts at the periphery of d .  c .   working other situations .     get them out of the arena .  find out where the stand by niches are  i doubt any of these people will be using that room .  then tend to interaction and facilitation crises .      his people gave him quick nods and dispersed into the chaos .      hey  hold it     another voice intruded .  a uniformed policeman strode up  one hand raised  the other touching the butt of his holstered stunner .  he glared briefly at the first security guard  who was still on his comlink .     who and what are you and what are you doing here .      derec extended his ill again .  the officer studied it briefly .     phylaxis group .  great  we already have more medics than we need walking allover the evidence  now we get you people collecting tinheads .      derec pocketed his ill .     sorry if rendering assistance is such a burden for your forensics people .  maybe you   d even prefer leaving the dead and injured just where they fell till you finished .  i   m sure only a few of them would expire before the evidence techs got all they wanted .  .  .      the policeman   s mouth tightened and he stepped toward derec .  whatever he had intended to say  he changed his mind .     all right  point taken .  you have clearance .     he turned sharply and strode away .      thank you     derec called after the retreating officer  who gave a negligent wave .      sir     the security guard said then .     mil jeffries is the floor supervisor .  i   ll have you taken to her .     a drone approached  a nonpositronic escort unit  little more than a tall  spindle like machine with a map programmed into it .     just follow this one .         thanks .      derec followed the drone along a narrow path between bodies that had not yet been picked up and small knots of people he assumed to be security  rigid  anger frozen faces  quick conversations with each other or into coms  attitudes of arrested momentum  and  if derec was not mistaken  embarrassment  and tried to get his mind around what he saw .  it was clear that the bodies here had been trampled .   the largest knot of standing people occupied the raised platform toward which the drone led him .  everywhere the wounded and traumatized moaned and cried  a few shouting anxiously for help or an explanation or for the simple emotional need to scream at something .  whole sections of the huge floor contained the injured  stretched out  and tended to by humans and a few medical support robots  again  nonpositronic units that lifted and carried and contained portable diagnostic units for the human techs .  most of these did not even look like robots in the spacer sense  but rather were collections of boxes and spheres and chunky assemblies mounted on treads or antigravity motivators  following the humans around like obedient pets .  derec saw frightened people shoving at them  crying or cursing  unwilling in typical earther fashion to be touched by metal fingers .  it was probably just as well no positronic robots were here to try to help  only the specially programmed could cope with injured or dead humans  but here they would be faced with the added confusion of humans rejecting their help .  first law dictated that they aid the injured .  second law said to obey humans .  the conflict of being ordered not to render aid would hit them hard  they would not understand the nature of the fear and resentment .  positronic breakdowns were sad  pathetic things to see .  the robots still functioning here clearly could not cope .  the lucky ones seemed already shut down .  derec   s team moved quickly among the traumatized robots  getting them out of the way with the least damage possible .  some might be salvaged but he was not optimistic .   several robots stood around the collections of the dead  mechanical bodies stiff  eyes dark  minds broken .   what about bogard .  he wondered .  he could not find that particular robot here .  perhaps it had already been removed from the gallery .  it was not really his anymore  it had been signed over to special service for active duty  but bogard remained derec   s creation and he could not help but worry about it .   derec looked away .  the outer walls of the gallery bore tall  blackened streaks from the explosions .  on the subetheric broadcast  the blasts had seemed great enough to gouge holes  but all that showed were the stains .   derec   s right foot slid sharply and he pinwheeled his arms to keep balance .  he looked down .  on the floor was a bright red smear leading from a puddle of blood .  his stomach lurched sickeningly .   the drone led him up onto the platform and toward a small woman who stood in the midst of a cluster of people  talking rapidly and stabbing the air with her index and middle fingers .      supervisor mil jeffries  sir     the drone said  loudly enough to attract her attention .  the woman glanced his way  frowning  then nodded and held up her hand to indicate that he wait .   task completed  the unit moved away .  derec waited at the edge of the cluster and listened while jeffries issued instructions .  one by one and in pairs the people left to carry out their assigned tasks until only derec remained .  she looked at him  one eyebrow cocked dubiously .      and .         i   m derec avery  from the phylaxis group .         those your people out there herding the braindeads away .         yes .         good .  about time .  i only have two people on staff who know anything about traumatized tinheads  and right now they   re busy with the ri .  .  .  which is where i need you  if that   s what you   re wondering .         the resident intelligence .  .  .  .         resident idiot  you mean .     she snorted derisively  then gestured for him to follow .     come on .  avery .  you   re supposed to be the expert on positronics .         one of          fine .  come with me .      jeffries  despite being a good head shorter  walked away fast enough to make derec struggle to keep up .  he glanced over at the huddle around the diplomats and representatives .  ambulances stood open  receiving bodybags and injured .  blood slicked a large area .  a dozen or so people were gathered off to one side  the quality of their clothes announcing their importance .  a few seemed nervous and several were deathly pale  but none looked hurt .   derec and jeffries came to the far end of the platform  descended the steps shoved against it  and the supervisor led the way through an innocuous door labeled private .  a few meters within they mounted a narrow stair leading up .      i was worried that you might bring some more robots     jeffries said .     we   re having trouble enough with the mere presence of them right now .         we don   t have any     derec replied .  she gave him a look .     besides the spacer districts  the embassies  and here  they are illegal on earth .      jeffries nodded .     hm .  do you have any idea what happened here .         i saw the replay on subetheric on the way over .         probably edited .         how many  i mean  who .         estimates are that eighteen people died in the shooting  but we have at least thirty wounded  maybe a hundred dead or injured in the panic  trampled  kicked  that sort of thing     jeffries explained .     all those you saw down there  that   s what happened to them  except for a half dozen or so that got hit by stray blaster fire from the security teams on the platform .  the auroran ambassador is dead  along with half her staff  plus the aurorans from the embassy here .     she stopped at the top of the steps and looked at him .     senator eliton  too .      derec opened his mouth to say something .  but then he saw a brief glimmer of pain in jeffries    eyes  a glimpse of what lay beyond the brusque jobber she had shown him till then  and closed his mouth .  he made himself nod .  jeffries    walls came up again  and she continued up the stairs to an unmarked door .   on the other side was a broad office pressed against a strip of window that overlooked the gallery .  desks  consoles  and people formed a loose maze between the window and a wall of monitors that stretched the length of the room .      from here     jeffries said     we watch the ri run union station .  normally  anyway .  today we watched it go out to play while people died .      everyone in the room stopped to look at jeffries  then at derec .  he felt the bitterness in her voice  saw it reflected in all the staff faces .  no robots were present  only people trying to cope .      would you explain that to me .         kedder     jeffries said .   two people sat before the sprawling main interface console in the center of the room .  one of them  a tall  slim man with short reddish hair  stood and cleared his throat .      i  uh          kedder  this is the man from phylaxis     jeffries went on .     he   s here to show us how to talk to our robots .      derec went to the console and extended his hand .     derec avery .         tathis kedder .         i have floor work to do     jeffries announced .     you need me  find me .      with that  she pivoted on her toes and left the room .   derec waited several seconds .  people returned to what they had been doing .     all right  what happened .     he asked kedder quietly .      well .  .  .     kedder gazed down at the console as if trying to remember what to do with it .   the other man at the board started tapping keys deftly .  the row of screens at the top of the console cleared to milky white  then new images winked into place .   kedder cleared his throat and pointed .     these are the  uh  primary monitor views leading up to the arrival of senator eliton .         what the ri saw .     derec asked .      uh huh .      robots moved quickly among the prep people who established the boundaries for spectators and ushered the public into their assigned areas .  quickly  the space filled .  then the first wave of dignitaries arrived .  derec checked the elapsed time  the sequence moved at roughly twice normal speed .  the platform became crowded  security robots followed humans around  guaranteeing free access from the main entrance to the platform  accompanying more dignitaries in  herding the throngs of people .  eliton   s entourage came in  and derec   s throat tightened at the sight of bogard .  so it had been here .   but what went wrong .  he wondered .      now     kedder said     let   s slow it back down to normal speed .  watch the audience .      the swift efficiency of the free floating staff and security abruptly shifted to a more human pace .  derec looked from screen to screen  each displaying a different view across the gallery .  the crowds bobbed and shuffled as if adrift on water .  then something changed .  derec blinked and leaned closer .  it had looked as if a section of the recording had been cut out  one moment spliced to another across the gap left by the missing segment .  a subtle jump  heads jerking slightly  and then       see .     kedder asked .      i   m not   i saw something  but        look     the other operator said sharply .  the images backed up  across the gap  and then ran forward again .  he rose out of his chair and touched a screen .     watch this person .      as derec watched  the gap came  and the person vanished .      what the          it gets better     kedder said .     or worse  depending .  .  .  watch this screen .      kedder indicated the middle view which showed the arched tunnel .  after several seconds  a crowd of people emerged  marching  boots flashing  black uniforms bulging with armor and adorned by insignia derec did not recognize .   the other screens changed then .  they showed a combination of corridors and alphanumerics .  the main gallery was gone  replaced by what appeared to be a military complex .  uniformed figures hurried past  numbers shifted .      from this point     kedder said     we got nothing through the ri that related in any way to what we could see happening down on the floor .  while people  while the attack happened  this was all the ri showed .  we couldn   t get it to reset  we couldn   t get it to tell us what was happening .  it wasn   t responding to any command .  nothing .         and now .     derec asked .      now it seems to be in positronic collapse .         all the security          it ran the whole thing .  for several minutes before the attack  it was issuing directions for security teams to respond to small crises that we later learned never happened .  when the shooting started  most of the security was outside the gallery and all the exits were sealed .  we couldn   t get the manual overrides to work until it was allover .  no data came in  nothing went out  it was as if the entire station had been isolated from all other external systems .         which may be just as well     kedder   s coworker said .     if it was having a breakdown  it might have carried over to externals .  we might still be waiting for medical and police support .         but i saw the assault on subetheric .         whatever this problem is     kedder said     it didn   t affect the media nodes the newsnet people brought in that stayed unlinked to the ri .  they weren   t supposed to do that  everything was supposed to be channeled through the ri for security reasons  but a few always slip unregulated eyes in .  anyway  independent data fed out unimpeded .  only the ri was .  .  .  diverted .         and all the security com .  .  .  .         was being routed through the ri .      derec stared at the two technicians .     this is impossible .      kedder looked embarrassed  the other man shrugged .      what is this it was experiencing .     derec asked  waving at the screens .     looks like a simulation .         a game     the other man said .     old strategy stuff .  it has a number of them in its accessory buffers .  running all the facilities doesn   t take up enough of its capacity  so it plays games .  it has a terrific chess approach .     he pointed to the screen .     this one is called coup .         how did it overwhelm the positronic pathways .         beats me  gato .      kedder frowned at his partner  then said     oh  i   m sorry .  mr .  avery  this is joler hammis .      derec nodded briefly .      sorry for being rude     hammis said .     it   s been that kind of a day .         forget it .  so you   re running everything manually now .         partly     hammis said .     we   ve got a hard programmed back up helping .  it took time to bypass all the systems the ri has  had  direct control of .  a few things are run by imbedded hardware and none of that seemed affected at all .  there are still functions we can   t operate now  like traffic control .  all shuttle service has been suspended for the time being  but we have to get that back on line soon          all right  we can take care of that much     derec said .     are the external comlines for the ri open .         no  but it   s not a problem     kedder said uncertainly .     right now it   s in no condition to send or receive          doesn   t matter .  is there a place i can work .  and patch me into that com system .      while kedder and hammis set up a station for him  derec ran the images back and forth on the screens .  it made no sense .  it looked almost as though an invasive program had taken over the resident intelligence   s entire sensory network and fed it false input .  but the virtue of positronic ris made such an invasion impossible .  unlike standard  nonsentient computer systems  positronic brains were not solely dependent on simple digital data input to set priorities .  rather  positronic brains used pre established  unamendable priorities  the three laws  among others  to determine the value of sensory input .  they depended on reality as a basis for judgment  reality as perceived through direct sense experience  vetted by hardwired expectations .  data  like that which computer and datum systems used and which told them how to interpret reality  was used only as a secondary reference  without the ability to interfere with the sense priority nature of the positronic matrix .  in this way  the positronic brain was occasionally superior to the human brain  it could not hallucinate  could not delude itself by referencing its own store of experience in isolation from base reality or privileging its experience to supersede its predetermined priorities .  in short  a positronic brain could not be subverted .  if conflicting information bombarded it to the point where its sense priority makeup became compromised  collapse occurred .  it simply failed .   but this .  .  .      here  mr .  avery     kedder said .      derec  please .     he looked over the console they had cleared for him .     good .  what i   m going to do is link to the ri at phylaxis and start load sharing .  then i   m going to dump the memory buffers of the station ri into our systems so we can start analyzing what happened .      kedder frowned  glancing over his shoulder .     you can replace our ri with your own .         sort of .  it   s a temporary arrangement and not nearly as efficient  but it should get all your systems back up and running .         well  i suppose that   s all right .      derec hesitated .     why wouldn   t it be .         just that .  .  .  well  a lot of people blame the ri for what happened  a lot of people here .  i   m just not sure how they   d feel about going back to one          look .  as i understand it  you need one to operate efficiently .  you can   t run the station without one .         mainly flight control        fine .  then let me get this set up .  switching to a hard program system will be a lot easier with an ri in place facilitating the changes .  either way  this is necessary .         i see that  mr .    uh  derec .  i don   t have a problem with it but          let me worry about the backlash .  i   m used to it .      kedder nodded .      by the way     drec said     what did the robots on the floor do when the shooting started .         i don   t know .  wandered around  got knocked down by the mob .  nothing useful .  see  they   re all tied directly to the ri .  more efficient to coordinate the entire robotic staff through a central unit          so when the ri started losing touch          it affected the mobile units .         but their own programming should   ve kicked them out of the ri   s matrix  let them function independently .      kedder shook his head  a sour expression on his face .     no  they were all deadswitch linked to the ri .  management wanted to be able to shut down all of them from one location .  it was easier to simply slave them all to the ri rather than bypass the three laws with one single command .         slaved through .  .  .  that would   ve required patching their sensory modules through the ri sensory net .         exactly .      derec sighed heavily .     in the name of fear and efficiency .     he shook himself .     all right  one problem at a time .  have i got direct access to your board from here .         yes .  here and here .  .  .      derec let kedder guide him through the basic arrangement until he understood how the systems were integrated  then made a call to group .      rana  this is derec .  we need thales to sub for the ri here .  let me feed you the parameters .         excuse me     kedder said and walked away to another console .      union station .     rana asked .      yes .         what a mess .  who   s dead .         all the wrong people .  humadros and eliton especially .          oh  hell .         spoken with true precision     derec said sarcastically .     i want a memory dump set up  too  we need to download the ri for study .  something really nasty happened here and i don   t understand how it was doable .  we have a subverted ri .         it didn   t collapse .         not till it came back to reality and saw what had happened .         if eliton   s dead          i haven   t seen bogard yet .  i don   t know what happened .  one crisis at a time for now .         all right .  i   m setting up the patches now .  give me the transfer codes .      derec worked steadily  absorbed in the details of the construct for several minutes .  when he leaned back to stretch  he noticed people watching him  several wearing expressions of disapproval .  he looked away  out the windows to the floor below .   out in the gallery  maintenance units were cleaning up the blood  police techs were gathering evidence  and medical techs were collecting samples .  ambulances still crowded the platform  but most of the bodies had been taken away .   on the opposite side of the gallery  he saw a large robot emerge from one of the service accesses  carrying a woman in its arms  which had unfolded like a sling around her  it was followed by two transport drones laden with more bodies .  derec stood and went to the window .      bogard .  .  .     he whispered .      four    ariel burgess gazed at the tri d image projected above her desk  a vague dread displacing the concern she knew she should feel .  the robot hovering in the field lacked an arm and both legs  and its head had been crushed as if a huge foot had stomped down on it as it lay on the ground .  various symbols covered its scuffed  dark blue body  most of them indecipherable yet threatening .  the one ariel did recognize shone bright white in the center of the robot   s upper torso  a lemniscate crossed by an arrow at an upward angle  the sign of the managins .  the unit had been attacked by members of the order for the supremacy of man again .      i   m not familiar with this model     ariel said .      we just began importing them last month     the man across from her said .     porter model dp   .         a domestic .         exactly so .      ariel remembered the designation  but had not seen one till now .  she had been busy with the preparations for the humadros eliton conference and had skipped several inspections  so she was not surprised .  she studied what remained of the head .     do you have a catalogue image of this  mr .  udal .         um .  .  .  yes  i think so .  .  .     he fumbled in his jacket pocket for a moment  clearly dismayed at her request .  he fished out a disk and slipped it into her desk viewer .     this is the fourth act of vandalism in less than two weeks .  customers have stopped coming into the showroom  sales have dropped off precipitously  and now my staff is talking about leaving .  they need the jobs  but they   re afraid .         you   ve contacted the police .     ariel asked  knowing the answer already .  the catalogue image appeared in the air alongside the first view .  it showed a neat  smooth bodied robot with a pleasantly smiling approximation of a human face .  ariel felt a cold lump suddenly form behind her breastbone .      of course .  the first time  a couple of inspectors came by  took statements .  the second time  only one of them showed up .  same questions  same answers .  the third instance  a uniformed patrol came  and this time  no one did .     he shrugged elaborately .     earthers .  they don   t care .         this is a humaniform .      udal frowned more deeply .     well  of course .  domestics are always given a degree of          you are aware of the guidelines concerning humaniforms on earth .         it   s not like they   re actually robots .  just drones .  without positronics        the guidelines are clear about drones  too .          well          terrans react poorly to robots that look too human .  to any machine that appears to mimic human life .  they find it offensive .         but these have sold quite well .  our advance orders        it should not have been in your catalogue at all  mr .  udal .     ariel shook her head and sighed .     i   ve been a little lapse in my rounds  mr .  udal  but you should have registered this with my office .  i would have told you it would not have been allowed for import .  i   m surprised you got it past customs .     she looked at him .     how did you get it past customs .         they didn   t challenge     udal said quickly .     look  if my customers want something  who am i to argue with them .  terrans ought to know their own laws  they certainly ought to know their own prejudices .  these units were ordered by terrans .         a certain class of terran  yes  i   m sure .  but those people are also looked upon with suspicion by the average earther .  wealthy clientele will buy something like this as much to insult what they perceive as lower class citizens as to have the benefit of a state of the art machine .  there are clandestine shops where you can buy a new body for a standard drone and turn it into a humaniform .  i assure you the people vandalizing your merchandise are not of the same sort as those buying it .      udal winced  his eyes dancing briefly  avoiding contact with her .     earthers .     he repeated  making the word sound vile .     why don   t we have these sorts of problems elsewhere .      ariel bit back a response regarding the prejudices of spacers .  it would do no good here  dealing with this problem .  udal would go over her head  disregard her advice  and only complicate an already awkward situation .  she covered her reaction by studying the image of the drone .  it did not look very dronelike .  the brain casing was certainly large enough for a positronic brain .      this is a retrofit  isn   t it .     she asked suddenly .     an older model .  .      she tapped commands on her terminal and another projection opened alongside the catalogue image .  the system began looking for a match .  in a few seconds  the kaleidoscope of robot types stopped on one that could easily be the twin of the drone .     a dp p  .  i thought it looked familiar .  these are expressly forbidden here .         it   s not the same model  i assure you          any terran with a catalogue and no real understanding of what they   re seeing wouldn   t understand the difference .  were any other models damaged in this attack .      udal looked to one side .     no .         your warehouse is in the convention center district  isn   t it .  i think a visit from my staff is in order .     ariel narrowed her eyes .     mr .  udal  if i find out that you   re importing through the black market          you   re supposed to be our advocate here .     udal shot back .     i am a legitimate dealer with a legitimate grievance .  the local authorities don   t seem particularly interested and i have come to you as a fellow auroran .         i sympathize  mr .  udal  but what do want me to do .      udal relaxed and smiled  his teeth brilliant in their auroran perfection .  the change was startling .     i understand you will be sitting in on the upcoming trade talks senator clar eliton is chairing .  i   m told ambassador galiel humadros herself is coming .  if you could bring it to their attention that these fanatic assaults on property have the potential to derail any progress they might achieve  it would help a great deal .  frankly  any more of these vandalisms and i may have to pull up stakes and go home .  my insurance premiums are high enough as it is  but        i   m flattered that you think so highly of my position here  but i   m only the commerce liaison for the embassy .  my function is purely advisory          then by all means  advise .  besides  you underestimate your potential .  you   re also an attach   from the calvin institute  and the calvin institute is respected even by the earthers .  a word from you       ariel   s com beeped .     excuse me  mr .  udal .     she touched the contact .     yes .         ariel  you better check the subetheric     ariel   s aide  hofton  said .      in a few minutes          now .      annoyed  ariel gave udal an apologetic shrug and turned on her set .  across the room  an image formed a meter or so out from the wall projector .   the scene confused her for a moment .  then she recognized union station  except .  .  .  there were bodies on the floor  people huddled here and there  red stains on the platform where the reception for ambassador humadros was to take place .  .  .   udal sucked in his breath sharply .     is there sound .      ariel fumbled for the controls .        lice have informed us that so far none of the perpetrators have been apprehended     a reporter was saying .     the death toll so far is ten  including senator clar eliton and members of his staff .  repeated requests for explanations on how weapons got past the security systems have so far received no satisfactory answers .  i repeat  senator clar eliton and the auroran ambassador galiel humadros have been murdered  as well as several members of their respective staffs  in an assault by a number of armed assailants who have all managed to escape .  none of the security measures supposedly in place operated  either afterward or apparently before the assault .         they didn   t .  .  .  i .  .  .  have to make some calls .  .  .     udal plucked his recording from ariel   s desk player and headed for the door .     thank you for your time  ms .  burgess .  i   ll let you know           mr .  udal .      he stopped and looked at her  face open with shock .      warehouse those drones until we can clear this up .  i don   t want to see any more of these on the open market .      udal sighed  exasperated  but nodded .  he glanced at the subetheric again .   she watched him hurry out the door  his face locked in an expression that she thought must mirror her own .  she looked back at the subetheric broadcast  at the aftermath of the slaughter .      here again is a replay of the scene that took place not fifteen minutes ago in the main gallery of union station .      ariel turned the sound down and touched the com .     hofton  get me setaris at the embassy  soon as possible .      she watched the blackclad assailants charge from the midst of the spectators  firing wildly  people dropping terrified  wounded  and killed  unable to accept the actuality of it .  this had to be a drama  a hoax  a piece of fiction  not a news report .  history contained accounts of such acts  but they never happened anymore .      ariel     hofton   s voice intruded .     ambassador setaris .      ariel touched another button and the space above her desk projector filled with the head and shoulders of a woman with severe green eyes and silver white hair .      ariel .         you   ve seen .         yes  a few minutes ago .  things are a bit tense around here .     setaris hesitated  her face briefly yielding to sorrow .     lys is dead  i think  and daril .      her deputies  two thirds of the principle auroran ambassadorial representation on earth .  ariel tried to imagine how setaris felt .  she and lys had been lovers once .  .  .      who   .     ariel started to ask .      we haven   t a clue .  as usual  the tbi is being less than informative .  most of what we know has come from the same source as everyone else has  the media .  i   m glad you called  though .  there will be a panic from the business community .  i expect flight  abandonment .  if there is anything you can do to calm them down        calm them down .  you   re joking .         i   m perfectly serious .  we can   t have a wholesale exodus of the very people this effort was supposed to help .  if they leave  then the worst factions on earth will have won  no matter who is responsible for this atrocity .  we might never regain a toehold if we turn our backs on them now .         given your sympathies  would you really consider that such a loss .         i   m not prepared to go into that with you now  ariel     setaris warned .     yes  i would .  more than you might expect me to acknowledge .      ariel suppressed a sharp response and forced herself to think it through .     what should i tell them .         that you  for one  aren   t leaving and that the calvin institute intends to work as closely as possible with terran authorities to find out who is responsible .  for all we know  this is just the random act of a bunch of social frustrates .         earth has plenty of those .  but        whatever the truth may be  ariel  our present reality is that humadros   s mission cannot fail .  especially not now .  if we allow ourselves to be frightened away and give up on any future dealings with earth  we may very well condemn ourselves to a slow death  assuming we escape a war .      ariel felt herself flinch .     i always suspected you agreed with me  but i never thought i   d hear you say so .         we can debate the extent of our mutual perspective at another time .  for the moment  can i count on your support .         of course .         good .         is humadros dead .  is it confirmed .         yes .  and her staff .  and eliton .  i don   t know which bothers me more  humadros or eliton .  he was the best ally we had .     setaris frowned thoughtfully .     what about his vice senator  taprin .  you know him  don   t you .         yes  i know jonis .         how does he stand regarding eliton   s policies .         he   s never been the firebrand eliton is  was  but they were in the same file on the subject .         talk to him if you can  see what his response is going to be .  we need information as much if not more than action  ariel .         i   ll do what i can  ambassador .  call me if  well  call me .      setaris nodded  smiling hollowly .  the image winked out .   ariel glanced back at the subetheric    cast  then turned it off .  they would be replaying that for the next several days at least  she could get a copy of the complete report at any time .   this is impossible  she thought .  union station was operated by a positronic resident intelligence  the first permitted to operate openly on earth in decades .  it was a showpiece  in fact  set up and licensed as a demonstration of the potential benefits of positronics for earth .  the first law imperative would have made it impossible for the ri to allow anyone in with a weapon that did not have prior clearance .  it would not allow the ri to permit this sort of terrorist act to be carried out   the ri should have used the mobile robots as a means to disarm  block  or otherwise interrupt the attempt .   everything ariel knew about positronics and robotics  which was not inconsiderable  told her that what had just happened could never have occurred .  unless the ri had been modified in some way to subvert those safeguards .  .  .      damn you  derec     she muttered aloud .     you finally did it .      no spacer would attempt to tamper with the three laws  none that she knew .  but derec avery was another matter .  she had not seen him since their last argument  a bitter  irrational exchange during which both had said hurtful  unretractable things  which had ended years of friendship and occasional passion .  derec had wanted to stretch the three laws  see how far they could be pushed  play with the strict  almost sacred parameters of robotic construction  and she had walked away  unable to accept even the most reasonable of his points .  it hurt even more to think that she had been right and he had not listened .   she stabbed her com .     hofton .  we have a lot of work to do .  see if you can trace vice senator taprin and connect us .  i need to talk to him asap .  then get me the list of on planet auroran businesses  then clear the com .         right away .  anything else .         yes .  send a message to derec a very at the phylaxis group .  six words .     i see you got your wish .             sign it .         no .  i think he   ll know where it came from .         five    the floor of the main gallery had been cleared of people and blood by the time derec finished with the ri .  he looked out the window  a cup of coffee in hand  at the cavernous expanse  all gleaming faux marble and granite  the essence of a past era when travel was as much ritual as necessity .  he had stood in more spectacular port facilities  architectures more elegant and impressive than union station p .  c .   but none that manifested history and significance to the same degree .  the place seemed mythic  and its lines resonated with heritage .   a few security people followed forensic units that sniffed and searched for minute bits of potential evidence  but derec doubted anything further could be found to aid them .  this was the final dotted i and crossed t of the physical investigation .   bogard and the woman it had been carrying were long gone .  derec   s work here had allowed no time for him to check on the robot before now .  making the operational transfer from the corrupted ri to the phylaxis ri had taken hours of close attention .  bogard became an afterthought .   now  with bogard in mind and his work completed  with only minor details to vett  derec had accessed a casualty list a short while ago .  he had been relieved to see ariel burgess   s name absent .  she had not been here with the others from the embassy .  given what he had seen on the    casts  he was amazed more people were not dead .  the assault had been fast and vicious and apparently indiscriminate beyond the assassinations of humadros and eliton .   a beep drew him back to the board .  kedder leaned across it and pressed a contact .     the air scrubbers are back online and .  .  .  yes  the biomonitors in food service are up  too .  looks like your surrogate is in complete control .      derec followed a tree of diagnostic glyphs down a screen .     could you check on the delay factor through the sensory net .  it shouldn   t be more than a few thousand nanoseconds  but        right .     kedder unfolded from the chair and strode toward the master console .   derec glanced at another screen and saw that the memory dump was about finished .  he pressed the com .     rana .         here .         we show a completed core transfer on our end .  what about        who is derec avery .     a new voice demanded .   derec looked up and saw two men standing at the main console  staring down at kedder  who gestured at derec .  by the time they stopped before him  derec recognized them for government security .      mr .  avery .     the shorter of the pair asked .  his face had the jowly look of late middle aged worry .  he wore his short hair in a herringbone weave that seemed to float a few millimeters above his scalp .      yes .         i   m agent cupra  special service .  this is agent gambel .  i understand you   re here on behalf of the phylaxis group .         that   s right .      agent cupra extended a disk to him .     this relieves you of all responsibility and authority for any dealings with the union station ri or related systems and bars you from any official inquiries .  it also requires you to turn over to us any documentation  recordings  or reports generated since the events precipitating your involvement .         what .  but          special service is assuming all investigative privileges and confiscating all relevant data .      derec slipped the disk into a slot on the board and scanned the document that came up on one of the small auxiliary screens .  the seal of the service appeared  followed by paragraphs of dense legalese which basically verified what these agents were telling him .      this is highly irregular .  phylaxis has an arrangement with the government concerning any and all outside spec problems with positronics .  this part of the investigation is our responsibility .         not in this instance .  you   ll find the documentation in order .      derec hesitated  staring at the disk in his hand .      whose word will you take  mr .  avery .     agent gambel asked softly .     we assure you  this is all in order .  feel free to verify it with whomever you wish  but we do have the authority to do this and we will have it done now .         what about the surrogate .  it   s our ri  we have to monitor it .      agent cupra frowned slightly  then shrugged .     that   s only to continue operations of union station  correct .  we have no interest in that .      derec pocketed the disk .     i will check on this .         your privilege  certainly     agent gambel said .     now if you don   t mind .      derec leaned on the board and touched the com button  breaking contact .     fine .  if you   ll come around here  i   ll show you what we   ve set up so far .         you haven   t seen any of the buffer files of the ri .     agent cupra asked .      no  only the playbacks from the video feeds .  do you have something to contain the ri matrix .         we   ll give you an address     cupra replied .  he smiled briefly  insincerely .     let   s get to work  shall we .        derec wandered across the now spotless floor of the main gallery  his footsteps ringing distantly around the immense space .  agents cupra and gambel had everything  including the transferred matrix from phylaxis  kedder had let it out that he had downloaded a copy for study .  derec could not shake the feeling that he had been betrayed .  he had taken the time to make a few calls to the people in government involved with his charter  mainly senator eliton   s committee on machine intelligence  and they had either expressed ignorance of what was going on or confirmed the special service authorization .  he might have continued badgering higher ups  but he doubted it would change anything today  the one man in government who could have made the most difference had been killed .  derec doubted vice senator taprin carried the same weight with the necessary people .   no one in the control room had been at ease with the agents .  joler hammis had been openly hostile .  they did not have the familiarity with these systems that they claimed  but they never hesitated to use the people around them .  poor kedder ended up redoing most of what he and derec had already gone over .  kedder kept giving derec apologetic looks .  hammis stayed for a time  then shook his head and left .  everyone moved cautiously  ever aware of the agents    presence  as if a wrong gesture might invite terrible consequences .  when derec   s part was finished  they showed him the door .  he felt numb .   looking around  it was difficult to imagine that this place had been the stage for the slaughter he had seen .  the floor shone now  polished  ready for new traffic  though when normal flow might resume he had no idea .  shuttle traffic had finally  after hours of delay  been rerouted to other ports .   what was the point .  .  .  .  he wondered hollowly .   he stopped in the middle of the gallery and turned slowly  gazing across the unoccupied expanse .  it was rare to see so much room on earth unpeopled .  everywhere in the warrens and metal caverns  people crowded each other .  standing here seemed a luxury for the moment  a pleasantly eerie feeling  a presc   vu  different from    outside     different from standing in a similar place on a spacer world where crowding was a bad dream and an incomprehensible myth .   he saw no robots now .  union station had been a robot saturated environ  unique on earth .  they had provided comfort and security for the offworld travelers that came through constantly  created a familiar environment for spacer visitors  and facilitated the services of the ri .  it had been a showpiece and a diplomatic necessity  something for the proponents of robots on earth to hold up as an example of how it might be .  to see none here now made it stranger yet .   derec continued to the exit  down the empty tunnel  and out onto the broad apron .  a few personal transports still occupied the cordoned off space .  beyond  the boulevard ran by  and across from that the express strips started .  the few people riding past gave the union station fa  ade uncomprehending stares  as if the place had suddenly become something other than it had always been  revealing a shocking reality long hidden .   he climbed into his vehicle and closed his eyes .  weariness  disbelief  and stress combined to fog his mind .  he gave himself a few minutes before engaging the drive and pulling onto the boulevard .   the com light winked at him .  he pressed the contact .      derec .         this is rana  derec .  what is going on .         you heard  didn   t you .  special service is assuming control of the investigation          i heard  but it doesn   t make any sense .  i just got an official request to turn over any and all documents and copies of the ri  with an address to forward it .  what is this .  they don   t know how to handle this kind of thing .  they   d have to hand it over to us anyway .         i doubt they   re going to    handle it .      i think they   ll just sit on it  conduct their investigation their way  and then leave the ri matrix as an unopened file .  they   re covering themselves .  a major miscalculation happened here today and  since it   s their job to make sure this kind of thing doesn   t happen  it   s only reasonable that they don   t want to compound their embarrassment .         reasonable .  people are dead and they   re worried about reputations .      derec did not know what to tell her .  it made sense to him  he grasped the kind of venality in play here .  so  for that matter  did rana  given five minutes    reflection  but comprehension did not make it any more acceptable .      it   s out of our hands     he said .     comply with the request .  i   ll be there shortly .  i have another stop to make first .         already done .  do we continue surrogate monitor for union station .  thales is already online .         yes  we do .         okay .  how long before you get back here .         i don   t know .  i   m going to check the med facilities .  bogard was on site during the massacre .         our bogard .         the very same .  i want to find it and check it over .  i   ll let you know .  oh  and wake up that lawyer we have on retainer and find out if there   s anything we can do to get around this injunction .  we   re supposed to have a contract  and i   m really uncomfortable having amateurs shut me out of it .         this is special service  though      rana began .      i don   t care if it   s the second coming of susan calvin .  a contract is a contract  and special service has no roboticists .      he could practically hear the grin on rana   s face as she said she would tend to it .  the link closed and derec touched the contact again .      location     he ordered the onboard computer .     emergency medical facilities  this district .  list .        as he pulled into the garage of the fourth medical facility  derec felt a chill of success .  several black vehicles occupied spaces near the entrance .  a man and woman in dark clothes lounged by the doors  watching the lot .   derec approached the entrance and the man stepped forward to block his path .  derec swallowed dryly and displayed his id .      oh  good     the agent said .     phylaxis .  mr .  avery .  i   m agent sathen  special service .  the robot is inside .  we can   t get it to move  maybe you can do something .         um .  .  .  has it caused any problems .         other than scaring the staff  no .     the man grinned .     come on  i   ll show you .          slightly puzzled  derec followed the agent through the wide main doors into the brightly lit reception area .  the air smelled of disinfectant  a piquant odor universal to hospitals  even on spacer worlds .  people rushed about intently amid a constant babble of com chatter and urgently spoken instructions .  at the nurses    station  a woman looked up  frowning at derec  then nodded at the agent .      it came in with agent daventri five hours ago     agent sathen explained as he led the way past open doors to examination rooms and patient chambers .     then it took a position just inside her room and refused to leave .         why here and not reed hospital with all the other wounded .      the agent shrugged .     our dispatcher sent her here .  it is closer than reed  and with the robot .  .  .         i see .  did the robot give an explanation .         says it   s here to protect agent daventri .  we can   t convince it that she   s safe .         first law obsessing .         it   s what .         apparently  it has locked on defending agent  daventri  is it .    defending agent daventri as its primary imperative .  unless you can present it with another first law condition that would override this one  it won   t leave until it knows she   s safe .         safe from what .      derec gave him a shrug .      robots     the agent said in disgust .     well  i   m surprised this one is still functioning after what happened today .  i saw a lot of braindead robots after the incident .  this one was supposed to protect senator eliton and it failed .  aren   t they supposed to shut down after something like that .         it depends .  a positronic brain doesn   t have the same capacities as a human brain  but in many ways it   s just as complex .         uh huh .  here it is .     the man stopped before a closed door and knocked .     bogard  this is agent sathen .  i   m coming in .  i have someone with me .         enter     came a firm voice from the other side of the door .   sathen gave derec a crooked smile .     first couple of us that walked in without identifying ourselves  bogard tranked .         were you armed .         yes .  after that  we got it to modify its defense protocols .      inside  derec saw first the patient bed and the array of biological support gathered around it .  looking small in the midst of the masses of equipment lay a woman with sickly pale skin and short  dark hair .      she   s still in rehab coma     agent sathen said .      how bad .         two holes in her right leg  one in her arm  a lot of bruises .  a broken rib .  mainly they   re worried about shock .      he turned away from the bed .     and this is bogard .     the robot stood against the wall  in a position to watch the patient and the door and within easy reach of both .  it towered over the two men by nearly half a meter .  derec noticed that its hands showed six fingers .  through anyone of them it could deliver a fast working tranquilizer to a bare patch of skin .  the white line of its optical array seemed to pulse at them .      hello  derec     it said .      bogard  hello .  i   m told you refuse to leave agent daventri .         that is correct  derec .         explain .         i have been given specific instructions to safeguard agent daventri until such time as she releases me to return to initial priorities .         agent daventri gave you those instructions .         yes  derec .         are you aware that she is presently out of danger but incommunicado .         yes  derec .  however  i am instructed to maintain watch until released .         what were the circumstances of these instructions .         agent daventri commanded me to pursue and apprehend two subjects involved in the assassin  assassin  assass          reset and continue .      bogard paused for a moment  then proceeded .     agent daventri left me to pursue a third subject .  i fulfilled her instructions by locating and tranquilizing the targets .  when i brought the two subjects back to find her  she had been injured during a confrontation with her subject .  i experienced a dilemma .  protocol dictated that under instruction to apprehend i must secure and deliver subjects to proper authority .  however  agent daventri   s injuries indicated immediate need to bring her to proper care .  she instructed me to commandeer transport drones to carry the subjects  to personally bring her to proper care  and to guarantee her safety in the event that she should lose consciousness .  i procured the transports and picked up agent daventri .  she then fell unconscious .  i will not leave her until she gives further instruction .         touching     sathen said cynically .     you   re service property  bogard .  your presence is required at headquarters for debriefing .      derec glared at the agent .     if you please .     sathen gave him a surly look and walked away .  derec turned to bogard .     alpha zed override .  command sequence          rejected .      derec blinked .     explain .         specific instructions take precedence over all secondary protocols .         i see .  .  .  very well  bogard .  continue according to instruction .         what .     sathen grabbed his shoulder .     we need this tinhead for interrogation  not standing here guarding someone who doesn   t need guarding .      derec shrugged sathen   s hand off .     come outside with me .     in the hallway  the door closed  derec rounded on the agent .     if you don   t stop  you could precipitate a positronic collapse  and you won   t have anything to debrief .         don   t give me        i   m not giving you anything .  did you hear it stutter .         yes  when it tried to say          assassination .  exactly .  now my understanding of what happened is that senator eliton died in that attack .  bogard was assigned to protect him .         it did a good job of that  didn   t it .     sathen said with a sneer .      do you know why it failed .     derec asked  holding his temper .      no .         then i suggest you don   t speculate .  robots follow a very strict set of guidelines in the commission of their duties and usually any failure that results in injury or death of a human causes positronic psychosis and collapse .  the robot shuts down .  you saw it happen to the staff robots at union station .      agent sathen frowned but clearly was listening .     go on .      derec drew a breath and tried to decide how much to tell sathen .  bogard was not a standard positronic robot  derec had built it differently so that it could function in the role of bodyguard without being continually conflicted .  it could do a kind of rough triage with priorities  but even bogard could not circumvent the onset of collapse under these conditions for long .   derec gazed back at the door thoughtfully .     for some reason     he said finally     bogard is still functioning .  barely .  i   d bet it has to do with agent daventri   s instructions .  if that   s the case  it must follow them to the letter or lose its hold on sanity and function .  it   s traumatized by the death of senator eliton .  it   s further traumatized by daventri   s wounds .  it may feel responsible .  if you want bogard in any condition to give you information about what happened  then leave it alone for now .  when agent daventri regains consciousness  she can release it verbally and you may be able to move it .  till then  it   s standing guard .         you know all this just from that little bit of conversation .      derec glanced at the door .     mainly from its rejection of my override command .  that only happens when it   s locked in a three law conflict .  it has to resolve the dilemma from within .      sathen drew a deep breath  looking thoughtful .     so there   s no getting it out of here .         not till your agent wakes up .  how long will that be  do you know .         a day  maybe two .  like i said  she   s suffering shock more than anything .         call us when she comes to .      sathen nodded .     all right .  look  i apologize for getting hot with you .  it   s just          i understand .  this has been a very unusual day .      sathen grunted .     that   s an understatement .      derec walked away .  he had given bogard only one of the possible override commands available  as much to see if it would reject it as to keep agent sathen from learning the other codes .     he had no idea how high up sathen   s clearances went .  besides  derec hoped he could get his hands on bogard before anything completely unexpected occurred .   derec returned to his transport .  as he started away  another black vehicle pulled into the lot .  derec slowed and watched until he saw agents cupra and gambel get out and head for the entrance .     command override omega five catalogue reset  shunt to auxiliary buffer  fourth tier conditional

that she was in a small room .  she felt nothing  and for a few seconds she panicked  groping in memory for the cause .      you are an  sthetized .      she heard the words but did not immediately recognize their meaning .  still  she felt herself calming down  and gradually she understood .      i   m in hospital     she croaked  her throat dry and mouth cottony .  she coughed  which came as a sound with no sensation in her chest .  she hated this .     water .  .  .  .      a tube touched her lips and she took it and sucked .  cool liquid filled her mouth .  she saw a large shape  shadow on shadow  to her left  looming  a thin line of white light marking its head .      bogard .         yes  agent daventri .     the robot came closer to her bed .      what are you doing here .     she asked .      performing required service .  i am protecting you .      mia hesitated .  for a moment she did not remember .  she drew on the tube and riffled through her memory .     how long .         you have been here for fourteen hours .         fourteen hours .  hospital .         yes .      then she remembered .     prisoners          secured and turned over for processing .         i was   hurt           multiple projectile wounds  right leg  right arm  left fourth rib .  healing vectors are positive  prognosis excellent .  rehabilitative coma is withdrawn .  full function should return in three to five days .         i instructed you to protect me .          yes .      mia blinked and looked away  remembering the last moments at union station .  she had lain bleeding while a transport drone chattered helplessly at her side about assisting her .  the pain  it had been difficult to think  to decide .  she had passed out  a wholly new experience  one she hoped never to repeat .  then bogard had arrived  two unconscious people in its grasp  and the concern in its voice had brought her focus .  bogard was already on the edge  having failed to protect senator eliton .  following her orders had kept it functioning  it needed another purpose to keep it from collapsing .  bogard was resilient  more so than any robot she had ever heard about  but it was still a robot with a positronic brain restricted by the three laws .  she remembered  vaguely  issuing a series of specific instructions to commandeer transport drones for the prisoners and see that she was safe .  .  .   her arms tingled .  the an  sthetic was slowly wearing off .      could we have a little more light  bogard .         i recommend against it .         explain .         there are irregularities .  i think it prudent not to alert the staff that you are awake .         i       and that fast she lost consciousness  as if dropped into a vat of nonawareness  floating in a place with no boundaries  no form  no light  no darkness .   when she opened her eyes again  the room was still dark  and bogard stood on the other side of her bed .      i have made modifications to the link between your monitors and the external systems .  i apologize for the abruptness of returning you to coma .  we will not alert the staff again .      mia started .     you reinstated coma .  bogard  i don   t          i am monitoring you now .  i have routed these systems through my own .  it was necessary in order to fulfill my instructions .         i   m not thinking as clearly as i should  bogard .  you have to give me more explanation .         i understand .  after bringing you here  several attempts were made to remove me .  i rejected all contravening instruction as none of them engaged a higher priority .  all of this was anticipated as a normal response to circumstance .  i will be required to provide data about the events at union station d .  c .  i could easily be debriefed here with the proper equipment  but no one considered that avenue .  therefore  other agents were stationed here to wait for you to regain consciousness in order to secure my release from your service .         i have to let you go .         correct .  earlier tonight  two agents arrived to attempt to remove me again .  their agitation did not seem within normal vectors of frustration appropriate to the circumstances .  they became quite agitated and verbally abusive .  the other agents seemed dismayed by their reaction as well and requested that they leave .  three hours ago  all agents stationed at this facility were recalled and reassigned .  presently  no law enforcement personnel are on the premises other than you and me and a new agent stationed at the nurses desk .  also  medical staff has been relieved for the night .  there is one physician on call  sleeping in the lounge .  i proceeded to intervene in your therapy and bring you out of coma early .  there was a small risk factor and you may experience greater discomfort as a result  but i determined that your awareness was of higher priority than your convenience .         no other personnel .  .  .  not even a city police officer .         no one .      mia did not know if the tingling in her belly was the result of restored sensation or fear .      bogard  i want you to surveil the premises .         i should not leave you .         listen carefully  bogard .  right now we don   t have enough information to make a decision .  we need to know .  you don   t want to let the staff know i   m awake  fine .  this is the alternative .  i can   t do anything till the an  sthetic wears off  anyway .  i need to know what   s happening  if anything .  i repeat  surveil the premises .      mia watched the big shadow  wondering if it would accept her logic and her instruction .  bogard was obviously still on the edge of a breakdown .  that it still functioned evidently resulted from binding it to her safety  but she did not know how far she could push it .      your assessment is sound     bogard said .     i will return as soon as possible .      and it vanished .  mia imagined she felt a slight shift of air  an almost breeze  as it left the room .  its speed startled her  and she wondered then how it had been possible that it had permitted senator eliton to die .   she craned her neck to see the monitors around her .  the readouts made little sense other than those for her pulse and respiration  which appeared slightly elevated but not out of bounds .  the tingly sensation spread across her thighs and now she began to feel the heavy bruised pain of her wounds .  she only remembered being shot once  but her memory was hazy on other details as well  she could not remember the specific instructions she had given bogard  only that she had given them .   as she lay there waiting for all her senses to return  mia began to puzzle over bogard   s report .  it had convinced her easily that something was wrong  but was that in fact the case .  coming out of a rehab coma  nothing worked right .  her mind grabbed onto anything that resembled reason and order  so the first thing she heard seemed to make sense .  perhaps sending bogard out like this was as much a reflexive attempt at verifying its perceptions as anything else .  field agents had better things to do than sit in a medical center holding a wounded but essentially fine agent   s hand .  it was reasonable to call them away  especially in light of what had happened not even half a day ago .  fourteen hours .  she had allowed bogard to scare her into believing what .  that her life was in danger .   no city cop either .  .  .      we must move .      she flinched at the sound of bogard   s voice to her right .  she watched as it deftly removed all her monitors .      bogard  what   .         little time     it said quickly .   it flitted to another part of the room and returned  moving too fast to follow .  in the dim light it was difficult to see clearly  but it seemed squatter  more compact than it should .  it pulled off the thin sheet covering her and for an instant mia felt a pang of modesty .   then it spread its arm against the mattress and expanded them to form a kind of sling .  mia had never seen this aspect of it in anything but a training video which had been itself circumspect about most of bogard   s potentials .  every other time she had witnessed bogard   s shapeshifting  it had already completed it  too fast for her to see  as when it had enveloped eliton .  she was startled and amazed at the process  like watching a part of the robot melt and solidify into a new shape .      can you move yourself .     bogard asked .      y yes  i think so .  .  .      she scooted  her leg aching sharply  the rest of her body dimly echoing the pain  and shoved herself onto the sling .  she expected it to be cold  but instead the material was comfortably warm .  when she had gotten herself entirely onto it  bogard lifted her and curled the edges around to cover her .  she was folded against it  infant like .  mia lifted her head and peered over the lip of the cradle .   bogard carried her out the door in a vertiginous rush and down the dark hallway .  mia frowned .  that was wrong .  the lights should not be dimmed out here .   at the end of the corridor  bogard stopped and turned so that she had a clear view back toward her room .      bogard  why   .         you will see .     bogard replied  voice hushed and low .   as she watched  a pair of black shapes crept up the hallway .  they stopped at her door and huddled on either side .  then one of them crouched  pushed open the door  and mia heard the sound of metal sliding on floor .  the pair then hurried back the way they had come  rounding the far corner just as the door burst out from the pressure of a bright cloud of fire .   an instant later the sound of the blast hit mia   s ears .  bogard   s shielding arms moved instantly to cover her face .   then there was    only the sensation of movement and the wracking tremors of fear .     tactical parameters  standard conjoined facility  connection to sublevels and

conflict assigned to auxiliary buffer  shield configuration  first order expedience  initiate survive and protect protocols    bogard carried her down to a sublevel of the facility  among the storage lockers and systems components that provided support .  smooth walled conduit snaked along the walls and ceiling  modules stood in ranks  interconnected  providing power and communications  conveyors stood motionless .  bogard shone a light among the dark shapes until it found the interrupted line that isolated the hospital .  a simple switch  one that had not been touched in years  judging by the dust on everything else around it .      leave it alone     mia told bogard .     it will only let them know someone is down here .      bogard did not respond  but moved past to another set of stairs  and down to another sublevel .   the passageways narrowed claustrophobically .  mia only glimpsed them in the short beam of light from bogard .  more conduit  pipes  collections of cable attached to boxes  rounded forms  or bunched masses of multicolored shapes  stained by age and moisture  the air smelling dank with the heaviness of hidden growth .   then bogard dowsed its own lights in the presence of bright red panels spaced every few meters .  the traces of connective cables and tubes took on an organic appearance and mia imagined  briefly  that they hurried down the veinous network of a living thing .  in a sense they did  the deep viscera of the urban organism known as d .  c .    bogard moved smoothly  without the shock she expected of running enfolded in its arms  and the motion lulled her .  she dozed .   she came awake with a start  groping for the edges of a bed  her fingers coming against the walls of her cradle .  her leg burned with pain and her torso ached .  she lay still for a few seconds  remembering  then realized that they were no longer moving .  she raised her head to peer over the edge of bogard   s arms .   the chamber beyond was unevenly lit .  columns seemed to support nothing  lost in darkness .  large housings made ominous shapes in the half light of old glow panels and a flickering illumination that danced somewhere beyond a wall to their left .  debris littered the floor .  stacks of objects here and there gave the place a forgotten quality  an attic melancholy .  cold air stroked her face .      bogard  where are we .         sublevel eleven  beneath mcmillan district .      sublevel eleven .  .  .  mia tried to recall the d .  c .  grid .  they were below the level of the ancient potomac .  mcmillan sector was several kilometers north of where they had begun .      how long have i slept .         you have slept inconsistently .  we exited the medical center eighty seven minutes ago .         why have we stopped .         i have determined that for the present you are in no danger of detection .  further instructions would be prudent .         prudent .  .  .  .  bogard  you have a fine sense of the absurd .         pardon .         never mind .  let me think .      mia found that more difficult than she expected .  all she wanted to do was go back to sleep .  she had never experienced so much fear  she had no idea what was a normal reaction  but this surprised her .  it was as though her unconscious  the repository of habit and instinct and reflex  was telling her that the safest thing to do was to go away until the danger was over .  bogard would protect her .   she looked up at the trace of white light from its head  above the curve of its upper torso and shoulders .  no  it could not protect her completely .  it could carry her out of immediate dangers  evade pursuit  act as a wall against blasters and explosives  but it could not exercise deadly force  could in fact be only minimally aggressive  and even that could be subverted if it was forced to recognize the actions as inimical to humans .  mia had to remind herself of bogard   s limitations  that no matter how fearsome it could seem it still used a positronic brain with all the constraints against harming humans that implied .  it had brought her here and now  sensibly  but it had handed the next decision over to her .   so decide .  .  .  she chided herself .   she needed to know who they were  the two who had just tried to kill her .  their choice of method seemed unnecessarily crude at first  a hammer to kill a fly .  but with bogard in the room with her anything else might easily have been countered .  which meant that they knew bogard was with her .  no matter what bogard would have done  it could not have done it fast enough or safely enough for other people who might have been in the building .   they knew about bogard .  .  .   that led to uncomfortable places .  mia set the problem aside to consider the immediate situation .  prudence dictated that she avoid another public facility until she knew all the facts .   protocol dictated she contact one and report .   but they knew about bogard .  .  .   her leg ached violently  and she sucked air between her teeth .     bogard  is there anything you can do for my pain .         i can administer a general an  sthetic .  i regret i do not have a local .         at some point we need to find painkillers .  first  though  i need .  .  .  i need some things .  .  .  can you get me to my apartment from here undetected .         yes .         that   s a start .  do that .  i can think on the way .        instead  she slept most of the way .  she glimpsed the passing of lights and unfamiliar places  old construction gradually becoming organic over time  the bones of the city encrusted with the residue of time and neglect .  bogard travelled so fast that even had she managed to keep awake  it would have still made as abstract and indefinable an impression .  she lost direction  sense of place .  sleep came easily  brief lapses in which dreams hinted at safer realities  and pain faded .      you   d make a wonderful transport     mia murmured once .  if bogard replied  she did not hear .   once again she awoke in the absence of motion .   bogard stood surrounded by trees .  mia pulled herself up as well as she could into a sitting position .  the smell of pine and grass filled her nostrils  displacing for a moment the distant tinge of blood .   through the tangle of limbs and leaves  a walkway separated the edge of the parkland from a blocky apartment complex .  streetlights set the pavement aglow  but above them only the warm illumination from windows broke the night .      bogard  assessment .          there is a service transport in the garage entrance .  one occupant .  high probability of encountering personnel or detectors .  degree of safety indeterminate .         damn .     she could not see herself wrapped within bogard   s arms like this  but she imagined what she looked like dressed in only a hospital shift .  even if no one was looking for her  her appearance screamed fugitive  especially in the company of a robot like bogard .     can you bypass surveillance .         yes .      mia looked up at bogard .     remind me to ask you for a complete manifest of your capabilities .         when .         when what .         when do you wish to be reminded .      mia almost laughed .     when we   re reasonably safe for more than an hour .  listen .  i want you to leave me here          that is not an acceptable action .         listen  i said .  leave me here  under cover .  find some bushes or something .  i need things from my apartment .  would it be safer for you to go in alone or carrying me .         alone .         then don   t argue .  leave me here under cover and enter my apartment .  exercise extreme caution .  if you cannot get in and out undetected  abort .  do you understand .         yes .         good .  now this is what i want .  .  .        tactical parameters  apartment complex  three pedestrian  residents accesses  four maintenance accesses  abutment to

straight out atop a bed of fallen needles  and stared through the small breaks in the evergreens surrounding her  listening to the dissociated sounds of the park  unable to tell which belonged and which meant threat .   it seemed  though  that she had slept enough and now found herself on the other side of a nightmare .  the events in union station did not feel real  but more like a fiction or the events of history as witnessed by someone else .  not her .  she had not lived through an assassination attempt  or seen her employer killed .  she had not chased a murderer and in turn nearly been murdered .  she had not been carried from a hospital room less than two minutes before it was bombed .  she was not cowering under cover of bushes  unable to cross a street and enter her own home for fear of being arrested or killed .   not mia daventri .  this sort of thing happened to others  never to her  and whoever this was happening to would never experience it again .  perhaps they were not experiencing it now but only waiting for sleep to resume or end so the waking world next time she visited it would show her that it all had been a dream  a chimera  a mirage of the mind .   i could ask bogard .  .  .  she thought .   the robot could do either  though  she realized  comfort her by confirming her hypothesis  or dispel the desperate rationalization just concocted .  safer  perhaps  not to ask it just yet .   she heard the crisp crackle of twigs snap nearby and her breath caught .   dreams can only threaten and illusions only kill when you surrender to them .  .  .   the shrubs around her shifted delicately .  she pressed her hands to the ground  muscles tightening .  she could not run  and she doubted she could do much more than annoy someone in a fight .   a branch moved aside  and a blunt helmet  shape with a streak of white light peered in at her .      i have the things you requested     bogard said in a clear whisper .   mia   s breath sounded explosively loud in her own ears .      bogard .  .  .     she breathed  relieved .        your domicile has been compromised     bogard explained .      listening devices as well as full visual surveillance  including a tap on your com line .  i detected only two personnel  the one in the transport  the other waiting in the lobby .  i did not procure sufficient data for recognition  per your instructions .         good  good .  .  .  you did good  bogard .      mia tapped at her portable datum and watched the diagnostic examine itself for intrusions .  it came up clean .  perhaps later she could get a more complete diagnostic  just in case  but for now she had to trust her own safeguards .   time for the next decision .  now that she knew she was under surveillance  she also knew she could not report to one .  someone on the inside could intercept her before she got to him .  she was a competent  even talented  agent  but she was relatively new on the job and had no illusions about the limits of her experience .  she needed a place to recover completely and think clearly .   but where .   she opened her list of names and started scrolling .  most of the people she knew well worked for the service .  going to one of them was a fifty fifty chance that they were involved or would become targets themselves .  she winced inwardly at the solid recognition that she could trust none of her former colleagues .  who did that leave .  relatives .  no .  her parents were dead  most of her brothers and sisters had emigrated to a settler colony  except toj  but he lived in europe now .  besides  it would be unfair to make them targets  especially since they were known to the service and were probably being watched in case she did contact them .  her best friend from university had broken off their friendship when mia had signed for special service .  the rest of her friends .  .  .  well  none were close enough to ask this kind of favor from .  if they were  she could not see that it would help .  they did not know what it entailed .  she would be putting them in danger .   this was frustrating .  paranoia occluded every possible action .   mia stopped scrolling and stared at the name that now appeared on the screen .  gradually  she felt herself begin to hope .      bogard  help me get dressed .  i know where we   re going .         seven    ariel listened to the quiet music  eyes closed  and wished for sleep .  the day had stretched till it felt like two had been compressed into one .   the delicate sound of ice in liquid clattering against a glass brought her attention back to the present .  jonis taprin smiled tensely at her as he sat down in the chair opposite her own  his back to her wall length window .  beyond  d .  c .     s roof sprawled in the night  marked by guide towers and isolated pools of light outlining the expanse of shell beneath which millions of people worked  ate  slept  lived their entire lives without ever seeing the stars except on a screen in a classroom or library .  a few enclaves erupted from the surface to boldly challenge the open sky  homes of the unaffected rich and offworld visitors who found constant enclosure beneath tons of metal intolerable .   ariel absently rubbed the sole of her left foot with the toes of her right .     why is it  after hours and hours of sitting in front of a com  my feet hurt .         i   d rub them for you     jonis said     but jennie might think i   m hurting you .      ariel lifted the glass jonis had set beside her  ignoring the remark .  jonis no more worried that ariel   s personal robot would object than she did  but he liked ariel to invite him to touch her  a game she occasionally appreciated but one that he overdid .     thanks     she said     i think i   ve earned this .     she sipped .     sorry i haven   t had time to talk .  it   s been chaotic .         same here .  more so  maybe .  clar   s death has left a vacuum large enough to swallow the sun .  i appreciate you let ting me hide out for a few hours .  this may be the last reprieve i get for the foreseeable future .         if your office is half as insane as mine .  .  .     she let the remark fade unfinished .  jonis had been on the verge of some sort of breakdown since he had arrived .  oddly  he seemed guilty about something  perhaps survivor   s shame .  besides being his vice senator  jonis taprin had been eliton    s friend .   jonis glanced over his shoulder at the view .     i   m getting better .  maybe by the time you agree to cohabit  i might even be used to it .      ariel felt herself tense at the remark  but covered her reaction by rubbing her eyes .      want to talk about it .     when she gave him a sharp look  he raised a hand defensively .     your day  i mean .         oh  it   s .  .  .     ariel sighed .     have you ever tried to calm down someone who is terrified for no good reason .         just today  as a matter of fact .  i think i   m about to be doing a lot of that .         i   ve been in contact with  oh  thirty five or forty people since the incident  all aurorans  all important people  all ready to book passage on the next ship back to aurora .  all i had to do was convince them to stay .         did you .         most of them .  a few can   t be consoled or mollified or threatened .  they   re leaving .         what about guviya tralen .  isn   t she the key to the rest .         you might say that     ariel agreed .     the rest follow her example .  if she buys on the terran exchange  aurorans the world over buy .  if she sells  they sell .         if she runs home .  .  .  .         exactly .  i   d rather negotiate with a managin sometimes .  she said     my good ariel  this planet is a sick place .  there   s no fixing it .  too much time  too much history  too much ingrowth .  we   re wasting resources on trying to come to terms with them .  our ancestors were right to leave and the settlers are right  much as it pains me to admit that anything born on this world can be right .           jonis raised his eyebrows .     hmm .  well  her analysis is sound .  i   m not sure i   d agree that we   re sick .      ariel waved a hand .     talk .  she wanted me to offer her something .         and did you .         i offered her a blot on her reputation if she ran .  sometimes that   s more important to a spacer  at least to an auroran  than comfort  security  and happiness .         so she   s staying .         at least until the investigation is done .  if arrests are made  then i think i can pressure her to stay on .         you   re wonderful  ariel .  if your fellow aurorans leave now everything clar and humadros worked for would fall apart .  the treaty is still there  even if the architects are not  and there   s no reason to think we can   t still get it ratified .         has there been any progress .         in the investigation .     jonis shook his head .     no  i   m afraid not .  of course  it   s a little soon .         i thought you had prisoners .         i haven   t heard anything from any interrogation .     he sighed tiredly .     i   m not looking forward to the next few days  either .  i have to contact the families of clar   s security team and tell them all their children are dead .      ariel saw the anguish on his face .  jonis was very much the politician in public controlled  reserved  emotional when necessary .  in many ways he was the perfect successor to clar eliton .  she wondered sometimes that he had never run against eliton in a general election  contenting himself to be vice senator taprin  but he worked very effectively behind the scenes while eliton presented the more visible public face .  in the months she had known him  ariel had found him to be as much an idealist as eliton  but coupled with a practicality eliton had seemed to lack .  now he would step into the senatorial position and she looked forward to seeing what he would make of it .      a waste     she said .     did you know them .         not well  but then special service doesn   t encourage intimacy on the part of their operatives .      for a moment ariel considered inviting him to spend the night .  but she had a lot on her mind and wanted to sleep and knew if he stayed that neither of them would .      what are you doing tomorrow .     she asked .   jonis started .     hmm .  oh  sorry  i drifted .  .  .  um  i have a meeting with the euro sector bilateral commission on manufactures and distribution .     he gave her a sour grin .     thrilling stuff .  i can   t wait to write my memoirs and take up the challenge of making this all sound romantic .     he shrugged .     but absolutely necessary .  they need to be reassured that the talks are going ahead .  oh  i should warn you  senator covidry is going to propose a delay of five days .         why .         i   m not entirely in disagreement with him  it would give us time to reorganize where necessary and give the police a chance to find the perpetrators .  this has been a hell of a shock  to put it mildly .  but clar wouldn   t delay  he   d push right ahead .  so i   m honorbound to fight a delay .  expect it to pass  though .         you really admired him  didn   t you .         clar .  yes .  he wasn   t a fake .  his convictions meant something .  he couldn   t always say what they were  but you could tell they were there  supporting him .  a rare man .     jonis glanced at his wrist .     damn  it   s after midnight .  i better get out of here and let you get some sleep .      ariel relaxed .  a consummate politician  jonis  always correctly gauging his public  and knowing exactly when to make an exit .  she got to her feet wearily and let him embrace her .  his lips brushed her ear briefly .      i   ll call     he said .      you get some sleep  too .         absolutely .      she walked him to the door .  r .  jennie waited with his jacket .  jonis cocked an eyebrow at the robot .     goodnight  jennie .         good evening  sir .  i trust you had a pleasant visit .         too brief  but very pleasant .     he winked at ariel .      later .      when the door closed after him  ariel sighed heavily .     i   m going to have to make a decision about him some day  jennie .         may i be of assistance .         no  i don   t think you can help with this one .     she took another drink .   jonis was the first person she had become intimate with since she and derec had parted .  at first it had been convenient  their schedules and duties guaranteed that they saw each other only for short times at odd intervals  but jonis had become more and more insistent on a formal arrangement .  she was uncertain that she wanted  had ever wanted  quite that much companionship .      it is late  ariel     r .  jennie said .     you have an early appointment in the morning .         are you telling me i   m up past my bedtime  jennie .         you do usually retire before eleven in the evening if you do not have guests staying over .      ariel looked at the robot .  r .  jennie wore her humaniform mask tonight  a pleasant  beige colored face with bluish eyes and the suggestion of a smile .  the features did not move  giving it an antique flavor  but it was better than the medieval machine mask ariel had it wear when earthers came to visit .  the revulsion of earthers to humaniform robots struck her as their most perverse trait  but she accepted it as part of life here and did her best not to aggravate the problem .   which made it all the more irritating when spacer vendors circumvented the rules and sold humaniforms anyway  like that fool udal .  imports were controlled  so how had he even gotten them .  and then to have the gall to come to her and demand action against the vandals .  .  .  she needed to inspect his warehouses  squeeze him a little to see if she could find the leak .  just now the last thing any of them needed was a black market import scandal .   ariel shook her head .     can   t sleep  jennie .  too much on my mind .         would you like a soporific .         no .  why don   t you shut down for the night  jennie .  i   ll go to bed soon .         very well  ariel .  good night .      she barely heard r .  jennie pad away to her niche .   ariel yawned and stretched .  she went to the window  glass in hand .  somewhere out there was the ocean  the atlantic .  aurora had nothing like it  just a series of big lakes and artesian springs  underground rivers .  of all the features of earth only the oceans disturbed her  the only natural force that seemed to match the lemming irrationality of earth   s people .   she did not tell jonis the rest of her conversation with guviya  grand matron of auroran business .  she wondered if she ever would  even though it bore directly on her decision to be alone tonight .  it had been a brief exchange .  after guviya   s pronouncement on earth   s sickness  ariel had said     perhaps .  but when your brother or sister falls ill  you help them .  you don   t turn your back on them or throw them away .         of course not     guviya had replied     but we don   t allow them to become ill in the first place .      ariel had wanted to reach through the link and slap her for hypocrisy .  no  heaven forbid a spacer become ill  what might that say about the culture .  perhaps ariel expected too much to hope that guviya would understand her point .  guviya did not know that turned backs and disposal had been precisely the treatment ariel had received from her fellow aurorans  many years ago and a lifetime away .  or did she .   her com chimed and she moaned .      i said no more calls .      another chime .  she took her drink and crossed the room to the panel .      accept  voice only .         my apologies  ariel     came hofton   s voice over the com .     i didn   t wake you .         no  but i wish you had .  that would mean i   d gotten some sleep tonight .         i thought this couldn   t wait .  the surviving members of the auroran legation are demanding immediate transport back up to kopernik station .         survivors .  .  .  how many are there .         four .  i   ll forward their bios .         wait  hofton  i don   t understand .  what am i supposed to do .  shouldn   t lys handle  oh .     ariel felt foolish .  lys was dead .  who else had gone down from the embassy .  they had been fortunate that setaris had refrained from attending  but the rest of her key staff had gone .     sony  that   s a silly question .  but this isn   t really my job .         it seems to be now  they were all forwarded to this office .  i   m sure it   s only temporary  ariel .  besides  i thought perhaps you might regard their departure as something of a problem in light of all the damage control we did today .  the legation itself leaving .  .  .  .         of course  but hasn   t setaris talked to them .         i would assume so  but .  .  .         i can   t blame them for wanting out .  no one we talked to today had been shot at .     ariel turned her glass  letting the ice rattle .     maybe one of them could stay .  .  .  all right  i   ll make one more call .  who   s in authority now .         i   m not exactly clear on that     hofton replied .     either benen yarick or tro aspil  but i gather there   s an internal dispute of some kind .         fine  i   ll talk to      ariel   s eyebrows rose in surprise .     tro aspil .         do you know him .         slightly .  i didn   t realize he   d risen to this level .  he was just an intern at the institute last time we spoke .  i   ll call him first .  thank you  hofton .         i   ll try not to disturb you for the rest of the evening .         thanks     ariel said wryly .  her buffer indicated receipt of hofton   s profiles .  the connection ended and she accessed the files  then placed her first call .   tro aspil did not answer .  benen yarick accepted her call promptly .      this is ariel burgess  commerce liaison  from the embassy .  i hope this isn   t an inconvenient time .         no  not at all .  no more inconvenient than anything else since we   ve been here     yarick said  her voice uneven and strained .      i understand that you   ve all requested immediate transport back to kopernick          oh  yes .  and from there directly back to aurora on the first available ship  yes .  we are all .  .  .  overwhelmed .  well  most of us are .  we can   t function in our present condition .  perhaps another legation will come later  after .  .  .         i understand your state of mind  believe me     ariel said .     but .  .  .  please understand  normally i   m not the one you need to talk to about this  ambassador setaris should be the one  but i   m grateful for a chance to talk to you about it and i   ll do what i can to help .  i deal with those aurorans who come here to live  do business  have interests on earth .  that ends up with me acting as a very complex kind of interpreter between terran and auroran          you have my sympathy     yarick said .      it   s not all bad .  after today i expect the rest of the year will be easy .  but right now i   m trying to keep a panic from destroying everything we   ve built here .  humadros   s mission would have made my life  well  not easier  but at least more hopeful .     as it is  everything could fall apart .         as i said  you have my sympathy .  how does that concern us .         it   s a question of appearances .  i   d like you to reconsider your departure .  delay it  at least until the local authorities can make arrests .  it would mean a great deal to the resident aurorans to see the surviving members of humadros   s legation          i   m sure it would  and i   m sure you mean well  and maybe you even shared galiel   s vision of a stronger tie with this planet  but frankly i could care less right now     yarick interjected .     i appreciate what you   re trying to do  but i watched people i loved and admired die today from an act that made even less sense than the actions these people usually make .      yarick closed her eyes briefly and seemed to gather herself .     i   m quite honestly afraid  ms .  burgess .  the only reason we   re talking  well  there is no reason we   re talking  only blind chance .  humadros died right in front of me .  then carset  then shoal .  they were the heart  mind  and spirit of this mission .  then all the others  vorin  janilen  aspil  all dead right in front of me  and the wounded  kitch  moreg  vanloonis  graw .  .  .  no  i want out .  i   m just as glad setaris forwarded me to you because i don   t want to talk to ambassador setaris .  when she has the time  she   ll do her level best to talk us out of it  and she can be very persuasive .      yarick shook her head emphatically .     i don   t want to be persuaded  and i don   t need any added guilt .  i want these arrangements made quickly and with the least fuss .  everyone else on the embassy staff will be in sympathy with setaris .  i want a full escort to the shuttle .  i won   t begin to feel safe until i   m on a liner back to aurora .  i   m sorry i feel that way  ms .  burgess  but i do and i can   t stop shaking .  i   m frightened of this place .  if i stayed  what good could i do  hiding here in the embassy .  because i won   t set foot on a terran street .  they even killed their own representative .         please  ms .  yarick  i understand      ariel began .      no  you don   t .  have you ever been shot at .  has your life ever been threatened so immediately that you believed your next thought would be your last .  i don   t think you do understand .         how old are you  ms .  yarick .     ariel asked quietly .      what .  i  what .     yarick frowned  off balance .      how old are you .         ninety eight .         do you know that the average life expectancy on this planet is less than eighty .         i  yes  i knew that .  i   m afraid i don   t see your point .         you   ve reached nearly a hundred and this is your first brush with mortality .  these people live with it daily once they hit forty .  part of humadros   s mission might have given them some hope to change that .      after a long pause  yarick said     are you implying that my reaction lacks perspective .         perhaps .  you   re making a lot of assumptions about how little anyone else might understand .         i see .  well  that may be true  and if so then i will apologize to you once i recover my perspective enough to appreciate it .  but for now  i can   t get away from my own reactions .  i   m sorry if that   s not what you wish to hear .         i apologize if i seem insensitive     ariel said .     but i do understand .         very well .  yes  perhaps i was presumptive .         would anyone else of your staff be willing to stay .  it would help if the entire auroran legation did not abandon the mission .         the wounded are already scheduled to go up to kopernik .  i can talk to trina and gavit  but they   re as badly shaken as i am .  i do see your point  but          anything you might be able to do would help .  we can move you into the calvin institute wing   there would be a full staff of robots .  i   m asking for a gesture  an act of faith       yarick laughed dryly .     the day has used up its allotment of gestures  don   t you think .  but i promise  i   ll speak with the others .  i   ll let you know in the morning  ms .  burgess .         that   s all i ask .  thank you .      the connection broke and ariel let out a long  exasperated sigh .  sometimes her job made it difficult for her to see why she wanted it .   she tried tro aspil again  but the link remained closed .   ariel paced the length of her living room and back  and by the time she reached her bar  the whiskey was gone  and she finally felt the first intimations of sleep coming on .  she looked at the time  nearly one in the morning  and tried to ignore the knowledge of her early appointments .      time for bed     she announced to the room .   the doorbell sounded  bright and clear .      what in   .     she groaned .   impatience mounted steadily to anger as she strode toward the door .  she could think of only a couple of people in the building who might be so impolitic as to disturb her this late  but could think of no possible reason other than to bother her about what had happened today .  she thought they would know better  but after a day of dealing with the skewed reasoning of her fellow aurorans it should not surprise her that they might not .   r .  jennie was already at the door by the time ariel reached it .      it is after the hours during which ms .  burgess accepts company     r .  jennie explained through the intercom patiently .     please return in the morning .         i can   t     came a small  tight voice .     i need to see ariel now .  listen  i am ordering you  you are a robot .         i am          listen  i am ordering you          jennie     ariel said .     admit them .         but  ariel          admit them .         yes  ariel .      ariel   s nerves danced as r .  jennie opened the door .   standing in the hallway  supported by the oversized arm of an immense robot  mia daventri smiled weakly at her .      hi  ariel .  sorry to bother you so late .  can i stay here for a few days .         eight    the phylaxis group offices occupied three floors of a refurbished small industries complex in the lincoln district  just off the seventeenth corridor .  they were crowded between a modest heavy metals recovery business and a recently abandoned tailoring shop .  the air always faintly smelled of hot ozone and acid .  a small plaque by the main entrance identified the group headquarters  but they received no walk in business .  derec had put in a reception area when he had gotten the permits  but it had been a gesture  a visible symbol of what he had hoped would become more than just a promise among politicians .  as he walked through the empty front office  he doubted any of his hopes would come true .  earth would surely reject all positronics now .  and if not  the fifty worlds had no reason to try to continue relations with them .   when he entered the main lab  rana turned from her console and grinned at him proudly .  she was a compact woman  with close cropped black curls and narrow hazel eyes .     i made a duplicate     she said .     we still have an ri matrix to study .      derec stared at her  uncomprehending .     a copy .  .  .  how   .         while the transfer to their buffer was going on .  it was simple to just assign a secondary address .      derec laughed .     it   s not traceable  is it .         please  derec .  credit me with some sophistication .  i didn   t want to say anything over the com earlier  just in case .  you mentioned special service  and i just don   t trust those        they   re not that bad .          with all due respect  derec  you don   t trust them either  otherwise you wouldn   t have    forgotten    that you were on com with me when they showed up .      he sobered  thinking of the two agents arriving at the med facility  the same pair that had thrown him out of union station .  no  he did not trust them  but he doubted they had tapped his comlines .  but perhaps rana   s caution would not be a bad example to follow until they knew more .      well .  in that case     he said     make another duplicate and hide it  just in case we get an on site visit .         already working on it .          start a forensic .  there   s an isolated segment in the ri where the recorded perceptions deviate radically from reality .  we need to know how that happened .         deviated in what way .         i don   t know .  the roboticists on site told me it was a strategy game  but it looked like a full sensory hallucination .  thales .         yes  derec .     the smooth  disembodied voice of their ri answered .      i want you to run a diagnostic through union station while you   re in there .  see if you can find any irregularities in the support systems  comlines  anything that   s connected to the ri .         do you have a specific irregularity in mind  derec .         no .  .  .  the ri started playing a strategy game called coup when it went off line .  see if there   s anything about it in the regular datum files .         yes  derec .         hallucination .     rana said .     that   s impossible .         of course it is .  everyone knows positronic brains can   t hallucinate .  but this one did .  did you get hold of our attorney .         no  he   s in chicago sector .  i left a message for him to call us in the morning .  have you called anyone else about this .  we   re supposed to be doing all the troubleshooting on a positronic brain .         who would you have me call .  i tried the subcommittee  but i only spoke to vann and hajer  and they didn   t know anything about this .         what about what   s his name .     rana asked .     taprin .      derec shook his head .     he   s doubtless up to his hairline in clar   s death .  i won   t bother him unless i have to .  i   d rather talk to our lawyer  but i suppose morning will have to do .  what about this ri .  have you given it a look yet .         it   s a jumbled mess .  i already found the collapse points  but we have a major problem .      derec glanced at rana  who glared at her screen .  she stabbed at a couple of keys on her board  then sat back  sucking her lower lip under her teeth .  derec waited .      it went into nearly complete collapse once it came back online .     she jabbed a finger at the screen .     here and here you can see the recursive loops it generated while trying to cope with the situation .  they spiralled out of control as more data came available  and it reached the inescapable conclusion that it was responsible for the deaths of humans .  total first law violation .  it followed its own navel into oblivion .         no one ordered it to shut down     derec said .      evidently not .  it just didn   t occur to anyone to think to preserve whatever data the ri might have .         or they assumed that collapse meant stasis .      rana cocked an eyebrow at him .     oh  sure  just like a human mind remains orderly during a psychotic break .         well  it does  sort of .  the point is  a positronic brain isn   t a human brain  so the expectation is unrealistic .  but most people don   t know that .     derec studied the screens .     this looks worse than it should  though .  there ought to have been discreet sectors  at least .  this appeared to have no coherence at all .         you said there were two positronic specialists there .     rana said .      they were there when i arrived .  whether or not they were on watch when this happened .  .  .      the pattern on their screens resembled a collection of interference grids  moir   textures  coils  dark and light alternating rhythmically .  rana touched a spot on her screen .      what bothers me are these little loops here and here .  same sort of thing  but according to their size they never quite amounted to much  like a problem that solved itself .  now  that can theoretically happen in a positronic brain  confusion  ambiguity  indecision  all that can start a recursive loop that dissolves as soon as it finds solid footing .  but not this much  and they usually have a distinctive endpoint pattern .  these just evaporate .  .  .         it   s likely the same event could trigger several loops .         sure .         of which only one or two develop into collapse .         it depends  though  doesn   t it .         on .      rana scratched at her chin absently  eyes wide  lost in the configurations before her .  derec waited .  she had been his best student on earth .  she grasped positronics better than anyone else he had trained here  but she still had to think her way through certain concepts that seemed to come naturally to him  or for that matter any positronic specialist from a spacer world .  it was said that one needed to be raised in the discipline to be good at it  rana had proved that axiom false  but she still wrestled with it like a second language .   he wondered where kedder and hammis had gotten their training .  .  .      depends on when these loops developed     she said finally .     their location and configuration suggest that they happened earlier than these major loops .  it   s hard to tell .  chronology in a collapsed positronic matrix is as jumbled as everything else .  but if they   re earlier  then i   d like to know what triggered them .         wouldn   t it be more to the point to find out why it took itself off line to playa game .         those loops could be tied to that .      derec nodded .  it made sense .  at least he hoped it did .  he suddenly realized how very tired he was and glanced at the time chop on one of the screens .  eighteen hours since he had started the day .  rana had been up longer  but she still appeared alert and engaged .  having a problem to solve energized her .      okay     he said     you work on those .  i need to sleep .         i   ll call you .      derec stood and looked around the room .  equipment covered the walls around them .  stations for eight people  all empty but for the two chairs rana and he used  spoke of the ambitions of the group more than the reality .  of the handful of qualified roboticists on earth  phylaxis employed four .  all the other people he employed  field operatives  office personnel  and paralegals  twelve in all  were little more than eager amateurs .  this room contained facilities to keep eight roboticists busy full time  given a commensurate workload .  the treaty conference would have provided that work with a successful outcome .      i   ll be upstairs     he said  and left .   derec climbed to the small apartment he kept on the premises  his legs seeming to grow heavier .   the room contained a bed  a datum  comlink  a shower and toilet  a small closet  and its own food synthesizer .  it was only slightly larger than a decent cabin on a starship .  derec kept a bigger  better appointed apartment a few kilometers away  but he often spent his nights here  even if he had nothing to do .   he sat down on the edge of the bed and rubbed his face with the heels of his hands .   senator clar eliton  dead .  he still could not take it in .   what about our charter .  he wondered .  without eliton to champion the entire robotics cause  phylaxis could end up without a license .  not that it mattered  because without eliton the reintroduction of positronics to earth could very likely halt .      tomorrow     he told himself .      you have several messages  derec     thales told him .      list .         four from the senate select committee on machine intelligence  two from the committee on import export  one from the calvin institute          stop .  play last one .         message reads     i see you got your wish .      message ends .      derec sighed .     ariel .         the message was not signed     thales noted .      no  of course not .         would you like me to continue .         no .  store messages .  i   ll go through them .  .  .  later .      so i got my wish  he thought .  he lay back on the mattress .  what might that be .   as much as he wanted to assume otherwise  he knew she meant bogard .  they had argued bitterly over it  she rejecting the idea of tampering with the three laws at any level .  robots  she believed  should be slaves  ideal servants  with only enough self direction to interpret the inexactitudes of human commands and possibly anticipate human desires .   but to construct a robot that could circumvent one of the three laws  no matter how little or how briefly  went against everything she believed about robots .  it came too close to free will for her .   of all the things that might have driven a wedge between them  casuistry would have been the last thing derec expected .      incoming message     thales said .      from .         agent sathen  special services .      derec sat up .     accept .  agent sathen .         mr .  avery .  i hope i   m not disturbing you          no  not at all .  in fact  i just quit for the day .  how can i help you .         well  i don   t think at all  really  but i   d like you to come back to the hospital .         why .  has your agent come out of coma .         no  i   m afraid that   s not even a question anymore .     sathen paused .     her room was bombed a little while ago .  she and the robot are gone .        the scene around the entrance to the hospital reminded derec of union station not a day earlier .  emergency vehicles crowded close to the entrance  small knots of people stood around  a police line kept spectators back .  no robots  though  and no bodies lying on the pavement .   sathen stood by the nurses    station  a cup in one hand  his face expressionless for the moment .  he blinked when he saw derec and straightened .      mr .  avery  thank you .  come with me .      derec followed the agent back down the corridors which earlier had been less crowded .  an acrid stench cut through the usual medicinal odors .   the walls on either side and across from the door to agent daventri   s room were blackened .  small fixtures sagged  melted .  the ceiling showed black  too  though oddly the floor seemed clean but for a few sooty footprints .  agent sathen gestured for him to look inside .   the walls appeared covered by black flakes or the scales of a charcoal reptile .  here and there lay a mound of ash or a mass of slag .  a forensic unit hovered in the air in the center of the burnt area .  as he stood there  derec thought he could hear the walls crackle delicately  still cooling .      what about   .     he started to ask .   sathen shook his head .     we   re collecting everything that we can  but whatever it was burned hot enough to vaporize seventy  eighty percent of whatever was in there before it started to cool .  the only reason there   s still a room is because of the standard radiation shielding in the walls  but even that has been crystallized by the heat .  another second or so and this whole corridor might have been engulfed .  it was a timed charge  very expertly made .  maybe a bubble nuke .      derec backed away .  he felt himself tremble .     is there some place i can sit down .      sathen frowned  but nodded .     we can talk back here .      sathen took him to a commissary at the end of the hall .  he fetched two cups of coffee from the dispenser and set one before derec .      thanks .  sorry .  i   ve been up since .  .  .  what day is it .      sathen nodded .     i know what you mean .  thanks for coming down .      derec swallowed a mouthful of too hot coffee .  it shocked him into more wakefulness .     was anybody else hurt .         one of our agents was found strangled by the nurses    station .     sathen   s voice was edged with anger .   derec blinked at him  startled .     i   m sorry .      sathen waved a hand as if to say     never mind .         why did you ask me down .     derec asked .      i have questions about the robot .  i understand you built bogard .         yes .  look  if you   re wondering whether or not bogard did this          no  not exactly .  i   m wondering if a robot  understand  mr .  avery  i don   t know a lot about robots  i   m wondering if it   s possible for one to malfunction in such a way as to explode .  they go  what .  insane .   when they have a conflict over protecting humans .  when they get like that        no     derec said firmly .      they do operate on a small nuclear battery  right .         did you check for radiation .         yes .         and .         zero .      derec frowned .     zero .         near enough to make no difference .  a bubble nuke would eat up its own radiation in the course of the blast .  but if the robot blew up .  .  .  i didn   t know what their power supply was .  so is there any other way for it to do this .         no  agent sathen  there is not .  bogard certainly would not have strangled someone beforehand .  that would be impossible .         i never count anything as impossible  mr .  avery .         count on this .  bogard could not harm a human being .  and it had no self  destruct function .         you sound very certain .          i am .  look  bogard runs  ran  on a positronic brain .  all positronic brains are built with the three laws already encoded .  before anything else is loaded into a positronic robot  the laws are there .  they cannot harm humans or allow humans to come to harm .         but they also have to obey humans  too     sathen countered .      not if it results in harm .         bogard was different  though  wasn   t it .  a bodyguard .          no  even bogard was constrained by the three laws .  whatever happened here  bogard had nothing to do with it .     derec drank more coffee  feeling his impatience and weariness begin to turn to anger .     bogard had a slightly wider range of interpretative freedom when it came to defining harm  true  but nothing that would allow deliberate self destruction  especially if it meant killing a human at the same time .  if it had malfunctioned that severely  it  as with all positronic robots  would have simply shut down .            i see .  .  .  so it   s possible it shut down before the explosion happened  which would explain why it didn   t prevent it .         that   s .  .  .  reasonable .  but without its brain or any of its recorders  there   s no way to tell now .         recorders .         it was a security robot  after all  agent sathen .  we built in several accessory recorders not directly tied to the positronic brain .  admissible in earth courts  since you don   t allow for robotic testimony .      sathen narrowed his eyes  thoughtful .     interesting .  so  this malfunction  how likely would that be .         it wasn   t behaving according to normal operational standards when i talked to it     derec admitted .     having failed to protect senator eliton  witnessing the deaths of other humans  it was likely in the first stages of a collapse .  that   s why i told you to leave it alone .  it might have been salvageable if it weren   t pushed .  i suppose  i   m just guessing  now  that it could have continued to break down after i left .  the pathways under breakdown aren   t well understood  only the cause and effect .         so when whoever set off this charge did so  bogard may very well have been completely inert .         could very well have been .      the silence stretched then  while sathen worked through the information .  derec finished his coffee .      this agent daventri .  .  .  did you know her .     derec  asked .      hm .     sathen shook his head .     no  not very well .  she   d just been assigned to eliton   s team .  before that she worked a different district than me .  i knew about her  though .  good agent .  a little green  but we all are once or twice  eh .         i suppose so .  some of us fairly often .      sathen grinned briefly .     so  how is your investigation coming .         mine .         on the ri .         phylaxis was taken off of that .      sathen frowned .     you were .  but i thought that   s what you people do  analyze positronics .         it is and normally we would  but apparently your people decided that this time it should be handled completely internally .     derec heard the bitterness in his own voice .      that   s .  .  .  huh .     sathen gestured to derec   s cup .     more coffee .      derec peered into his empty cup  shook his head .     do you have more questions .         probably  but i suppose they can wait .  is there anything else useful you could tell me about bogard .         relating to this .  no  i don   t think so .         then  no .      derec got to his feet .     oh  you might remind your forensics people that bogard was partially constructed out of amalloy .  it has a distinctive molecular signature .         right .     sathen remained sitting .     thanks  mr .  avery .  you don   t mind if i give you a call later .         no  i   d be interested to know how this is going .     derec glanced over his shoulder  in the direction of the destroyed room .     this is crazy  isn   t it .         i haven   t seen anything like it     sathen admitted .   derec left the hospital  the muzziness of too long a day smothering his thoughts .  he let his transport carry him back to his apartment this time while he dozed along the way .   at home  he entered the darkened space  not troubling to call for the lights .  he stumbled against a chair on the way to his bed before he finally stretched out .      zero radiation .  .  .     he mumbled to himself  just before sleep took him .      nine    mia   s hand trembled with the knife as she sliced through the meat patty .  the aroma seemed better than anything she had ever smelled before .  she had not eaten since before the incident at union station and had not thought about it till ariel asked if she were hungry .      maybe i shouldn   t say this until you   re done eating     ariel said     but .  .  .  i thought you were dead .         almost     mia said around a mouthful of bread .  it was warm  fluffy .  she wondered if it were freshly made .  she did not ask  not about any of it .  she wanted to pretend for the moment that it was authentic beef  natural potatoes  garden grown greens .  more than likely it was the same processed  reconstituted  vat grown molecules everyone on earth ate except the very wealthy and powerful .  she swallowed and washed it down with milk .      bogard got me out .  i can   t go back to my apartment  it   s being watched .  i can   t go      she laughed wryly .     i can   t go anywhere .      ariel nodded slowly  the crease between her eyebrows deep with worry and puzzlement .     so you came here .  why .         because you have no reason to turn me away and no reason to turn me in .          are you a felon .         victim .         risky assumptions  though .  i   m auroran and several of my people  important people  were murdered by terrans yesterday .  people whose safety should have been guaranteed by you .  why would i now trust any terran .         that   s a good question .  i   ve been asking myself exactly the same thing .     mia tore off a piece of bread and pushed it through the sauce remaining on her plate .  she ate it slowly  not looking at ariel  and drank the last of the milk in her glass .     thank you .  now i have to ask  are you going to turn me in .      ariel frowned .     should i .         if you do  you   ll never find out who killed ambassador humadros .         you want to explain that .      carefully  mia recounted the day of the reception  the events she remembered just before the explosions  and the slaughter that followed .  she told ariel about the bizarre behavior of the robots  the chase and capture of three of the assassins .  she described how bogard had carried her from the hospital after her room was bombed .  she spoke in an even tone of voice  choosing her words precisely  the way she would if giving an oral report on an assignment  as if it had happened to someone else and she was only the investigator .  the habit of training and experience helped  kept the fear at arm   s length  got her through the entire recitation without a break or a tremor .      there are several unanswered questions     she said .     several dozen  actually .  but the big ones  who were the assailants  how did they get in through security  where did they get their weapons .   those can be confronted directly .  unfortunately  some of the answers may lead to questions just as large that can   t be directly confronted .  my conclusion is  has to be  that someone inside the service is involved .  they knew about bogard  they knew where i was  they knew the only way to get me was the method they used because bogard could defend against anything else .  but they were also eliminating witnesses .  they wanted bogard gone  too .  besides  i can think of no other way security at union station could have been compromised so badly .  there has to be an insider .         how do you explain the behavior of the ri .     ariel asked .      i don   t .  which brings me to you .  you have a degree from the calvin institute  your specialty is robotics          i   m a bureaucrat            and you   re embassy staff with a stake in what happened .  i think you want to know as badly as i do .  plus  you want to know that it won   t happen again .         you   re still assuming .         and you   re not throwing me out .      ariel smiled faintly .     i have some expertise in robotics  true  but that doesn   t mean i can solve this for you .  for all i know  i won   t even be allowed near that system .  besides  there   s already someone who has probably been called in to do that .  still .  .  .  assuming you   re right and there   s an insider  that means that any investigation will be hampered  crippled  or blocked completely .         exactly .         but that also means you can   t do anything  either .         not exactly .      ariel shrugged .     as an auroran  there   s not much i can do .         you   re being modest     mia said .     as a member of the auroran embassy mission  you have a primary interest in this investigation .  you can make noise  embarrass people  harass them .     she smiled .     all things you enjoy .         now you   re being facetious .      mia shrugged .     do you remember when we met .         four years ago  kopernik station .  the day i arrived to take a job with the auroran trade section .         i was new on the job then  freshly certified  right out of the academy .         and the reason they assigned you to the duty was your high tolerance for open spaces .      mia smiled .     they assumed that included outer space  too  so i spent two hours    shuttle time with my eyes shut and my fingers clamped tight around my seat  not daring to look out the port .         you were in charge of security on our baggage            and you weren   t going to let me inspect your personal luggage            and you weren   t going to let my bags off kopernik without a thorough inspection            and you weren   t going to let a human do it .      ariel was laughing .     i   d met some stubborn people before that  but you were the most        after you  that is .      ariel nodded .     yes .  after me .         but i wasn   t unreasonable  was i .         no .  you asked what kind of inspection would satisfy me  and i said only a robotic inspection .  you agreed .  surprised the hell out of me .      mia nodded .     so we dragged some poor domestic from the auroran section of the station over to do the inspection .  i told it what specifically i wanted to know about  you validated my instructions  and everything else was kept confidential .         i wasn   t used to terrans understanding anything about positronic robots .  i   m still surprised when i find one that does .         i trusted you .      ariel raised an eyebrow .     you trusted the robot .         but i had to believe the claims for them  which meant i had to believe you .      ariel gave her a sober  assessing look  nodding slowly .     yes .  you trusted me .         it could have meant my career if you   d deceived me .         it could have meant your career if you hadn   t compromised .         and you had to trust me that i   d abide by the robot   s findings .      after a pause  ariel sighed .     we trust each other .  then and  i suppose  now .  is that your point .         that   s my hope .      ariel   s gaze shifted to a point past mia   s left shoulder .     and that .      mia turned her head to look at bogard  standing immobile at the archway between the foyer and the spacious living room .  ariel   s robot  jennie  stood nearby  waiting .      bogard .  what about it .         that   s the bodyguard  isn   t it .         yes .         why do you have it .     ariel asked .      i   m its primary duty right now     mia replied .     i had to transfer its priority from senator eliton to me to keep it from freezing up .  bogard was close to .  .  .  what do you call it .  positronic collapse .         i imagine so .  it failed .  why is it still functioning .         because       ariel shook her head .     that shouldn   t matter .  a human died that it was supposed to protect .  you can   t conveniently tell a positronic robot to forget about one set of duties and take up a new set to keep it from collapsing .         you can with bogard .      ariel looked unhappy .     i don   t like it .  but i suppose it has to stay with you .         bogard has all the data concerning the assault .  there are things i didn   t see  couldn   t see  and most of the others who could provide reliable information seem to be dead now .  besides  i   m not exactly in any condition to defend myself at the moment .  i need bogard .         you trust it .      mia shrugged .     for now .         i   ll reserve my judgment .     ariel stared unhappily at the robot .  mia did not understand her reaction  she seemed almost afraid of it .  then ariel shook her head and looked at mia .     but you have a point about the data it has  it might be useful .     she turned to her own robot .     jennie  prepare the terran guest room for mia .  and check my itinerary .  cancel any guests i had scheduled for the next ten days .         yes  ariel .     the robot moved quickly from the room .   ariel pointed a finger at mia .     i want you to make it clear to bogard that i am now part of its responsibility .  i don   t want it misinterpreting anything i do as a threat to you .  how long before you   re back up on your feet .         a few days maybe .  a week at most .  if i had some medical attention  maybe sooner          i   ll take care of that later today .     ariel stood .     i   m exhausted and i need to think .  not a good combination .  make yourself at home .  we   ll talk in the morning .      mia reached out and caught ariel   s hand as she walked by .     thank you  ariel .      ariel hesitated  then returned a squeeze .     get some sleep .  you   ll be safe here for the time being .        mia sat propped up in bed in the half light from a dimmed bedside lamp  knowing she should sleep and unable to slow the cascade of thoughts .  she had dozed so much during bogard   s journey through the warrens that while she did not feel rested  she did not feel sleepy .   ariel had given her the guest room with no windows  for which she was grateful .  she had fewer problems with open air and unceilinged sky than most terrans  and given time she could manage to overcome those reservations and minor fears she did possess .  but tonight  after everything else  trying to sleep with a window looking out over the roof of d .  c .  would be difficult .   a reader lay beside the lamp on the nightstand  a stack of book inserts with it .  ten pages into something light or dull and she would be asleep  she knew  but she was reluctant .  for that matter she could ask bogard to tranquilize her .   the robot had inspected the entire apartment  much to ariel   s dismay .  it now stood near mia   s door  on standby  satisfied for the time being that mia was safe .  and for the moment  mia did feel safe .  her anxiety came from different concerns .   she opened her datum and sorted through a few files .  here  laid up like this  there seemed little she could do .  but she knew better than that  her limitations were illusory  borne of her own anxiety of being unable to move easily .  she could do a lot just tracking things through datapools .   for instance  she realized  staring at a list of names on the small screen  like sorting the possible sources for certain items like the weapons .  she read down the short column of names of illicit arms dealers .  most of them dealt primarily in the collector   s trade .  a wealth of ancient weapons changed hands among certain rich clientele for private collections  illegal but hidden from sight  almost untraceable .  authorities knew who the collectors were  mostly  but not what they possessed .  where once some of these dealers would only have made money in selling in quantity  now they made good livings on the premiums received for one or two rare items a year .   but a couple of them still trafficked in arms the old fashioned way .  for the most part  it was an offworld trade .  sales to settler colonies  banned by treaty with spacer worlds  flourished  and the government frankly looked the other way .  sentiment lay with the settlers and if they argued that the weapons were needed for local fauna or law enforcement  that was reasonable  no .  the problem was the sources for such weapons .  small factories and jobshops operated allover the globe  and a few on the moon  and there was one large facility on mars .  any of them could turn out one or one thousand of almost any weapon .   the guns used at union station were archaic but effective .  projectile weapons .  mia did not know the type  but judging from the wounds she had seen  a fairly large caliber .  even had the ri been functioning properly  energy damping fields would have had no effect on them .   of all the names on her screen  two dealers were the likeliest to provide such arms .  one was rumored to own his own factories .  it seemed logical to concentrate on that one  especially since time was short  kynig parapoyos .   the problem with him was that his existence was more myth than reality .  was there an actual person named kynig parapoyos .  there had been at one time  but from the talk mia had heard at the academy and among the more seasoned agents  he had been around almost too long to be real anymore .  so it was probable that kynig parapoyos was an organization rather than a specific individual .  no matter .  parapoyos  whether one or a hundred  was a real entity that dealt in almost anything black market  and had made a fortune on the arms trade offworld .   so  she needed to buy a weapon .  that was the easiest way to contact an illicit arms dealer .   then  too  she did have real names to track  the names she had heard over the com bogard had tapped at union station .  bok and lemus .  first names  certainly  and harder to hunt down  but better than nothing .  the assault had gone down expertly .  that narrowed the field marginally .  they had moved like ex military .  she could start a search for matches with those parameters .   she closed the datum for the night .      bogard .         yes  mia .     its optical array glowed brighter at once .      i   d like to receive your report now .      the robot shifted from near the door to alongside her bed in the fluid motion that always awed and disturbed her .      specify     it said .      relate events from entry to union station to present .     bogard seemed to hesitate  then began speaking in a calm  evenly modulated voice  starting with their arrival in eliton   s limousine .   mia listened to the recitation  eyes closed  imagining the scene as bogard related the detail at length .  the crowds  the security  the shouted anti spacer and anti robot slogans  the expanse of the station proper  the assembled dignitaries  the arrival of the auroran legation     stop .     she looked up at bogard .     go back .  repeat from phrase    several explosions occurred    and continue .         several explosions occurred  do you require a specific number .         no .  continue .           at which time my defense priority changed from potential to full prophylactic .  a number of individuals emerged from the crowd surrounding the platform  armed with projectile weapons  and began firing upon the humans gathered on the platform .  several humans were injured .  agent daventri asserted priority  ordered me to discontinue uplink with resident intelligence  and commanded that i render aid in tracking and capturing one or more of the assassins          stop .  review .  why have you left out detail .         specify .      mia pushed herself up straighter in bed .     you enshielded senator eliton .  you left that out .         i have no record of that action .         you attempted to enshield ambassador humadros .  you left that out .         i have no record of that action .      mia frowned .     review elapsed time starting from the explosions to the point at which i requested your assistance .         forty six seconds .         what occurred during those forty six seconds .      bogard hesitated .  mia waited  breathing shallowly .      humans were injured     bogard stated simply .      detail .         i  there is no detail .  i have no record          stop .  run diagnostic .         global .         no  specifically on memory .      bogard remained silent for a few seconds .      all memory systems complete and operational .         you register no gaps .             no .      mia scowled  annoyed and a little frightened .     bogard  there is a significant amount of detail you are not reporting .  review the time segment previously specified and analyze .      silence .  then     i show no discrepancy .      mia started to tell bogard  but its prior hesitation when confronted with only part of the information made her pause .  she knew a little about what the roboticists called    positronic breakdown     but not enough .  she lacked the expertise to examine bogard any further  but the gap in bogard   s report disturbed her .   bogard did not remember senator eliton dying .  should she tell it .  what would happen to it if she forced it to confront the deaths of two humans it had attempted to protect .  she remembered its near collapse in the hospital and  earlier  its apparent relief at having her override its priorities in union station .  she simply did not know enough .      do you wish me to continue the report .     bogard asked .   mia started .     oh .  no  bogard .  that   s enough tonight .  i need sleep .         i will be here .         one more thing  bogard .  can you identify the type of projectile weapons used .         not at present .  i have a reliable image and can do a database search and match .         good .  initiate search .  thank you .         you are welcome .      she stared at bogard until she could no longer stay awake .  there were already too many questions to puzzle through and  she imagined  too little time .  to have bogard become one of those questions .  .  .  too much  too soon .   sleep was welcome .     initiate internal diagnostic relevant to interrogatory command  specify corrupted sequencing  analyze potential third law violation  buffer nodes p seven and

   ten    derec found rana asleep on the cot in the cafeteria  one arm draped over her eyes  the other hanging to the floor .  he did not know how long ago she had given herself up to sleep  so he left her alone .  he poured himself a coffee and returned to the main lab .   details .  he scrolled through the reports filed sometime in the early morning hours by his field techs .   twenty six of union station   s robots had gone into complete positronic collapse  all those that had been present in the gallery when the shooting began .  the rest seemed relatively unaffected  although complete diagnostics could not be finished due to the team   s ejection from the site by special service .   a request for a tech to help an acrisian with a domestic problem .  one of her servors had evidently been given a conflicting command and sent it into a dilemma loop .  she suspected one of the workers from d .  c .  urban maintenance had done it  though she could not prove it .  she wanted her robot fixed and evidence to take to the local police when she filed a complaint .   derec sighed .  robotic affidavits were not allowed in terran courts  the police would  at best  take her report and then do nothing with it  humoring the spacer .  at worst  the robot would be confiscated as contraband .  positronic robots were allowed only in embassy areas and one or two other specially designated spacer zones .  how these people got humaniform positronic robots past customs baffled derec .  nevertheless  he entered authorization to send a field tech to her residence  which was just outside the embassy district  on the coast .  acrisia   s oceans nearly dwarfed earth   s  so it made sense to him that acrisians would try to be near something homelike  but he still wished the spacers would stick to their enclaves if they insisted on keeping robots .   he found a thank you on his com from agent sathen for his help at the hospital  sathen   s personal com code appended .  derec filed that .   he was tempted to call more people in government to try to get past the special service restrictions  but the only one who might help would be eliton   s vice senator  now senator  jonis taprin  and derec doubted he would be available yet  what with all the details eliton   s death must have dropped on him .  perhaps later  though he doubted it would do much good .  derec shuddered at the idea of untrained people teasing through the tatters of a positronic brain .  he called his lawyer again  but the man was still in chicago sector .   he went to rana   s console and sat down .   her screens displayed the bizarre patterns she had shown him the night before .  he sat down and leaned on the console  tracing the mazelike coils .  they still seemed familiar  though he could not identify them or recall the context .  rana was right   they ought to have had solid endpoints  clear resolutions  but they simply faded out like the paths of excited quarks on a particle analysis chart .  the equivalent in human brains would be the degenerative pattern of a memory disorder or cognitive disfunction .  .  .   derec sat up stiffly .  no  there was a closer resemblance .  he stared at the patterns now  almost unwilling to admit what he saw .  he moved to another screen and accessed the specifications on bogard .  after sifting through a number of levels  he found what he wanted .      damn     he hissed .          morning     rana said  stumbling into the room .  she carried a cup of coffee .      take a look at this     derec said  scooting back from the console to give her room .   rana leaned toward the screen with bogard   s specs .  she frowned .     what   .         those are the pathway tracks for the temporal buffers we built into bogard .      rana looked back at the ri display on her own screens  then again at these patterns .     damn .         i thought those trails looked familiar     derec said enthusiastically .  he stood and clapped his hands .     i was exhausted last night  that   s why i couldn   t see it .         they aren   t identical .      derec looked at the bogard screen .  the pathways that showed the track of positronic activity from one part of bogard   s system into another did not coil so tightly nor fade out in quite the same way .  instead  the loops and tangles doubled back on themselves a couple of times  then traced direct paths out of the main positronic matrix  through a clear demarcation point  ending sharply with the exit of the track .      no     derec conceded     but the similarities are too great to deny .      rana sat down .     but bogard   s a prototype .  none of these specs are in any other database than our own .      derec rose from his seat and shrugged .     parallel research .         on whose part .  the union station ri is a standard positronic brain  installed by the good people of the calvin institute .  part of the agreement for it was that it would be a conservative  basic model .  and even if they knew about our upgrades  they   d think it was heresy and would have nothing to do with it .     rana glanced at her screen .     besides  they aren   t identical .  bogard   s pathways don   t just fade like this  they end .  they have a destination and a gateway to it .         because they feed into a symbiotic system riding alongside the main one .  there   s only one place for the trace to go .  there   s access back and forth across the boundary  sure  but the way the trace is generated            is pretty much the same .  which means that  what .  three law violations in a standard positronic brain are being shunted  where .  outside the system .      derec paced briefly .     possibly  but i doubt it .  if that were the case  then the ri shouldn   t have collapsed .  my guess is this is a sensory diversion .         sensory .  .  .         the ri was playing a game .         which implies a malfunction     rana said .      yes  but where .  what if it thought the game was real .         how .  that would mean that its entire sensory net        was subverted .  its ability to perceive reality had been altered  so that something else became the operative reality .  when it came back online it must have realized what had happened .         but not while it was playing the game .      derec shrugged .     evidently not .      rana frowned .     look  we built bogard to shunt memory like this .  the only way for a standard positronic brain to exhibit this is for an external system to be grafted onto it .  that would show up as interference in major operational areas .         that should be easy enough to find     derec said .      but i haven   t found any .         did you look .      rana paused .     no  not specifically .  but it would be obvious  even as badly jumbled as this is .         maybe .  maybe only if we look at it the right way .  you   ve been trying to figure out what   s been happening to the ri brain given the assumption that it   s an unmodified unit and therefore self contained .  not to mention something this radical  i mean  think about it .  at a crucial moment  the entire ri absented itself from what was happening in the terminal to playa game .  that much of a modification  that much interference  it would have to be enormous and it would have to be something .  .  .         what .         it would have to be something laid in over time  otherwise it would trigger alarms  cause shutdowns .  minor crises would be the rule .  .  .         so it might not be so obvious .         no  but it would still be big just to get around the normal self correcting routines     derec explained .     did we get its operational records for the past  oh  how long has it been online .  a year .         almost two .  we did  but i   m not inclined to trust them .         why not .      rana gestured at the screen .     nothing we   ve seen here is as it should be .         good point .  but that   s only if you rely on the ri   s own report .         i don   t think i   d trust a report made by terrans .         you   re terran     derec pointed out .      an accident of birth .     rana waved a hand dismissively .     i claim special circumstances .      derec laughed .     bring it up anyway     he said .   he went to the com and tapped in the code for union station .  after going through a short maze of addresses  he finally connected with tathis kedder .      mr .  avery     kedder said  bemused .     i didn   t expect to hear from you again after  well  after .         i take a personal pride in my work     derec said .     just because i   m told it   s no longer my business  that doesn   t mean i stop worrying about it .      kedder smiled  nodding .     i know what you mean .  how can i help you .         just your recollections .  do you remember any instances of inexplicable interruptions in service from the ri .  or periods when it seemed sluggish or .  .  .  uncooperative .      kedder shook his head .     never uncooperative .  apologetic a couple of times .         apologetic .         yes  it glitched   the one i remember best was a luggage mix up  and it apologized profusely  as if the world might end .     kedder paused .     let me think .  .  .  one other time the whole kitchen component seized up .  that lasted about ten minutes  then seemed to correct itself .         and the ri apologized again .     derec asked .      most sincerely .         and you didn   t report it .      kedder frowned .     of course we did .  to the shift supervisor  who took it to the calvin institute .         the calvin institute .  why not here .      kedder shrugged .     i don   t know .  i thought we were supposed to go through you  but the supervisor said no .         and what did the calvin institute say .         adjustment errors .  nothing important enough to bring you in .         i see .  did the calvin institute give that recommendation .         that was my understanding .         which supervisor was this .  i   d like to talk to him .      kedder shook his head .     he   s gone  oh  about ten months ago .         where  if i may ask .         new job .  he went to work for .  .  .  let me think .  .  .  oh  yes  imbitek .         do you remember his name .         hob larkin .      derec scratched his chin thoughtfully .     any other    adjustment errors    that you can think on        a couple of times requested data got routed to the wrong place .  it lost one of my reports once  i had to redraft the whole thing .  little stuff like that .  but that was all early on .  in the last  oh  year it   s been behaving perfectly .         until the other day .         yes .      derec sighed .     thank you  mr .  kedder .  if you think of anything else  let me know  would you .         sure .         how are things going .         well  we   ve had imbitek people in here all morning .      derec raised an eyebrow .     imbitek .         yes .  the decision was made to convert over to nonpositronic systems .  we already had some of imbitek   s imbedded systems in place  so .  .  .  sorry .         hm .  that was fast .         not fast enough for management .     kedder smiled wryly .     a lot of pilots won   t use us till the changeover is made  they just don   t trust positronics anymore .  not the spacers  of course  they   re complaining for just the opposite reason  threatening not to come through here if we do switch to a nonpositronic system .  it   s turned into as big a problem as it would be if we didn   t have a system at all .  do you have any idea how much traffic goes through here in a day .         of course     derec replied .     i just meant the selection of a new vendor .  bureaucracy doesn   t usually move that quickly .         fortunately  this time was an exception .         well  i   m glad something   s going right for you .         how about you .  how   s your investigation coming .         did you forget .  phylaxis was taken off that .      kedder looked confused for a moment .     oh .  yes  i          this was purely personal .  thanks  mr .  kedder .  oh  by the way  could i speak with your associate  mr .  hammis .         he hasn   t come in yet .  normally we aren   t on shift together  just yesterday was .  .  .         ah .  i see .         i can tell him you called .         would you .  just some routine stuff .         sure .         thank you .     derec closed the connection .      don   t feel too bad     rana said .     imbitek has something like sixty percent of earth   s robotics market .         only don   t ever call it that to their face .  it   s    imbedded service technologies    .     derec steepled his fingers below his chin  staring unseeing at the blank com screen .     who at the calvin institute would issue instructions for them to bypass the contract service    .      the company that had installed the ri had been solarian  not auroran  but there had had to be a calvin representative to oversee it .  who had that been .  derec tapped the request in the datum .   bys randic .  he remembered her  but she had rotated back to aurora several months ago .  the company itself had been a midsized firm  not a bad choice  but certainly not the first that would have recommended itself to derec .  the byzantine complications of the terran bidding process still baffled him  certainly there had been better firms  but the traditions of earther government procurement could not be circumvented by straightforward spacer logic .  but he had been there during the entire operation as well and audited the process .  eliton had seen to that  since it came under his committee   s oversight .  other companies  mostly terran  had installed the satellite systems  but the calvin institute rep had vetted the interfaces and pronounced them acceptable .  who  along that striated line of involved parties  could have overridden such a vital part of the process .   he punched another code into the terminal .     imbitek corporation  how may i direct your call .     said a synthetic voice  ungendered and inoffensive .      i   d like to speak to the manager in charge of the refit at union station .      derec waited while the ai system rolled the request around for a few seconds and decided what to do with it .  finally  it said     one moment  please  while i connect you .      the moment became nearly a minute before a human voice  male  answered .      this iva kusk .  how can i help you .         this is derec avery of the phylaxis group  mr .  kusk .  i understand that imbitek is installing new systems into union station .         phylaxis .  .  .  ah  the robot people .  yes  we are .  it   s my understanding that you   ve been removed from the project .         that remains to be seen  sir .  we have a contract to service the ri          which is no longer functioning  am i correct .     kusk interjected .      well          imbitek received an exclusive contract pursuant to the failure of the current system .  it   s my understanding that the ri suffered total collapse .  under those circumstances  you have nothing to service .         the positronics still need to be removed .  i ought to oversee that  at least     derec countered .      we   re not removing it  the solarians are .  take it up with them .  as far as imbitek is concerned  you have nothing to concern yourself with .         nevertheless          nevertheless  mr .  avery     kusk said sharply     i think you know that we shouldn   t even be discussing this matter .  sorry i can   t be of more help  but when special service lays down the law  we   re not inclined to go around them .  so  if there   s nothing else .  .  .         should you find yourself running into difficulties with some of those systems  mr .  kusk  consider giving us a call before you destroy something you can   t replace .         thank you  mr .  avery     kusk said smugly .     we   ll take that under advisement .      the connection died .      high marks for sincerity     rana said .     demerits for tact .      derec ignored her and called imbitek back .  he got the directory and asked to speak to hob larkin .      hob larkin no longer works for our firm     the ai informed him .     due to privacy restrictions we may not provide any other information .      derec broke the connection and tapped yet another code .  the emblem of the terran senate appeared on the screen .  a moment later  a secretary took its place .      senator clar eliton   s office .  may i help you .      derec noticed that her voice was strained  as if under firm control .     i   d like to speak to jonis taprin  please .  this is derec avery of the phylaxis group .         i   ll see if vice senator  senator taprin is available .  please hold .      derec watched the time chop above the screen .  the secretary reappeared after nearly a full minute .      i   m sorry  mr .  avery  but senator taprin is in a meeting .  may i direct you to one of his aides .         no  thank you .  please have him call me at his earliest convenience .  it   s important .  it concerns union station .         i   ll let him know .      the screen blanked .      he   s going to be tied up in meetings from now till the election     rana said .   derec nodded .     he   s got a big vacuum to fill .         why don   t you just call the calvin institute .         not yet .     he returned to her console .      do i detect a hint of personal aversion .         not a bit .  what are you doing .      rana gave him a skeptical look  then pointed at her screen .     an excavation .  i   m matching layers to see if anything turns up .      derec shuddered at the idea .  the ri was scrambled from the collapse .  whole segments of it no longer    lined up    to form a functional matrix .  what rana was attempting to do made random chance seem predictable by comparison .      that could take days .          thales is doing the gross sorting for me .          still .  .  .         uh huh .  do you have a better idea .      derec slid his chair to his own console and began entering commands .     as a matter of fact  no .  but maybe one just as good .  we can narrow it down by isolating out all other possible intrusive presences .  a lot of com traffic goes through this thing        but most of it is buffered to avoid direct contamination of the positronic matrix     rana concluded .      of course it is .  so anything that got past that          would be worth a look .  of course .  what about the ri performance record .         save it .  i   ll look it over later .      derec set up parameters for each type of communications link that the ri dealt with  regular com  systems interfaces with incoming shuttles  dialogues with maintenance drones  hotels  requisitions vendors  banks  security protocols with the various police services  subetheric links  interstellar traffic  interfaces with nonpositronic systems  and its own relays with its various service components .  after establishing a firewall between the subject ri and thales  he let the group ri do the actual sorting  which took much less time than any other method .  while the lists compiled  he wrote an instruction to search for mirror sites once everything was in a manageable state  looking for match points with the unexplained pathways rana had found .   they worked in silence for nearly three hours .  the amount of data to go through remained immense and intimidating  but derec sensed progress .   the com chimed behind him .  he looked over his shoulder and saw that vice senator  now senator  taprin was returning his call .   he punched accept .      mr .  avery  how are you .  how can i help .         i   m fine  sir  if a little confused .  there are a couple of matters i hope you can help me clear up .  phylaxis was taken off the investigation .  i don   t know if you were aware of that .      taprin frowned .     no  but i don   t keep that close tabs on what you do .  frankly  clar tended to be very proprietary about the entire positronic issue .      issue .  .  .  .  derec thought .     special service assumed jurisdiction over the entire investigation  which is certainly their prerogative .  but it    is unorthodox .  i   m not aware that they have any positronic specialists on staff .         i didn   t think they did  which was one reason to use you     taprin said .     i   ll look into it .         thank you  sir .  the other matter has to do with protocol regarding the union station ri .  i   ve learned that someone gave directions shortly after it was installed that certain problems with the ri were to be referred directly to the calvin institute rather than us .  i wondered if you could find out who issued that directive .         i can look into it  but my authority stops at the auroran embassy door .  you could ask them yourself .         i   d rather it came from a more official source .         i see .         besides  the staff at union station wouldn   t be under auroran authority .  whoever issued that directive had to have terran authority .         true .  now that i think about it  it is odd .  i   ll see what i can find out for you .  it might take some time .  i   m swamped .         whatever you can give me  sir  i   d appreciate it .         if  as you say  special service has removed you from the investigation  why are you interested .      the question surprised derec .  he hesitated uncertainly .     well .  .  .  i think we   d all like to know what went wrong  senator .  i thought you   d appreciate the input .  besides  i think this pertains directly to the future of phylaxis .  but beyond that  it seems pertinent to senator eliton   s work .      tarpin nodded slowly .     mmm .  very true .  i   ll see .          thank you .      the screen went blank  leaving derec with an odd  displaced feeling .   why am i interested .      we have something matching up     rana said .   derec hurried back to the console .  on the main screen  columns lined up .  as he watched  lines from each became highlighted  then isolated to another window .      maintenance .  .  .     derec read aloud .     maintenance .  .  .  maintenance .  .  .  maintenance .  .  .  all the exit pathways are mirroring to maintenance communications .         that   s what it   s looking like .  but the signals are not transmitted .         what do you mean .         i mean they are strings of code going through the ri and routed back to the relevant site     rana explained .     they   re one to one .  something at the pathway site is injecting code directly .      derec stared at the configurations on her screens .     there   s no routing .  .  .  no buffer .  .  .  .  it   s as if something is directly attached to the physical node .      .      doesn   t make sense  i know  but that   s what it   s showing .         we have to get in there and look at these components .      rana laughed sharply .     before imbitek rips them out .  good luck .      derec drummed his fingers .     they can   t .  the calvin institute has to supervise removal of the positronic components  satellite systems and all .      rana pursed her lips  but said nothing .   derec rapped his knuckles impatiently on the console and headed back to the comlink .     and so should we .     he punched in a code .      calvin institute .  how may i direct your call .         i want to speak to .  .  .     he hesitated  licked his lips  and sighed heavily .     i wish to speak to ariel burgess  please .  tell her it   s derec avery from the phylaxis group .         eleven    ariel got out of bed with the feeling that something was not right .  perhaps it was only that she had gotten five hours of sleep .   she found mia in the living room  occupying one of the oversized sofas .  her portable datum propped on her lap  a cup of coffee on the end table  and various disks scattered on the pillow beside her  she looked more like a business traveller than a government agent .  ariel was larger than mia  and the borrowed robe seemed to swallow the smaller woman .   the picture window was milky white  allowing in morning light but not the view .      good morning  ariel     r .  jennie said  trundling in with a tray of breakfast .         morning    jennie .      mia looked up and smiled briefly .     hi .         you look better     ariel said .     how do you feel .     she glanced around the room until she found bogard  halfway between mia and the door  standing against the wall .  it seemed somehow shrunken now  not nearly as imposing as the previous night .      rested     mia said .  she winced slightly .     sore .  my treatments weren   t finished .      r .  jennie set the tray on the breakfast table by the window .  ariel thought about moving it to the coffee table before mia  but it was not too far away .  and bogard still made her a little nervous .   ariel sat down and lifted the cover from her eggs and hamsteak .     i   ll make the call to take care of that after i eat .  what are you going to do afterward .         after what .         after you   re healed .         that   s what i   m trying to decide .  i can   t very well hide out here for the rest of my life .  and i doubt you could get me an open passport to aurora .         you might be surprised what i can get you .      mia raised her eyebrows  but said nothing .  she tapped the keypad on her datum for a few minutes while ariel carved her ham and drank down half her cup of coffee .  ariel wondered if she should have jennie prepare a large carafe for the day .   mia sighed heavily  then set the datum aside .  she rubbed her face  then folded her arms .     i can   t run .  if i do  we   ll never find out who did this .         the media are all blaming the managins .         that might be partly true     mia said .     i think it was managins that actually did the killing .  i   ve started a search protocol on a couple of names that might be relevant and one of them came up within seconds  lemus milmor .  he   s a known affiliate of osma  the order for the supremacy of man again .  he   s in our database under a    to be watched    flag because he was rejected by a settler   s group for assaulting two people .      mia shook her head .     still .  the managins are a large faction  true .  lot of members  broad base .  but to subvert the security systems in a place like union station .  and get all those people and all those weapons in without being detected at some point .  and then to put me under surveillance and try to kill me .  no .  they have the motive but not the resources .  not on their own .         there are other factions .         i   ve been going through the list     mia said  gesturing at the datum .  she grabbed her cup and cradled it .     terrafirst  primists  the hla  the fraternity of organic supremacy  if you take bits and pieces of several of them  you might get an effective team together that could attempt something like this .  but they hate each other almost as much as they hate spacers and robots .     mia frowned .     sorry .         for what .  are you a member of any of these organizations .         no .  .  .  well  maybe .  the largest faction would have to be the terran government .         but you don   t go around killing spacers to prove your point .  forget it .     ariel shrugged .     any other candidates on your list .         there   s been corporate resistance to these talks all along .         positronics is a threat to homegrown industry .  at least  they see it that way .  we   re not so optimistic .         what do you mean .         it   s spacer belief  an article of faith  that earth will never allow positronics again .  some of us don   t believe that   s an absolute  after all  we got a resident intelligence installed at one of your largest spaceports  but we doubt earth will ever embrace our robots to any great degree .  positronics will always be a small presence here .         so what was this conference supposed to be about .     mia asked .      spacer technology is highly advanced  some of it very far advanced over what   s available on earth .  earth would love to have some of it like our medical tech  but earth is afraid that opening the gates just a little will let all of it  including positronics  in .  for our part  spacers are worried about competition from some of your technologies that we find impressive .          like what .      ariel ticked the list off with her fingers .     transportation systems  automated databases  imbedded technologies  quasi organic biomechanisms .  but mainly mass manufacturing systems .  earth has a long history of production engineering that even with all we   ve done we can   t quite match .  frankly  i find the terran aversion to positronics puzzling considering some of the things your people play with daily .  anyway  there   s fear of open trade both ways .  underlying commercial concerns  there   s fear of cultural contamination .  but the main deal is the black market .  ever since the tiberius incident  earth has been treading very carefully .  we almost went to war over that .         if you hadn   t backed down      mia began .      if you hadn   t found contraband  you mean .  it   s very difficult to claim injury when the other fellow is right .         as far as earth is concerned  that was still an illegal act  boarding the tiberius .         but rather than go to war  you listened to eliton .     ariel heard the edge of impatience in her own voice .  mia did not respond  obviously waiting for her friend to calm down .   ariel cleared her throat .     this conference was supposed to start a process of .  .  .  well  of demystifcation between us .  a start at debunking some of the erroneous beliefs and tearing down prejudices .  without that process  controlling the illegalities that proliferate between us will never be possible and one of these days we will go to war .  some of us don   t think either earth or the spacer worlds can survive without each other .  at best  though  positronics would always be a token presence  but a way of teaching terrans not to fear us .         that   s all shot to hell .         maybe .  i   ve been doing a lot of damage control .  but the heart and soul of the conference is  might be  an agreement to allow positronic inspection of all traffic between spacer worlds and earth .  we believe the piracies are a front for black marketeering .  the tiberius supports that belief .         on whose part .     mia asked .      both sides .  you can   t sell contraband without a market .         collusion between legitimate corporations and pirates .         or pirates in the pay of those corporations .  either way  humans can be bribed .  robots can   t .      mia shook her head in wonder .     the newsnets had been going on for months over the proposal for all robotic inspections of interstellar freighters .  that would have been a miracle .         maybe .  just short of getting earthers to accept positronics .      mia laughed bitterly .     the union station ri was a positronic system .  it failed .  that   s going to be a hard fact to get past .      ariel covered her reactions with a forkful of egg .  the resident intelligence at union station should not have permitted the catastrophe .  there were ample security systems tied into it  it had the capacity and the imperatives to prevent harm to humans .  but mia was right  it had failed .  she was right  too  that it would be a difficult wall to break down .  anyone wishing to derail the conference and any future conference could not have wished for a more perfect event .  with all the other problems  it may well have made the situation impossible .   but why had the ri failed .  it made no sense .  ariel wondered what derec   s phylaxis group had found out .  she glanced at her com  but quashed the impulse to call him .  she looked over at bogard against the wall  it had failed  too  even with its vaunted    versatility    in interpreting three law conditions .  that was derec   s concept  his design .   his failure .     mia tensed when the medical robot showed up  but made herself relax and allow it to treat her .      you should be in hospital     the robot informed her .      treat her here     ariel said .     strictest confidentiality .         confidentiality will be respected unless such treatment places the subject at risk     the robot informed her .      understood .  proceed .  do you want me to stay  mia .      mia shook her head .     no  i   m fine .  you have things to do .         in that case  anything you need  ask jennie .  if you have to contact me  do so through her .      mia nodded  watching the medical robot examine her leg .   ariel approached bogard .     you will not admit anyone except me unless you receive an explicit command otherwise .         coded .         i will say .  .  .     ariel paused .  what would she say that would identify her .  she wondered if she were being a little too paranoid .  she glanced at mia on the sofa and decided that too much might be just enough .     i will say    avernus in perihelion    and you will match my voice pattern .         i understand .  what are your instructions regarding the visiting robot .         log its identification .  admit no other without my authorization .         i understand .  have a pleasant day  ms .  burgess .      ariel left her apartment with a shudder of relief  as if she had just escaped .  bogard made her anxious and she resented that .  no robot should cause ill ease in a human .  she wondered at mia   s evident trust in it .  perhaps it took a terran to come to terms with such a mechanism .   and it had saved her life .  .  .   at the end of a short hallway  ariel boarded a tube .     embassy level e     she told the mechanism .  several seconds later  she stepped out of the transport into the lobby of her department .   a vaguely humaniform robot occupied the small reception desk .  few terrans ever came here .  hofton  ariel   s aide  leaned over its shoulder  watching something on its screen .  hofton looked up briefly and nodded  then gave a quick instruction to the robot .      ariel     he said  moving to open her office door for her     it   s already shaping up to be one of    those days    .         i thought it would .     she entered her office and immediately switched on the subetheric .     who called first .         they all called at the same time .  i was tempted to draw straws to see who i answered first .  i decided etiquette demanded it be setaris .  she wants to talk to you  though   she wouldn   t discuss anything with me .  next was gale chassik from the solarian embassy .  he wants to know the official position of the auroran business community .  i told him we were officially staying put .  what certain individuals chose to do was no indication of general policy .         good .     ariel sat down at her desk and punched the code for ambassador setaris .     third .         benen yarick .      ariel scowled .  she wished yarick would just talk to setaris and leave her alone .  ariel felt as if her allotment of understanding and patience were being fast used up .      just give me a list of the others     she told hofton .  .  .  forward no more calls till i say .  i   m not in yet .         of course .         try to get an official release from the police .         i imagine that the tbi have assumed control of the investigation  as usual .         i don   t care who it   s from .  they   d be great .     she made a shooing gesture .     i have to joust with windmills now .      hofton almost smiled as he backed from the room .   setaris appeared on her com .     ariel  good morning .          ambassador .         please tell me you have good news .         well  yes and no .  i spent the balance of yesterday talking to our people .  a large number of them had already decided not to leave .  not the majority  but enough to surprise me .  i managed to use that and a little arm twisting to get most of the rest to agree not to run .  i   ll need you to sign off on some concessions  but i didn   t break the budget .         i   m sure anything you promised will be reasonable .         i appreciate your confidence .  i   m afraid  though  that there will still be a very visible number bailing out  but that leaves nearly eighty percent of our people willing to wait and see .         that   s not as bad as i thought .  .  .  so is that the good news .     setaris asked .      that   s the good part .  last night i spoke to benen yarick from humadros   s legation .  the survivors want to leave .      setaris looked pleased .     you did speak to yarick .  good .         it   s irregular  though .  i thought she should speak to you or           or who  ariel .  go on .         yarick is simply frightened .  she claims that even if she brought herself to stay  her state of mind would make her virtually useless at the conference .         hm .  i suppose i can see her point of view  but .  .  .  what did you tell her .         that it would be a great service to me and the auroran population here if she reconsidered .  as i said  i couldn   t convince yarick to stay  but she said she would talk to the others .  i have to return her call this morning .  i   m hoping she can tell me they   re staying .         i sympathize with them  of course  but .  .  .         is there anyone else on staff that could step in for them if they all left .     ariel asked .   setaris sighed .     no  not really .  i   m afraid my credibility in this matter doesn   t extend quite that far .  my position on certain elements of what humadros proposed is too well known to the terran delegates .  i opposed on principle too much of it to be taken seriously .  oh  and speaking of credibility  i   m starting to get calls about the robotic side of this .  which reminds me .  i should have called you last night to tell you  but now is as good a time as then .  as of this morning  your credentials have been modified to include ambassadorial authority .      ariel felt abruptly uneasy .     what prompted this .         let me see .  .  .     because of the nature of this crisis         setaris quoted  evidently reading something off screen        the liaison from the calvin institute has been granted temporary modification of plenipotentiary status .              what    nature of crisis    prompted this .         the fact that you are the most senior embassy official still alive .  except for me .  all i have is junior legates and trainees .  and because of the positronic element .  the terrans are claiming a breakdown of the ri at union station .  you   re our positronic expert on the ground  so now you   ll be seconded to my department to deal with diplomatic matters relating to the situation .  anything major  of course  you clear with me first  but .  .  .  congratulations .      ariel was silent for a few moments .     have you heard anything concrete from the authorities .         they   re blaming managins .         you don   t sound as if you accept that .         the managins are a nuisance  certainly  but do you believe they could mount something like this .     setaris shook her head .     it seems they really have no idea  so they   re letting the media dictate explanations .  i   ll never get used to the earther taste for the salacious and the absurd .      ariel glanced at her appointment scroll  just now coming up .     i have another day of dealing with auroran irrationality .  it   s the same thing  different character .      setaris frowned .      not an opinion     ariel added     i share with anyone other than those who already know .      setaris   s frown changed to a wry smile .     of course .         oh  i received a call  i need to follow up on this  too  from gale chassik .  he wants our official position on this .         he   s being a nuisance and calling everyone .  i think he wants to find inconsistencies he can exploit .  our official position is that the conference is still on and we will wait for the terran authorities to pronounce on the investigation before taking any other actions .  we condemn the act  but we will not be precipitate .         i see .  .  .         anything else  ariel .  i have a full roster  too .         no  no .  thank you .  i   ll keep you informed .         of course .      the image winked out and ariel stared at the blank space .  obviously setaris had already been in contact with aurora and decisions had been made .  yarick had told her that much .  but aurora could take days or weeks to come up with a policy statement .  spacer time was more leisurely than earther time  decisions .  .  .  gestated .  .  .  until ready .  it was one of the sore points between the two governments .   on the other hand  the pace of diplomatic exchange had increased with the piracies .  perhaps someone on aurora had figured out that hesitation could be expensive when dealing with earth .   ariel wondered what sort of    other actions    aurora might take .  did they already have contingencies .   her change of status unsettled her .  instead of being gratified at the elevation and the implicit confidence it should signify  she was suspicious .  she could not help but think that they were looking for a scapegoat .  given her past  she would be perfect if things went wrong .  all they would have to do is issue an official statement  strip her finally and completely of auroran citizenship  and leave her on earth  alone .   she entered beren yarick   s code .      good morning  ms .  burgess     yarick answered promptly .     i did as you requested .  trina korolin has agreed to stay  but she   s our most junior member .  i was unable to convince gavit jans .  trina will also have her personal aides  two of them .  i   m sorry i couldn   t do better .         what about          i also apologize for the impersonal nature of this response .  i   ve already boarded a shuttle to kopernik .  i regret not having the courage of ambassador humadros   s convictions .  i hope you understand .         damn .     ariel punched the disconnect .  a recording .  she could not even stay on the ground long enough to give a personal reply .   perhaps  ariel thought sourly  she was worried i might actually talk her out of it .      what a mess     she muttered .   she entered trina korolin   s code .      good morning     the com answered .     ms .  korolin is temporarily unavailable .  please leave a message and a connection code .         ariel burgess  at the auroran embassy  calvin institute .  i would like to have a personal talk  ms .  korolin  at your earliest convenience .      ariel ended the connection .  she did not want to deal with chassik yet   he could be abrasive .  she looked down her list .  no doubt  she knew  it would grow longer by the end of the day .  most of them would want little more than an official shoulder to cry on .  they were all afraid .   she touched hofton   s intercom .     hofton  could you get me a list of the casualties .  all of them  terrans included .  and a download from several newsnets of the attack .         certainly .      she leaned back in her chair .  what about the other spacer contingents .  of the fifty spacer worlds  about a dozen had sizeable enclaves on earth  the largest  after aurora and solaria  being acrisia  pallena  and saon .  of the rest  only a few tourists or the one  off official on short term business .  all tolled  there were perhaps sixteen or seventeen thousand spacers residing on earth  soon to be fewer .  how were their governments reacting .   ariel scrolled down her list  searching for calls from the other embassies .  nothing .  that did not mean much  though  since they would more likely deal directly with setaris   s office .   but that could change now .   what is it they think i can do .  she wondered .   she had not told setaris about mia .  not that she had intended to  but now it seemed like a very shrewd decision on her part .   if i have the authority setaris tells me i have  she thought  then why not use it .   she touched the intercom .     hofton  find out who is heading the investigation and get me the code .         twelve    the agent in charge did not return her call .  over the course of the day  ariel sent a request to speak to him three times  but agent cupra either had received none of them or was refusing to respond .   she had been surprised to learn that special service had taken over the investigation .  something like this should have been a tbi matter  but the terran bureau of investigation had been shut out of it .  in a way it made sense  it had been a special service failure in the first place  a smear on their reputation at best  a reason to turn the entire service upside down and inside out in a search for blame at worst  so they would be strongly motivated to solve the matter .  nevertheless  earthers tended to be traditional  and tradition alone would dictate that the tbi run the investigation .   she scrolled down the lists hofton had gotten for her .  casualties  survivors  relatives  addresses  mia was the only member of eliton   s security team who had lived .  officially  though  she was now listed as deceased .   twenty one dead  thirty three wounded  not counting all those who had suffered injuries among the spectators during the stampede to escape the gallery .  humadros and most of her staff  eliton and his two aides  those were the costliest diplomatically .   bogard had given her the name of the agent at the med center .  ariel had hofton find his code .   agent sathen was a thin faced man with deeply recessed blue eyes and a short growth of dark brown hair that seemed to hug his scalp like a helmet .      yes .         agent sathen  i   m ariel burgess  from the calvin institute .         yes .     nothing but professional  impersonal  with no hint that he would willingly tell her anything .   ariel drew a breath .     i   m calling in regards to mia daventri .     seeing his expression change to uncertainty  she made a decision then how to approach this .     i was a friend of hers .      sathen stared at her for a few moments  then slowly nodded .  the set of his jaw relaxed .     how can i help you .         tell me what happened .         as a friend or as a spacer official .         both .  i understand she originally came in for medical treatment in company with a robot .         i   m no longer part of the investigation .         i understand that  agent sathen .  i   m interested in the part you were involved with .         as a friend .      ariel bit back her impatience .     i      she stopped .  of course  she realized  this is being recorded .     as a friend .  i met mia on kopernik station when i first came to earth .      sathen nodded .     i see .  well  there isn   t much to tell .  i and my partner received the call to accompany an injured agent to the clinic and to stay with her till she regained consciousness .  the ambulance beat us there .  when we arrived  the medics had already put her in a room and started her on regeneration treatments .  they couldn   t get the robot to leave  though .  it didn   t interfere with them  but none of them were too happy with its presence .         what robot was this .         that special one attached to eliton   s security team .  bogard .         i see .  weren   t you able to recover it .         it wouldn   t accept commands .  agent daventri had evidently given it a priority to protect her and it wouldn   t accept any other direction until she released it .         that sounds like you understand something about robots  agent .         i don   t understand a thing about them .  that   s what mr .  a very explained to me .      ariel   s eyes widened slightly .     derec avery .      sathen nodded .     from the phylaxis group  yes .  he showed up about five or six hours after agent daventri was admitted .  even he couldn   t get it to move and  as i understand it  he built the thing .         that is odd  but .  .  .  go on  agent sathen .  what happened .         well  mr .  a very told us to leave it alone and to call him when agent daventri regained consciousness .  then later we were recalled .  after we left the clinic  agent daventri   s room was destroyed  with her and the robot .         why were you recalled .         reassignment .  my partner and i were to be attached to vice senator taprin   s security team .  that won   t take effect  though  till tomorrow .  when the explosion occurred  we went back to the clinic .  there was .  .  .  nothing left .     sathen   s mouth flexed .     another agent was killed  too .         in the explosion .         no .      when he did not elaborate  ariel asked     any evidence who did it .         none .  the monitors in the entire clinic went down right before the blast .         isn   t it a little unusual to be recalled before an assignment is complete .         yes  ms .  burgess  it is .  but then everything about this is unusual  isn   t it .         yes  it is .     ariel paused .     did you know mia .         not well .  she seemed like a good agent .         may i ask who recalled you .         it came through our general dispatch .  normally  another team would relieve us .  i thought  well  it didn   t happen .  an oversight .         i didn   t think special service made mistakes .      sathen   s expression hardened .     we don   t .  is that all  ms .  burgess .         unless you can think of anything more .          i can   t think of anything i left out .         thank you for your time  then  agent sathen .      the screen blanked .  ariel entered the code for agent cupra once more and again got a recording that cupra was unavailable  please leave name and code .   no forensics .  .  .  ariel thought .   she called up the staff registry for the clinic in which mia was    killed    and found the head nurse that had been on duty that night .      my shift ended at ten     nurse carther explained .     but i was there when the injured agent and that   thing   came in .  dr .  jaley oversaw treatment .  he just ignored it  the robot .  i couldn   t  but i didn   t have to be in there with it .         when did the other agents arrive .     ariel asked .      a few minutes after we got the biomonitors connected .  agent sathen and agent .  .  .  um  vetter .  they ran security checks on all of us .  agent sathen was upset that he couldn   t get the robot to leave .  then a man from the phylaxis group showed up and he couldn   t get it out of there  either .  after he left  the other two agents arrived .  my shift ended about twenty minutes later and i left .         who was your replacement .         it was supposed to be karl funil  but he called in sick .  i   m not sure who was called in then .         so your relief hadn   t shown up when you left .  isn   t that irregular .         most of the clinic functions are automated     carther explained .     if someone isn   t there for ten minutes  it   s not a problem .  the physician in charge was there .  i could check if you like  see who was called in  but more than likely it was a temp .  we draw from a couple of hospital resource pools for emergencies .      ariel considered for a few moments .  that night would have been filled with emergencies .     no  that   s all right .  what other agents showed up .         two more special service people .  i don   t know what was said  but agent sathen was pretty angry with them .  i heard yelling .         they were still there when you left .         yes .         can you remember their names .         just the one and only because i heard agent sathen say it .  cupra .         they didn   t show you ill .     ariel asked .      agent sathen knew them .         thank you .  i appreciate it .  if i have any other questions  can i   .         i   d rather you didn   t     carther said sharply .   ariel started .     oh .         if that   s all  i have things to do .         yes  i        the image winked out .  after all this time  terran prejudice still surprised her .  too often it came wrapped in a false tolerance that camouflaged real sentiment .   ariel checked the clinic records again .  she found a note appended to the staff log that night  head nurse karl funil  excused for illness .  but there was no notation for who took his duties .  the way the log read  nurse carther had stayed .   was anyone on staff after she left .  .  .  .  ariel wondered .   agent sathen had said nothing about the visit by agent cupra .      i can   t think of anything i left out     he had said .      how paranoid do you want to be .     ariel muttered aloud .      ariel     hofton   s voice came over the intercom .     gale chassik is calling again .         damnit .         do you want me to .         put him through .  if i don   t talk to him now he   ll never go away .      a moment later chassik   s face appeared on her com screen .  gale chassik   s features implied an athletic youth unmaintained in middle age  wide jaw  a fleshy chin  and solid cheeks below bright greenish eyes and a seamed forehead .      ms .  burgess     he said slowly     thank you for taking the time to speak with me .      ariel heard the unspoken    at last    at the end of his sentence .  she made herself smile and hoped she looked convincingly apologetic .      sorry  ambassador chassik  but it has been a hectic day .         i can imagine .  i truly hate to add to your burdens  but i do have a matter or two that require attention .  the sooner the better and i can leave you in peace .         of course .  what can i do for you .         first  may i offer condolences on the losses of your fellow aurorans .         thank you  ambassador .  and i for yours .         we were more fortunate  at least in simple numbers .  i understand setaris   s top aides were killed .         that   s correct .         who .         i   m taking over some of their duties for the time being .          ah .  then i have finally reached the office i need .         that depends on what you need  ambassador chassik .          simply the formality of an official statement .  what is aurora   s  and the calvin institute   s position  on the disaster just experienced .         it   s strictly wait and see .  we don   t intend to take any precipitate action until we have some answers from terran authorities .  for now  we   ll wait on their investigations before taking any further steps .         nicely paraphrased  ms .  burgess .  what about the conference .         there is no reason currently to believe that the conference should not continue .      chassik looked surprised .     without galiel .  who could possibly stand in for her .  and senator eliton .         senator eliton   s second  vice senator taprin  will stand in for him     ariel replied .     as for our own contingent  i don   t know yet what the roster will be .  what about your own legation .  who   s staying .         none of them .  why should they .  the welcome they received          ambassador  i already have commitments from survivors of the auroran legation to stay and see the conference through .  it would be awkward if solaria backed out  don   t you think .      chassik pursed his lips .     i   ll get back to you on that .  may i ask who is staying .         you may ask .      chassik waited  then grinned .     when you have your roster completed  you will let us know .         of course .         the second matter  then .  what is your position on the alleged positronic failure and what do you intend to do about the phylaxis group .         we have no position on the alleged failure .  we haven   t seen the evidence on it  therefore we cannot determine the validity of the suggestion .  personally  i find it ludicrous .  as for the phylaxis group  i don   t understand what you mean .      chassik raised an eyebrow .     really .  phylaxis built that absurd robot that failed to protect senator eliton .  phylaxis is in charge of analyzing the ri in union station .  the claim that the ri failed has come to us from a variety of sources  some of them quite reliable .  if you don   t believe that it failed and phylaxis says it did  well  in light of the incompetence of the bodyguard  can you accept their word .         are you suggesting collusion between phylaxis and          i   m not suggesting anything     chassik said quickly .     but i have constituents who are quite uneasy about that robot and after witnessing its performance yesterday  i can   t say i disagree with them .  if there isn   t collusion  there is gross incompetence .  we can   t have phylaxis damaging our reputations .  it was a solarian firm that installed the ri .         i   ll look into the matter  ambassador .  is there anything else .      chassik seemed thoughtful for a time .     have you spoken to the terran authorities yet .         no .  i   ve requested updates on their investigation  but so far i   ve received nothing .         hmm .  when you do hear from them  would you let me know what they say .         i   m sure you   ll be informed at the same time      ariel began .      a favor  ms .  burgess .  in return  i   ll share what i receive from them .  it may be that aspects of this will be overlooked .         i see .  i   ll let you know  ambassador .  thank you .         oh  and one more matter .  i   m officially informing you that the ri at union station is being removed by solarian specialists .      ariel blinked .     removed .  .  .  .  when .         work begins today .         but  i should have been informed .         i   m informing you now .  you have been difficult to reach .         a calvin institute representative is required to be on site for          ms .  burgess  this is earth .  they have no such regulation .  the fact that your people were consulted when we installed it was a political courtesy .  now they want it out and they don   t care .  they need to get the station up and running and a replacement has already been chosen .  all that needs to be done is the removal of the ri  which we have been requested  strongly requested  to do with all haste .  if you have anyone from the institute you can spare  send them around .         it doesn   t matter that this is earth  this is a spacer regulation .         time  ms .  burgess  time .     chassik shook his head as if exasperated with her .     my people were contacted early this morning and the request was on my desk when i arrived .  i understand their haste  even if i have reservations .  the ri is defunct  totally collapsed  a useless mass of pathways .  this is a simple physical extraction .         has phylaxis been contacted .  is derec  mr .  avery there .         i don   t know .  would his presence mollify you .         i   m not sure .     ariel fought back her irritation .     i don   t have anyone to spare .  please make sure they document the removal and forward a report to me .         i   ll see to that  of course .         thank you .          good day .      ariel stared at the blank screen  fuming over the breach in protocol .  it was not just a matter of form  but a question of accountability .  how could she know that everything was done properly without an inspection .  she would have to trust them .  she imagined that it was the same solarian company that had installed it in the first place  which did little to assuage her apprehensions .   why the rush .  .  .  .  she wondered .   after a time  hofton interrupted again .     ariel  trina korolin is calling .  and i have those downloads for you .        at a little past two  ariel wanted to go back to her apartment .  the pressure behind her eyes had mounted steadily over the last two hours till she could no longer deny it and her patience had frayed in equal measure .   trina korolin seemed far too young and certainly lacked the experience for what she had volunteered to do  but if enthusiasm and commitment meant anything perhaps she could manage it .  ariel had put her in touch with jonis taprin and hoped for the best .   after that  she had spent the rest of her time dealing with panicked aurorans and at least five attorneys who threatened suits on behalf of terrans who had been injured or simply frightened senseless at union station .  they could not sue aurora   the diplomatic arrangements between spacer worlds and earth made it virtually impossible  but they could bring suit against resident spacers who owned businesses .  for the most part  they were only threats designed to elicit out of court payments .  ariel told them to go ahead and file  that she thought it likely that  once it was brought to the attention of certain government departments what they were doing  they could lose their licenses rather than risk countersuits by aurorans .  the conversations turned ugly in a couple instances  with one attorney telling her bluntly that he intended to press the suit anyway if there was any chance of getting the damn spacers off earth .   her responses grew sharper and sharper until she finally told hofton to stop putting the calls through .  she could no longer concentrate on her job .  her attention was divided .      ariel     hofton   s voice came over the intercom     i have recordings of the incident  as you requested .  two for now  a third one has been promised .         i   ll view them at my apartment later .  thank you  hofton .      she stared into space  letting her thoughts collide randomly .   there had been gaps in the exchanges with agent sathen and gale chassik .  she kept turning over in her mind what else they might have left out .  sathen had pointedly said nothing about the two agents who had come to see him after mia   s admission to the hospital .  chassik   s implication of wrongdoing against derec infuriated her .  he had danced over the fact that it was a solarian firm that had installed the ri at union station and that if any collusion were involved it would be between that company and the conspirators .  the more she thought about it  the more convinced she became that both sathen and chassik had made deliberate omissions  and in the case of sathen  at least  unwilling omissions .   ariel had never gotten used to the standard practice reticence diplomatic service entailed .  not being told things because it was    not your area     or was not part of her    need to know    irritated her to the point of fury  but she had come to accept it .  this was different  though she could not quite define how .  there was a distinction between covering one   s butt as a matter of routine and covering up .  she could sense the change even when it defied specification .   perhaps her insight came only from the fact that mia daventri was hiding out in her apartment .  it seemed curious that special service could pronounce her dead without a single tissue sample .   she stabbed the intercom .      hofton  i   m going home .  unless war breaks out before tomorrow morning  handle it .         as you command     hofton intoned with mock gravity .      don   t be impertinent .         never .      in spite of her headache  ariel smiled .  she gathered up the disks of all the downloads hofton had gotten for her and slipped them into her pocket .   she stepped into the lobby and raised her hand to gesture good bye to her staff .      ariel     hofton said  looking up from his desk     you might want to take this call .         i might .         i think so .  it   s derec avery from the phylaxis group .         thirteen    derec waited restlessly in the small phylaxis group reception lounge .   the room contained comfortable chairs  a bar  a subetheric  a viewer on which could be displayed promotional or educational material  a pleasant environment in which clients could become better acquainted with phylaxis  its work  and positronics .  derec remembered the party held here when they had received their license .  his truncated staff and senator eliton and a few of his own aides had toasted the future  the gamble they were taking  the hope that things would change .  it had been the only time anyone had actually used the room .   a bell chimed and derec pressed the button on the receptionist   s desk to open the door .   ariel stepped inside and stopped .  she glanced around  then looked at him .  derec began to smile .  she wore a better than average terran one piece the color of clay and a dark blue jacket .  she was thinner than the last time he had seen her  eyes wearier  the lines around her mouth a little deeper  tighter .  except for the slightly exaggerated contours of her chin length black hair  closer to spacer style than terran  she might pass for an earther .      i   m here     she said .      thank you .  i wasn   t sure you   d come .         i   m still not sure it   s worth my time .  you said you have something to show me .      derec felt his brief pleasure fade .  better  he realized  to get directly to business .      who from the calvin institute supervised the installation of union station   s ri .  it wasn   t you .      she frowned .     directly .  no .  i   m the commerce liaison here  not a project manager .  but i looked in on it .     she shrugged .     why .         who did the inspection .  i mean  specifically .         bys randic .  she rotated back to aurora last year  though .  is it important .         could be .  was there anything unique about it .  the brain itself  that is .      ariel sighed deeply .     i didn   t come here to be interrogated .  you told me you found something wrong with the ri .  did you .         oh  yes .  but          show me .      derec started to protest  but stopped himself and waved her toward the door behind him .  clearly nothing had changed in the years since the last time they had spoken together in the same room .  at least this time ariel was not shouting and redfaced .  not yet  anyway .   a short corridor ended at a heavy security door  which stood open .  ariel preceded him through to the main lab .   rana looked up from her console  one eyebrow cocking critically .  from behind ariel  derec patted the air to let rana know it was all right .   ariel did a more careful survey of this chamber .  derec could almost imagine the way she assessed each piece of equipment  sorted out the way in which the lab worked  and judged it .  .  .      i   m impressed     she said .     you could do some excellent work here .     she turned to him .     what do you do with it .         till lately     rana said     we   ve done a lot of theoretical work  plotting positronic vectors under stress situations and the like  and we can play some really high level strategy games on it .  for the most part  though  we spend our time answering questions from resident spacers who can   t understand why their robots won   t anticipate their wants and desires the way they do back home and explaining to others why they shouldn   t have a positronic robot outside embassy confines .      derec glared at her .     rana  this is ariel burgess .  ariel  verana duvan  my chief roboticist .         burgess     rana said  rising .     calvin institute .     she stopped a pace away from ariel .     i read your brief on    cross inference deduction in the field .      good work .      ariel hesitated  then slowly nodded .     thank you .  i   m afraid i can   t say i   ve seen any of your work .         don   t apologize .  i   m terran .  we don   t get to publish in spacer journals .         how .  .  .  .         how did i get involved with robotics .     rana grinned .     my degree is in industrial automation  with a minor in ai .  i got sidetracked into positronics .  we aren   t all rabidly antirobot .         that must have been difficult .         tracking down the material was a challenge .  frankly  if derec hadn   t come along with his offer to work here i was going to apply for emigration .  i was preparing my application to the calvin institute .  futile gesture  maybe  but you never know till you try .         why futile .  if derec wanted you  you must be good .         calvin doesn   t take very many earthers .  i checked .   there   s a very old saying about a snowball   s chance .  .  .  .     rana started to go back to her console  then looked at ariel .     and i am good .         modest  too     derec said .      so with all this talent  why do you need me .     ariel asked .      because we didn   t install the ri at union station  we only watched from a distance     rana said .     and it has some peculiarities we can   t explain .         what did they tell you at the institute .         they didn   t     derec said .     we .  .  .  aren   t really supposed to be looking at it .         excuse me .         special service assumed jurisdiction over the entire investigation .  threw us out .         special service doesn   t have any positronic experts .         maybe they   re talking to your people at the institute      derec said .   ariel   s mouth compressed tightly .  she looked troubled .     so what are you doing with it .         we set up surrogate function through our ri and transferred a complete copy of union station    s here before we were shut out .  they don   t know we have it .         and you don   t want to go through normal channels to ask .  .  .  i see .     ariel nodded .     you think i   ll act as go between for you .  believe me  the last thing i need now is a problem with special service .  i   ve already got panicked aurorans ready to leave earth at a heartbeat .  any kind of problem with earth authorities that might lead to          ariel     derec said  cutting her off .     no .  i want you to look at what we have and give me your opinion .      she gave him a dubious look .     that   s all .         we   ll see .  first  i want to know what you think .      her eyes narrowed .  he knew she understood what he was doing .  he hoped she would acknowledge a stake in this  that perhaps she already had found inconsistencies in the situation  that her involvement would outweigh her resentments .  he watched her work through all of that and more he could not guess .      all right     she said finally .     show me what you have .           it   s been a while since i   ve seen a collapse this thorough     ariel said  staring at the screen .     did anything function .         nothing     derec said .     according to the staff  everything had to be switched to manual .  fortunately  some of the systems had their own parallel processing units  so it wasn   t a complete loss  but .  .  .      ariel pointed at one of the spirals .     what is that .  it looks like a paradox loop  but i don   t see a resolution point .         neither do we     rana said     and i   ve been looking .  i started an excavation  but it looks like the loops resolve somewhere outside the positronic matrix .         that   s absurd  there is no    outside    a positronic matrix     ariel said .     not like this .  unless it   s a connection with another positronic matrix .         a comlink     derec said .      basically  yes .  you know this stuff  derec .  this is freshman level pathway schema .         but in this case     he said patiently     it doesn   t go through any comlinks .  we traced a good number of the comlinks  mostly the supervisory connections with the mobile staff .  none of them match these sites .  these loops are leaving the matrix and going somewhere else through a channel we can   t determine .         just what sectors are they in .         it   s too damaged to tell about all of them     derec said .     once it began collapsing  everything randomized .         at some point it should lock up .  the whole thing shouldn   t devolve into chaos .         that   s what i thought     rana said .     basic salvage protocol  ever since the stasis modifications went in  what .  twenty years ago .  but this did exactly the opposite and became more fluid .      ariel started tapping the keyboard before her .     you said too damaged to tell about all of them .  does that mean you could tell for some of them .  what about a scan for mirror sites .  .  .  where do these sectors link to the station systems .         maintenance     rana said .   ariel waited  then glanced at the other woman .     all of them .         so far .         hm .  how did you determine that .         like i said  i   m running an excavation .  layer by layer  sector by sector  and matching it to design specs from our ri  which  for the time being  is running union station .      ariel blinked at her .     i admire your ambition .      rana shrugged .     no option .  but .  .  .     she waved at the screen .      maintenance .  .  .     ariel mused .     what about the reference template .  did you check it .         can   t find it     rana said .     everything is so random       ariel leaned forward and worked the keyboard .  she entered a few more commands  then sat back .  two of the peripheral screens began to display new patterns .   rana stared .     how did   .     she began  but derec gave her a minute shake of the head .      every positronic brain has a reference template     ariel said quietly  more to herself than to them .     a basic pattern of behavior and attributes against which the working brain can refer .  .  .     she frowned .     i don   t understand this .  they   re randomized  too .     she tapped more commands .  the screens changed .   ariel touched one of the screens .     this comline isn   t right .  it   s one to one  no buffer to shield the matrix .  same with this one .  what kind of accessory systems were installed on this .         don   t know     derec said .   she scowled at him impatiently .     what do you mean  you don   t know .  didn   t you do an on site inspection .         we didn   t get a chance to before we were taken off the job and barred from the site .         what about before this .  are you telling me you only looked at the system during the install and not since .         we went back in once  a few months after the installation .  after that it was supposed to be on an as needed basis and we never received a call .  now that we need to get in there  we   re blocked .         that   s ridiculous .  who issued that order .         it came from the director   s office of special service     derec replied .     their authorization was legal .         but phylaxis          we were removed  ariel .  period .      she stared at the screens before her  but derec was sure she saw nothing on them .  she absently scratched her chin once .      i see .  and you think i  we  had something to do with that .         the thought had occurred to me     derec said drily .   ariel nodded slowly  still looking at the screens .     you said no one knows you have this copy .         no one has shown up yet to take it away from us .     that elicited a grin .      do you have any theories about what this is .     she pointed at the screen .      the staff told me that just before the assault  the ri took itself off line to play a game .  it was completely unaware of what was happening in the gallery until it came back online and witnessed the aftermath .         and that   s when the collapse began .         exactly     derec said .     now  the paradox loops and the mirror sites suggest that something was physically attached to the ri network .  when i asked about problems with the ri before this  i was told that a few glitches had occurred  but they were minor and they   d been told that    adjustment errors    were to be expected  to contact the calvin institute about them before contacting us .  most were dismissed .         adjustment errors .  .  .     ariel stood and walked slowly around the lab .  after one full circuit she stopped directly in front of derec .     what do you want from me .         to start with  i   d like to know who issued that maintenance directive .         you want my help .         just      derec began .      you want me to pry into the operations of my own people to see if any of them are somehow culpable .     her voice was growing edged  caustic .      ariel          you want me to help you figure out why the ri went insane .         well        you want me to forget about everything else  drop my responsibilities  and be a spy for you .     ariel folded her arms across her chest and grunted derisively .     i have to credit you  derec  you have nerve .      derec could feel his own irritation grow .  he feared a repeat of their last fight .     are you going to tell me you   re not interested in this .      ariel glared at him briefly .     damn you  yes .  you knew that would happen  once i saw this .     she slapped the top of the console .     you relied on that .  you used it .         and you hate being used .          damn it   .         then help us     derec said softly .     whoever did this is using you in a much worse way .  whoever did this did it to kill galiel humadros and clar eliton .  they also killed the two surviving members of eliton   s security team .  it will get worse .  at the very least  this completely discredits positronics on earth .  this undoes everything eliton hoped to do .  even if the conference goes on now  without finding the people responsible nothing will be accomplished .  tell me this doesn   t concern you .      ariel caught herself  face red  mouth open to respond .     i need to know more .      derec felt a moment of hope  a brief twinge of success .  he ran the tip of his tongue over his lips  folded his arms  and  in as calm a voice as he could manage  told her what he had learned .  all the while he watched her  hoping he could still trust what he saw in her expression .     rana kept glancing over the top of her console at ariel  who sat on the opposite side of the lab  arms folded  staring at the floor .      what are you wondering .     derec asked finally .   rana gave him an annoyed look .     she enters a couple of commands and in half a second gets to where it took me hours to fail to reach .     she shook her head .     i   m not sure if i   m wondering or just resenting .         ariel   s one of the best .         along with you .         sometimes i think she   s better .         how long will she take to make up her mind .      derec looked at ariel .     i don   t know .  it will take as long as it takes .          rana shook her head .     i was really excited when i found out you knew ariel burgess .  it was a major disappointment when it turned out you weren   t on speaking terms anymore .     she glanced at him .     i knew there was a problem between you two  but .  .  .         philosophical differences .          you said that before .         you didn   t believe me .         people don   t usually display that much heat over philosophy .         not the abstract kind  no .  but when it relates directly to what you do  who you are .  .  .     derec frowned .     she believes i betrayed her trust .  we .  .  .  it sounds like a clich    but we really had everything together for a while .         until .         until i started playing around with the ideas that became bogard .     he looked at rana .     you can be damn nosy .      rana shrugged .  she began to say more  then nodded toward ariel .     decision time .      ariel was walking toward them .      we   ll see     derec whispered .   ariel leaned on the console .     what do you think is going on .         obviously  someone had a stake in seeing the conference stopped or at least rendered useless .  i don   t think anything constructive can come of it now .         do you believe what the news nets are saying .  that it was the managins .         no .         why not .         they don   t have the resources     derec replied .     the will  yes  but the ability to subvert the resident intelligence of a facility like union station .  get several armed people inside .  and then escape .     he shook his head .     i gather no other arrests have been made .     .      none that i   m aware of .         someone used the managins  maybe .         who .      derec shrugged .     i don   t know .         do you think the calvin institute is involved .     ariel asked .      someone issued that maintenance directive .  someone who understood the nature of positronics and knew what i might find .      ariel   s mouth was a thin  hard line .     i can   t disagree .  not entirely .  but i have another problem .         which is .         that robot of yours .  the bodyguard unit .  why did it fail .      derec felt himself stiffen .     i don   t know .          you admit that it did .         it .  .  .  something went wrong .         it was designed to defend a primary subject  correct .  in this case  senator eliton .  it didn   t .  eliton died .  why .         i wish i knew .  it   s more complicated than that  even .  from what i saw  it was defending eliton .  then  for some reason  it abandoned him .         perhaps your design was faulty .      derec hesitated .     perhaps .     he had not wanted to admit that possibility  especially not to ariel  but he could not reject it .      or was it subverted the same way the ri was .     ariel asked .   that surprised him .     i can   t see how .  but i don   t know how the ri was subverted  so your guess is as good as anyone else   s .  there   s no way to tell .  if i had bogard here  i might be able to determine what went wrong  but it   s gone .  destroyed .      ariel tapped a finger absently while she regarded derec .  suddenly  she slapped both hands on the top of the console .     all right  i   ll help you .  i   ve got unanswered questions myself .  but i want to know what we   re supposed to do if we find something .         like what .         like what we both suspect  that this is more than the actions of a group of disaffected bigots .  unless those bigots have members in the government .         i suppose that depends on just who it is we find .  if it   s the authorities  we can   t very well go to them  can we .         it   s not likely to be all of them .         no  but          the problem  derec  is that whoever is behind this  the consequences of uncovering it could be worse than leaving it alone .         are you serious .         perfectly     ariel replied .     right now  as much as i hate to admit it  we have a diplomatic crisis .  we   re left with a shattered program and we have to start allover .  what we do not have is a war .  push this and that   s exactly what we might have .         war .  you   re overstating a bit  aren   t you .     rana asked .      i already told you  i   m perfectly serious .  if it becomes clear that the terran government  or a part of it  engineered an assassination of an auroran ambassador  the only conclusion aurora and the fifty worlds can make is that earth cannot be trusted .  they could decide that the only way to deal with it then is containment .  no more settlers will be permitted out .  no more trade .  no more anything .  isolation .         is that doable .     derec asked .   ariel shook her head .     no  not entirely .  we can   t even get rid of the pirates that have been raiding the lanes .  but it doesn   t matter .  it   s enough to set off a war .         so who would benefit from that .         i don   t know .  someone always benefits from a war .  but that   s one possible outcome of this .     ariel paused .     so .  i   ll ask again .  what do we do when we find out .         we may not be able to do anything .  i think we need to find out what we can first  then decide .         no going off on your own .  we decide .      derec nodded .     agreed .         all right .  where do you want to start .         well .  .  .  getting inside union station would be good .  i need to do a physical inspection to see what   s been done to the matrix .         i may be able to help with that .         good .  that will do for a start .      ariel gave him a curious smile .     it would really help if you could talk to bogard .         of course it would .  but       ariel   s smile broadened .     why don   t you come with me .  i have something to show you .         fourteen    in light of recent revelations     the newscaster declared from the subetheric     the death of special service agent mia daventri and the destruction of the experimental robot assigned to guard senator clar eliton have taken on new significance .  the entire team of agents charged with the security of eliton and his staff during the union station meeting with spacer legations has now been killed .  special service is conducting an internal investigation on which they refuse to comment  except to suggest that certain irregularities are at the heart of the tragedy .  the utter failure of a trained team of agents to protect one of earth   s most prominent politicians cannot be explained unless that failure was part of a larger movement .  sources inside the terran bureau of investigation have let it be known that flies have been opened on the agents involved  and their affiliations with various organizations  ostensibly in the line of duty  are being questioned .  nevertheless  the question no one seems willing to either answer or deny is the spacer connection .      mia pressed the contact on the remote  shutting off the subetheric .  after going from one newsnet to another in between other tasks she felt nervous and edgy .  none of the news reassured her  almost all of it had raised more questions  and she should have stopped listening .  she especially should not have watched this    cast .   dal kammer  one of the top rated newscasters on subetheric  implying that mia and her teammates had been involved in the conspiracy to kill eliton and humadros  made her cringe .  if it had been any of a dozen other newsnet people she might have shrugged it off  there was more detritus on the subetheric than legitimate data  but kammer was prominent  reputable .  that did not mean he would not twist  color  alter  or fabricate his facts .  but it meant that to get him to do so was expensive .   or he was being led to believe the reports .  .  .   mia lay her head back against the pillow .  the medical robot had left over six hours ago  giving her a pain blocker along with a tissue accelerant and instructions to move around as little as possible until its next visit .  she wondered if squirming counted .   her datum lay on the table beside her .  she had spent most of the day sending queries through ariel   s com system  using a pair of alternate electronic personas working in tandem  so if any back traces were attempted they would lead into blind alleys  to see if any of her passwords worked anywhere .  nothing .  the service had shut her out of everything  which puzzled her .  if they thought she was dead  why be so thorough so fast in blocking her access .  unless they really did think she had been part of a conspiracy .  then it made sense  they would suspect someone else possessed her codes .   a few names appeared on the small screen  possible contacts she might yet be able to trust  a newsnet reporter named holis  her old instructor at the academy  and coren lanra  the ex service agent she had seen at the gallery  now working for dynan manual industries .  holis would help her in return for an exclusive  which meant that she needed something with which to bargain .  so far  except for the fact that she was alive  she had nothing solid .  she was uncertain how much trouble she might cause for her old instructor .  as for lanra  she did not know where he stood  except that he had no loyalty anymore to the service .  she had contacted none of them .   what had gone wrong .   mia glanced over at bogard  standing against the wall between where she lay and the door  still and solemn .  two hours ago  after its own datum search  it had reported on the type of weapon used at union station .  no direct match  but it bore similarity to a twenty first century staros  nine millimeter automatic .  modifications had been made  altering them enough to call a direct match into question .  but that meant they had probably been manufactured exclusively for this strike  which reinforced mia   s opinion that kynig parapoyos had provided them .   the other name on her screen tended to confirm that .  bok vin golner .  it was the likeliest match she had come up with from the name bok  given the other parameters she had attached to the search .  retired terran military  captain  a veteran of two campaigns  including the ganymede suppression  and  since leaving the army  an irregularly employed security specialist .  he had been arrested once for civic disturbance during a terran first rally and another time for trafficking in unlicensed merchandise  black market .  in both instances he had been represented by a lawyer he could not reasonably afford and the charges had been dropped .  he was listed as an affiliate to a couple of anti spacer groups .   if you want to set up a military assault  mia thought  use someone who knows how and can follow through .  .  .   bogard shifted the three meters to the door .  mia blinked .  a few seconds later  r .  jennie trundled into the room  but stopped upon seeing bogard blocking the entrance .      avernus in perihelion     came ariel   s voice over the intercom .      accepted     bogard announced and opened the door .   ariel stepped past the robot with a wary look  followed by a man mia did not know .  only slightly taller than ariel  he wore his pale hair short  and a black jacket over a dark blue one piece .      hello  bogard     he said  his expression openly surprised .      hello  derec     the robot replied .     it is good to see you  again .      derec gave ariel a skeptical look .     avernus in perihelion .         would anyone you know guess that as a password .     ariel asked .   derec shook his head .     no  i suppose not .     he looked at bogard again .     don   t take this wrong  bogard  but i thought you were dead .         no  sir     bogard said .     although your misapprehension is understandable .         welcome home  ariel     r .  jennie said  accepting ariel   s jacket .     welcome  sir .      derec shrugged out of his jacket and handed it to r .  jennie .     thank you .     he stepped into the living room and looked at mia with the same expression of amazement .     and you .  you   re          dead  yes     mia said .     officially  at least .  do i know you .         no .  the last time i saw you was in the hospital .  you were quite unconscious .  the next time i saw that room  though .  .  .         bogard performed its function admirably     mia said .   derec gave the robot another look  this time with an unmistakable expression of pride .      apparently     he said .      mia daventri     ariel said then     this is derec avery  of the phylaxis group .  derec  my friend  mia daventri .      derec came up to her and extended his hand .     i   m not sure i even want to know how you ended up here .  but i   m very pleased to make your acquaintance .      mia took his hand .  dry  warm .     i   ve heard interesting things about you  mr .  avery .         derec  please .     he glanced at ariel .     from ariel .         no .         how do you feel .     ariel asked .      better .  a little pain block does wonders for my disposition .         good .  we have work to do .            we    .     mia asked .   ariel smiled .     you wanted me to trust you  you have to trust me .  i wouldn   t bring just anyone in here now .  derec is the other positronic expert on earth .      derec grinned .     the other best one  that is .     he looked at ariel .     who   s the first one .      ariel aimed a finger at him .     don   t start .      derec raised his hands in mock surrender .     somebody should start  though .  why not ms .  daventri .         mia .  unless i   m mad at you  then it   s special agent daventri .     she liked his smile  she decided .  but it was obvious ariel did not .     start where .  with what .         first  i suppose  how did you get out of that hospital alive .      mia sighed and started talking .        you saw two people .     derec asked again .      there might easily have been more .  bogard  how many intruders entered the hospital .         i registered five presences in the building     bogard said .     one was the agent left as guard .  one was the physician on duty sleeping in the doctor   s lounge .  three intruders entered .  two conducted the assault on your room while the third remained at the entrance .         how many were involved in the assault at union station .     ariel asked .     several got away .         bogard     derec asked     how many assailants did you count at union station .         a visual count of twenty one .         that seems right     mia said .   derec was frowning at the robot .     why the qualification  bogard .         i am not sure  derec  but i have a firm count of the visual only .  infrared suggests eighteen  radar only nine .  i cannot explain the discrepancy .         we need recordings from the assault     derec said .   ariel crossed the room to her com .     we have two newsnet downloads .         only two .      ariel gave derec a mock scowl .     to start .     she worked at the com for a minute  then gestured to the subetheric .  the broad space filled with the image of union station   s gallery  filled with spectators awaiting the arrival .      this is seath callon for gvs          we don   t need sound     derec said .     i think we   ve all heard enough .  just visual .      the voice over died and they watched in silence the events unfold .  the entrance of the eliton party  the gathering on the platform  the arrival of the spacer legations  the explosions .  the recorder shifted abruptly  then  the operator apparently unsure where to concentrate attention .  finally  the image closed on the platform and the area immediately surrounding it as the black clad figures crowded against the base  firing into the panicked delegates .  mia noticed that derec a very watched bogard as much as the vid .      looks like twenty one to me     ariel said .      back it up slowly     mia said .     bogard  track the assailants .      the robot moved closer to the screen .   the camera withdrew  the action flowing languidly in reverse until a point just before the explosions .      stop     mia said .     bogard .         there is a discrepancy     the robot said .     i counted twenty one assailants at the edge of the platform .  twelve of them are absent from the crowd at this point .         what   .     ariel started .  she glared at the robot .      wait     derec said .     the vid i saw at the station from the ri surveillance  just prior to it going off line  showed people in the crowd vanishing .  now you   re telling us that several of these figures appeared during the initial attack .  they weren   t already present .         that is what i am seeing  derec .      ariel   s skeptical look slowly changed to apprehension .     mia  do you remember what you saw .         not that well .  our first concern was the explosions .  then the gunfire .         bogard     derec said     we   ll advance the scene now .  tell us when those missing figures first appear .      the scene once more ran its course  in slow motion .  the crowd seemed to undulate under the sound of the blasts  like anemone waving in an ocean current .      stop     bogard said .   derec leaned forward  then grabbed the subetheric control .     where .     he asked  handing the device to bogard .   the robot narrowed the view to a patch of people about four meters from the base of the platform .  it was a variegated collection of onlookers  mostly well off  dressed fashionably in brightly colored jackets over more muted single pieces  hair streaked and coifed in pastels .  now  panicked  their faces were drawn into macabre parodies of themselves  eyes wide  mouths gaping  and their bodies crouched in preparation to run .  but they were trapped in a larger crowd with no room .   in the very midst of the twenty or so spectators  three people stood dressed all in black .  even their heads were covered by pullovers .  there was something not right about two of them  though  the two following a third who shoved a path through the crowd .      they don   t fit     mia said .     look at the people immediately around them  especially that man in bright red .  beside him is a woman in orange .  they   re standing right next to each other .  in fact  bogard  can you give us more mag .  thank you  in fact  they   re holding hands .         so .     ariel asked .      their arms are joined right through that assailant   s stomach     mia pointed out .     look at the other one .  .  .  the shoulder is passing through that woman   s breasts .         images     derec said .     projections .  bogard  follow those two  continue scan .      the scene began to move again .  the two black clad figures stepped quickly through  through  not around  the intervening people  following a leader  to emerge into the space now at the foot of the platform .  others joined them .  they seemed to lean their elbows on the edge of the plat form  rifles in hand  and commence firing .      bogard  see if the other sudden appearances come grouped in twos or threes .      the robot advanced and backed up the images  shifting from one part of the crowd to the next  so quickly mia had trouble following the scene .  she had to close her eyes when vertigo threatened to make her nauseated .      there is always one in the lead     the robot said finally     and two who appear behind .          military     mia said .     a holographic generator worn by a soldier projects an image of two or three more .  an enemy targeting system can be confused  just like bogard was  giving multiple counts .         bogard     derec said     do a projected trace on one of their shots and see where it goes .      there was a moment   s pause  then one of the shadow rifles fired .  the scene jerked forward then  into the frightened delegates  and stopped on an auroran woman trying to turn and flee back into the debarkation umbilical .  she looked unhurt and continued her attempted flight .      bogard  according to your trajectory plot she should have been hit .         yes  derec .          wouldn   t the newsnets have figured this out already .     ariel asked .      probably not     mia said .     they got their recordings  they put them on subetheric  they did their duty .  i doubt anyone gave it a second look .     she thought for a few seconds .     on the other hand  maybe they have and they don   t know what to do with it .  it doesn   t change the results  does it .         all right     derec said     this would confirm your suspicion that kynig parapoyos at least supplied the weapons and that an ex military man like this bok golner conducted the actual assault .  what do we do next .      mia cleared her throat  then  and looked at derec and ariel .      before we go any further     she said     i need to make it clear that once we start  it gets dangerous .  i can   t trust my own people and they control the security network for the planet  or at least a good portion of it .  if we go probing we could get hurt .  if you don   t want to risk that  tell me now and we stop it here .      ariel pursed her lips and made a show of thinking it over .     there   s no option for me .  i have to know .  but derec          no option for me  either     he said .     i   m involved already through bogard .  no matter how this comes out  what i   ve built here is at risk .  the only way i can protect any of it is to see this through .  we   re in .      mia studied them both  then nodded .     all right  then .  first we need to find out where the guns came from and where bok golner trained his team .  the attack took expertise .  you don   t just get up one day and do something like this without practice .  where would they train .         kynig parapoyos bothers me     ariel said .     why would he do this .  or his organization .  i don   t recall ever seeing or hearing anything about him conducting assassinations .         not like this  no     mia said .     but i don   t think he   s entirely behind it .  someone had to subvert the ri  someone had to subvert special service agents  someone had to be on the inside .  parapoyos could provide the weapons  but all the rest .      ariel was nodding .     he   s the main supplier for the settler colonies .  do you think they had anything to do with it .         why would they .     derec asked .      the piracies     mia answered .     one of the primary suspects is the settler worlds .  one or more of them may be harboring the pirate bases .         and robotic inspections could affect that relationship     derec said  nodding .     but all of them .  as a matter of policy .  isn   t that a stretch .         of course     ariel said     but the settlers aren   t a monolith  no more than the spacers are .  it   s a possibility .         it would be a good idea for you to buy some guns  ariel     mia said .   ariel   s eyebrows went up .      it would be a way to get to parapoyos .  you go to the settler coalition and talk to them .  if they   re buying through parapoyos here  riansa visher was involved .  her successor will know about it .  they can put you in contact .         why me .         because this little incident could mean war     mia explained .     aurora may need weapons .      ariel did not look comfortable  but she nodded .   after an awkward silence  derec waved a hand at the subetheric .     with this and the recordings from the ri          assuming anyone but you and the ri staff saw those particular records     ariel said .     by now  special service may have confiscated or destroyed them .      derec frowned and stared at the subetheric .      bogard     mia said  glad for the change of subject .     find the actual casualties and trace the shots back to source .  determine how many live assailants were present .      for a few painful minutes the view shifted from victim to attacker  victim to attacker  several times .  each instance startled and saddened mia .  what struck her most consistently was the expression of surprise each wounded person wore upon being hit  followed sometimes by a rictus of pain  but only if that person had survived the injury .  death left the last expression stamped on each face  bafflement  confusion  amazement  in one instance a look of betrayal .      nine     bogard announced finally .     there are twenty one images and nine actual assailants .         nine     mia mused .     that tends to validate the idea that they were after only a few individuals .         bogard  can you identify the individuals killed .     ariel asked .      yes  ms .  burgess .     bogard began displaying the names of the delegates as they appeared on the screen .      you captured three of the assailants     derec said to mia .     didn   t you .         yes     mia said .     i          stop     ariel said  standing .  bogard fell silent .  she stared at the screen .     that last name .  .  .         tro aspil     bogard said .      tro .  .  .  but he survived .  .  .         the wound depicted     bogard said     is not consistent with survival .  the shot entered the throat and severed the carotid artery .         then .  .  .     ariel went to her datum .      what is it .     mia asked .      should i continue .     bogard asked .      hmm .     mia glanced up at the robot .     compile the list for future reference .         you captured three of the assailants and .  .  .  .     derec prompted .      yes  i did .  well  bogard captured two of them  but          how did bogard perform .         after i gave him a new priority  perfectly .  i couldn   t have apprehended those men without it .         then .  .  .     derec looked at bogard self consciously .     how do you explain the failure .         i   m not sure          i built bogard  agent daventri .  senator eliton is dead .  i need to know what happened .         i see .  yes  you should know .  frankly  i had intended to ask you that question .  when      she gave bogard an apprehensive look .     i   m not sure we should talk about this in bogard   s presence .      derec nodded .     bogard  have you completed compiling the list of casualties from this recording .         yes  derec .         stand down  then  please .         i cannot do that  derec .  i am still responsible for agent daventri   s safety .      derec frowned briefly  then shrugged .     should any of the subject matter we   re discussing present potential operational difficulties for you  alert us .         i will do that  derec .      derec smiled .     bogard will know better than any of us when it   s in trouble .      mia felt uneasy .     i attempted to get a full report from bogard last night .  the part about senator eliton is absent from its logs .         no  it   s not .  it   s elsewhere  but it   s there .  at some point i   ll have to run a complete debrief on all bogard   s systems to get at it  but it means that its system is working the way it should .  please  go on .         when the explosions began  bogard immediately enshielded the senator .  that left us free to confront the assault .  but it came so suddenly and unexpectedly  you train for the possibility  but nothing can prepare you for the reality .  the casualties  the explosions  the panic  what do you do first .  our training says to get the people we   re supposed to protect out of harm   s way as soon as possible .  there was nowhere for them to go .  we couldn   t get them to safety .  then .  .  .  then my teammates started going down .  i tried to return fife  but for all i know now i may have shot nothing but images .  or i may have shot innocent spectators .  there was too much all at once .      mia swallowed thickly  aware now of the stinging in her sinuses and eyes and the faint quiver in her stomach .      i remember turning to see if anyone was covering the spacers .  i saw bogard retract from around senator eliton and head for ambassador humadros .  senator eliton stepped backward          stepped or stumbled .         stepped .  .  .  as if he was ready to be abandoned .  .  .  but he still looked surprised .  .  .         and .         and ambassador humadros went down before bogard reached her .  it reversed itself to return to eliton at the same time i started toward him .  then senator eliton .  .  .  went down .     she wiped at her nose  embarrassed .     excuse me  i   m not          it   s all right .  this isn   t a normal day .  you   re entitled .      mia sniffed  then looked at him  suddenly angry .     am i entitled to fail .  i don   t think so .         how did you fail .         i did not protect my assignment .      derec waved his thumb at bogard .     there stands several million credits of technology a hundred times faster and more alert than you could ever be .  it failed .         there has to be a reason .      derec nodded .     exactly .         but      mia caught herself and held back .  in an instant she lost the sense of recrimination that had been building in her all day and had nearly overwhelmed her just now .  not entirely  she could sense it still within  but it was at arm   s length again  manageable .  perhaps it would get worse later .  perhaps it would come and go for the rest of her life .  it was a simple truth derec had handed her  and it sabotaged the guilt she felt .  .  .  at least for the time being .   it   s not  she thought  so much my failure as it is someone else   s success .  .  .  temporary success .   she cleared her throat .     i see .  yes .  thank you  mr .  avery .         derec  please .     he looked at bogard again .     so the question is  why did bogard abandon senator eliton .  you said eliton had ordered bogard to protect humadros  but that shouldn   t have made any difference .  i need to take bogard back to phylaxis to debrief it .      mia felt herself tighten up inside .  she glanced at the robot .     i shouldn   t travel yet          you only need to release bogard from its priority and turn it over to me .      mia would not meet his gaze .     i  i   m not comfortable with that  mr .  avery .         not      derec caught himself when she looked away .     please understand me  mia .  bogard has data necessary to this  this investigation .  the only way i can get at it is to do a full debrief and reset .         bogard is the only reason i   m still alive .  i can   t          you   re in the auroran embassy .  what   s going to hurt you here .         i don   t know .  and that   s just it .  i do not know .  until i can walk on my own and defend myself  i just  i can   t release bogard to you .         agent daventri       mia shook her head .     i   m sorry  mr .  a very .  i can   t .  please don   t press me further on this .  maybe in a day or two           there   s another problem     derec said .     bogard right now is unaware ofa discrepancy in its memory .  its behavior is conforming to its program  but there is discrepancy and eventually the self diagnostics are going to tumble to it .  when that happens  bogard will hunt it down even if it means tearing its own programming apart to find out what the problem is .  bogard could easily destroy itself .  that   s why debrief is important .  more so because it involves a personal failure on its part .         i don   t know what to tell you .         don   t tell me anything .  release bogard          no .      derec jerked back as if she had slapped him .     how long do you want to wait to find out what happened to senator eliton .         you can figure that one out     ariel interjected  returning from her datum console .     the question i want answered is how can a dead diplomat board a shuttle back to kopernik station to take passage on a starship bound for aurora .           you   re sure it   s not an error .     derec suggested .   ariel scowled .     that was my first thought .  but last night when i spoke to benen yarick  one of the junior members of the auroran legation  she mentioned tro .  i replayed our conversation and she listed him among the fallen .  but he was on the list of survivors i had from the embassy comptroller   s office .  one or the other had to be wrong .  perhaps yarick only saw him injured  not killed .  i checked the embassy transit office and found a passage booking for him on the shuttle that lifted this morning at four fifteen for kopernik .  i sent a query to confirm his arrival at the station .  the confirmation also verified that tro aspil boarded the liner corismun at one ten local time .         it could still be an error     mia said .     it was chaos afterward .         that   s what i want to find out .     ariel tapped a code into her com .      trina korolin .         ms .  korolin  this is ariel burgess .  sorry to bother you again .         no bother .  what can i do for you .         i just wanted to make sure everything was still on for tomorrow   s meeting and to check a couple of details .  the rest of the survivors are leaving tomorrow .         yes  i  i   m sorry we   re all turning out to be such          no  don   t .  this was extraordinary .  i can   t blame anyone for wanting out .         that   s .  .  .  kind of you .  .  .         i was curious  though .  tro aspil has already left .  was there a reason he needed to depart before the others .         tro .  .  .     there was a long pause .     you   re joking  aren   t you .  tro died .         but i have a transit record for him through the embassy .         i don   t care what you have  ms .  burgess .  i saw tro die .  he  his neck exploded .  he bled to death in the middle of us .      ariel widened her eyes .     i   m sorry .  this is an inexcusable error .  my apologies .  i   m glad i asked .  i          when they loaded him into the ambulance  he was dead .  he died with his eyes open  ms .  burgess .  i tried to shut them .  they wouldn   t close  they just kept .  .  .  staring .  .  .         ms .  korolin  please .  i am very sorry .  this was a transcription error  obviously .  perhaps it was for his remains .         no  all the bodies have been sequestered by the authorities pending autopsy .  we were told it may be weeks before we can ship them home .         i see .  well .  thank you  ms .  korolin .  i   m frankly a little embarrassed about this .         don   t be .  i apologize if i spoke inappropriately .  i just  it hasn   t been easy since .  .  .         will you be up for tomorrow .  would you like to postpone .         no  not at all .  i need to get on with this .  if i wait another day  i might change my mind .         i understand .  in that case  i   ll let you get back to your privacy .  thank you for your time .         thank you .      the connection broke and ariel turned back to derec and mia .     i didn   t know the bodies had been sequestered .         it   s standard procedure  ariel     mia said .     even for foreign nationals  they   ll be at the sector morgue  attached to the reed hospital complex .      ariel nodded .      so if     derec said     tro aspil died  then who is on the way back to aurora .         we need to verify that tro is the one who did die     ariel said .      then     mia said     you need to get into the morgue .  normally  i   d be able to get you in  but right now i   m not one of the living myself .      ariel looked up  almost grinning .     i think i can arrange that .         fifteen    the civic morgue occupied a sublevel  well below the main hospital complex in reed district .  its innocuous fa  ade could have been easily missed  a plain metal door with an id scanner to its right  a plain sign above the lintel .  no other vehicles were in the small lot when the embassy limo pulled in .   derec stepped from the limo and tugged at the hem of the formal jacket ariel insisted he wear .  it did not quite fit and he kept pulling at the sleeves and shrugging as if to ease the tightness out of his shoulders .  he had been glad she had lacked the rest of the suit that went with it .   a second door was set into the wall a dozen or so meters from the visitors    entrance  one large enough for ambulances .  the space hummed with a deep background noise from above .  the place was unadorned  bare metal  struts and sheeting and harsh lights .  derec could not even find graffiti  as if by unspoken agreement no one intruded upon the area .   ariel led the way to the entrance  carrying herself with confidence  as if she did this all the time .  derec still wondered whom she had called for the authorization to get in here  but all she gave him was a secret smile as she had dug through a closet for the jacket .  she stopped at the door and slid her ill into the scanner .      speak your name and business  please     a tinny voice requested .  bored  monotone  human .      ariel burgess  auroran embassy  authorized survey of spacer bodies .      derec heard the slight hesitation on the last word  but did not look at her  keeping his hands clasped behind his back and acting the part of an ambassadorial aide .      i have clearance for one person     the voice said .     who is with you .         my aide  massey .         i repeat  i have clearance for one visitor .         check embassy protocols .  all embassy personnel of representative or liaison status are permitted one aide in the conduct of any official business .     she sounded just as bored as the unseen caretaker  with just a hint of impatience .  derec admired the act .   he imagined the person on the other end punching a terminal for information on the proper regulations  looking for anything that would get him dismissed or reprimanded  and probably wondering why tonight someone like ariel burgess had to show up to make him think about his job .      acknowledged     the man finally said .   the scanner extruded her ill and the door slid open .      massey .     derec asked sardonically .   ariel cocked her eyebrows at him but said nothing .  she led the way into the morgue .   the reception area was a long  cramped chamber  bracketed by the cubicle where the night attendant worked on one end  and the doorway into the morgue proper at the other .  between them were two rows of booths containing com and datum terminals .  the light  though standard  seemed oddly inadequate  the upholstery was dark  dark green  the floor a dingy grey  and the walls pale green .  even here derec caught the aseptic scent of chemicals and a metallic tang  subtler and somehow worse than typical hospital odors .   the attendant looked up from his desk to give them a disgruntled look  then returned his attention to whatever he had been doing before derec and ariel had disrupted his peace of mind .   ariel slid into the nearest booth and derec stood at the edge of the seat .      i have the batch number     she said .      batch .      she gave him a wry look  then tapped commands into the terminal .  derec let his gaze drift over the walls and ceiling  looking for eyes or ears  realizing even as he did so that they would not likely be obvious .  he glanced at the night attendant  who ignored them pointedly .      you don   t think they   re overstaffed here  do you .     he asked .      according to the log  there are two doctors on duty tonight and three orderlies .      derec leaned closer to read over her head .     as long as we   re here  why don   t we see .  .  .         i   m checking     ariel said .  after several seconds she gave a surprised    huh .     and sat back .     they   re all in the same lab .      derec studied the screen .  there were eight labs  each with its own storage .  he read down the list ariel had pulled up and saw all the names from the union station incident appended to one lab  number six .   ariel stabbed another key and a chit extruded from a slot beside the screen .     please follow the guidon     a small voice told them from the terminal .   the chit glowed green in her hand .   the door into the lab area opened on their approach .  a strip along the floor pulsed green  leading the way down the long  wide corridor past door after numbered door until the green chit ariel held turned red .   she inserted the chit into the slot next to the door  which slid aside .   derec could not define the smell .  a hybrid of medicinal sterility and stale air  mingled perhaps with his own preconceptions of a necropolis  decay  wet stone  mustiness .  but he saw nothing damp  the room was metal and plastic  and nothing here rotted .   the room reminded him of nothing so much as a library  with neat rows of cabinets  each drawer a number matched to a manifest  the contents awaiting study .  for a moment he imagined himself lying in one of these files  still and empty of life  a shape  unconnected to anything he had ever done .  he shuddered .   another door led to the lab where the autopsies were performed .  he shivered again  heavily .   ariel stood before a datum set at in the right hand wall from the entrance .  derec joined her .      i   ve got the manifests     she said absently  scrolling slowly through the names .  she was in the cs .      aspil  right .     derec reminded her .      um .  .  .  yes .     she scrolled back to the beginning of the list .     row three  number five d .      derec followed a pace behind .  ariel moved slowly now and derec thought he understood .  reluctance  ill ease  sadness .  she had known this person  differently than the others  a few of whom she had met but none that had meant more than a brief bio on a publicity jacket and maybe a drink while talking inconsequentials .  even aspil she had not known well  she had told him  though she knew him well enough that it made a difference .  they had met at the calvin institute on aurora .  she had spent three days with him giving orientation on institute policy regarding export of robots to settler colonies .  three days  business  dinners afterward  time for personal conversations .  sufficient to make him more than just a face and a name and an assignment .  a week later she was on a ship to earth  with other things filling her attention  and she had given tro aspil no further thought until his name had come up on a list of the dead .   she strolled down row three  reading numbers .  the drawers were stacked six high .  somewhere around here  derec thought  there must be a lifter platform .  but    d    was at shoulder height .  ariel stared at the plain grey square  the number in black in the center .   derec almost reached for the button .  ariel   s hand shot out and stabbed it .  she stepped back as the drawer ex tended .   the naked body lay beneath a transparent canopy .  it looked artificial  skin the wrong color  eyes closed too tightly  hair too neat and stiff .  a wound puckered halfway down the neck .      it   s tro     ariel said  her voice small and controlled .      then who took his flight back to aurora .         i don   t know .     she pressed the button and the drawer withdrew  back into its slot .  she gazed at it thoughtfully for a few seconds  then turned away .     what other discrepancies are there .      she went back to the datum where the manifest remained on the screen .      what the .  .  .     she hissed .   derec looked over her shoulder .      mia daventri     he read .     but          all the bodies from union station are here .  that   s what i meant when i said they stored them all together .         mia wasn   t killed at union station .         she   s part of the same event  it just took a few more hours to kill her .     she frowned .     there are six bodies i don   t recognize from the casualty lists .      derec skimmed the names she pointed out .  rimmer  iklan  cutchin  milmor  rotison  and wollin .     the assassins .         it doesn   t say  does it .     she pulled a portable datum from her jacket and entered the names and the tracking numbers assigned by the morgue .  there was no other information .   derec looked self consciously back at the entrance .     somehow i would expect guards or .  .  .  something .  .  .         no one comes to the morgue except those who absolutely have to .  what would they be defending .  who would steal a corpse .         still .  .  .      ariel nodded .     it feels wrong  though  doesn   t it .      derec tapped the screen on mia daventri   s name .     it is wrong .      ariel touched her lips with a straight finger .     let   s take a look  shall we .      mia   s drawer slid out  revealing a badly charred skeleton .  derec met ariel   s eyes over the top of the canopy and saw her wondering the same thing  who .   eliton   s drawer was in the next aisle .  derec pressed the contact  his heart racing as it emerged .  upon seeing eliton  he felt oddly relieved .   the features matched  but lacked the vitality derec recalled .  the shell gave no hint of the energy eliton possessed and displayed  nothing of his passions .  three puckered mounds traced a line from his left shoulder to his sternum .      he looks .  .  .         yes     ariel said .     death takes everything .     she frowned and did a slow examination down the corpse   s entire length .      what .     derec asked .      i .  .  .  nothing .     she closed the drawer .      humadros .      ariel drew a deep breath  then shook her head .      we should verify them all     derec said .  he raised his eyes upward slightly .   she caught his meaning and nodded .     all right .  let   s finish .        derec experienced a profound sense of relief when the limo pulled away from the morgue .  he shrugged out of the too tight jacket and pulled his own back on .  ariel gazed out her window  a frown pulling a crease into the space above her nose .      something   s bothering you     derec said .      brilliant .  how long did it take you to deduce that .         sarcasm .  i didn   t think you cared anymore .      instead of the sharp comeback he expected  she said     none of this is making sense .  the problem is  i can   t see how it   s not .         such as .            if tro is dead in the morgue  then who took his seat on the shuttle .         clones .      ariel made a face .     except for some very limited organ regrowth  cloning is completely illegal on earth .  they   re more frightened of that than robots .         but we   re not talking legal here  are we .      ariel shrugged but did not reply .      unless it   s just a glitch     derec said .     the ticket was bought  the name was never deleted  the seat stayed reserved .  this has all happened fast .         we can check that .  car  take us to union station .         yes  ambassador     the car replied flatly .      then     ariel continued     the burned corpse under mia   s name .         yes .  .  .  that wouldn   t have been possible even if she had died .  i saw the room .  everything in it was vaporized .         how come the whole facility didn   t go up .         contained explosion  what they call a    bubble nuke .      stasis fields and so forth .  very sophisticated  very expensive .         parapoyos .      derec shrugged .     the trouble with kynig parapoyos  as i understand it  is that he   s everywhere .  might as well blame a devil or some other supernatural force .  but  yes  something like that would be in his line .  very thorough  too .  agent sathen told me that nothing was recoverable .         sathen .         do you know him .         i spoke to him yesterday .  he was very uncooperative .  but not willingly .  it seemed to me like he   d been given orders not to talk about the situation .         hmm .  he seemed open to me  but i spoke to him just after it happened .  anyway  there would be no corpse  even if mia hadn   t got out .         so that body      ariel began .        whoever it might be            wasn   t just placed there so that there could be a body            it was placed to contradict the intensity of the blast            and keep anyone from wondering about the source .         exactly .      ariel looked at him .     and sathen .         who could silence him .         his own people .         which is just what your friend mia suspects .         i talked to the nurse who was on duty that night .  she told me two other agents came in and sathen got into an argument with them .         did she remember their names .         one of them .  cupra .      derec laughed sharply .     the other one is agent gambel .          you know them .         they   re the pair who threw me out of union station .  they had all the right documents .  when i checked  their authority was verified .  i couldn   t argue .         but you kept the copy of the ri .          what copy .      ariel chuckled  shaking her head .     derec  derec  derec .  .  .  you are a naughty boy .      derec smiled .     i knew you would appreciate my finer qualities .         the question is  why would the same two agents show up at the medical facility mia was in .         they   ve taken charge of the entire investigation .  my guess would be that they needed to debrief her .         and instead they try to kill her .         that   s something of a leap  don   t you think .         is it .     ariel asked .      well  it could have been bok golner .         someone would have had to set it up for him .      they rode in silence for a time .  derec watched the urbanscape pass  mulling over the conclusions hovering just out of reach .  he agreed with ariel   s guess about cupra and gambel  but there was no more than coincidence on which to base it .  even with mia   s assertion that there had to be a special service component to the entire affair  derec wanted something concrete before he embraced the belief that earth   s own security people were responsible for what amounted to the worst diplomatic catastrophe of the decade  perhaps the century .      ambassador     the limo suddenly said     this unit is being followed .      ariel leaned forward .     show me .      the screen mounted between the seats facing them winked on  displaying the rear view .  the limo made a right turn and a few moments after  another transport made the same turn .      identify     ariel said .      no registration available     the limo said .      this car isn   t positronic  is it .     derec asked .      i wish .  car  how far to union station .         ten minutes at current course and speed .         proceed as normal .  let me know if that vehicle begins to gain on us .         yes  ambassador .         when did you get a promotion .     derec asked .   ariel waved dismissively .     it   s programmed to respond to the primary passenger that way unless specifically told otherwise .  sometimes i really hate it here .         you miss your robots .         damn right i do .  at least you get to play with some  when you   re not building killers .      derec   s face warmed .     excuse me .      ariel scowled but would not look at him .     i beg your pardon .  i didn   t mean that .         yes  you did .  do you want to explain it .         why should i .  you know perfectly well what i mean .         bogard .      ariel extended her hand  palm up  in a gesture that said  there  see .  you knew what i meant .      bogard   s purpose is to protect humans     derec said .      by being willing to harm other humans .         it   s not that simple .         evidently not .  it failed .         not with agent daventri .         oh  it messed up the first time and now it   s doing better to compensate .  why did it let senator eliton die .  there are three holes in that man that shouldn   t have been there .         i don   t know why bogard failed .  i can   t find out till she releases it to me and i can run a proper diagnostic on it .     derec   s anger filled him suddenly .     you never have accepted the idea that robots needn   t be straitjacketed by the three laws  that the nature of positronics can be applied to allow wider discretion       he stopped  realizing that she was no longer listening .  ariel stared into the middle distance  her face expressionless but her eyes bright .      what .     he demanded .      hmm .  i      she shook her head .     i   m sorry .  i didn   t mean to bring this up now .      and she looked away from him  pointedly ending the conversation .  derec knew better than to try to force her to continue .  he sat and seethed until the limo arrived at union station .      so when did you get a promotion .     he asked again .      two of those bodies were ambassador setaris   s top aides .  i ended up next in line .         no  you don   t .  they could draft some junior legate .      ariel shrugged .     since the situation involves a positronic unit  it made sense to have me step in as setaris   s chief aide .  for the time being .         you   re being set up to take the blame if anything goes wrong .         are you surprised .  typical auroran politics .      she still sounded distracted .  derec was surprised to find himself worried for her  but right now it did not seem to matter to her .   the limo stopped on the apron of the main gallery .      car     ariel said     you will return to the embassy garage .         yes  ambassador .         we   re finding another way back .     derec asked as he got out .      we can use the auroran embassy offices here     ariel said .   derec searched the boulevard for their shadow but saw nothing unusual in the cluster of cabs and limos crowding against the apron .   the normality of union station troubled him .  two days ago derec had entered upon a scene of violence and terror  now it seemed as though nothing had happened .  the gallery echoed with the sounds of foot traffic and conversation  the p .  a .  announced boarding for a shuttle  the floor gleamed with new polish .   there was still a trace of the powder bums along the wall .   derec felt anxious all the way to the customer service desk .  he realized then that he half expected a security guard to eject him .  he glanced up at the row of windows that overlooked the gallery  where he had been two days ago .   at the desk  derec had planned to use a self service datum .  instead  the small consoles were all shuttered .  a young man greeted them with a vague smile .      can i be of service .     he asked .      are the datums down .     derec asked .      for a few days .  we   re going through a complete systems overhaul .  in the meantime  i can help you .      ariel shrugged .     fine .  i   d like to confirm a passenger .      the attendant nodded and glanced down at his own console  hidden from derec and ariel by the desk .     do you have the flight number .      ariel checked her portable datum .     shuttle flight two seven k dash one one nine a .  yesterday at four fifteen am .         shuttle to kopernik station .  it launched on schedule .         seat e twenty .         confirmed for a mr .  aspil  tro .  final destination .  .  .  aurora on the liner corismun .         i   d like to confirm that he actually took the flight .      the young man looked up  not quite frowning .     is this official .         he   s an auroran citizen     ariel said  digging out her id     and i   m from the auroran embassy .         but          it   s not official yet  but it could be .  i   m trying to save everyone some headaches .      the attendant checked her id .  he looked unhappy for several seconds  then shrugged .     i suppose there   s no problem just checking to see if he boarded .     he handed the id back and worked at his console .   derec turned around to survey the gallery .  something bothered him about the scene .  the access to the service areas was guarded by uniformed security people .  a small truck sat against the wall bearing the imbitek logo .  that was an obvious difference .  what nagged at him felt more subtle  less .  .  .   no robots  he realized .  none  not even the mindless mobile drones that usually scuttled about with luggage or messages or food .  instead  he saw humans doing those jobs .      i have mr .  aspil checking in at three twenty to board the four fifteen shuttle     the attendant said .     according to the record  he was logged visually and verified .      ariel sighed .     fine .  thank you .      derec turned back to the young man .     can i ask  when was his ticket purchased .         um .  .  .  six weeks ago .      ariel blinked .     who bought it for him .         according to my records  he bought it himself .         could you give us the account number .     derec asked .   the attendant openly frowned now .     we   re not really          listen     derec said  placing a hand on the desk top in front of the attendant     there are some irregularities with this and if necessary we can get authorization to go through the records without your help .  that might cause you some problems if it has to be explained to your supervisors that we   re rummaging through files because someone didn   t cooperate when it would have saved time and trouble .      the young man   s face darkened briefly .  then he shrugged again .     it   s not worth my job .  here .     he handed a printout to derec .     you didn   t get it from me .         i   ve never seen you before     derec said  taking the slip .      thank you     ariel said .  as they walked away  she said quietly     it is contrary to service regulations to divulge personal information without proper authorization .      derec shrugged .     he won   t have a job next week anyway  he   s a temp .  he probably doesn   t know the regulations .  but he certainly doesn   t want an unsatisfactory mark on his performance record .     he gestured around the gallery .     did you notice .  no robots .         it   s a shame .  this place felt           like home .      ariel snorted .     no place on earth feels like that .  i was going to say    civilized     but that   s not right .  it felt safe .         because of the robots .      ariel nodded .  she held up her datum .     who bought tro a ticket back home six weeks before he even arrived .         shows a little foresight  doesn   t it .         on whose part .      derec gave the service entrance another look .     i need to get in there  before they rip everything out .      ariel pointed to an archway guarded by two uniformed security men .     embassy offices are through there .      the archway opened onto a long concourse .  on either side  stairs at ten meter intervals led up to narrow corridors .  ariel entered the one nearest the far end .  the corridor ran five meters to an ornate  metal finished door that  derec guessed  was heavily armored .  ariel slipped her id into the reader and a moment later the door opened for them .   the reception desk made a graceful arc  halving the floor space in the antechamber .  a single attendant sat dozing  head propped on fist  before the elegantly molded bank of monitors to his right .  at times derec missed auroran luxury  but it could be overwhelming .  the walls cascaded with a complex blue and yellow pattern that seemed to shift like falling water as he moved .  the desk almost glowed from its high polish .  the air was scented  and the carpet gave a good two centimeters underfoot  absorbing all sound from their tread .      are we on duty or is this your nap time .     ariel asked .   the attendant jerked awake  blinking up at them .  he blushed briefly and cleared his throat .     sorry  ambassador .  how can i be of service .         i need a private office .         yes  ambassador .  um .  .  .  no one else is here  so use any of them .     he gestured vaguely behind him .      thank you .      derec followed her down a short hallway  past three doors  and through a fourth .  the office was slightly less decorated than the antechamber .      aren   t you curious     derec asked     who followed us from the morgue .         of course i am .  but how do you propose to find out without causing a scene .     .      since when have you been worried about that .         i   m not  but i won   t waste it .  i want to find out what   s going on .  if we start confronting people too early  we might find ourselves restrained .  blocked at the very least .     she extended a hand .     let me see the flimsy .      derec took the printout from his pocket and studied it .     it gives an account number but no other name than aspil   s .     he handed it to her .      we can see if it   s an embassy account  at least     ariel said  sitting down at the datum terminal .  she entered the number and waited .  she frowned .     that   s interesting .  it   s an embassy account  all right  but not ours .  solarian .         but          tro was auroran  yes .  .  .  and the flight terminates at aurora .      ariel stared at the screen for several seconds  then forwarded the data to her apartment .      the ticket was purchased six weeks ago     derec said .   ariel nodded .     before tro arrived .  and the ticket was bought here .         why would the solarians kill their own people .         it wouldn   t make sense  would it .  besides which  the union station ri was a point of pride to them .  seeing it all fail           speaking of which  it would be a good thing if i could get back there to look at the ri .         hmm .  oh .     ariel worked her terminal again .     wait a second .  .  .  i initiated a log search before we left regarding this alleged directive not to report minor errors to you .  i want to see if it   s turned anything .  .  .     she frowned at the terminal .     no .  it did not come from us .  nor from any other office of the auroran embassy .     she looked at derec .     i could do an offworld search to see if my predecessor did  but i doubt we   d find anything .  that would mean collusion and there   d be no trail .         none to speak of .     he gestured at the datum .     uh  the ri .         oh  yes .     she touched a few more contacts .     there   s the schema for this branch .      derec leaned over the desk and studied the screen .     all right .  .  .  there   s a service entrance here for the robot staff .  it says it   s been sealed off .         be my guest .     she smiled ruefully .     if you get caught  this office will deny any knowledge     derec snorted and turned away .  ariel laughed .   the hallway outside the offices made a sharp turn at the very back and narrowed even more .  it was barely wide enough for a single person carrying a tray now  which was more than enough room for a robot with the same tray .   it opened into a circular chamber containing three wall niches  now empty of robots .  as a concession to terran authority  even the embassy robots had been slaved to the ri here .  to his left was a plain metal door with a simple positronic scanner .  below the scanner was an override control .   from his jacket pocket  derec took out a small square that resembled an id chit .  its surface  however  showed the faint outlines of a keypad and one edge was thicker than the rest of the square .  he was proud of this device  though he had never before found it necessary to use .  he slid it into the override scanner and pressed one of the contacts .  a moment later  one contact lit up .  he pressed the next and so on until the door accepted the code the device had developed from its interaction with the mechanism and slid open .   the only illumination in the tunnels beyond came from clusters of readylights .  derec felt his way along until he came to a brighter area  then he stepped from the robot accessways into a human use passage lined with dim amber panels .  he followed it until he came to a branch  then guessed from memory which way he needed to go .   the machinery that operated all the station facilities surrounded the public areas  hidden in the walls and beneath the floors .  peel away the skin inside and outside union station and a network of tubes  corridors  conduit  shafts  and cables would be revealed  resembling in its complex density the internal organs of a living thing .  since it had been retrofitted for the ri and robotics  a good deal of the network contained open spaces for humans  service nodes and maintenance stations  which made it easier for derec to find his way .  signs were posted giving locations and directions .   it was late .  derec thought it unlikely that he would run into any workers at this hour  but he walked carefully anyway .   he wanted to find one of the maintenance nodes  since the curious data loops rana had found all centered on maintenance nodes .  they were scattered throughout the complex network  junctions which served several purposes  beginning with the monitoring of the data traffic that rushed throughout the system at light  speed .  the junctions broke down the task of maintaining  repairing  and supervising the day to day functions that kept union station working into discreet units  each with its own supply and repair staff .  until the incident  that staff had been robotic .  prior to the installation of the ri and the station   s conversion to positronics  humans did the work .  now  derec imagined  they would again .   he turned a corner and lurched back at the sight of a row of people .  he waited for them to come after him .  when they did not  he looked again and saw that it was only a row of robots in their niches .   pulse racing  he quickly walked by them .   a maintenance node stood at the end of the row .  derec squeezed through the narrow opening  into the hexagonal chamber .  a worklamp came on automatically at his presence .   the node was being disassembled .  cables and router boxes hung from their places  forgotten for the time being  a mess .  derec tried to piece together how it would operate  but too much was missing .  he lifted one of the router boxes and turned it over .  one face looked pitted  hundreds of tiny holes allover it  the plastic casing discolored as if it had been heated .  he found two more in about the same condition .   the next one  though  was intact .   he opened the access doors and peered in at the neatly organized components .  nothing looked disturbed .  he pushed and pulled at cables to get his hands inside the mass  feeling around for .  .  .  he did not know .   but he found it in one of the racks at the base of the walls .   the space was filled with transfer buffers  large memory dumps that held the millions of bits of data required by the station until needed .  tucked between two of them was a mass of greenish blue corrosion .   no  not corrosion .  more like mold or some other fungus .  derec prodded it  but the surface did not yield  nor did it seem brittle .  it appeared to be grown to the transfer buffers .  he worked a fingernail into the join between a buffer wall and the growth and pried .  fibrous tendrils had sunk into the buffer .   he had nothing on him to work at the material .  he went back to one of the other maintenance nodes  where the work crew had left some tools  and took a plain screwdriver .  he pried and chipped at the growth until a small amount flaked off .  he wrapped it in the printout from the station and slipped it into his pocket .   he made his way back to the embassy branch  unable to shake the growing sense of dread that seemed to spread over and through him .      sixteen    the robot caused ariel to flinch every time she saw it .  she brushed past it  impatient with her own reactions  and strode into her living room  derec close behind .   mia was still on the sofa  her datum in her lap  the subetheric on  frozen at a scene from the massacre .  it showed  magnified  a clutch of people huddling together  faces stretched in panic  bodies twisted and angled as if about to fall to the floor .  from the clothing  the group was terran .  ariel recognized no one .  the image was so different from the scene she had seen in union station not two hours ago that it seemed from another reality .   mia looked up .      and .     she asked archly .   ariel stared at the image .     all present and accounted for  including you .  someone has thoughtfully put a burned body in your morgue stasis drawer .      the expression on the younger woman   s face made ariel immediately regret her words .  mia   s mouth fell partly open and she paled visibly  her eyes seeming to go darker still and more desolate .      we checked at union station     derec said     and someone calling himself tro aspil did show up to take his seat on the shuttle .  so either the corpse in the morgue is aspil and someone else is heading for aurora            or aspil   s body is a fake     mia said  nodding .     like mine .         but your double doesn   t even have to look like you     ariel said .     the only way to prove it isn   t you would be a dna scan .         i   m sure that has already been flied     mia said .  she gave her shoulders a twist as if to relieve tension  then pointed at the screen .     i   ve been doing a tally .      ariel sat down on the sofa beside her .  mia   s datum screen showed two columns of names .      bogard had a master list of everyone scheduled to be at the ceremony     mia said .     i pulled a list of casualties from the newsnets and started running the vids for a match .         any discrepancies .     ariel asked .      none so far  but i began doing trajectories .  when we found out that several of the assailants were just projections  i wondered then just how many real shots were fired .  bogard helped me edit the newsnet recordings you have into a single composite .         how are you doing the tracking .     derec asked .     bogard   s sensory net is as good as it gets  but even subetheric recordings don   t have that kind of detail .         bogard was able to identify nine actual shooters out of the twenty one apparent assailants .  by studying the recoil of their weapons  it gives us a reliable estimate of how many shots were actually fired .  then it   s just a matter of tracing the consequences .         nine     ariel mused .     you caught three of them .  three of them were killed on the scene .         so we can assume three of them are still at large .  there may have been accomplices outside the gallery waiting to facilitate an escape .  we don   t know .         six bodies i couldn   t identify are in the morgue  in the same section with all the victims     ariel said .     i have a list of names and tracking codes .      mia frowned .     the three i captured were still alive when bogard brought us back into the gallery .         these six may not be anything more than innocent bystanders who got in the way .  we have to check the names .      mia shrugged .     i   ve tried running enhancements on them  to see if facial features show through the masks  but they padded the masks .  what i have found so far is an emerging pattern of targeting .  i   m not finished  so this isn   t final  but it appears they were working from a specific list .  it wasn   t just a capricious act of terror .      ariel blinked at the image on her subetheric .     well  we know they wanted humadros and eliton .  .  .         maybe .  at least  yes  they were part of it .  let me finish this before i say any more .     she turned to the robot .     bogard .  let   s continue .         at some point     derec said     i   m going to have to have bogard back to do a full diagnostic and debriefing .      mia did not look up from her datum  only nodded .  ariel saw clearly that she did not like the idea of giving up the robot .  not yet .      how are you feeling .     ariel asked .     can you walk yet .         oh  i hobbled to the bathroom twice while you were gone .  things are improving .  your medical robot said another three days for the healing accelerants to work through completely .         no problem .  i can guarantee privacy for that long .  of course  this is ruining my social life .      mia smiled thinly .     sorry .         don   t worry about it .  i didn   t have anything this exciting planned for at least another month .     she stood and gave derec a significant look  then headed for her bedroom .   as she had hoped  derec followed .   she closed the door behind him .      stop pestering her for bogard     ariel said .   derec frowned .     excuse me .         she   s terrified .  right now bogard is the only thing making her feel safe .  every time you ask to have it back she gets scared .  stop it .         look  bogard has data we need .  we can   t just ask for it  i have to download it from its buffers .  in order to do that  i need bogard back at phylaxis .         give it a little time          how much do you want .  we have a situation here and i don   t think we have the luxury of a few days or a week before we get at the information bogard has .         right now we have    more information than we know what to do with .  none of it   s making sense .         and neither are you .  since when can you have too much information .         when most of it   s useless  noise .  like that mess you   ve got from the union station ri .      derec drew himself up and ariel braced for a fight .  she knew that look and could predict all that followed it  and suddenly she felt extremely tired .  she held up her hands .      just back off asking for bogard for now .  i   ll talk to mia in the morning and see what i can do .  she   s my friend .      unexpectedly  derec let out a long breath and nodded .      all right .  i need to check in with rana  anyway .     he turned away  hands on hips  and surveyed her bedroom .     nice     he said .     you   ve been doing well for yourself .         if i had time to enjoy it  life would be wonderful     ariel said .  she winced at the sharp look of hurt he gave her .     derec  i   m too tired to think straight anymore .         i   m going .      she followed him to the apartment door .      i   ll call first thing     he said .     this whole situation .  .  .         a mess  isn   t it .      derec grunted .      watch your back     ariel said .   he nodded  lingering a moment longer  as if he had something more to say .  but he only smiled tightly and left .   on the sofa  mia typed at her datum while bogard stood motionless before the subetheric .  people moved on the screen  molasses slow  dying again .   ariel went back to her bedroom .  she did not remember lying down .        ariel .         hmm .         wake up  ariel .  ariel .         wha  who   .         ariel  wake up .  i have to ask you something .         go    way .         ariel .      someone grabbed her right shoulder and shook her .  ariel   s eyes snapped open and she rolled away from the touch .     what .         ariel .      she rubbed her eyes  groggy and disoriented .     mia .  what time is it .         you don   t want to know .  i need to ask you something .         what .         who made the final list of invitees for the podium .      ariel sat on the edge of her bed .  she noticed then that she still wore her clothes .     jennie     she called     bring me a cup of coffee .     she stood and stretched .  her limbs vibrated from weariness  not enough sleep .  again .   mia stood on the opposite side of the bed  waiting .      who made what .     ariel asked .      the final list of invitees .  who did that .         you don   t know .         we   re just security  all we got was the finished list and a set of orders .         well .  .  .  it was a joint decision .  .  .  humadros had her end already finalized and simply sent us a copy of her list .  .  .  then ambassador setaris and ambassador chassik worked with senator eliton on the list here .  why .      mia hobbled toward the door .     someone else must have gotten hold of it .  like i said before  from what i can tell the targets were preselected .  they knew exactly who they wanted to take out .  bogard verified that assumption .      ariel watched mia limp out of her room .  who had put together that list .  she wondered  irritated then at how muddled she felt .  r .  jennie entered the room with a tray bearing a single cup of steaming liquid .      get me a stim as well  jennie     ariel said  taking the cup and brushing past the robot .   she glanced at the time as she entered the living room and groaned .  only four hours of sleep .  she felt on the verge of lousy now  the rest of the day would be little better .  she sipped coffee  wincing at the hot fluid .      what do you mean .     she asked .   mia dropped onto the couch .     bogard  explain to ariel what we found .      bogard stood alongside the subetheric screen  with the remote in its hand .  the scene projected shifted several times until it showed a wide view of the stage and the mass of black clad attackers huddling at the edge .      once we isolated the corporeal subjects from the projections     bogard explained     we began making a determination of the number of shots fired and targets struck .  this was accomplished through a combination of identifying each impact and backtracking the trajectory to a given weapon and counting the number of times each weapon was fired .         how did you do that .         the explosive charge used to impel the projectiles appears to be a fast burning  high heat substance which burns up its own residue  therefore producing no visible  debris upon exit of the projectile .  however  there is a heat bloom at the end of the barrel which distorts light passing through it .  linking each instance with a given sound  we have determined the number of shots fired to within ninety eight percent accuracy .  coupled with the impact traces  we have a positive number of shots fired to wounds inflicted .         which is .         point nine three .      ariel stared at the robot for a number of seconds .  she took a mouthful of coffee  then noticed r .  jennie standing beside her with a tray containing a single pill .  ariel took it and swallowed it .      wait     she said to bogard .     you mean they never missed .  not one stray bullet .         two stray bullets .  twenty fatalities  thirty three wounded .  fifty five actual shots fired by the corporeal attackers .         one of the misses was me     mia said .     apparently .  given that gel and mattu  my teammates  were killed .             there were other shots .         yes     mia said quietly .     a few of us returned fire .  we did kill three of them  but i   d wager that they must have been wearing diffusion harnesses to divert the energy .  but mainly we shot the projections .         but if they were just projections          the bolts went through and struck bystanders .  several of the injured among the spectators were from our weapons .      ariel looked at mia .  her eyes were closed and she looked pale .  the side of her jaw worked delicately  angrily .  clearly the realization that she may have harmed or killed innocent people hurt in ways ariel found hard to imagine .  she waited while mia worked through the spasm of conscience .   finally  mia    s eyes opened .     interestingly enough  we found one major discrepancy in these numbers .  it seems clear that the intention was to kill all fifty three of the people hit .  those who lived survived by sheer luck .  but one of those fifty three was not senator eliton .         not .  .  .  .      mia looked at bogard .     bogard .         there is no correlation between the injury manifested in any of the recordings and a shot from the attackers     the robot said .     all of fifty three shots fired are accounted for among the casualties  one miss is accounted for by agent daventri  leaving one stray shot which from appearances was fired in the direction of senator eliton  but which missed .         eliton was a casualty  though     ariel said .      that cannot now be verified     bogard said .     no actual shot struck him .  though he appears injured  there is no correlation that i can determine with an assassin   s bullet .  i am not  therefore  counting him as one of the casualties .         the recording shows a wound     ariel said .     i saw his body .  he had       ariel stopped  remembering the corpse in the stasis tube .  she thought about it carefully  questioning the memory  but it was accurate .      the body i saw had three wounds     she noted .   mia frowned .     these people  whoever they are  exhibited tremendous skill as marksmen .  one shot  one wound .  that   s consistent with the idea that they   re ex military  trained by a man who was very good at killing  which bok golner apparently was .  as far as i can determine  they never wasted a second shot on anyone .  bogard can   t find the shot  the shot  mind you  that killed senator eliton  and according to the recordings he was hit only once .  are you sure you saw three wounds .         absolutely .  one here      ariel touched her left shoulder      here      her sternum      and here .     her right side just below the ribs .  she shook her head .     it was eliton  though .  .  .         uh huh .  the same way maybe that the skeleton you saw was me .      ariel blew out a breath .     let   s go through this again .  bogard  walk me through the whole scenario .  jennie  make more coffee .     she looked wryly at mia .     i   m going to pay for this at work later .        dawn was minutes away .  the horizon was already lightening .  ariel stared at it  seeing it and not seeing it  her mind filled with the details of trajectories and impacts and target possibilities and invitation lists and all the minutiae of a disaster .  the subetheric was on  the volume low  ignored  while she tried to let calm of some sort settle through her mind .  mia dozed on the sofa .   too much information  she had told derec  was information composed mostly of noise  meaningless and irrelevant .  now she wondered if there could be too much worthwhile data .  nothing they had developed in the last few hours could be dismissed as irrelevant .   taking out ambassador humadros and her immediate staff  senator eliton and his aides  and as many other important delegates as possible had at first been an obvious goal of the assault .  but now ariel was not so sure .  ambassador chassik had escape uninjured  though two of his staff had not .  killing setaris   s aides seemed pointless  as neither of them  nor setaris  were to have any significant role at the conference .  nor did killing eliton   s security team make much sense  as they really knew nothing .   the weapons had been handmade .  ancient machines  only museum samples of the originals remained  but someone had gone to the trouble of building new ones .  nothing much had been said about them so far on any of the newsnets .  old  obsolete perhaps  but terribly effective  obscenely so given that the projectiles could potentially go through a body and injure someone else behind the target .  because of the angle and other factors  that had not happened this time  but mia had pointed out that if nine of these weapons existed  there was every reason to believe that there were many more of them  somewhere .   mia had tracked the names of the six unknown bodies in the morgue through civic records  using ariel   s authority to access the files .  factory workers  an office clerk  two unemployed and on civic assistance .  the only thing she had found that bound them together was their affiliation with osma  order of the supremacy of man again  otherwise known as managins .  mia thought there could be something else in their backgrounds  but it would take time to get at it .  mia could only assume that these were the six assassins who had not escaped  and three of them should not be dead .  they had been in service custody .  one of them had been lemus milmor .   the invitee lists troubled ariel the most .  if a copy had gotten out  it could only have done so from a few sources .  eliton had had a copy  but so had setaris and  presumably  chassik .  special service had a list since bogard had it .  the list had been finalized only ten days earlier .  time for a leak  certainly  but it would still have had to be a leak from one of those sources .  anyone else .  had any of the industrialists present possessed a copy .  there was no way to tell .  somehow the managins had gotten it and a team of assassins had been assigned targets .  was there anything about the target list that could give a hint .  perhaps  but ariel was exhausted  and she had embassy work to do today .   but she could not sleep .  her head buzzed with too many details .   she glanced at the subetheric and started to see jonis on the screen .  she grabbed the remote and turned up the sound .        into it as thoroughly as humanly possible     he was saying     but so far i   m told we have no leads .         what about the captured gunmen .     a reporter out of the picture asked .     has their interrogation produced any tangible results .      jonis looked embarrassed .     frankly  we won   t get anything from them .  apparently  they were inadvertently killed while in the process of being apprehended and arrested .         killed .  by whom .  special service agents .         no  not exactly .  i  uh  haven   t been given the full details  it   s all very classified at the moment  but the  uh  robot assigned to senator eliton   s security detail may have had something to do with it .         you mean the same robot that failed to protect senator eliton and later exploded  killing the last surviving member of his security team .         uh  yes  that robot .  it may have exerted excessive force in the apprehension of the  uh  suspects .  it   s being looked into .      ariel glanced over at mia and saw her friend staring fixedly at the screen  her entire body rigid with attention .      this doesn   t say very much of senator eliton   s interests in promoting the reintroduction of robots on earth     the reporter said .      that may be premature     jonis said .  still  he looked as if he agreed with the assessment .     we   ll have to wait for all the facts and assessments before making a final judgement .  i don   t want to say anything to belittle clar   s  senator eliton   s  beliefs .         of course .  if i may ask          that   s enough for now .  i have to get to my committee .         but senator       ariel turned the subetheric off .      shit     she muttered      amen     mia said .   ariel made herself stand .  she had to call someone .  by the time she reached her comline  she decided that it should be derec .      seventeen    i should have gone to my apartment  derec thought as he entered the phylaxis lab .  he stood in the entry  feeling the weariness of the day  gazing at the empty lab .   not empty .  he heard the fragile impact of fingers on a keypad  then saw someone at one of the stations .  rana   s console was unattended  the screens blank .  the main lights were low .   derec stepped quietly toward the sound .  halfway down the left hand aisle  between the banks of equipment and workstations  he saw someone working at a console near the back of the room .  his pulse picked up until  a few meters closer  he recognized the man .      caro     derec said .   the man started  jerking his hands from the keypad as he twisted in his chair .  then he sighed heavily and shook his head .      hi  derec .         didn   t mean to startle you .      caro waved a hand .        sallright     he said  then yawned .     final report on the mobile units from union station .      derec thought for a moment  then remembered that caro and amson had been assigned to help decommission all the floor robots .      you just finished .         unless that heartless slaver chassik calls us back .  i sent amson home .  never saw her so beat .  we   ve been at it      he glanced at his wrist      damn  nearly thirty hours .         did you have any trouble with special service .         no  this was mostly off site .  by the time we were informed that special service had assumed authority over the investigation  most of the mobiles were gone  back in a warehouse  waiting transhipment .         shipment .  .  .  where .         back to solaria  i imagine .  ambassador chassik was most insistent that they all be shut down prior to shuttling  and the positronic logs  such as they were  downloaded and stored .      chassik .  derec went to his station and sat down .  he pulled the folded paper with the sample he had taken from union station from his pocket and put it in a drawer under the console .      you   re up early     caro said .      late  actually .  when did rana leave .         when i got here  about an hour or so ago .         any messages .         not that i know of .      derec watched caro work for a time  then heaved to his feet .     i need sleep .         are you going home .     caro asked .      no  i   ll stay here .      caro nodded absently .  derec drifted across the lab to the com and touched the log to see what messages were in the buffer .  nothing from senator taprin .  a message from joler hammis .  two from gale chassik at the solarian embassy .  three anonymous calls .  and a final note from rana .  nothing from his attorney .  he opened rana   s .      the brain is rebelling     she said .     mine  that is .  i need sleep  much as i hate to admit it .  not much progress after you left with ms .  burgess .  sorry .  talk to you tomorrow .      he opened joler hammis   s and was surprised to find a resume appended to a short note .      it seems union station no longer needs the services of a positronic specialist  mr .  avery .  i am available at your convenience .  please call .      the three anonymous calls contained no messages .  he shut down the com and went up to bed  his mind working at a low level .   chassik .  hammis .  robots being shipped back to solaria .   details .   he needed sleep badly .        derec .         mmm .  .  .         ariel burgess is on the com .  she won   t disconnect until she talks to you .      derec blinked  his eyes gummy .        m asleep .  i   ll call her later .         derec .  mr .  avery .      derec rolled over then .  rana never called him    mr .  avery    unless she was very upset .  he ran fingertips across his sleep encrusted eyes  wincing as a few lashes jerked loose .      time .         six thirty one .      derec groaned .     doesn   t anyone sleep anymore .     he sat up and sniffed .  the strong aroma of fresh coffee drew his attention .  he held out a hand and a moment later felt a cup placed against his palm .  warm .  he brought it to his mouth and drank cautiously .     all right .  all right  tell her i   ll be right there .         want me to route the call up here .     rana asked  walking toward the door .      sure .         and when you   re done with that  come down to the lab .  i have something to show you .      derec felt himself nod .  he sat there in the abrupt quiet  nursing the coffee  wondering what was so important that he had to interrupt what he remembered to be very good sleep .      derec .      he looked up at the sound of ariel   s voice .     oh .  yes  ariel .         do you have vid .         is it necessary .  you just woke me up .         don   t brag .  i   ve been up since four  i think .  what are you doing .         drinking coffee .          after that .         i have to review rana   s excavation .         good .  you can tell me what she found when you meet me .         i   m meeting you .         for lunch .  at the franklin park home kitchen .         what .         for old time   s sake .  you know where it is  don   t you .         of course          good .  then i   ll see you there at  what .  eleven thirty .         sure .  .  .         great .  i   m looking forward to it .      the connection died and derec stared at his com unit .  the franklin park home kitchen  on the k street corridor .  a home kitchen .  neither of them had had to eat at a public facility in years .  he doubted ariel had been to a home kitchen since her return to earth four years ago .  and why one so far away .  the spacer embassies were south  in the anacostia district  franklin park was north .      i   m not awake     he said aloud and looked down at his half empty cup .   he finished the coffee and showered  then stumbled downstairs to the lab  still feeling off balance .      morning     he said .   rana nodded  staring at her screens .   derec went to the com and tapped in joler hammis   s code .  he received a request to leave a message .      this is derec avery  mr .  hammis .  i   d be very interested in speaking with you at your convenience .  please let me know when would be a good time .  thank you .      he poured more coffee and sat down beside rana .  she began talking immediately  as if a switch had been thrown .      okay  the excavation has given me three discreet segments to study .  i   ve got the entire matrix just prior to the ri going off line in one segment  the same during the period it was off line  and the segment just after it came back online and began to collapse .  i isolated them all from each other  but i set up a marker base to follow the linkages .         you did all that after i left yesterday .  what time did you go home .      rana shrugged .     i don   t know  midnight .     she pointed to the screen .     now .  getting these three sets apart gave me a handle on the problem .  all those command nodes that we traced to maintenance .  the entire system shifted all its attention to them during the off line period .  it was as if the ri just let itself be sucked out of its own matrix to somewhere else .  of course  that left a lot of automatic functions  but even those were subsumed to a different set of operational parameters during this period .         wait  wait .  you   re saying that something drew all the higher level functions away from its primary duties .         more or less .  the maintenance nodes show exponentially increased stimulation  as if a tremendous amount of data was suddenly being pumped to those sites and demanding that the ri pay attention .  and it did .  complete attention .  basically  everything it was supposed to focus on became secondary .  not even that .  quaternary .  the only thing it seemed to be noticing outside these nodes were the mobile units .         and when it came back online .         from what i can see  it came back exactly at the point that it left  with one difference  the time chop .  it knew that minutes had gone by during which time it was not paying attention .  it couldn   t escape the conclusion that it had failed .  collapse began almost immediately .         thales     derec called out     are you still running union station .         no  derec  not all of it     the ri responded .     i am being shut out systematically as systems are being changed over to newly installed imbitek systems .         but you were doing it all .         for twelve hours  twenty three minutes  derec .         while you maintained full oversight of union station  did you run a diagnostic of satellite systems .         yes  derec .  i needed to know what i had to work with .  standard procedure in a new environment .         of course .  did you find anything unusual .         several systems were of a type of imbedded technology with which i am unfamiliar .  nothing out of my capacity to interpret and operate  only new configurations .         what about .  .  .  rana  is there a list of those maintenance nodes .         sure .     she touched contacts .  a list appeared on her screen .      what about these sites  thales .     derec asked .      there was nothing at those sites  derec .          what do you mean  nothing .         i mean that i found no corresponding systems of any sort answering my diagnostic interrogatory at those sites .         but the union station ri showed them to be active .         i cannot account for the discrepancy  derec .  i acknowledge the data from the ri  but my own diagnostic and analysis showed nothing at those sites .  it is possible that those sites suffered damage or were programmed to operate only at predetermined times or were programmed to shut down at a predetermined time .         how much access do you still have to union station .         i have been excluded from sixty two percent of the systems     thales stated .      can you still monitor those sites .         three of them are still within my sphere .         watch them .  i want to know if any activity occurs at all at those sites .  the method of exclusion  can you work around it .         do you mean can i bypass it .         yes .         i can  derec  but it is against          never mind that .  this is a priority .  humans may be in danger as a consequence of those sites resuming some operation .  i want you to circumvent the exclusions if possible without alerting anyone outside phylaxis and keep a monitor on them .  understood .         i understand  derec .          continue  thales .         nothing there .     rana said .  she waved a hand at the screens displaying the shattered remnants of the ri .     that   s a lot of damage for nothing .         those sites were shut down     derec said .     i   d love to know how they did that without leaving a physical trace  though .  something should be there  even if it   s only an i o port .  which reminds me  i got in there last night .         where .  union station .         back in the service sections  yes .  i found something .  .  .     he went to his own console and retrieved the paper with the sample .     i need this analyzed     he said  opening it .     this was all through the circuitry in one of the maintenance nodes .  it   s hard and brittle .  i hope there   s enough here .         i   ll set thales up on an analysis     rana said  peering at the flakes suspiciously .   derec glanced at the screens .     a positronic brain is joined to its realtime perception in a one to one relationship .  it has to be that way or interpretive errors creep in and there   s a kind of subjective drift .         but robots interpret things all the time .         true  but they have their core template to use as a standard .  if you look at how they interpret you   ll see that they   re damnably literal .  there was a classic case once of a newly uncrated robot completely disbelieving that humans had built it .  the only evidence it could see were the humans supervising it and clearly they couldn   t build one  so it must have been a lie .  the three laws prevented it from doing other than its duty to protect and obey them  but only within certain limits  and it came to believe that robots were created by another machine .         i thought that was apocryphal .         maybe .  i   ve heard it said that the core template came directly out of that incident .  but apocryphal or not  it illustrates the point .  positronic robots rely on the concrete to function .  if they didn   t  they could easily develop neuroses based on abstract concepts of humans they don   t even know coming to harm .         robots having an existential crisis .         something like that .  so we give them strict associational and sensory parameters by which to recognize what is real .  that way they can determine optimum hierarchical responses to orders given by humans that may conflict with first law imperatives and likewise permit them to make similar assessments in third law situations .  judgements like that demand concrete definitions .         but what if you substituted those definitions with others .  or one set of perceptions with a different set .         they   re designed to shut down if they detect that kind of sensory shift .  you     d have to actually bypass their sensory apparatus to do that  but bypass it without any interruption in the sensory input  and consistent with the core template .      rana tapped one of the screens .     this brain thought it was playing a game .  all it perceived  apparently  was the game .  the game became its concrete definition .         which is impossible .  any code coming in from outside would cause a complete disruption of normal function .         unless it didn   t come from outside .         you mean like a parallel system built into its matrix .         bogard worked that way .         in a very limited fashion .  bogard   s buffers simply bypassed crisis situations .  it still perceived reality          it just conveniently forgot some of it .  what   s the difference .      none  derec thought  staring at the screens .  he had recognized the similarity in the paradox loops the other night .  he had hoped it had been a fluke  but rana had a point .  someone had devised a more complete way to divert a positronic matrix  and not just part of it .   the com chimed .      yes .         mr .  a very .         speaking .         this is ambassador chassik .         yes  ambassador     derec said  wincing .     i apologize for not returning your calls yesterday  but i was out of the lab          i understand that  mr .  avery .  i   ve reached you now and that   s fine .  i wanted to get together with you to discuss certain matters concerning the removal of the ri from union station .      derec glanced at the time .  almost six thirty .     it   s rather early  ambassador .  when did you have in mind .         the sooner the better .  i   ll send a limo .         now .  but          thank you  mr .  avery .  i   ll see you in a short while .         don   t you love not having to make up your own mind .     rana asked  grinning .     gale chassik had the heavy look of someone who had done considerable physical labor during his life  which was incongruous in his case as he was a solarian .  spacers did not get unnecessarily physical  they left that to their robots .      i apologize for the circumstances  mr .  avery     he said  pouring two glasses of amber fluid .  he set one on the table beside derec and took his own to the chair opposite .     unfortunate times .         how can i help you  ambassador .     derec asked  ignoring the glass .  he folded his hands in his lap and waited .      i wanted to have a talk with you about the union station ri .         in what respect .         your analysis of its condition .  what you think happened .         i have no idea what happened .          it   s been two days          nearly three  ambassador  and phylaxis was removed from any involvement with it at the end of the first day .      chassik frowned .  his forehead seemed to contract .     removed .  but i understood          normally  phylaxis group would be doing the forensics  but special service assumed full control of the investigation and barred us from all the relevant material .  surely you knew .         your people have been working with us on decommissioning the mobile units .  i assumed .  .  .      derec nodded .     to answer your question  sir  i have no idea what happened to the ri .  the unit is a solarian brain  isn   t it .  the company that did the original installation is removing it .  didn   t they tell you any of this .      chassik snorted .     terran regulations .  they aren   t allowed to discuss it with anyone  including me  until such as time as  et cetera .  i   m sure you   ve heard the same excuses .     he narrowed his eyes at derec .     you aren   t even doing oversight on its removal .         no  sir .         hmm .  odd .         i can   t disagree .          well .  do you have any theories  mr .  avery .         no  not even a hypothesis .  at best i would be making a wild guess .         please .         somehow  coding was introduced into the ri that effectively distracted it from its primary responsibilities and redirected it .  when the assault occurred  the ri was playing .  it never saw what was happening .         that   s not possible .         again  i can   t disagree .  without access to the unit  though  i can   t begin to tell you why or how .      chassik sipped his drink thoughtfully for a few moments .     mr .  avery  i don   t think i need tell you what sort of consequences we   re looking at .  i don   t believe it   s unlikely that relations with earth could be severed .      derec wanted to argue  but in truth what chassik said seemed all too likely .  one of the core issues of the conference  surrounded by all the trade talk and good will hype  was an agreement to allow robotic inspection of all earth spacer shipping  in both directions .  that meant allowing robots onto terran vessels  a condition too few on earth approved .  it only seemed possible because of eliton   s efforts and the general esteem which ambassador humadros commanded and the fact that a great deal of money was involved .  the union station ri and its satellite systems had been intended to showcase positronics on earth  to    educate    terrans and ease some of the prejudice .  now that it had failed so dramatically and catastrophically .  .  .      i   m not sure what i could do to help  ambassador     derec said finally .      solaria stands to lose a great deal over this incident .  our reputation is at stake  here and at home .  so you will understand my desire to know as much as possible about what happened .  would you be willing to do an analysis of the ri after it   s been removed from union station .  off the record .         off .  .  .  i   m not sure i understand .         on the quiet .  i   m afraid it would not be authorized by anyone other than me .  i could .  .  .     borrow    the unit before it gets shipped back to solaria .         what good would that do .  if i found something        then it becomes my affair and i could do something with it .  but without any knowledge of what happened  i   m helpless .         it would have been better had the unit not been removed .      chassik shrugged .     i can   t stop it .         let me think about it  ambassador     derec said .     i   m not sure such an analysis would give you anything worth using .  off site like that  without any kind of witness to the process  it could be claimed that anything i find is manufactured .         would it be .         what .         claimed .  you know these terrans a little better than i  perhaps .  you   ve been here longer .         think about it  ambassador .  under similar circumstances  what would you claim .  they aren   t really that much different .      chassik   s eyebrows raised fractionally  but he nodded and smiled .     don   t take too long to give me your answer  mr .  avery .  there   s a window of opportunity here .         i understand  ambassador .      chassik pointed at the glass beside derec .     you didn   t touch your drink .         it   s a little early for me .         too bad .  something called beam   s choice .  i must confess  i don   t find much about earth superior  but they make fine whiskey .     he finished his own glass .     a present from one of their industrialists .  they like giving tokens here .         when they can .      chassik nodded and stood .     it was pleasant talking to you  mr .  avery .  and do let me know soonest on your decision .         yes  sir .  thank you .      derec followed the waist high mobile unit down the corridors to the elevator  trying to work loose the tightness between his shoulders .  nothing just said made any difference to anything  the entire meeting could have been done by comlink with the exception of the illicit offer to allow .  phylaxis access to the ri after its removal from union station .  so that  derec decided  had been the true purpose of the meeting .   which made no sense if special service had impounded the ri .  if they had not  then what was the purpose of assuming complete jurisdiction of the investigation .  and if they had  how would chassik get his hands on it .  true  it belonged technically to solaria and would eventually be shipped back  but not before terran analysts ripped it apart .  by then  any analysis derec might perform would be useless .  nothing would be left to analyze .   derec rode the elevator down to the garage  his unease increasing .  chassik had to have known phylaxis was barred from the investigation .  well  there was truth to the implication of bureaucratic territoriality  it was possible no one from special service  the station  or his own people had told him anything  but surely ariel would have said something  being the liaison from the calvin institute .   too many things made less and less sense .      where would you like me to drop you  sir .     the limo asked him .   derec hesitated .     what time is it .         nine ten  sir .      two hours at least before his meeting with ariel  all the way north of the capitol mall to franklin park .  that was a good thirty minute drive .  .  .      ford theater  please .         yes  sir .      the limo started up and headed for the exit .      eighteen    ariel waited nervously at a small table by a massive pillar and watched the throngs enter and leave the sprawling kitchen .  it had been years since her last visit to one of these huge communal dining areas  the place triggered memories  some pleasant  others unwelcome and long neglected .   derec wandered in with a crowd of school kids who were all dressed in bright blue and yellow jumpers and wearing their id badges prominently around their necks .  he got in the queue  picked up a tray  and went through the line .   he drifted by her table  then looked again .  he made an exaggerated grin and ambled over  everything about him suddenly announcing salacious intent .      excuse me  but i couldn   t help notice     he said  just a bit too loudly .  a few people turned to look  then as quickly turned away .     you look lonely .  mind if i join you .      ariel almost laughed .  it was so blatantly clich  d she wondered that anyone could possibly accept such an invitation .      i don   t think    she began .      you   re that friend of kate   s  aren   t you .  down at the data import pool .  i   m massey .      ariel looked away  working at her smile .     i   m sorry  i didn   t recognize you at first .  please .      derec slid into the chair opposite her .     come here often .         enough     ariel hissed .      sorry .  couldn   t resist .     he started sorting out his tray .     so why here .         i left through a service access and took the strips .  no limo .      derec glanced at her .     dressed down  too  i see .      she had worn a single piece of dull brown and a bright red jacket that glistened wetly .     it might have been worth it .      maybe .     he tore off a piece of bread and dipped it in the thick gravy around his slab of meat product .     you know  i   ve eaten at the best  but there   s still something primally appealing about this place .         you   re joking .  that   s disgusting .      he gestured at her glass of milk .     and you look like a very convincing t rating  sitting in your home kitchen without any food .         we won   t be here that long .  hurry up .         are you going to tell me what we are here for .         the body we saw .         which one .  eliton   s .         yes .  it wasn   t .     she went on to update him on the six managins and the fact that now  according to senator jonis taprin  bogard had killed the three mia had apprehended  then self  destructed  killing mia as well .   derec frowned and forked a chunk of meat into his mouth .  he chewed thoughtfully for a time .     of course  you know that   s not true .         of course i do .     he gave her a skeptical look .  impatiently  she went on .     i may disagree with the    looseness    you   ve built in to bogard  but if it kills someone it will be by inability to cope  not through intent .  those three men were alive when mia was taken off to the hospital .         all right .  so what are we doing up here .         looking for ambulances .      he looked puzzled  then smiled .  he nodded  chewing .     you know  you certainly are     ariel held up a finger .     don   t carry the charade too far .      derec chuckled .  she watched as he ate everything on his tray .      are you finished .         i am now .  all i had this morning was coffee .         no wonder it tasted good .      he stood .     shall we go chase ambulances now .        they took a strip east  toward the convention district .      the newscams followed eliton   s corpse out of the gallery and to the ambulance     ariel said .     we got a clear id on the vehicle .  mia called reed and told them she was an insurance adjuster and needed to verify id numbers on the ambulances servicing them .         why .         the body was switched somewhere .  if it was in the hospital itself  it gives us a place to start .         makes sense .  and .         the hospital very helpfully connected us to the administrative records datum and mia was able to just peruse at leisure .  that ambulance had been assigned to reed  but it was decommissioned last year .  too old to be economically upgraded .         wouldn   t somebody have noticed on the scene .     derec asked .      who .  an ambulance specialist .  no  they use the same body shells .  it   s all the hardware inside that gets the upgrades .         so  that ambulance doesn   t service reed .  it could service another hospital .         or small clinics .  but a vehicle has a data trail that follows it everywhere  even after they   re    officially    decommissioned .  no record of any upgrade  no reassignment to any other facility .  the vehicle officially is no longer in service at all .         what about the newscams .  they were at reed when eliton   s body arrived .      ariel nodded .     mia   s trying to locate an available record .  two of the agencies we contacted told us that they missed the arrival of eliton   s body  that it had been delivered through a secured access and none of them knew where .  the first they knew  eliton   s body was already inside reed .     ariel looked at the passing signs  then pointed .     here we go .      they began making the careful transition down to the slower strips and got off at corridor six .  ariel headed for the nearest directory .  she wanted sublevel e .  the directory indicated the closest escalator and elevator .      you wouldn   t want to hear about my morning  would you .     derec asked  following .      sure .  how was your morning  derec .         i had a meeting with ambassador chassik .      ariel stopped .     chassik .  why .         he wanted to do me a favor .         chassik never does favors .         he offered to let me analyze the union station ri after it   s been removed .         why .         don   t know .  i told him i   d think it over .      ariel and derec continued on to the escalator .  as they descended to sublevel e  she noticed how few other people seemed to be around .  most of this area contained maintenance  service  and distribution facilities and those few people present looked like i rated laborers  dressed in plain overalls .  the sound of heavy machinery gave a throbbing background groan  and the air smelled warm  metallic .   they paused at the intersection of an alleyway and the main corridor .  ariel slipped her portable datum from inside her jacket .  the map of the area on the small screen also gave their location .      down there     she said  pointing across the corridor and returning the datum quickly to its pouch .  she looked around  frowning .     there   s something else about this area        they turned down a narrow passage covered by a wide strip of dull grey material  a guide path for movers .  at the end they emerged into a wide area fronting a garage entrance .  old transports lined the wall to their right  grimy vehicles long unused  their identifying markings obscured by dirt and wear .  two wide transport exits opened on either side of the apron .      d .  c .  municipal transport service terminal     derec read the sign above the main door .     substation six e vernon section .         this is the place .     ariel looked around  frowning .      now what .  are we expected .         i sincerely hope not .  it   s just .  .  .  something else about this area .  .  .     she shrugged .     we get inside and look for that ambulance .         how .         that   s what i needed you for .  you   re good at getting by al systems  aren   t you .         i   m the designated thief .  should have brought bogard along for this .         oh  absolutely .  let   s bring a robot into a worker class section .  no one here would mind .         bogard is stealth capable .  no one would have noticed .      her own anger surprised ariel .  she drew slow breaths and suppressed it .     mia still won   t release it .         that has to change .         she   s afraid .      derec shrugged .     all right  there should be another access  for maintenance crews or supervisors or whatever .     he sounded ambivalent now  his voice dull and flat .  he walked away from her  skirting the edge of the broad apron .  he disappeared to the left of the fa  ade .   ariel searched the geometries surrounding the garage  suspended walkways  roofs  shuttered windows  sharp shapes piled up around massive supporting beams that ex tended into the cavernous heights high overhead .  mist obscured details of the main roof  haloing the bright points of light .  she saw no one  which did not reassure her .  she followed after derec .   the gangway turned right several meters from its entrance .  ariel experienced a brief touch of claustrophobia looking up the walls that formed the narrow canyon .   she found derec at the top of a set of metal steps  tentatively entering data into a small panel set alongside the human sized door .  his face was blank  now  only his eyes bright with concentration .  ariel stood by the comer  a few meters away  watching  as if she could do anything if they were caught .   derec grunted  then slid something into the reader at the base of the pad .  he entered a few more commands and the door slid open with a grinding sound that made ariel   s nerves dance .      i don   t think it gets much use     derec said  retrieving a wafer thin square .   ariel hurried up the steps and they ducked inside .  derec stabbed at a panel below a dull red light and the door closed .   except for the red lamp  the place was dark .      great     derec said .     it   s an automated garage .         there has to be an office or a service station .          mmm .  maybe .  or it could be  wait .      ariel heard him pat the wall as he moved away from her .  then a sharp click and suddenly a wan yellowish light filled the immediate area .  he stood by another panel filled with switches .  a walkway ran directly along the side of the wall .  outside that  the garage itself remained lightless .   at the far end they came to a row of cubicles  each containing a desk and datum terminal .  the dust on the transparent walls obscured detail within .  derec ran his finger down it  leaving a clear trail .      you   re sure this is the one .     derec asked  brushing his fingers on his pants .      no .  this is only the last known address .      derec walked slowly along the row  then stopped .     ariel .      the cubicle wall showed trailing handprints near its door .  the desk and terminal inside had been dusted off and there were clear footprints on the dark tile floor .      could have been the regular staff     ariel suggested .      i doubt it .  if there was a regular staff  it would be cleaner .     he entered the cubicle and stepped up to the desk  then sat down and switched on the terminal .     what   s the id number on the ambulance .      ariel brought out her datum .     here .     she showed it to him .   derec entered the code and sat back  absently tapping his chin with a forefinger .      decommissioned thirteen months ago     he read from the screen .     it gives overhaul estimates  then lists component values for recycling it as parts .  .  .  and a secondary market value for direct resale .  .  .  a bid was made on it eleven months ago .         someone bought it .         it doesn   t say .  just that a bid was made .  it only gives an auction number .     he frowned .     no further updates of any kind .  it evidently was sold .         is it here .         it doesn   t say that  either  but it does give a bin number on the original entry .  i suppose we could just go look .         let   s .      derec entered a few more commands  then took the flimsy sheet that extruded from the printer .  he closed the terminal down and stood .      level four  row f  bin twenty eight .         what about lights .      derec opened each drawer in the desk  then went to the cabinet near the door .     ah     he said as he straightened  holding a flashlight .   their footsteps echoed loudly  mingling with the stray  obscure sounds of the garage .  in the near total darknessbroken by constellations of readylights here and there and the circle of their flashlight pushing before them   the noises made the space seem vast and complex .  ariel walked alongside derec  trying to control her reflexive jitters at every click and whir and drip .  it was not fear so much as a formless unease at not knowing where she was or what it looked like .   they came to a stairwell .  a fading level two glowed bright yellow in the halogen glare .  derec started up the steps .   they emerged from the stairs adjacent to row b .  vehicles occupied stalls .  cables and tubes connected each one to a diagnostic unit  but those they looked at showed their units all on stand by .  the machines appeared untended  the vehicles dirty  many in various stages of disassembly  and even that process seemed abandoned .   row f  bin twenty eight  was different .   the diagnostic equipment was old but not neglected .  only the standby light glowed  but in the wash of the flashlight ariel saw clearly that the control panel was clean .  the ambulance itself shone neatly  grimeless and intact .      well  well     derec said and stepped into the stall .  overhead a worklamp came on .  derec  frowning  switched off the flashlight .     we better not stay long .  what do you need .         its log .     ariel handed over her datum .     do you know how .      derec took the datum and opened the rear door of the vehicle  looking up at the silence .      either it   s not alarmed or          we   ll have visitors soon     ariel finished .   derec climbed into the ambulance .  ariel peered into the darkness  listening .  the glow from the stall   s worklight cast marginal illumination across to the opposite row .  it seemed less a garage than a necropolis  the broken shapes hunkering together in sepulchral consolation .   a thud came from behind her .     ow .         are you all right .         fine     derec called from within .     be done in a minute .      ariel stepped away from the stall .  the various noises of the place seemed less sinister now .  it was only an old  near forgotten storage facility .  she wondered how many of them were strewn throughout the fabric of earth  niches wherein terrans stuffed all the things they thought they might need again someday and then forgot they ever had them in the first place .  layers upon layers of urban complex  down she did not know how many levels  and at the very bottom  just before primal earth  actual soil  there must be an entire layer of nothing but storage lockers  garages  closets  stalls  bins  dumps  and depositories  filled with a history of experiment and expedience  she started at a new sound .  not a click or a whir  but a faint grinding  like something rolling across broken pavement .  she took another step away from the light behind her  careful and silent  listening .  the grinding stopped .   the skin up the backs of her arms rippled with chill .  she felt watched now and stared into the murk  searching for eyes .   something moved to her left and she jerked to the right  heart racing .  ariel backed into the stall and went to the rear of the ambulance .      derec     she said .      done .     derec climbed out and shut the doors .     clean .  like just recently .         time to leave .      he handed back the datum and went to the end of the stall .  he stood quietly and listened  then gestured for her to follow .  he sprinted across the driveway and entered three more stalls at random .  two of them lit up with worklights .  he returned to this side and did the same to another three .  one lit up .   the sound started again  louder and clearer .  treads .      probably an automated inspection unit     derec said .     we triggered an internal security program  that   s all .      at the landing  she stopped .  from below came the faint echo of voices .      damn     she hissed .      where .     he asked .      up .      they moved up the stairs as quickly as they could and came out on level six .   the tread noise grew stronger .  ahead  ariel thought she saw a reflection  dull red  and guessed it might be the source of the sound .   they descended one level and sprinted along the dark stalls .  another machine sound started toward them and they scurried into one of the stalls .  the worklight above did not wink on and they hunched behind a mass that once may have been a functioning vehicle .   beyond  a large shape  its general dimensions outlined by small amber  red  and blue lights  rumbled past the stall .  derec took her hand and drew her out .  they watched the drone roll around the intersection by the stairwell and disappear .  quietly  they walked after it .   suddenly everything was still .  all the drones had stopped  apparently  their inspection done .  distantly  ariel heard two sets of footsteps echoing .   she heard two people descending the metal steps .  below .   when it was silent  she tapped his shoulder and they continued up .   at level eight the stairs ended .   derec shined his light .  most of the stalls here were empty .  at the far end of the row was a bulky door .   ariel stopped halfway .     derec .         what .     he returned and shined his light into the stall .   packing crates  about forty centimeters on a side  filled the space .  they had a familiar look  and ariel knelt down by the nearest and lifted it .      about six or seven kilograms     she estimated .  she turned it over  but there were no markings on its dull grey surface .      hey     derec said .  he aimed the light into the next stall .  more crates .  two more stalls were filled with them .   a distant hissing began and ariel snapped to her feet .      we need to go now     derec said and hurried to the door .  he studied the panel for a few seconds  then produced his wafer again .  a minute later  the door lurched open and they stepped outside .   ahead stretched a narrow corridor between two other structures .   the gangway deadended at a wall supporting a ladder that stretched up about fifteen meters .  debris gathered at the corners  grime packed paper  indeterminate plastic shapes  accrued matter that crunched underfoot .   ariel handed him the crate and went up first .  at the top  her arms burned slightly from the exertion .  she climbed onto the roof and looked down at derec .  he climbed one handed  the crate tucked under his other arm .  his breathing came heavy  too  and he gave a loud    hoot    when he reached the top .   sitting on the rooftop  ariel looked up at the ceiling of d .  c .  high above  almost lost in a tangle of struts  roadways  and the reaching towers of surrounding buildings .  one structure was being taken down or repaired  its skin tom aside to reveal the skeleton beneath .  this was an old section of the city and it struck ariel how empty it suddenly appeared to be .  from here they saw and heard no one but the distant background hum of thousands of machines .   her pulse raced .     now where .      derec looked around .     let   s see your map .      she handed him the datum with the grid pulled up on the screen .      well .  .  .  if we keep going south we should come to an elevated strip .         which way is south .     she asked .   derec pointed past her .  she turned to look and saw a low wall  and beyond that  the cubes and polyhedrons of industrial structures .  they had more climbing to do .      let me see that .     she looked at the map .  the area still struck her as familiar  but she still could not see why .     great     she said .     so who do you think that was .         maybe there was a security guard on the premises after all .         took long enough to come look for us .      derec looked back the way they had come .     this was awfully easy .  you   d have thought they   d change the id codes for the ambulance .         who would think to look for it .         maybe .  they seem to be pretty open so far .         really .  then why try to kill mia .  for that matter  why put a fake body in the morgue .     ariel asked .      two fake bodies  if what you told me is true .     he shook his head again .     and that doesn   t make a lot of sense .  they shot eliton once at union station and then twice more afterward .  why .         maybe the replacement body didn   t want to die .          the second body .  .  .  reconstructive surgery or a clone .         either way .  the same ambulance that picked him up did not deliver him to reed .         seems less a cover up than a confusion .  which might work even better .     derec hefted the crate .     these probably won   t be there for long  whatever they are .  as for the ambulance  after a point they probably just don   t care what anyone finds out .  the cover up is only short term .  the question remains  how much is being covered up and from who .  is it all special service or just the two agents that assumed control of the investigation .  who do we ask without alerting cupra and gambel          they   d never manage it     ariel said .     besides  could two agents on their own bar you from working on the ri .         i wouldn   t have thought so .     derec stood .     and how far is it really to the next strip .      ariel sighed and opened her datum .  after studying it a few moments  she also got to her feet  pointed  and began walking .      nineteen    mia forced herself to walk across the apartment again  her right leg aching in protest  pain stabbing up to her hip with each step .  sweat pooled at the base of her spine and around her neck .      please refrain from further exercise  ms .  daventri     r .  jennie asked her again .     you are clearly in distress .  it is my duty          i understand your duty  jennie     mia said through clenched teeth .  the wall was only a couple of meters away now .  then she had to turn around and make it back to the sofa .     i have to do this to build strength and recover .  if i don   t  i will be confined to the sofa or bed longer than necessary .         you could also cause further injury to yourself and extend that period of confinement .      mia came up against the wall and paused  breathing hard .     are you medically qualified to diagnose  jennie .         i am certified for nursing and emergency medical administration .         but .  .  .  .         i do not have the same qualifications as a medical specialist .      mia turned and let her back rest against the wall .  the sofa was maybe four meters away .     then kindly let me decide for myself how much i can manage .      r .  jennie stood near the hallway that led to the bedrooms  motionless  arms at its sides  and yet somehow managed to convey doting concern .  it looked briefly at bogard standing near the apartment entrance  as if looking for support from a fellow robot .  but r .  jennie had already tried to enlist bogard   s aid in making mia see reason and had been rebuffed .  bogard understood what mia was doing  if it disapproved it kept that opinion to itself .   mia launched herself toward the sofa .  the pain made each step seem to take forever .  she staggered the distance and fell onto the pillows .   she lay very still while her leg gradually stopped hurting .  when she felt able to move again  it was only a dull throb  like a bad bruise .  the painkillers in her system did not eliminate the aches completely  but seemed to work on a graduated system designed to keep her from overdoing physical activity .  as long as she remained relatively motionless  the sensation was there but distant  like a strained muscle .  the more she worked it  though  the more it hurt .  she supposed that was a good thing  otherwise she might stress it to the point of reinjuring it .   spacer thinking .   r .  jennie stood beside her now with a tray bearing a glass of cold water .  mia suppressed her irritation and took the glass .      thanks     she said .      will you be stationery now .     r .  jennie asked .      yes .  i think that   s enough for the time being .         is there anything more i can do for you .         no  not yet .  has ariel called in .         no  ms .  daventri .         call me mia  please .  let me know as soon as she does .         of course .      r .  jennie returned to the kitchen .  the last few days had been an education for mia .  she had never spent this much time around positronic robots and she was beginning to think that their banishment from earth had less to do with any moral or ethical revulsion than with their constant fret ting .   the water felt wonderful going down her throat .   she straightened on the sofa and looked across the living room .  it was a good twelve meters wide and she had managed ten laps  one side to the other .  yesterday she had only managed six .  good progress by any measure  but mia was impatient with her slow healing .  she needed to be mobile .  too much longer in this apartment  in the dutybound company of r .  jennie  and she might change her mind about eliton   s dream of bringing robots back .   eliton .  she wondered now about that dream .  even if they managed to discover who had engineered the assassinations  it seemed thoroughly dead  the true victim of the violence .   on the table before her the datum showed the signal notation working .  the algorithm had been running for nearly two hours now  searching for a series of connections which  if there  may only be tenuous  insubstantial coincidences .  the tenuousness of her hunches had made her reluctant to even begin such a search  but some of the names on the lists generated in the last two days struck her as odd .  she doubted anything would turn up  but for lack of any other ideas and a dependable leg it seemed worth the trouble .  in her studies at the academy it had amazed her how many crimes in recorded history had been solved due to serendipity .  all this training went for nothing if chance failed to manifest .  the good investigator was one who knew how to take advantage of the coincidences that presented themselves .   for instance  the fact that not one of the dynan manual industries people had been shot .   going over and over the recordings from the newscams  mia returned to that oddity time after time .  she had had bogard run trajectory analysis several times  and she could not explain away the curious fact that no shots had been directed at any member of the dynan party .  there had been only three executives and one security  but they had been right alongside imbitek and porvan standardmech  another company that built supplemental technologies like conveyors  lifters  tractors  and a variety of other moving equipment .  two people in the imbitek group had been wounded and three people in the psm group  plus one dead .  in spite of being sandwiched between these two  rega loom   s people had survived untouched .   unable to go to them to ask her questions  mia worked the data .   now that she was satisfied that none of the injuries and deaths had been accidental  that indeed the assassins had been good enough to hit exactly what they aimed at  she found herself trying to figure out what each victim meant in the scheme of cause and effect .   humadros and eliton represented the primary targets  obviously .  without them  the conference died  even though several parties worked valiantly to keep it alive .  there would be a meeting  certainly  but how much could realistically be accomplished now .  the bulk of humadros   s legation had died .  those remaining were junior members  more diplomats in training and gophers than real negotiators .  of course  there was the anomaly of ariel   s acquaintance  tro aspil  being both dead and en route back to aurora  but even he had not been a significant member of the legation  not in the larger schema .   all of eliton   s security people .   including her .   why .  did they represent the only honest group within special service .  as easy as it was to think that way  it was unlikely .  but mattu and gel and mia were the most likely to figure out the inconsistencies in the cover up .  it had been a matter of expedience to close off that avenue of trouble immediately .  they had missed mia in the gallery  possibly the only shot that had gone wild .   or maybe not .  maybe they had wanted her alive to frame  along with bogard .  easy enough to do .   then why the attack on the hospital .  second thoughts .  correcting a mistake .   safer to believe that she was a target all along .   eliton   s staff  two people  were dead .  along with five members of humadros   s team killed  that totalled thirteen .  one dead in the psm party .  fourteen .  the other seven .   crol dushek  head of the solarian legation  and two of his aides .  seventeen .  the three aurorans from the embassy here .  twenty .   the last one still seemed anomalous  a woman named viansa risher  who at first had no apparent reason to be on the platform .  she had been a member of the settler   s transport committee  a division of the settler   s coalition  a bureaucrat with no direct connection to anyone else .  it looked like a token invitation .   when mia called up newsnet articles  though  she discovered that risher   s presence had been significant indeed .  the settler worlds had demanded a seat at the table from the first announcement of the conference and had been consistently ignored by both terran and spacer governments .  risher was the settler coalition   s spokesperson on earth and had made a good case for inclusion .  trade relations between spacer worlds and earth did potentially impact settler worlds  and they certainly had an interest in the piracy issue since everyone privately believed that the pirates were settlers or at least used a settler world as a base .  the exclusion made little sense and none of the reasons given had been convincing  finally  in the last month  eliton   s office issued an invitation to risher and the conference committee certified her for inclusion .  but only her .   twenty one officially dead  or twenty  depending on eliton   s actual status  .  thirty three wounded .  fifty five actual shots fired .  who among the thirty three had they intended to kill .   and why no one in the dynan manual industries party .   the screen on her datum continued to show working .  .  mia finished her water  staring at it  waiting .   ariel   s com registered another call .  mia hobbled over and sat down .  she had scrolled through the growing list of messages  worried .  three from ambassador setaris  two from delegate korolin  five from her aide  hofton  one from senator taprin .  .  .   this one was from coren lanra  the security for the dynan group .   mia killed the visual and pressed accept .      ariel burgess .         oh  ms .  burgess .     lanra   s voice was nasal and a little rough .     i tried your office already but they told me you weren   t in          so you called me here .  how did you obtain this number .         i   m coren lanra  security for dynan manual industries .      he said it as if it explained everything .  mia felt herself smile despite her annoyance .     i   ll take that to mean it   s none of my business .  what can i do for you  mr .  lanra .         well .  .  .     he sounded unsure now .  this was not the kind of response he had expected  obviously .     i had hoped we could discuss the incident at union station .         is there a reason you want to discuss it with me .         i   ve tried to talk to several other people at your embassy  but no one seems to have the time .  understandable  with three of ambassador setaris   s immediate staff dead .  but i   ve been working down the list .  i thought i   d give up when i reached the maintenance department .         our maintenance is handled by robots  mr .  lanra .         yes  well  as i said .         i still need a reason .      lanra said nothing for several seconds and mia began to think he would simply excuse himself and go away .      there are certain .  .  .     he said finally     .  .  .  irregularities .  .  .  about what happened .         concerning .         my employers  for one .      mia chewed her lip .     you mean like the fact that none of dynan   s people were injured .         like that  yes .         do you think that needs explaining .         it will .         and you   d like to explain to us .  why .  it seems to me that you ought to take this to terran authorities .         right now they aren   t very receptive to explanations .      mia did not doubt dynan would be high on the list of suspects .  even without the anomaly of no injuries  rega loom  dynan   s owner  was also the untitled head of the church of organic sapiens  a rabidly anti robot faction .  but not only anti robot  dynan manufactured ergonomic and organic multiplier tech  tools that allowed a person to do the work personally  in fact  required a human to operate it .  their philosophy was a modified form of self reliance  any tool that operated independently of human control  they claimed  sapped something vital from the human condition .  positronics topped the pyramid of technologies dynan found inimical to their concept of humanity  but it certainly did not stop at robots .  imbitek  they declared  made things that were little better .  imbedded tech quietly did things humans did not even know about  hidden and forgotten .  humanity had no idea what capabilities it lost to machines that did work for them .  nothing dynan made operated on its own .  the church of organic sapiens extended that belief into the religious  claiming that the true nature of humankind was pretechnological  that eden had contained no machines  and that the only true state of grace was a state wherein human beings required and possessed nothing but their own bodies and minds .   but  mia reasoned  if they had been behind the attack  then it was stupid of them to have not at least offered a token victim .      i suppose listening couldn   t hurt  mr .  lanra     she said finally .     what do you have in mind .         if we could meet somewhere .  .  .         give me a code where i can reach you .  i have to juggle some things  but i   ll get back to you .         ms .  burgess  please don   t avoid me .  i think this is very important          i have no intention of avoiding you  mr .  lanra .  but i still have responsibilities to attend .  i will get back to you .      lanra sighed unhappily .     all right .  you can reach me here .      a number appeared on the com .     thank you  mr .  lanra .  how late will you be there .         as late as necessary .         i   ll be in touch .      mia stabbed the disconnect with a trembling hand and leaned back in the chair  thrilled and frightened .   something  she thought .  finally something .   now the only problem was finding ariel .      bogard     she called .      yes  mia .         can you still tap directly into security com lines .         i have not attempted to do so since our arrival here     the robot said .     it may be that i have been isolated from access .      i doubt it  she thought  especially if they think you   re gone .  .  .      try it now .  see if there is any local security chatter concerning ariel and derec .      bogard moved up to the com console and extruded a thin cable from its left hand .  the cable connected directly to the i o port .  data flashed rapidly across the screen .      no     bogard reported .      send an anonymous report concerning them .         through central coordination  or shall i find a field unit in the area .         a field unit  of course  if you can .      a few seconds later  bogard said     there is a cruiser within the grid around the garage ms .  burgess is investigating .  i have sent a simulated dispatch directing it to the site .         very good  bogard .  thank you .         do you wish me to continue monitoring .         yes  bogard .  no further communications  but let me know if anything happens .         yes  mia .      mia limped back to the couch  leaving bogard connected to the com .  she had not thought bogard could do this  but  thinking about it now  it was only logical .  she stared at it  wondering what other capabilities it possessed to which she  or anybody else in her department  had given no thought .   she stared at her datum screen for several seconds .  it no longer said working .  instead  the words search completed glowed green .   hesitantly  she pressed access .      twenty    derec touched pavement at street level  relieved to finally be off the rooftops .  he looked back up the length of ladder  toward the distant ceiling of d .  c .  some of those roofs ended at that ceiling  forming part of the support for the cap that covered the city .   he shook his right arm to ease the bum .  he had climbed down the entire length of this building   about fifteen meters  he guessed  with the crate under his left arm .  his muscles ached .      you know     he observed     it   s been a long time since i did any serious climbing  but this really isn   t a very good substitute .      ariel was looking around  her face pulled into an annoyed scowl .      what .     he asked .     you   ve been looking like you lost something since we got to this sector .         it   s  i don   t know  i can   t quite put my finger on it .  i should know something else about this area .         what does your datum say about it .         a warehouse district  some small assembly plants  mostly merchandiser   s storage .  i       ariel snatched out her datum and tapped it quickly .  she turned and pointed .     that way .      derec followed  irritated afresh .     you have an appointment .         actually  yes .         have you ever been here before .         no  but it   s part of my duties to know certain areas .      derec waited for more explanation  but none came .  he resigned himself to following and waiting for a bit longer .   ariel went down a narrow gangway and out into a broad service alley that ran between loading docks .  she glanced left and right and went left .  at the fourth dock she stopped  referred to her datum  then pointed .      that   s the place .         what place .     derec asked .   ariel climbed onto the dock apron and tried the employee door .  when it did not open  she looked expectantly at derec .      don   t overuse this     he said as he joined her and inserted his decrypter .  the lock was simple and the door opened within seconds .   inside  they found a small  neat office .  business licenses hung on the walls .      this is auroran     derec noted .      i know .         what are we looking for .         contraband .      the warehouse proper was filled with rows of ceiling high shelving containing crates of a similar dull grey as the one beneath derec   s arm  though much larger .  ariel stepped up to the nearest one and studied it  then looked around .  she found a small handheld device hanging from the end of the shelves and ran it along the length of the crate .   the lid unsealed and swung out .  within stood a humaniform robot  minus the head .      a dp       she said .     porter model drone .         a bit too human for here  isn   t it .     derec commented dryly     just a bit .     ariel checked three more and they all contained headless dp   drones .     now  where do you suppose the heads are .      they wandered among the shelves .  derec saw cases containing a variety of drones  factory assembler units  agromaintenance  cleaning drones  but only one section with the humaniforms  and every one of those that they opened they found headless .  he began to suspect now what it was he carried under his arm .      derec     ariel called .   he followed her voice to a wide door leading into another  smaller storage chamber .  he saw machinery and workbenches .      how come no one   s here .     he asked .      the embassy ordered all our nationals to close their businesses for the duration of the crisis .         there   s a crisis .      she gave him a warning look .   on one of the benches sat a row of humaniform heads .  not absolutely human  but broadly so  caricatures of human faces .  the backs were open .  derec turned one to peer into it .      empty .         and .  .  .  .      he looked at ariel .     it   s easily adaptable to a positronic brain  if that   s what you mean .         i do .      he looked at the crate he carried  then back at ariel .      this place is only a short distance from the garage     she said .     proximity doesn   t usually mean much  but in this case i   d have to say the coincidence is a little too much .         i think we   d better leave before another incident .      ariel nodded vaguely and let derec lead her back to the small office .  she went to one of the three desks  though  and switched on the terminal .  she took out her datum and connected it to the i o .      ariel       she held up a hand and derec pressed his lips together tightly .  it was futile to argue with her when she had her mind set on a goal .  he waited while she riffled the system and transferred data .   finally  she shut down and pocketed her datum .      let   s go .      relieved  derec stepped out onto the loading dock .      please stand still .  place all objects on the pavement and raise your hands .      derec looked sharply to the right .  a police cruiser squatted in the alley and two officers stood behind it  weapons aimed at them .      shit     he muttered and slowly placed the crate at his feet .        just what were you looking for .      ariel stared angrily at the back of the cop   s head .  her voice was controlled and reasonable  completely at odds with the frustration derec saw in her face .      convention space     she said .     there   s going to be a trade show of spacer manufactures .  that   s what i do  i   m the commerce liaison with the auroran embassy .         convention   .  there aren   t any convention facilities in this area  ambassador  and that was a private warehouse          but it   s called convention center district on all the maps .         yes  it is     the cop said agreeably .     but there really aren   t any convention facilities there .         so why is it called that if that   s not what it contains .         it   s always been called that     the other cop said .     you must be new on earth .          so it must be a practical joke  is that it .  leave outdated names on all the maps so the new tourists end up over their head in a bad neighborhood .  of course  that   s a joke  too  since the terran tourism and visitors department swears there are no bad areas in d .  c .  or in any other major urban center on the planet .         tourism doesn   t ask the police  ms .  sorry .         someone should ask someone     ariel went on  her voice acquiring an edge now .   derec watched appreciatively as she gradually amplified her rant  over the course of the several kilometers back to the auroran embassy  irritating and then enraging the two police officers who had  in fairness  just done their jobs .  she picked on every explanation they offered until they clammed up and gave her only monotone answers and clearly could not wait to get her out of their cruiser .  they had not arrested them because ariel had her embassy id on her and had convinced them that she had had business at that warehouse .  derec still had the crate  secured by the same explanation  though the policemen were clearly not happy about it .  they were not willing to risk the trouble  though  in arresting an ambassador .  now she had gotten them to the point where they cared about nothing other than returning them to the auroran embassy  which they had been more than willing to do  no doubt under orders to make sure no more spacers got harmed or killed in the aftermath of union station .  ariel took advantage of that to so thoroughly outrage them with her petty slurs against earth that they did not bother asking for derec   s id  nor did they ask the questions that would have opened the door to answers ariel did not wish to give .   on the landing pad  fifth floor of the embassy  they climbed out of the transport .  ariel strode off in a huff .  derec looked in at the two cops .      thanks  i really appreciate it     he said .   the nearer one glared at him .     your boss needs to learn a little circumspection .      derec shrugged .     well .  .  .         have a good day  sir .      they lifted off and derec staggered back from the wash of hot  compressed air .  he wondered how much of a report they would file .   derec caught up with ariel at the elevator .      that was       she shot him a look .     unnecessary .           masterful .      she frowned briefly  then laughed .     those poor .  .  .      the elevator door opened  letting three people out .  ariel did not finish her thought .        all the log recorded was date  destination  and distance     derec announced .     it was used once in the last eleven months .         union station .     mia asked .      correct .  and directly back to that garage .  there   s no record of the driver  the medical technicians  or the patient .         no surprises  then     ariel said .      but it   s confirmation     mia said  nodding .  she pointed at the crate on the end of the table .     what   s in that .      derec felt inexplicably reluctant to open it .  he looked at ariel  his heart pounding .     do you still have that key .      ariel handed him the seal key from the warehouse .  derec switched it on and ran it along the seam .  the crate lid popped open .   nestled within padding lay a plastic wrapped mound of silver and gold webbing  wrapped tightly and mingled with darker nodes .      damn     ariel hissed .      what is it .     mia asked .      a positronic brain     derec said .     absolute contraband .         close it up     ariel said .   derec complied  then looked at mia .     you called the police  didn   t you .      mia nodded .     something came up .  i had bogard issue a dispatch through their channels .  not much  just a cruiser to go look see .         bogard is just full of tricks     ariel said icily .     pity it couldn   t do its primary job as well .      derec looked at her .  she was staring at bogard  arms folded  an expression of unconcealed resentment on her face .      you sent me a message     derec said     after the incident .  you said    i see you got your wish .      what did you mean by that .         you knew it was from me .  can   t you figure out what it means .         eliton   s death was          beside the point .  you got what you wanted by being able to create a dangerous robot .  i don   t think you wanted to kill eliton .  i think you wanted to build robots  any way you could  any way you wanted .         how does that follow .     derec asked .     with eliton   s death  no one will be able to build robots on earth .         i don   t think it matters .  someone will hire you to build bodyguards now  no matter what .         excuse me  but i failed to do that .      ariel waved her hand dismissively .     glitches .  no one on earth would buy it  but spacers understand that prototypes always have bugs to be worked out .  it brought back three of the assassins .  that   s the point that won   t be missed .  you   ve got your opportunity to build your special positronics now .  more leeway  more freedom of action  more humanlike .  hell  they   ll even make mistakes .         ariel          pardon me     mia said .     i feel like i   ve come in at the tail end of a very complicated argument .         derec and i disagree fundamentally over bogard .  what it represents .         i gathered that much .  why .             derec   s robot here is the product of an attempt to circumvent three law programming          that   s a complete mischaracterization .     derec shouted .     you never understood what i was after .         really .  tell me something  why is that robot still functioning .         what .  i don   t          it failed     ariel snapped .     it let a human in its care die .  it stood witness to dozens of fatalities and injuries .  it should be a mass of collapsed positronic gelatin .  instead  it is fully functional .         what good would it be if it had collapsed .         it would be inert .  it would pose no further threat .         what threat .         the threat of negligence .         it wasn   t negligent .  look at how it performed for mia .         then why is eliton dead .         we don   t know he   s dead .         as far as bogard is concerned  he is .  why .      derec did not know .  of everything he had intended in designing and building bogard  that was precisely the thing which ought never to have happened .  he looked at the unmoving  unmoved machine and wondered what had gone so profoundly wrong that it had allowed the human it was programmed expressly to protect to die .      would someone please explain this to me .     mia asked .      derec built it  let him try     ariel said in disgust .      under normal circumstances .  .  .     derec started .  his throat caught  and he coughed .     normal circumstances .  .  .  whatever that means .  .  .  the three laws are built into every positronic brain  part of the core template .  they represent the first principles for a robot  the foundation on which all its subsequent learning and experience rests .  the initial designers set it up so that almost all the secondary programming requires the presence of those laws in order to function .  it would require a complete redesign of all the manufacturing methods as well as the basic pathways themselves to build a brain without the three laws .  they aren   t just hardwired into the brain  they are basic to the processes of constructing one .         is that what you did .  redesign everything .         no .  i   m not that good .  nor am i that irresponsible .  all i did was set in place a new set of parameters for the application of the laws .         you circumvented them     ariel snapped .      i did not .  i took an accepted standard practice and stretched it .         what practice .     mia asked .      setting conditions of when the robot perceives that it is responsible for a violation     derec explained .     think about it .  according to the first law  if a robot followed it absolutely  all robots would collapse .     a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .      consider that as an absolute .  human beings are always coming to harm .  time and distance alone guarantee that a robot can   t act to prevent that harm in all cases .  if some kind of buffer zone  a hierarchical response  weren   t in place  the instant robots realized how many humans came to harm because they weren   t doing something to prevent it  we would have no functional robot population .  so we establish a reasonable limitation for its application .  if a robot does nothing to stop the human it is standing right next to from being killed  say  by a speeding vehicle  out of control  then it fails and collapse follows .  if that same robot can do nothing to prevent the same fate happening to a human a kilometer away from it  the only way it fails is if another human forcefully asserts that it was at fault .  it does not automatically perceive itself as responsible .      mia nodded .     that makes sense .          practical engineering     derec said .     but then we run into a functional brick wall when it comes to certain tasks .  law enforcement  for one .  most positronic brains cannot cope with violent crime .  a few have been programmed to dissociate under very specific circumstances so that  say  witnessing dead humans at a crime scene won   t create a three law crisis .  but they still can   t make arrests because that offers the potential of harm to a human being .         but a criminal      mia began .      is still a human being     derec insisted .     what a human has done by violating a law does not mitigate the robot   s adherence to the three laws .         unless you redefine harm     ariel said .     which is how you got around the three law imperative .         that   s an oversimplification     derec replied .     what i redefined was the sphere of responsibility .  bogard is just as committed to the three laws as any other robot  but it has a broader definition of that commitment .  it can make the determination that limiting a human   s freedom action  even if it results in a degree of harm  bruises or strained muscles  for instance  may prevent harm from coming to other humans .         you   re telling me you gave it a moral barometer .     ariel demanded .      sort of .  it relies on the human to which it is assigned to make that determination .  it also recognizes a human prerogative to go in harm   s way should circumstances require risk to prevent further harm .         and when confronted with a clear case of three law violation .         it has memory buffers and a failsafe that shunts the data out of the primary positronic matrix .  it prevents positronic collapse and allows for the opportunity for further evaluation .  in a proper lab debriefing  the cause and effect of a situation can be properly explained and set in context .  the robot can be reset and returned to duty .         you gave it selective amnesia     ariel said .     it can allow a human to come to harm and still function because after the fact it doesn   t remember doing it .         that   s why bogard left data out of its report     mia said .      that   s why i have to take bogard back to phylaxis to debrief it .      mia nodded thoughtfully .     so why don   t you approve  ariel .         a robot is a machine     she said .     a very powerful machine .  it is intelligent  it can make decisions .  i want them inextricably joined to the three laws so that they can never  never  circumvent their concern for my safety .  if they fail to protect me  i want them shut down .  i don   t want them thinking it over .  i don   t want to ever be considered a secondary or tertiary concern by a robot who may decide that i ought to be sacrificed for the good of the many .  or of a specific individual .  i think loosening the bonds like this can only lead to operational conflicts that will result in unnecessary harm .         that   s the only way to construct a robot bodyguard  though     derec said .      there should be no such thing  then .     ariel shouted .     it didn   t work .  somewhere in its sloppy brain it made a decision and sacrificed senator eliton .  explain it to me how that was for anyone   s greater good .      derec stared at her  ashamed .  he could think of no answer to give her .  in fact  he had no answer for himself .      twenty one    mia watched the argument escalate  amazed at ariel .  she had always seen her friend as impatient but controlled  usually even tempered  never enraged and irrational .  but this was a side of ariel with which mia had no experience .  the unreasoned hatred she directed at bogard reminded mia more of an anti robot fanatic than of a spacer who ought to be at ease with robots .      ariel      derec said tightly  obviously reining in his own anger .   ariel left the room .   derec closed his eyes  leaning back in his chair .      you two have known each other a long time .     mia asked .   derec gave a wan smile .     too long  i sometimes think .  in a way  i   ve known her all my life .         you   re not          related .  no .  it   s just i  we  both had amnemonic plague .  burundi   s fever .  we   ve been complete amnesiacs .  when i had my bout  ariel was the first human i came into contact with .         and you were with her when she had hers .      derec nodded .      so .  .  .  why don   t you explain this dispute to me .  i didn   t understand half of what you were talking about .      derec drew a deep breath  clearly uncomfortable .     well .  i started investigating the way positronic memory works  especially in the aftermath of collapse .  sometimes you can recover a collapsed positronic brain  not often  but it can happen .  there   s something .  .  .  unpredictable .  .  .  in the way they collapse .  i was curious about that .         having been an amnesiac have anything to do with this .         more than a little .  what differs between human and robot is in the way we   re locked into our perceptual realities .  the way we interface with the world .  humans have a plasticity robots lack  we can indulge fiction  for instance  and know the difference  even when it   s a full sensory entertainment that is designed to mimic reality in the finest detail .  a robot can   t do that .  tell its senses that what it is perceiving is    real     and it acts upon that stimulus .  it can   t make the intuitive distinction .  if what it perceives causes a conflict with its three law imperatives  collapse is likely unless quickly resolved .         even a fictional crisis .     mia asked .   derec nodded .     exactly .  convince a robot a lie is real  and it has no way to treat the lie as a conditional reality pending further data  like a human does .  now in either case  unacceptable realities can cause breakdowns .  humans still suffer nervous collapses  psychotic amnesia  reactive psychoses  a variety of disorders in which the brain tries to deal with an emotional or physical shock that the mind cannot accept .  it happens faster and under more concrete conditions to a robot .  but in the case of humans  the attempted resolution is also an attempt to circumvent the trauma to allow the organism to continue functioning .         amnesia victims can still carry on living even if they can   t remember who they are or where they came from .         simply put  yes .  i wanted to see if some sort of the same mechanism could be duplicated in a positronic brain .      mia looked over at bogard .     it seems you succeeded .         not completely .  what i established was a bypass  true .  the memory is still there  but inaccessible to the primary matrix .  i shunted it over to a buffer .  eventually  it has to be dealt with or bogard will start suffering from diagnostic neurosis .         what   s that .         it   s what i tried to explain to you before .  a positronic brain runs a self diagnostic every few hours .  at some point  bogard   s diagnostic will register the absence of a specific memory node as a chronic problem .  it won   t be able to fix it  so bogard will start feeling the need to be serviced .  it can impair function .      mia felt a ripple of anxiety .  she still did not want to release bogard .     so tell me why ariel doesn   t like this .         anything that tampers with the full function of the three laws she sees as a step away from heresy     derec said .     in her view  by giving bogard the ability to continue functioning in the wake of a three law conflict that should shut it down  i   ve created a monster .     he grunted .     it was her work that gave me the direction to go  though .         how   s that .         her doctoral thesis from calvin .     three law conflict under alternative concretizations .      basically  she proposed the possibility of an informational loop that is created when a robot has incomplete data which strongly suggests the necessity of action .     derec frowned .     unfortunately  it can   t make the determination of which kind of action because the information is incomplete .  it starts running probability scenarios  to fill in  basically by occam   s razor  the blanks in its information so it can make a decision .  but it still can   t .  it can theoretically create its own delusional scenario wherein collapse is imminent based on an unreal situation .  one of ariel   s inferences was that a positronic brain could be lied to on a fundamental level and thus create a false standard of reality for it .  the hierarchical response to perception would be distorted .  and it would be stuck in it  the loop causing a cascade of alternative perceptions .         how would you do that .  just walk up to it and say    by the way  black is white  and people can fly    .         no  the hardwiring prevents the brain from accepting that kind of input .  it would have to be a more direct interference  like a virus that could change pathways in the brain structure .  something that would directly affect the positronic pathways themselves .         doesn   t that describe what happened to the ri at union station .      derec looked worriedly at her .     yes .  that   s what i wanted to see by doing the physical inspection .  there   s evidence of a direct intervention at certain sensory nodes  but we can   t tell which ones they were .         could anyone have accessed your research .      derec shook his head  but mia saw uncertainty in his face .  the notion had occurred to him  but he did not want to give it too much consideration .      if i understand everything you   ve told me so far     mia continued     that means that bogard could only have malfunctioned if it had been ordered to do so .  if it had been given a set of operational parameters that allowed it to perceive reality a little bit differently .         i suppose .  .  .  yes  that   s logical .  but          so someone told it to fail .  that   s the only way it could have .  correct .  because it   s been performing flawlessly for me .      derec shifted uncomfortably .     i   m not sure i completely follow .         somehow  someone convinced bogard that eliton was in no danger .  someone programmed it to ignore the real situation .         but it went into full protect mode .  it enshielded eliton .         bogard was linked to the ri   s sensory net at the time .      derec stared at her for a long time  then nodded .     bogard would have been affected by the same thing that altered the ri   s realtime perception .  but it still enshielded eliton .  .  .         it looked to me like eliton had ordered bogard to go protect humadros .         eliton would have needed the override codes .  he didn   t have them  did he .         no .  .  .  unless someone gave them to him .     mia rapped her fist on the arm of her chair .     i have to get access to the service datum .         there may be a way to do that .  but i have to debrief bogard before we go much further .  you have to release it to me .      mia knew he was right .  bogard carried information they needed and she did not have the skills to get to it .  but she still walked painfully and badly  and she felt more vulnerable than she ever had in her life .   bogard could not protect her forever  though .  the only way to feel safe again  on her own  would be to solve this .  for that  derec needed bogard .  she had to hand it over to him .   do spacers feel this way all the time .  she wondered .  vulnerable without their robots .  lost  insecure  incapable .  maybe it wasn   t such a bad thing to get rid of them .  .  .   the thought shocked her .  robots were tools .  if people had allowed themselves to become so overdependent on them that they could no longer function without them  was that the fault of the tool .  hardly .  but it was always easier to change an environment than change the people who lived in it .  getting rid of robots was far easier than making the necessary  and probably beneficial  changes in people .   but what do i know .  i   m just a cop  not a philosopher .      very well  mr .  avery     she said .  she turned to the robot .     bogard .        mia knocked on ariel   s bedroom door .  she heard nothing and nearly returned to the living room when it opened .  ariel had changed her clothes .  she had an appointment with the representative from the settler   s coalition this afternoon  mia remembered .      sorry     ariel said .      for what .      ariel shrugged  smiled  scowled  and turned away with a look of disgust  all within the space of a second .     i get a little irrational on certain subjects .  i hate losing control in front of people .         you enjoy it in private .      ariel looked startled  then laughed .  she came out and went into the living room .  she stopped and looked around .     where are they .         i  uh  turned bogard over to derec .  it was time .      ariel nodded thoughtfully .     you know  this is the only thing derec and i have ever disagreed on .         i   m sure .      ariel smiled wryly .     you   re very politic .  but i   m talking about serious issues  not the annoying debris that clutters up anyone   s life .         besides bodyguard work  what else would such a robot be good for .         good for .  nothing .     ariel paused .     no  that   s not fair .  quite a few situations would suit a robot that was able to more loosely interpret the three laws .  starships rarely have mi .  xed bridge crews .  usually  the robotic contingents are on stand by till needed .  it   s still dangerous to travel space .  exploration  certain kinds of lab work  some heavy industries .  it   s feasible that where now we have to either leave it all to robots or all to people  a robot like bogard would make it possible for a mi .  xed presence .  police work  certainly .  forensics robots are lab technicians that are specifically programmed to ignore the fact that a corpse was once a human being in the sense of a person in need of protection .  but those are very limited refinements  nothing like what derec has done .         you really disapprove     mia said .      it really scares me .      silence stretched between them .  mia could find no worthwhile response to her friend   s admission .  she shrugged .      we have plenty to keep us busy .  you got another interesting call while you and derec were gone .        mia ran a query through the public datum on the garage .  the place was serviced under general contract by a maintenance firm called cyvan .  cyvan services did upkeep on a variety of storage facilities and a few government buildings .  they were owned by a holding company  though  glovax diversified .  it took time to find out who owned glovax  but the answer  even though she would have guessed another  did not surprise her .      imbitek .  just like the ambulance .         imbitek bought the ambulance .     ariel asked .      not directly .  it took me the whole time you were gone to track that one down .  the bid was submitted by holden transport and combined services  who took possession .  but the credits came from lexington siever financial .  holden transport banks with them  but it   s not their primary account  just a short term cache for incidental expenditures .  it was certainly large enough for this purchase  but the credits were replenished the next day from another in the same institution  a private account for one nis garvander  who sits on the board of directors of glovax diversified .  three days after the transfer of funds  garvander closed his account down .         glovax .  .  .     ariel mused .     so we   re right back at imbitek .         looks that way .      ariel tapped her lips .     but this is still circumstantial  isn   t it .  after all  imbitek suffered casualties .  how come dynan didn   t .         good question .  rega looms certainly looks like the more obvious suspect .         which might be exactly why dynan took no hits .      mia looked at ariel .     you   re thinking they were set up .      ariel nodded .  mia respected ariel   s perceptiveness .  she would have made a good security specialist .      but     mia said     we shouldn   t discount dynan completely .  i   m trying to find out if there have been any funds exchanged between the two companies .  it   s still possible that dynan engineered everything and left this trail just so we   d find it .         i could never be a cop     ariel said  shaking her head .     it must drive you crazy to suspect everyone all the time .         oh  it   s not that bad .  i don   t suspect you .      ariel grinned .     thanks .  it would help if we knew why this happened .         motive .  both those firms have motive .  positronics could directly impact their markets  and in dynan   s case there   s a moral aspect .         i don   t believe anyone seriously thinks positronics will ever have the presence on earth it once had .  i   ve talked to alda mikels a couple of times .  he   s far too sensible to think that way .      mia gestured at the crate with the positronic brain .     what about that .         certain people will always buy things that are illegal  just to be daring .  there   s no doubt that earth has enough of a market to sustain an illicit trade in positronics  but it would never support a legitimate traffic .         but it would have an impact on interstellar trade  wouldn   t it .  i mean  mikels wants to export his products .  competition with positronics isn   t a big deal here  but on settler worlds and spacer worlds .      ariel pursed her lips thoughtfully .     hmm .  but the conference would have addressed those issues .         if he trusted the outcome .         and rega looms .         he doesn   t even think we should be in space .      ariel fell silent  deep in thought  and mia turned her attention to the datum .  the ambulance log ariel and derec had retrieved gave little enough information  but it was sufficient for them to construct the scenario .  the false ambulance team arrived  got hold of eliton   s body  and took it back to the garage .  the travel time recorded allowed for no other possibility .  so they at least knew that the body lying in the morgue adjacent to reed hospital complex was not eliton   s .   but  then  where was the real body .   or was eliton really dead .   mia cleared her throat .     there   s something else .  i did a public data search on the connections between the various people in this and .  .  .     she hated her own reticence .     i found something that shouldn   t be .  derec mentioned that imbitek was doing the refit at union station .  they started the next morning  after the attack  which is incredibly fast .  i thought it had been an emergency appropriation that had been rushed through to meet the crisis  but i checked and found that the contract for the refit was part of the original deal for union station .  when the contract was drawn up two years ago  imbitek was the first company signed for work .  there   s a clause that gives them exclusivity in case of a failure .         that sounds unbelievably foresighted .  or .  .  .         or collusive .  senator eliton  it was his committee that vetted the contract .         of course     ariel said .      it turns out that eliton and mikels have another connection .  mikels    son died in the military .  at ganymede .  eliton was the brigade commandant on that action .      ariel   s eyebrows rose .     i had no idea that eliton had been in the military .      mia nodded .     eliton and mikels knew each other then .  eliton had arranged for mikels    son to be transferred into his unit .  shortly afterward  mikels gave him a significant share of stock in imbitek .  as far as i have been able to determine  eliton never divested .  there are nondisclosure restrictions on private actions dating back over fifteen years .         convenient .  so mikels and eliton knew each other .  and eliton got mikels    son killed .  so what is this .  revenge .         i suppose that depends on whether or not eliton is still alive .  but if they hated each other  why would eliton give this kind of a concession to imbitek on union station .         blackmail .      mia shrugged uncomfortably .     which reminds me .  you have an appointment to make .      ariel looked at her quizzically .     hmm .  oh  your acquaintance .  coren lanra .         correct .      ariel went to the com .     tell me about him .         he used to be special service .  he quit last year in protest over senator eliton   s pro positronic leanings .  he   s a committed anti robot humanist .            flesh  not steel    .         he wasn   t quite there when he quit  but he works for looms now .         why do you think he contacted me .         that   s what we need to find out .      ariel entered lanra   s code and waited .      lanra .         mr .  lanra  this is ariel burgess again .     mia started at the sound of ariel   s voice  she was making it rough and gravelly .     where would you be comfortable meeting .      there was a long pause .     are you sure you want to .  your voice sounds          it   s been a long day and i   ve been talking most of it  mr .  lanra .  that   s the kind of job i have .  now  if you please .         i see .  all right .  um .  .  .  do you know sullivan   s .         very well .         in .  .  .  four hours .         how will i know you .         i know you .  i   ll meet you .      the connection broke and ariel cleared her throat .      why   d you do that .     mia asked .      you and i don   t sound that much alike .  now what .      mia looked at the assortment of devices ariel had gotten  some from a specialty dealer mia knew  others from her own embassy security people  and wondered if it would be enough .  she picked up a transceiver pair and rolled the small beads around in the palm of her hand .  they were good for several kilometers .  she sighed and held them out to ariel .      we meet him at sullivan   s .        sullivan   s occupied three floors of the lexington coriolis hotel and offered a view of the mall just south of the ancient lincoln memorial .  mia could not remember now if the memorial was one of the reconstructions or the original .  a good part of the old washington d .  c .  had been destroyed in the riot years  during which  among other things  robots were banned from earth .  it looked crowded and out of place beneath the enclosing roof that now covered all urban habitats on earth .  the mall itself was an anachronism  a holdover of a time known now only to professional historians and a few antiquarian enthusiasts .  it served more as a reminder that there had been a past than what that past meant .   mia sat by the terrace on the second level  alone at a small table .  she had been terrified when she stepped out of the embassy .  her leg still ached  but ariel had gotten her painkillers and an adrenal analog in case she needed to move faster than she should .  still  she was not one hundred percent and she felt open and vulnerable .   but the terror subsided and it felt good to be out .  she was doing something and it surprised her how much she had missed that feeling .   she absently scratched her left ear and pressed the small bead more firmly in .  ariel wore the other of the pair as a pin on her jacket .   the other tool mia had brought along rested inside her jacket   a short  blunt tube that projected a jolt of electricity  enough to stun .  she had wanted to bring a sidearm  but decided against it   this time .      ms .  burgess .     said a male voice through the transceiver .   mia casually looked toward ariel   s table  in the center of the main dining room .  lanra stood there now  introducing himself .      yes .     ariel said .      i   m coren lanra  chief of security for dynan manual industries .         pleased to meet you .     ariel gestured for him to sit .      i appreciate you coming to talk .  i realize that you   ve got a busy schedule .         i do  mr .  lanra  so please make the time count .      lanra grinned slightly  apparently surprised by ariel   s abruptness .     yes  well .  my employers are concerned at the reaction over the union station incident .  certain charges are being made .  they fear arrests are imminent .         and why would that be .         you saw the recordings .  no one from our group was injured .  every other group suffered casualties  but not one of our people was shot .         you make that sound like a bad thing .          in this instance  it is .  we look very culpable .         are you .         no .     pause .     you don   t believe me .         i think i could accept that you aren   t culpable  mr .  lanra  at least not directly     ariel replied .     but looms has been railing against spacers and robots since i   ve been here and  i   m assured  long before that .  he   s been very explicit in his desire to cut off all contact between earth and the spacer worlds and to stop the exodus of settlers .  now  on the eve of a conference which would strengthen all those ties and possibly enable an even freer exchange of immigrants and ideas  he and his entourage are the only ones untouched by assassins  who themselves may be affiliated with a group in sympathy with mr .  looms    own church .  tell me that doesn   t make a persuasive case against him .      lanra nodded .     it does .  it   s almost perfect .  and that should tell you that it   s not true .  how often does reality match up so well with appearances .         you have a different view  of course .         looms is on record as being opposed to any kind of technology that isolates people from direct control .         true .         then why would he use that very technology to commit a crime for which he   d be likely to be implicated .  and where would he get the expertise to implement it .         expertise can be bought     ariel noted .      to what end .  close down a conference that might give him the best platform he   s ever had from which to be heard .      ariel shook her head .     all you   re doing is arguing motive  mr .  lanra .  there is as much motive to implicate him as there is to exonerate him .         all right  what do you think was accomplished by this assassination .  what was there in this conference that was so threatening that someone would commit murder to stop it .         a lot of tradition  a lot of credits  a lot of territorial imperative .         all that  yes .  but it   s the money .  now ask yourself  what part of the proposed treaty was most likely to pass that would cost the most money .         cost who .         answer the first  you answer that .         there were a lot of elements        let me give you a hint .  tiberius .         the boarding incident .      lanra nodded .     that almost triggered a war  yes .         i   m not sure i follow  mr .  lanra .      lanra leaned toward her  folding his hands on the table .     a year and a half ago  mr .  looms was approached by a group of industrialists to join an investment portfolio being funded by certain shipping lines .  mr .  looms declined  since he disapproves of interstellar settlement and  although the money looked very good  he could not afford to appear hypocritical on this issue .  most of his own investors are members of his church and they invest in dynan as much from ideological conviction as out of the hope for potential profit .  the fact is  dynan doesn   t perform nearly as well as its closest competitors  so that loyalty is significant .  we make a lot of money  but our profit margins are narrower than average .  this group assured him that his participation would be entirely anonymous .  in fact  all of their participation in it was anonymous and completely off record .  the profits were funneled directly into the mutual fund  loaned out  and returned as interest free payments  at which time the funds could go into any account without the hint of taint .  when mr .  looms inquired into this shipping line through other channels  he found no such line existed .  officially .         black market     ariel said .      exactly .         the pirates .         who are not  strictly speaking  pirates     lanra pointed out .     the thefts are all prearranged .  the part of the treaty that would put a damper on it was the clause concerning robotic inspection of all ships  coming or going  to any recognized colony or spacer world .         i   d considered that  of course .  how does this let looms off .         he has no investment in this enterprise and  in fact  would not mind seeing such inspection .  he feels that terrans would resent it so much that it would significantly reduce trade .  in time  it could curtail colonization .  hurt both enough  and you might see the day when earth can extricate itself from involvement with spacers and settlers .         that seems a bit optimistic  don   t you think .     ariel asked .      maybe .  all i   m concerned with here is that it reduces rega looms    culpability .         disrupting the conference could accomplish the same thing  though .  give me something more concrete .      lanra shook his head .     i can   t .  i   m looking into it  but right now i can   t .  i needed to see you to find out what you intend to do .      ariel raised her eyebrows .     me .         spacers .         we   re hardly a monolith  mr .  lanra .  my own people are taking a wait and see approach .  when and if the terran authorities make arrests  then we can see .         they   re likely to arrest rega looms .  what then .         it   s a question of evidence .         look     lanra said .     mr .  looms is not especially liked here  either .         what do you mean     either    .         like spacers .  see  people want stability  they want comfort  they want reassurance .  they don   t want disruption .  change scares them .  the way things are right now  it   s fairly comfortable .  both you and my employer advocate changes .  whoever is setting this up will give the people something they want  two avenues of unwelcome change closed down .  who   s going to be on rega looms    side in this when he   s been telling people for years what lazy bastards they   ve been because they won   t peel their own potatoes or make their own clothes .  he sees the average technological environment today as no better than one with positronics .  people resent it   enough to not care that he might not be guilty .         he   s the perfect scapegoat  in other words     ariel said .      as you say .         you still haven   t given me an alternative .         alda mikels .         imbitek .  why would he .         you should look at his finances .  and you should look at your own people .  this didn   t happen entirely here on earth .  the black market exists to serve spacers and settlers as well as terrans .         you   re very good at making broad claims that you can   t back up     ariel said dryly .      there   s a very  very old saying on earth  ms .  burgess     follow the money .           lanra stood then .     thanks for meeting with me .  i hope it wasn   t fruitless .      mia watched him cross the dining room .  halfway toward the entrance  he did a casual turn  sweeping the room .  a very professional move  one she should have seen coming  but did not .  she froze in place as his gaze swept past her  then returned  briefly .  she thought she saw a faint frown of puzzlement  followed by a quick smile .   then he was gone .      twenty two    the embassy limo pulled into the phylaxis garage .  derec told it to wait and ascended to the main level to see who was present .  he found rana in the cafeteria  making coffee .      anyone here .     derec asked .      no .  stu came by today  filed his reports  then went home .  no one else .  listen  this has been quite a day so far .  you received a call you will not believe and the work ups on that stuff you found          later .  prep bogard   s niche .      she blinked at him  momentarily uncomprehending .  then her eyes widened .     right .      derec returned to the limo .      bogard  come with me .      the robot unfolded out of the rear seat  its body flowing liquidly and resuming its standard form alongside derec .  derec told the limo to return to the embassy .  he watched it back out of the garage and drive away .  the door closed and derec led bogard up to the lab .      do you remember this place  bogard .         yes  derec .  i was constructed and programmed here .          that   s correct .  do you know why i   ve brought you back .         debriefing and recalibration .         correct .  are you aware of a gap in your primary memory .         y yes  yes     the robot stammered .      fine  bogard  don   t focus on it     derec said calmly .     that gap represents a potential conflict .  that   s what we   re going to fix .         y  esss  derec .      the abrupt distortion in bogard   s speech execution worried derec .  he had expected a slight hesitancy  not such a clear sign of imminent collapse .  it had been over four days since the incident  so perhaps it was not unreasonable to expect problems like this .      oh  my .     rana stood at the door to a separate chamber  staring at bogard .     i thought          i know     derec said quickly .     is everything prepped .         uh  yes .      derec led the robot through the doorway into the small room .  the space contained two workstations  cousins to those in the main lab .  against one wall stood a robotic niche  modified to link to a third console off to the left .  a wide table hung from the right hand wall  tools and half constructed components covered it .   rana went to one of the workstations  derec the other .      bogard  please enter the standby module     derec said .   bogard obediently backed into the niche .  derec activated the module .  the niche extruded hundreds of wire fine i o probes and linked bogard into the system .   derec relaxed then  surprised at the amount of tension he had carried all the way from the embassy .  he realized at that moment that he had been uncertain of bogard   s cooperation .  perhaps ariel was right and tinkering with absolute three law restrictions was a mistake .   too late .  .  .      all right     he said to rana     start the alignment .  bogard   s buffer is holding a major conflict at bay .  i think the internal barriers are about to yield to the diagnostics .         it   s been what .  four  five days .     rana asked  working her console .      close enough .  i thought we might have a little more time  but it   s already showing symptoms of collapse .      derec watched the screens at his station .  the buffer transfer was the most complicated part of the debriefing .  a duplicate positronic brain received the contents of bogard   s buffer  allowing for a full assessment of its impact .  simultaneously  a simple memory cache received a verbatim record of those same contents .      thales  please monitor the positronic transfer     derec said .      yes  derec     the ri replied .      alignment ready     rana said .      begin .      several things happened at once .  all the screens on derec   s board showed sudden changes  most especially the three showing activity in the receptor brain .  where there had been the trace readings of a functioning but unprogrammed positronic net  now the scales indicated a rapidly adapting set of personality algorithms  basic memory notation  and program parameters .  within less than two minutes  the receiving positronic brain became bogard .   and the trouble started .      derec     thales said     there is a rejection algorithm working .         what .         the receptor is rejecting the contents .  it carries an unassimilable paradox .      now derec saw it  a discontinuity starting in the memory pathways and spreading into the personality .  the two aspects were drifting out of sync with each other .  the receptor brain was trying to refuse the information .  positronic brains carried certain self protects in their initial make up which prevented them being programmed in any way that conflicted with the three laws .      how about the memory dump .         reception and encoding nominal .          bypass the personality sectors     derec told rana .   rana nodded  her fingers dancing on her console .  gradually  the discontinuity flattened out and the transfer proceeded .  by circumventing that part of the positronic brain which manifested as a robot   s personality  the information could now load as simple data .      once it   s all transferred     derec said     then we   ll try adding the rest .      rana frowned  but continued working .     set and working .  this will take some time  maybe ten minutes .  fifteen .         good .     derec ran a hand over his face  feeling all the weariness from the day .  had it all happened in less than five days .  yes  and he had been working eighteen out of every twenty four hours since the incident .  even so  he knew he should not be this tired .  then again  arguing with ariel always drained him .      was that coffee i saw .     he asked .      absolutely     rana replied .      i   ll be right back .      he wanted to go upstairs and stretch out on the cot  but he walked into the cafeteria instead and poured a cup of coffee .  the past few days seemed to both contract and expand in his memory  at once too short a time and too long .  he was worn from the distorted time sense .   but he was excited  too .  he felt close to an answer .  maybe not the answer  but an important one just the same  and once he had a handle on one relevant fact the rest could be dragged out into the open through sheer persistence .   unfortunately  right now he could make no sense of anything he had learned .   the com chimed .  derec wandered toward it  intending only to hear who it was .      mr .  avery  this is tathis kedder .  from union station .  i uh       derec stepped up to the com and pressed accept .     i   m here  mr .  kedder .  how can i help you .         well  i   m not sure .     kedder laughed nervously .     i was going over some old logs and  um .  .  .  there are some inconsistencies in the way the ri was reporting certain things that  well  in light of everything else that   s happened  they made me wonder .         what sort of inconsistencies .         i   d  uh  rather not discuss it over a comline .         i see .  where would you like to talk  then .         my apartment .  tomorrow afternoon .         send the address .  i   ll be there  mr .  kedder .         thank you  mr .  avery .  i  uh  i appreciate this .      the connection broke and derec grunted .  what was this all about now .  reminded  he touched the reconnect for joler hammis .  the line still came up unavailable .      how come kedder isn   t looking for new work .     he wondered aloud .     maybe he is .         derec     rana called from the main lab .     i need to show you this .      derec returned to the lab .  rana was leaning over a workstation .      those flakes you gave me the other night .  look .     she pointed to one of the screens .   the image showed a six sided lattice structure .  the pattern spread over the entire screen .  .  .  except in three places  where the hexagonal form splintered around an octahedron .      what .  .  .  .     derec said .      the vertices     rana said     are oxygen atoms .  they   re bonding aluminum atoms throughout most of the matrix except here      she pointed to the octagonal forms      where they   re bonding faujasite analogs .         analogs .  .  .  you mean they   re synthetic .          as far as i can tell  the whole thing is synthetic .  what i mean is  the faujasite molecules are composed of similar components  except instead of electrons in the constituent atoms  these have positrons .      derec felt his scalp ripple .     positrons .  you   re telling me this is a brain construct .         it   s a construct  but i wouldn   t call it a brain .  the basic shape is a zeolite .         zeolites .  .  .  filters  industrial filters .     derec shook his head .     huh .         i said the basic shape     rana explained .     those faujasite analogs have one other component that i don   t recognize .  the positrons are interacting with the aluminum atoms and transferring themselves like an electrical current from octahedron to octahedron .  the aluminum ends up    borrowing    electrons from the oxygen atoms .  the resultant oxide sort of follows the current  passing the positrons along .  no normal atom wants to keep the positron  so it just travels .         ending up where .         it   s looking for another positronic matrix .         why .      rana shrugged .   derec studied the screen .     industrial filters .  .  .  zeolites are used in food processors  for reconstituting certain molecules into different combinations .  .  .  they   re used in gas exchangers .  all they   re really designed to do is pass other molecules and recombine them or strip out electrons to make isotopes .  what would this be used for .     he chewed his lip .     this is incomplete  isn   t it .  were there any other atoms .         a few scattered ions  nothing coherent .         like what .         platinum  a few pyroxenes  stray carbons .  .  .     rana   s voice trailed off .   derec looked at her .     and .     he prodded .      well  there were a few large fragments of long chain carbon atoms  i can   t swear to it  but it looked like a fullerene .         a buckyball .         no  buckytubes .         superconducting .         there wasn   t enough of one left to test  but that would be my bet .         buckytubes .  .  .  with positrons instead of electrons .         no  but the fragmenting looked like it had occurred at that level  like the binding electron shells had been disrupted .         as if a positron had been passed through it .      again  she shrugged  but now there was a small grin on her face .      so what we   re looking at     derec mused     is a material designed to find and link with a positronic matrix and pass material into that matrix .  a conduit that  what .   attaches parasitically and sets up a single point feedback loop .         fullerenes grow under the right circumstances .  if this material permeated the ri        there   d be no way to tell without examining the ri itself .     derec shuddered .     clever .  somebody has created what amounts to a positronic parasite .         but all it could do would be to pass positrons into the system .  the charges are opposite for anything else and if it   s a positronic matrix  then it   s still functioning as its own brain .         unless this thing can be used to feed it new information .         what kind .     rana asked .      perceptions .      rana   s eyes widened .     the game .      derec nodded .     the ri took itself off line during the assault to playa game .  the game was loaded into the system to begin with  but it knew it was a game .         but if it came through a secondary matrix that substituted one set of sensory parameters for another          the ri wouldn   t be able to tell which one was reality .  at least not right away .  it might have reset itself .         or this might have just switched off .         either way  it wouldn   t be able to tell that the false information was coming from outside .  this would appear to be just another branch of its own system .         damn .         absolutely damn .  i       a chime sounded .  rana peered at another console .     bogard   s finished transferring .        derec put bogard on standby before he brought the receptor brain up .     thales  i want you to run monitor .  keep the receptor brain from collapsing till we get a complete picture .         may i remind you  derec     thales said in its calm way     that a conflicted positronic brain on the verge of collapse is a chaotic system .  i will do what i can  but i guarantee nothing .         do your best  thales .     derec touched a contact and watched his screens .      would you like me to run a recalibration on bogard .     thales asked .      can you handle both .         of course .      derec glanced at rana  who smiled at the hint of injured pride in thales    voice .      go ahead  then .     he studied the readouts .  he keyed a set of commands .     bringing up the surrogate .  .  .  now .      all the realtime graphs warped radically .      what .  what .  what .     came sharply over the speakers .  derec turned down the decibels .      bogard     he said .      y yes .  who are  what .         this is derec avery  bogard .  pay attention to my voice .  center on my voice .         d derec  yes .  i acknowledge  i know  i  yes          calm down .         i am .  i  am .         listen to me .  are you listening .         yes  derec .         i require a report .  can you give me a full report of the operation at union station .         yes  i  will .         begin report .      several seconds passed in silence .  the fluctuations displayed on the screens continued .      thales .     derec asked .      the brain continues nominal for the circumstances     thales said .   derec nodded .     bogard  report .         i cannot .     the response came as a shriek .      bogard  center on my voice     derec said calmly .     pay attention to my voice .      the robot paused .     yes  derec .         i require your report .         yes .      again  the silence stretched .  as derec was about to make his request again  bogard   s voice finally responded .      i failed .     it shouted .      report  bogard     derec insisted .   suddenly  the chaos on derec   s screens seemed to settle down slightly .      report on security operation     bogard said .     subject  eliton .  theater  the gallery at union station  washington  d .  c .      derec looked at rana  who seemed surprised .      continue     derec said .      all telemetry reports optimal .  crowd control is in effect .  communications and sensor telemetry established realtime through resident intelligence .  surveillance reports zero infiltration of threatening subjects .  police have blocked admission to several protestors who appear on their trouble list .  robotic security maximum .  crowd density acceptable  assessment acceptable  the word from one is go .      the limo stops at main entrance .  we are met by eliton   s field security team .  i am assigned operational control to agent mia daventri .  she indicates that the situation  while apparently chaotic  is acceptable .  i allow senator eliton to emerge from the limo first per prearranged program .  i follow immediately and perform an on site scan .  the crowd is noisy and hostile  but belligerence is kept at the level of verbal protest .  no indication of immediate threat .  per scheduled conditions i uplink to resident intelligence for optimal security coordination .  the security team moves ahead .  i stay one meter behind senator eliton all the way to the ceremonial platform .      i  mission parameter amendation  tier four  level b nine  proceed sublevel sixteen          bogard  stop     derec ordered .     clarify last sentence .         mission parameter amendation .         understood .  what is the nature of the amendation .         circumvention tactic .  request movement to tier four              bogard  stop .  clarify .  circumvention of what .  you are performing observe and protect duties for senator eliton .  what circumvention .      bogard paused .     i do not know .  missing modules

was the command code to override bogard   s preset priority  the command used by mia daventri to save the robot at union station .      who gave that command .     derec asked .      i do not know .         was it a human .         yes .      derec felt a chill .     did it originate from within your enshielding .         yes .         do you know who gave the command .     derec asked again .      no one .         someone had to .  bogard  reset parameters .  follow the logic .  you perceived a threat .         yes .         you enshielded senator eliton .          yes .         you received an amendation from the ri .         yes .         the command to reassign your primary concern came from within your enshielding .         yes .         who was the last human within your enshielding .         senator eliton .         conclusion .         senator eliton gave the command .     there was a long pause .  then     but he was no longer there .  i lost him .  i could not perceive him .  the ri had a positive track on him and he disappeared .  he could not have been there to give the command .         bogard  were you using the ri   s telemetry the whole time .         yes  as an augmentation to my own  until the link went down .         you were relying on the ri for identification and location .         yes .         who instructed you to do that .         standard procedure within union station .  i was told to conform to the required protocol .         by whom .         agent otin cupra  pending verification .      derec slammed his fist down on the console .     damn .  that son of a      he took a deep breath  exhaled raggedly .     bogard  did the ri lose track on senator eliton at the time of its last amendation .         yes .         i don   t understand     rana said .     what   s going on .         bogard was linked into the ri during the entire assault .   when the ri went off line  it took bogard with it .         that   s not possible  bogard wasn   t slaved to it .  besides  bogard claims the ri communication net went down .         true  but until that happened  for all practical purposes  at least half of bogard   s sensory net was being used by the ri .  it was sharing data realtime .  bogard never got drawn completely into the illusion that took the ri off line  but it was sufficient to impair bogard   s ability to sort out reality  at least for a short time .  long enough .  bogard was relying on the ri to keep informed of everyone   s whereabouts .  and why not .  one positronic brain to another  what was there to worry about .  they both had the same interests  the same standards  the same basic imperatives .  why would the ri intentionally distort data .  so when bogard lost track of eliton          it was because the ri had     rana concluded .     then the link went down and all that remained was the last amendation .  but what about this command that eliton gave .  that doesn   t make any sense .  bogard didn   t know he was within the enshieldment  but still accepted the command .  and how did eliton know it .  the primary should never know how to do that  otherwise what good is it having an incorruptible agent as bodyguard .  that was the whole point          rana  it   s me  derec .  i know .  i designed it .         but none of this is making any sense .  who   s agent otin cupra .         one of the pair that threw us off the job at union station .         what authority did he have issuing protocol instructions to bogard .  and why would bogard accept that instruction when it didn   t have to .         that   s a damn good question .  agent daventri had field control of bogard  but within special service i suppose anyone could give it orders that don   t run counter to its priorities .     derec sighed heavily .     it could take months to sort out all the numbers  but i think bogard had become  for an instant  part of the game the ri was absorbed in .  the command could have come from anywhere .  since bogard couldn   t locate eliton  it only made sense for it to shift priority to another primary .  left to its own  it might have realized its mistake and covered eliton again .  but it was given a new primary .         and failed to protect her .      derec nodded .     at which point bogard was probably in the process of severing its connection to the ri .  then it found eliton .         and failed to protect him .         and should by any normal expectation have collapsed on the spot .  if agent daventri hadn   t had the presence of mind to reset its priority again          daventri .  the one that died in the hospital later that night .         she didn   t die .  bogard got her out .  bogard performed faultlessly in protecting her .         if she   s not dead  why are they claiming that her body is in the morgue .     rana asked .      who   s claiming that .         i saw it on subetheric  oh  yesterday .  newsnet program .  the usual interviews with officials  meaningless answers .  they did  however  suggest a conspiracy between renegade agents within the service and the managins .         managins .  .  .     derec winced .     well  there   s a conspiracy  all right  but daventri isn   t part of it .  that   s why she was killed .         you said she wasn   t .         it   s not her body in the morgue .  i know .  i saw them both .  i also saw eliton   s body  with three wounds in it .  but at union station he only received one wound .         what does that mean .         it means that eliton didn   t die at union station .  .  .  if he died at all .     derec looked toward the ceiling .     thales  did you record all that .         everything  derec .  how much longer do you wish me to maintain the receptor   s integrity .         talk to it until you   re satisfied you have everything of use from it  then let it go .      rana looked pale .     now what .         now we get bogard back up to spec .  i have to call ariel .  i think i have a job for it .         you might want to answer the call you got today .         you did say something about that .  sorry .  who was it from .         alda mikels of imbitek .

did not amount to very much  an act of desperation  but it was action nonetheless  and after days of waiting for her body to recover  hiding out in ariel   s apartment  it seemed to her the zenith of plans .   bogard moved hesitantly  as if uncertain that it could or should walk .  the scarring and pitting over its shell  the way one arm hung inoperatively at its side  gave a convincing account of the aftermath of horrible trauma .  its coppery gleam was mostly hidden under a charred black .  anyone seeing it would know that it had been through a conflagration .   even so  it looked new compared to the ancient walls  columns  and beams of the alleyway .  graffiti formed palimpsests over the corroded  mildewed surfaces  attesting to the centuries of ambivalent residence .  pocked walls  undifferentiated litter softening corners and accruing in shallows mounds  half open doors  and a smell born of machine  stale breath  yeast  and sweat accentuated the lack of attention the district received .  most of the buildings here stood empty  long abandoned .  they were deep in the sublevels of d .  c .   near where bogard had brought her on that first night   s flight from the infirmary .   bogard staggered against a wall  turned with comic grace on one foot  and lurched toward the opposite wall .  mia found herself inexplicably worried for the robot  even though it was a machine just doing what it was told .   what derec had told it to do .      you   re sure it   ll be all right .     she asked .   he gave her a curious look  then shook his head .     it   s risky .  any number of things could go wrong .  tbi could pick it up  local police  a corridor gang  even a salvage crew .  are you changing your mind .  you said this was the only way to get inside .         yes .  .  .  it is .  only .  .  .     she glanced at her feet  avoiding his gaze .  only bogard is the only thing i feel absolutely confident in right now .  .  .  she sighed .     all my backdoors into the service databases have been shut down  all my passwords have been discontinued .  we need access .      derec nodded  then touched the com unit on their vehicle   s dash .      ariel     he said     we   re ready .  we let it off in corridor     sublevel ten  macmillan sector .         got it     ariel replied .     i   ll wait two minutes  then call it in .         good .      bogard disappeared around a corner and derec started the transport .     car  proceed to second preset destination .      the transport  an ordinary maintenance vehicle from an embassy garage  unmarked and anonymous  pulled away from the alleyway .      don   t worry     derec said to mia .     the least we can do is fail .         hah .  mattu used to say that failure wasn   t even part of our vocabulary .         mattu was your team leader .         since the first day i was assigned personal security for senator eliton .  he and gel had been working as a team for four years .  i replaced a retiring agent  starns .  she   d been team leader .  mattu was next in line .  he was very good  mr .  a very .      mia looked at him and saw surprise in his face and wondered how harsh she had sounded .  her eyes burned  time to stop talking about it .      you feel guilty     he said quietly .     you   re alive  they   re not .  bad enough if it had been some bunch of mad fanatics  outsiders  but you don   t know how to make sense of it being your own people .         are you a frustrated psychoanalyst .     he laughed briefly  without humor .     that would be convenient .  no  i just  i don   t really understand human nature that well .  i try .  i pay attention .  it seems that   s more than most people who don   t believe they have a problem with it do .         is that why you work with robots .         i told you          you told me why you built bogard .         touch   .     derec looked out the opposite window for a time  and she thought he intended to drop the subject .  but then  not looking at her  he said     i   m the son of a genius .  i lost .  .  .  memories .  i   ve made up for a lot of them  but i can never know how much i   ll never recover .  i don   t know why i   m as good at robotics as i am .  parental influence .  maybe .  probably .  but that answer is common  easy  and unsatisfying .  maybe you   re right .  maybe i work with robots to .  .  .  to understand .     he turned to her .     they make more sense than people do .  most of the time .      mia felt uncomfortable under his gaze  as if he expected more confession or perhaps confirmation .   the transport turned onto an ascending ramp .      do you think senator eliton is alive .     she asked .   he blinked at her  surprised again .  he nodded  though  accepting the change of subject .     if he is  then where is he .         i   m more interested in why .  if we know why he   s still alive  then we can figure out the rest .  why will give us who .         maybe we can find out from bogard .         from the service database .  why would it be there .         two agents  a senator  who knows who else .         i can   t accept that the entire service is culpable .  can you .         can you accept that eliton might be part of it .         i don   t know .      derec shrugged .     this is earth .         what is that supposed to mean .         when something inexplicable happens  spacers like to say    must be terran .      it   s a joke .  a bad one .  but there   s some truth in it .  something inexplicable happens here  they say    this is earth .      less of a joke .         what is so inexplicable about earth that isn   t about spacers .     mia asked .      hate .  hatred is a tradition here .  terrans hate robots .  most of them have never even seen one except in bad vids with rampaging robot villains  but they hate them anyway .  it doesn   t make sense  but it   s the truth .  even sensible people hate them .  how can you tell the difference between them and the fanatics .         we don   t have a monopoly on hatred .         no .  but it seems to be better done here than anywhere else .      mia fought with her resentment  surprised at her sudden anger  it proved his point  after all  especially since she found it impossible to disagree with him .      if hate is driving this     she said     then why the pretense of a conference at all .  why not just reinforce the restrictions already in place and shut the spacers out even more .         too much money at stake to stand on principle     he said .      for some  not all .         like rega looms .      mia nodded .     he   s one example .         maybe .  but it may still be a money issue .  if the conference succeeded  what would that do to dynan   s p   l statement .         you   re suggesting he   s the one most motivated to see it fail because of profit .     mia shook her head .     even without spacer competition  he would never be able to outperform the others .  imbitek could buy dynan out of petty cash .         then it   s hate .         coren lanra suggested that it   s the black market .  the pirates .         greed again .  take your pick .  hate versus greed .  in the middle  eliton .      mia found it too simple .  credits dictated life throughout the vast moral middleground of terran politics and industry  yielding at the edges to the passions .  but she had never known a truly passionate fanatic who could move in those middle terrains and not be seen clearly for an outsider .  even looms  radical as his personal philosophies made him  gave unto caesar and was deemed dependable by all the rest .  somehow  he did not fit this crime .   but she found derec   s simplistic reasoning compelling .  what had she learned at the academy .  the simplest motives explain the most .  complex behaviors could often be rendered down to very basic emotions .  the complexity only obscured the driving force .   so what was it .  hate or money .   or both .   the transport pulled onto a broad  brightly lit thoroughfare .  derec climbed into the back and returned wearing a stylish blue jacket .      personally     he said     i   m hoping it   s greed .  that can be understood as a matter of logic  simple numbers .  if it   s hate          then why would alda mikels personally invite you to see him .         one can only wonder .  wish me luck .         luck better have nothing to do with this .      he grinned at her .  presently  the transport pulled off the main road and slowed to a stop in a service corridor .  derec opened his door and stepped out .      be careful  agent daventri .  after all  you   re supposed to be dead .         the dead are tough  mr .  a very     mia said .  he started to close the door .     derec .     he paused  waiting .     good luck .         thanks .  you  too .      he closed the door and she watched him cross the corridor in front of the transport .  they had stopped half a kilometer from the corporate offices of imbitek .   derec and ariel were not professionals and although so far everything they had done had turned out well  mia wondered how much longer they could operate without incident .  now they were confronting people  digging where they could be discovered .  this would have been a difficult enough investigation with trained agents  but with amateurs .  .  .   she would have to get used to it  there was no choice .  when derec was out of sight  she touched the contact on the dash .      car  proceed to destination three .      the transport rolled on .     dynan manual industries maintained a large suite of offices far out in the arlington district  away from the majority of its fellow corporations .  looms evidently believed in making statements whenever possible  and his choice of location spoke of his deliberate dissociation from everyone else .   coren lanra  however  kept private offices closer to the heart of d .  c .   on the fourth floor of an old but well maintained structure just off the southwest corridor  at the outskirts of the infant district .  the area was popular for lawyers and lobbyists and supported a large community of service industries that catered to the wealthier residents .  in the mix one found research agencies  professional witnesses  independent forensics labs  physicians  therapists  a variety of technical experts  and private security firms .  mia had never learned why it was called the infant district .   the transport parked in the garage opposite  and mia stepped out onto the pavement .  her leg hurt like an old bruise  but she could walk normally again .  the only thing holding her back was fear .   she crossed to the entrance  sweeping the immediate area for any sign of service attention .   lanra   s office was in the middle of a row of eight along the hallway .  no one sat behind the reception desk .  mia stood very quietly in the middle of the foyer  listening for signs of occupation  and slowly searching for evidence of an arrest .  but everything was orderly  as if those who worked here had simply stepped out for a few minutes .   she went to the door marked coren lanra  i .  s .  i .  and nervously pressed her hand against it .  the door swung in soundlessly .   seated behind a desk  coren lanra watched her  a vague smile on his lips .  casually  he gestured for her to enter  then put a finger to his lips .   when the door closed behind her  lanra reached across his desk and pressed a contact .      there     he said .     now we   ve got maybe ten minutes before their ais untangle my encryption .     he smiled  a combination of genuine pleasure and opportunistic anticipation .     it   s not every day the dead walk .  how are you  mia .         i   ve been better .         i don   t doubt it .  please  sit down .  since we   re on a timer  we should skip the reminiscence and move to the important issues .  agreed .         agreed .  i have one question .          only one .         the only one there is .  who killed senator eliton .      lanra spread his hands  then folded them together .     i wish i knew .  the tbi wants to hang it on looms .  they   ve always had a fondness for morally committed outsiders .         you   re sure looms had nothing to do with it .         please  not you  too .  no  mia  it wasn   t looms .  let   s not waste time on a false lead .  besides  i   m fairly certain you   ve looked into enough of the peripheral evidence to have another suspect .  am i right .         the assassins were managins .         predictable .  you think they did it on their own .         no .      lanra nodded .     they haven   t got the resources .  the people  sure .  the means  no .  i   m still trying to figure out how they got inside union station with those weapons .      mia hesitated  wondering how much to reveal  how much any revelation might tell a trained ex service agent by what it left out or implied .  there was just too little time to be as careful as she wanted .      the ri was subverted     she said .   he covered it well  kept his expression as neutral as he could  but there was a moment of puzzlement in his eyes  replaced almost instantly by surprise  then masked .  he had not known .  lanra  at least  was not part of it .      that   s what we get for playing with this positronic crap .     he glanced at his hands for a moment .     i thought it had just failed .  so that definitely leaves out the managins .  they were the weapon  not the wielder .  so  how are you pursuing this .         first  i want to know why you contacted the aurorans .         process of elimination .  i knew    it couldn   t be the managins and i knew it wasn   t looms .  once the tbi started looking at us  i wondered where the service was .  they haven   t asked a single question of looms .  when you were killed      he cocked his eyebrows and grinned      it started to look like someone on the inside .  that meant someone in the service was involved  so i couldn   t go to them .  the tbi won   t listen  the local authorities could care less once the tbi take over .  the official statement from the spacers is basically wait and see  but one of the aurorans is staying here to try to conduct the conference .  i checked on her  a junior member  no experience and almost no authority .  the rest of the survivors have returned home  leaving the embassy staffs here to clean up after the mess is finished making .  all their actions indicate that they never knew this would happen  confused  disorganized  trying to put a good face on it .  i decided not to talk to the solarians because of their involvement with the ri .  the aurorans are as close to an objective party as we can find right now  and when i asked around to find out who was talking the spacers living on earth to stay put and not run  i hear the name ariel burgess .  calvin institute .  i started trying to talk to the aurorans .         you didn   t call burgess first .         no  i started at the top .  i wanted to see who would be willing to speak to me as much as anything else .         what about other corporate security .         our competitors .     lanra shook his head .     besides  they   re all amateurs .         underestimating your enemies .         no  keeping a handle on leaks .  the biggest problem with amateurs isn   t that they aren   t good at the job itself  but that they brag about it .  usually to their employers .         you think it   s corporate .         don   t you .         i can   t see a motive .  as far as i can tell  everyone stood to make a lot of money from this treaty .         legally  yes .         i don   t follow .         you   re looking at the wrong flow of capital .         the piracy .      lanra grunted .     one of the things i miss about working for the service is all the alternate labels the government puts on things .     piracy      they call it  as if ships in space chase each other  shooting  and the bad guys seize a hapless freighter against its will .  crap .  it   s tariff dodging  pure and simple  and if the treaty goes into effect  that ends .  frankly  as much as i hate robots  i can   t say i   d be sorry .         you   re saying major corporations are behind it .     mia asked .     there can   t be enough money in it to make it worth the risk .      lanra gave her a mock incredulous look .     really .  mia  think about it .  earth exports to fifteen of the fifty spacer worlds and another twenty settler colonies .  leaving out the settlers for now  do you have any idea how much we   re talking about .  on average  ten to twenty billion credits per world annually .  now that   s the legitimate trade .  out of that  the so called piracy bleeds off about five to eight percent .  just to average that out  let   s say that comes up to one point two billion a year that never gets to its destination .  the current set up prohibits earth from directly trading with the other spacer worlds  the fifteen we export to are licensed to distribute to them  we aren   t  and there   s a stiff tariff system in place between them  not to mention the contractual arrangements on those settler worlds where there are also spacer colonies .  black market merchandise easily commands twice to three times its legitimate market value  especially on merchandise not on the approved export list .  so that eighteen billion credits    worth of    lost    merchandise ends up on the black market fetching fifty to eighty billion in sales .  and if the spacers react predictably over these killings  you could see that figure double when they start raising tariffs and putting on more restrictions .  and i haven   t even mentioned the import black market or the fact that those    stolen    shipments are insured .  in total  i   d guess that you   re looking at a two hundred plus billion credit illicit trade volume that could dry up if this treaty goes into effect .  now you tell me that profit isn   t a motive .      mia had known the black market was large  but not that large .  officially  it was estimated that the total volume came up to less than thirty billion credits .  still a substantial amount of money  but hardly enough to jeopardize a treaty that would have lowered tariffs and increased exports .  but if lanra   s estimates were true  there was simply too much money in it to give it up easily .  in fact  worsening the situation would seem even better .   lanra was nodding sympathetically .     we   re too parochial here  we don   t see things in terms of entire star systems and trade routes extending dozens of light years     he said  following her thoughts .     it   s too much to take in .  we   re willing to believe the official numbers because we can   t imagine past them .         so how have you managed it .         not easily  i   ll tell you .  looms has been wanting it exposed for a long time .  it   s one more reason  he says  that we don   t just turn our backs on space and be done with it .  but letting people know how much money can be made at something .  .  .  that   s not always the best way to convince them to leave it alone .  so he   s been waiting and paying attention .  he   s got a big file on it .         does he have a favorite suspect .         no one person could do this .  it has to be a consortium  and not just of terrans .         spacers .      lanra nodded .     and a few settlers .          the settler representative      mia began .      the settlers are getting the worst end of the whole enterprise .  a lot of settler colonies have a real start  over from scratch attitude and set up their charters to limit trade with earth .  they aren   t well disposed to deal with spacers  either .  as a consequence  a lot of settler worlds are austere .  the black market for them is like a drug  people buying stuff that doesn   t even exist on the open market .  it also makes them an easy scapegoat .  most of us believed that the pirates were settlers .         you don   t think so .         a few individuals  i   m sure .  have to have agents on the ground for something like this .  but state sanctioned .  no .             how do explain the fact that not one member of dynan   s party was injured .         what better way to paint us the villain .  it   s simple  clear  obvious  all it takes is for someone to point out the fact at the right time in the right way .         it   s too obvious     mia said .      for who .  you  maybe .  a judge .  does it matter .  this will be a political trial .  it   s not too simple for the masses and it has the added benefit of discrediting anything looms might reveal about the black market before he can say word one .         you   re a cynical one .      lanra nodded .     i   ve learned that expediency is the only constant .  when you live like that it   s easy to lose faith in anything else .         i don   t suppose you have any proof of any of this .      lanra pursed his lips .     what is it you   re trying to do  mia .  you   re supposed to be dead .  what can you do .         i   m .  .  .  trying to find out who set us up .         someone on the inside  obviously .  do you have a name .         cupra and gambel .      lanra   s eyes widened briefly .     well  well .  three surprises in less than a day .         i don   t know them .         service all the way .  if they   re involved  you can be certain someone higher up is  too .  i can   t imagine them doing this on their own .     he opened a drawer in his desk and took out a disk .  he slid it toward her .     this is a synopsis of my conclusion from the last three years .  my logic trees  my numbers  guesses .  i     he glanced at his desk top and scowled .     time   s up .  you need to leave .  now .         one more question .        lanra glanced nervously at his desktop .     quick .         the guns  the assassins .  i need a name  a supplier .         look at kynig parapoyos .  now you have to leave .      mia tucked the disk inside her jacket and stood .

anacostia river  although these in d .  c .  were not imbitek   s main works .  the largest plant was somewhere on the other side of the globe  near kiev sector .   derec entered a high archway into a maze of walkways that wound among the offices .  the entrance lay on the opposite side of a large fountain .  a series of canopies at various heights obscured the towering bulk of imbitek while letting light diffuse delicately onto the corporate mall .  the result was an impression of imbitek as warm  considerate  and human scaled  most of it hidden from sight  like its products .   he walked through the broad doors and up to the reception desk .      derec avery to see mr .  mikels .         you   re expected  mr .  avery     the receptionist told him .     please wait a moment and i   ll have someone take you up .      another woman arrived  smiled pleasantly  and asked him to follow her .   behind the reception area  they entered a wide hallway lined by doors .  derec was led to one at the far end .  his guide pressed a contact and waited .  the door opened and she waved him into the small cubicle .      this will take you directly to mr .  mikels    offices  mr .  avery .  he   s looking forward to meeting you .         thank you .      derec stepped into the cubicle .  a bench hung from one wall .  the door closed and he felt only the briefest of movements .  a few seconds later  the door opened again to admit him into a spacious office .   alda mikels stood before an immense desk  smiling .  he was a broadshouldered man  slightly shorter than derec  with a thick mane of nearly white hair .  his eyes were a muddy brown and he tended toward overweight  though his tailored dark suit hid it well .      mr .  avery .         mr .  mikels .         my apologies for the way my man kusk brushed you off .  we were rude .  i am sorry .         contract restrictions often leave little room for cordiality  sir .  don   t worry about .      mikels laughed  a deep  pleasant sound .  it could be easy to like this man .     nevertheless  i wanted to make amends .  thank you for coming .  can i get you anything .  a drink .         water would be fine  thank you .      alda mikels gestured to the opposite end of the office where a bar covered most of one wall .  it was not the kind of office where work got done  at least not the hands on sort derec thought of as work .  he imagined meetings here  drinks or smokes offered  and talk designed to prepare the way for work .  clients met mikels here  if they were important enough  and perhaps enemies as well .  derec wondered in which category mikels placed him .   mikels filled a tall glass from a crystal pitcher and handed it to derec .  he poured for himself a tumbler of brandy from an ornate decanter .  every move exuded a kind of pride  look what i have .      your original call concerned union station     he said  lifting the tumbler in a half salute .  he sipped .      phylaxis group was supposed to have the exclusive service contract on the ri .  i was concerned that everything be handled the best way possible .  and phylaxis was able to get operations back online within hours .  we were running all the operations before we were excluded .  i   m curious          you   re curious if we had anything to do with shoving you out of the way .     mikels shrugged .     depends how you look at it  mr .  avery .  we   d been lobbying to displace positronics in union station since the proposal to go that way first came up .  now  i understand as well as you that having positronics there was political  not practical  so our lobbying was directed at those people in government responsible for deciding such things .  good business .  when it failed  imbitek wanted to be able to take advantage of it .         you were certain it would fail .  that   s why you convinced senator eliton to write you into the contract two years ago  so you could step in at once .      mikels looked momentarily surprised .  he smiled .     we   d already warned the senate that positronics would not work there and that when it went wrong it would go very wrong  either technically or politically .     he frowned .     we had no idea it would be this costly .         you don   t blame positronics for eliton   s death  do you .         being a non terran yourself  perhaps you wouldn   t understand .  yes  indirectly or otherwise .  without positronics  the issue and the fact  eliton would never have made himself a target .      derec was surprised at mikels    bluntness .  he stared at the man  wondering what would follow such an observation .   mikels smiled again .     but that   s politics .  no one does it successfully without making enemies  and clar was very successful .         i suppose it   s also difficult losing a friend this way .      mikels blinked at him .     i knew clar  certainly .  we were as close to being friends as two people in our positions can be .  we had lunch at least once a week .  he was the main target of our lobbying efforts .     he finished his brandy and poured another .     he   ll be missed .      the words came out flat  empty of emotion .  a mistake  derec realized .      so  how can i help you now  mr .  avery .         can you get me inside union station to look at what you   re doing .      mikels looked surprised for a moment  then laughed .     what do you need me to do that for .         i   ve been barred by special service .         in that case  why would i risk their displeasure to help you .      derec shrugged .     just a thought .  you asked .     he drank his water and set the glass down  half finished .     who do you think engineered the assassinations .         fanatics .  zealots .  patriots .         former employees .         and why would you say that .     mikels asked .      you aren   t the only one with lobbying interests  mr .  mikels .      mikels nodded as if he had just had something confirmed .      since you   re here  mr .  avery  can i offer you a tour .  do you know much about imbedded technology .         honestly  no  i don   t .         well  let me show you .  i think you   ll find it amazing .      mikels crossed to his desk and leaned over it .  he spoke briefly  his words indistinct to derec  then smiled and gestured for derec to follow .   derec   s scalp tingled .  i should leave now  he thought .   instead  he let alda mikels take him by the elbow and lead him into his empire .        this     mikels declared  one arm outstretched  as they stepped out of a transport cubicle     is our bench test lab .  one of them  anyway .      derec slowed as he approached the enormous window that ran the length of the oversized hallway .  beyond stretched a maze of tables laden with equipment  tended by dozens of people in pristine white coveralls  working under shadowless light .  it dazzled  he found it difficult to focus on anyone point  all of it fascinated him .  no sound came through the glass .      i understand your main manufacturing facilities are elsewhere     derec said  as much to break the long stillness as anything .      our largest factory is in kiev  but it   s not much larger than the ones in denver and singapore .  r and d happens here  and we build the prototypes .  there   s some jobshopping that gets done as well  special requests  custom fitted pieces  things like that .      this was what aurora and solaria had hoped to obtain from the new treaty  derec knew  the methodology to do manufacturing on such a scale .  the fifty worlds were wonderful places and their tech was awesome in many respects  but in a way they were simple tinkerers compared to earth .  here  humans knew how to create places where tools and machines could be made in the millions .  the ability to do so  to conceive of the techniques and construct the mechanisms  both human and machine  to produce in those quantities was an art that somehow had never made the transition from earth to the stars .  aurora built excellent robots  but in small lots of a hundred or less .  if earth decided to build them they could flood the trade lanes with absolutely identical models by the tens and hundreds of thousands .  spacer tech was    handmade    compared to the mass manufacturing culture of earth .   current trade law forbade the exportation of key technologies .  it gave earth an edge .  even black marketeers would be inclined to want it to stay that way .  their profit came from inequities in systems .      i didn   t realize the need to do new research was so important     derec said .     i mean  the basic design of a positronic brain has remained largely unchanged for          and the culture stagnates  doesn   t it .     mikels interjected .     nothing new  nothing grows .  why change perfection .  but perfection is only real for a given time  place  and person .  tomorrow  it   s not perfect anymore  is it .  and usually never for your neighbor .     he smiled at derec  enjoying himself .     but don   t take offense .  the basic idea of imbedded tech hasn   t changed for almost as long .  i like to think it began with burnt toast .         pardon me .         way back when  people had to toast their bread over an open fire .  lay the slices on a plate  suspend it over a flame  and watch it so they could turn it at the right time .  too little time  it was just warm bread .  too much and it was blackened grit .  had to be a better way .  so someone devises a box with heating coils and a thermostat attached to a springlock that retracts when enough heat has been applied .  the box knows exactly how much heat is necessary and toasts the bread the same way every time .  imbedded tech .  since then  if people want something done and they don   t want to tend to it with one hundred percent of their attention  someone else has found a way to make a device that will do it for them .  it finally got so sophisticated that some of these devices are the intellectual equivalent of small children .  then they got so that they weren   t even visible and hardly ever broke .  paradise .         perfection .     derec chided .      not at all .  people change  needs change  technology has to keep up .  take that toaster .  it   s so good now that it even makes the bread  assembling molecules in just the right way and shaping the result before heating it .  but what if you also want it to make sweet bread .  or cake .  it doesn   t have the programming for that and the device simply isn   t important enough  or expensive enough  to warrant having a reprogrammable feature .  what do you do .         throw it out and buy a better model .          wasteful .  but we   ve gotten around it .     mikels waved at the lab .     penetrating polycollates .         i   m not familiar with the term .         not many are .  we can introduce augmentation through the surface of the device  reprogram it the same way a virus reprograms a healthy cell .  it   s a complex filtration system that can work its way through the interstices of a material        like a zeolite .      for the second time in their talk  mikels seemed surprised  although he masked it well .     yes  that   s right .  you   re familiar with zeolites  mr .  a very .         only slightly .  i   ve seen some work done on positronic matrices with them .         indeed .  that   s very interesting .  where was this .         aurora .         now that   s surprising .  i wouldn   t have thought spacers would have much need for such primitive tech .         is it primitive .         the idea is .         like your imbedded devices .      this time mikels    smile did not seem warm  but predatory .  he studied derec for a few seconds  then turned his gaze toward his lab  his left hand playing absently with the cuff of his right sleeve .      you have an interesting perspective  mr .  a very .  have you ever considered          mr .  mikels .      derec started  surprised .  an aide stood behind mikels  leaning forward slightly at the waist  solicitous and apologetic .  mikels frowned at him .      sorry to disturb you  sir  but you   re needed in section four .         what .  damn .     mikels sighed loudly .     forgive me  mr .  avery .  i have to tend to something .  kobbs here can finish the tour for you .  it has been a pleasure making your acquaintance .  perhaps we can get together another time .      mikels gripped derec   s hand firmly and shook it twice .      thank you for taking the time     derec said .   mikels gave him a last cordial smile and stalked off  leaving kobbs waiting for derec .      there really isn   t an emergency  is there  kobbs .     derec asked .     you just came to rescue him .  what did he do  summon you somehow .  his cuff .      kobbs looked uncomfortable .     if you   d like to follow me  sir  we can continue the tour in          no  thank you  kobbs .  i feel that i   ve already gotten the tour .  if you   d just show me the way out .  .  .  .        tathis kedder lived just north of the navy district  off the southeast corridor in the garfield district .  derec left the strips near the apartment complex a little before twelve  an hour early for his appointment with kedder .  he had given himself plenty of time .   the complex was a collection of blocks arranged at different levels  heights  and orientations .  walkways  stairs  and balconies threaded throughout the mass like complicated three dimensional mazes .  derec had once considered taking rooms here .  it was an enclave for midlevel professionals like kedder .  he had been unsurprised to discover that joler hammis also lived here .   after receiving hammis   s resume  derec had been unable to get in touch with the man .  he had left messages asking hammis to call him back  let him know if he had found other employment  or just to talk .  ariel   s insistence that no one at the calvin institute had issued any such directive about    transition errors    made derec curious about where those orders had come from .  kedder had obviously not questioned them  but hammis had struck derec as the sort who might question anything .   he went to hammis   s apartment first .  he mounted the steps and went up to the third level of hammis   s block  found the number  and pressed the bell .  he waited nearly a minute before pressing it again .      it   s probably available if you want it .      a man stood at the open door of the next apartment  a few meters further down the walkway .  he was neatly dressed and carried a small case  large enough for a custom datum .  derec thought  lawyer .      mr .  hammis is no longer living here .         moved out three days ago     the man said  punching a code into his own door .     he complained about the job market  but joler didn   t strike me as the type to stay unemployed for long .  he probably found something and swee      he made a flying gesture to go with the half whistle      gone .  check with the housing authority .      the man smiled and walked past derec to the steps and descended out of sight .   derec punched the code for the complex housing authority into the scanner beside the door .  the small screen came up with a bright pink may i help you .  derec entered the apartment number and pressed enter .  a menu came up  resident  availability  other .  derec touched availability .   not currently available .   derec stared at the door for a time  debating if it would be worth the trouble to break in .  he checked his watch  he still had forty minutes till his meeting with kedder  and pulled out his decrypter .   within two minutes  the device unlocked the door .  derec did a reflexive inspection of the walkway  then entered hammis   s apartment .   it did not look vacated so much as abandoned .  clothes lay scattered over the floor  a plate with days old remains set beside a cup with a few centimeters of coffee on a table covered with disks and scraps of paper .  the comline contained several calls in the message queue .  even to derec it was obvious that hammis had not moved out .   he walked from room to room  stepping quietly and carefully  touching nothing .   the place was disheveled  but it did not quite look ransacked .  derec returned to the living room and examined the scattered paper on the table .  he recognized algorithms  a few scribbled notes on pathways  could be positronic  could be n  and a pair of pamphlets half buried under the disks .  he eased one out and opened it .   derec felt his scalp tingle coldly as he read .     order for the supremacy of man again  the ancient and honorable struggle to free humankind from its own delusions and the chains such delusions become has never been more difficult and demanding as it is today .  now the battle must be fought with information systems and the very tools we have created to aid us in overcoming nature itself .  to this end  osma has dedicated itself to the cause of resisting wherever possible  and by whatever means seem most appropriate  the subjugation of humans by machines  systems  or the seductive and pernicious ideologies such seeming innocuous constructs require to come into existence in the first place .     derec dropped the pamphlet back on the table and looked around the room for any other sign of managins .  after a few minutes  he picked the paper up again  folded it  and slipped it into his pocket .   he checked that no one was on the walkway when he left  then headed quickly to the other side of the complex  to his appointment with kedder .  the two had worked together .  maybe kedder knew something about hammis .  perhaps he suspected hammis of being the method by which the managins had gotten into union station with weapons .  in any case  derec felt relieved to be out of hammis   s apartment .  he made himself walk at a normal pace  conscious of his quick  adrenalized strides .   calm down  he told himself  it could mean anything .  millions of people probably have these pamphlets  it doesn   t mean they   re all managins .   but what did it really take to be one .  perhaps most people were not officially members of osma  but certainly most of people on earth sympathized with them  at least where it concerned robotics .   he was still ten minutes early when he knocked on kedder   s door .  the scanner came on .      yes .         derec avery  mr .  kedder .         oh .  um  yes .  one moment .     the door slid aside and kedder blinked at him .  he was barefoot and looked as though he were still waking up .  he smiled sheepishly at derec  then stood to one side .      please .      derec stepped into the apartment .  it was much neater than hammis   s .      your coworker seems to have moved out  mr .  kedder     derec said .     he lost his job  i understand .     derec turned .   hammis stood by the door  looking frightened and apologetic .  beside him were two men  dressed in black  hoods covering their heads .      i   m sorry  mr .  avery     kedder said .   derec bolted for the back of the apartment and the rear exit .   something caught his shins just through the first doorway and he slammed heavily onto the floor .  before he could stand  bodies crushed him .  he struggled until something cool touched his neck and numbness spread throughout his body .      twenty five    ariel disliked using derec   s robot .  she made the call to special service  anonymously  routed through a comline far from the embassy  with misgivings .  they were sending a robot to lie to humans .  there was no other way to look at it and her absolutist soul chafed at the idea .   hofton looked briefly surprised when she walked into the reception area  the crate with the contraband brain under her arm .  he smiled and followed her into her office .   the door closed .     the keeper visits the zoo     he said .     i trust you   ve been well .      ariel looked at him .     it   s been busy .     she placed the crate under her desk .  she was not really sure why she had brought it  other than she did not feel comfortable leaving it in her apartment anymore .      moderately .         i   ve been handling some of it from home     she said  sitting down behind her desk .  it had only been a couple of days and yet it seemed much longer .     what have you got .         setaris has called at least eight times a day .  most of her questions i   ve been able to handle  primarily to do with the migration of aurorans off earth .         how many .         nearly six hundred in the last two days .      ariel stared at him .     i thought        it seems that the tbi interrogated a few of our key citizens .  they decided to leave immediately after .  others  not unexpectedly  followed .         who in particular .         i have a list .  .  .     hofton fussed briefly with ariel   s terminal .     there .  and at the top          guviya tralen .  damn .     she stabbed at her comline .     what business did the tbi have interrogating her .         her complaint was quite specific .  they wanted to know who she knew among    her kind     i quote  who would want to disrupt the conference .         get me a schedule of everything else i need to tend to  hofton .  this call is private .         of course .      hofton retreated from the office and ariel stared in rage at the screen until a secretary appeared .      i want to speak to jonis taprin .         i   m sorry      the secretary began .      this is ariel burgess from the auroran embassy .  he will want to take this call .  trust me .         one moment  ms .  burgess .      tbi .  .  .  .  i thought special service had assumed complete authority .  well  never assume anything on earth .  .  .   nearly two minutes elapsed before jonis appeared  even at that  ariel was surprised .  under other circumstances  she would have been pleased .      ariel     he said  smiling broadly .     how very good to hear from you  i   ve been          what the hell is going on  jonis .  the tbi is rousting aurorans .      jonis   s face seemed to ripple  settling finally into a wary frown .     i   m not sure i understand .  .  .         don   t play politic with me  jonis  you know damn well what i   m talking about .  i   ve got a list of prominent aurorans in front of me who   ve been interrogated over the last two days by tbi agents .  most of them are leaving  which was something i worked very hard to prevent not four days ago  if you   ll recall  because they don   t like being called conspirators .         ariel wait          guviya tralen  jonis .  they asked guviya tralen who she knew who would want to see the conference stopped .  she   s a pain  she   s obnoxious  i sometimes wish she had never come to earth  but she   s a fashion icon  not a killer .         calm down  ariel .  tbi was just doing its job .         what job is that .  safeguarding terra from bloodthirsty spacers .      jonis reddened .     that   s not fair .  we   ve lost one of our most important citizens .  you can   t expect          i can expect a little more attention to who really killed our people when they were invited here and a little less spacer baiting .  especially from you .         me .  i don   t have any say over how the tbi conducts their investigations .         no .  maybe .  but you do have a responsibility not to feed public fears over positronics by suggesting a positronic robot intentionally killed humans .         those men were dead on arrival          that   s not true and you know it     ariel shot back .     and even if it were  don   t you think it would have been responsible to keep it to yourself and check with me first .  after all  i know more about what positronics can do than you or your descendants ever will .         how do you know it   s not true .         it   s a positronic robot .  the three laws would forbid          three laws  three laws  three laws .     taprin glared at her .     it was built by people  ariel  and as long as people hold to no law absolutely  their machines won   t  either .  i don   t give a damn about your sacred three laws because i don   t believe them .  as for the tbi  they   re doing their job and once they   re finished  we   ll all be better off for it .         who will be .      he looked puzzled .     what do you mean .         who will be better off .  they keep insulting aurorans and they   ll start an exodus i won   t be able to stop .  six hundred have already left or booked passage .  they   ve undone everything i tried to do  jonis .         they have killers to find .          among us .  those were managins  jonis .  what would aurorans have to do with managins .         we have to trust that they know what they   re doing     taprin said .      no  we don   t .  your police agencies have already made more mistakes than i   d tolerate from a janitor .         such as .            such as barring derec avery from doing his job     ariel replied .     special service has no roboticists  they won   t have a clue what to look for .  or does this come under the category of looking for killers among spacers .         why would you know about that .     taprin asked after a moment  his voice now cautious .      jonis  it   s me  ariel .  calvin institute .  anything to do with robots .      he seemed to relax then  which ariel found unsettling .      i   ve already looked into that     taprin said .     mr .  avery called me  i   ve taken care of it .         he   s getting reinstated .         i can   t discuss it  ariel .  suffice it to say that special service clamped down on everything related to the killings  including that  and your mr .  avery did not have the necessary security ratings .  he was automatically barred .         does he know that .         he   s been notified .     he sighed .     look  ariel  it   s been a lousy week and it isn   t over yet .  when i heard it was you  i thought that for two minutes i   d be able to talk to someone who didn   t want a liter of my blood and a position statement .  where   ve you been  by the way .  i   ve called a couple of times  but hofton kept telling me you were unavailable .         as you say  it   s been a lousy week .      taprin nodded .     touch   .  look  what do you want me to do .         talk to somebody  get them to stop .  or do you want to see the spacer community leave en masse .         it might actually be safer for them .  but i   ll see what i can do .     he gave a wan smile .     maybe this saturday .  dinner .  i   m not sure what i   ll be doing  but if you say yes  i   ll make time .            i   ll have to see  jonis .  this situation was unexpected .  i might not have any saturdays for a while .      he was visibly disappointed  but he nodded .     i understand  believe me .         while we   re talking  what has been found out .  and how did the tbi get involved .  i was under the assumption special service was handling this exclusively .         for the most part they are  but the tbi has its own mandate .      ariel frowned .     mmm .         well  as you said  the assassins were managins  but so far there doesn   t seem to be a clear connection between them and anyone else .  unlikely as it sounds  it may turn out to be that they did this on their own .         you can   t possibly believe that .      taprin shrugged .     special service knows what they   re doing .  they   ve been keeping me fairly current  though i   d like it to be hourly rather than daily .         what about the people who murdered my friend .      he frowned thoughtfully .     oh .  i  uh  frankly  i haven   t asked specifically .  i assume it   s part of the same investigation .  i   ll ask about it next time i get a report  all right .         fine .  now please  call off the hounds .  i   ll be doing damage control until i retire after this .      taprin winced  but nodded .     i have to return to the arena now and face the lions .  i   d like to see you .  .  .         i   ll be in touch  jonis .  i have my own lions to fight right now .      ariel broke the connection .  her anger thrummed at the back of her head .   what had he said .  i don   t give a damn about your sacred three laws because i don   t believe them .   that pretty much said it all  she thought .  jonis had put into words what likely powered all the fear terrans held for robots .  to them  a robot seemed to possess will  and anything with a will was potentially corruptible .  terrans relied on automatons  mindless machines with no will at all  but that could kill or injure purely by accident or if wielded by another human .  their machines could not refuse to be misused that way  could not make a decision to protect a human .  they just did their tasks and if flesh got in the way  too bad .  an accident .  or a human   s fault .  they no more trusted that a robot with evident capacity to decide would never harm them than ariel trusted that derec   s    variation     on robotics would never harm her .  perhaps for the first time she really understood terrans and their unreasoning fear of positronics and robots .      thank you  jonis     she mused .     your last act as my lover was at least beneficial .      if taprin believed that  though  after all their time together and having worked so closely with clar eliton for several years  then how could he possibly represent humadros   s and eliton   s beliefs .  she thought back over the interview she had seen  and his comments about bogard .   he   s not  she realized .  it   s over .  .  .      ariel     hofton   s voice came over the intercom .     ambassador setaris is on the link .      ariel touched accept .  setaris winked onto her screen .      ariel  where have you been .         working     ariel said  more sharply than she had intended .   setaris frowned slightly .     are you aware of the flight .         yes  i am .  i   ve spoken to senator taprin about it .  i think it should be taken as given that nothing will be done .  special service has assumed complete authority over the investigation and the tbi is upset about it .  they   re having a territorial dispute and they somehow think that entitles them to harass our citizens .  i don   t think we can stop them any time soon  certainly not quickly enough to do any good .  i   m going to make the rounds again and see what i can salvage  but with tralen      she glanced at the list hofton had provided      shorit  klasina  prattek  and qurvis leaving  i don   t expect to have much success .      setaris was quiet for a time .     i see .  legate korolin is being put off over when the conference will actually take place  as well .  negotiations have snagged on venue .  once they start arguing about where a meeting is going to be held  it   s a guarantee that there will be no meeting .         it   s coming apart .         it looks that way  yes .  unless arrests can be made in the next day or two  our brief will probably be to sever relations .         it   s that bad .         the credits  ariel     setaris said wearily .     you have no idea how much money is in play here .  without the conference and some kind of treaty .  .  .         i see .  then whoever did this has won .  even if they   re captured  they did what they intended .         who knows what was intended .  yes  you   re probably right in the main  but   i have a meeting to attend with the other ambassadors in six hours .  i doubt any of them will stay if aurora pulls out .  it would be pleasant if you could give me good news before then .         i   ll do what i can  ambassador  but          i won   t expect miracles  ariel .      setaris broke the link .      how generous     ariel said to the blank screen .   she resisted the urge to call mia .  they had put bogard into play  a gamble ariel had been reluctant to take  and now all they could do was wait to see if it paid off .  she surveyed her desk .  she had more than enough to keep her occupied  but just now she could not summon the interest to begin .      ariel     hofton broke in again .      yes .         i wouldn   t bother you with this normally  but under the circumstances i think you should take this call .  mr .  udal .         udal .  .  .  .         the vendor who filed a complaint of vandalism with us early in the week .      ariel felt a wave of annoyance .     what the hell does he want .         as i say  i think you should take the call .      ariel banged her finger against the accept contact .      yes  mr .  udal  how can i help you .     she managed only a hint of strain .      i  uh  request an intervention .  i need asylum .         what .  from what  mr .  udal .  have the vandals come back to smash the rest of your illicit stock        please  ms .  burgess .  i   m quite serious .  the terran bureau of investigation is threatening me with confinement .         for what .         contraband .  i swear i didn   t know  i swear it  but       ariel felt a solid lump form just below her throat .     what sort of contraband  mr .  udal .         positronic robots .  i swear  i   ve never handled          mr .  udal  come to the embassy at once .  i want to speak with you in person .         do i get asylum .         we won   t know that until i talk to you .  please come in at once .         yes  yes .  i   ll be there within the hour .         sooner .     she paused .     in fact  mr .  udal  stay where you are .  i   m sending an embassy limo for you .  is that clear .  don   t leave where you are .  i   m sending a limo .         yes     udal spluttered .     yes  i  thank you .         hofton  do you have mr .  udal   s location .         yes  ariel .         go there yourself  personally  and pick him up and bring him here .  immediately .  take  what   s his name down in security .  michensol .  take him with you .  i want mr .  udal in my office in half an hour .         thank you  ms .  burgess     udal said .     thank you .      ariel broke the connection  more annoyed than when she had answered it .   contraband .  damn and damn .  what next .  all she needed was for the tbi to announce the arrest of an auroran smuggler and the presence of an unknown quantity of illegal robots scattered who knew where on earth .   i should have stayed home this morning .  .  .        i   m not at liberty to discuss the specifics of our investigation  ambassador .  please understand our position .      ariel tapped her index finger impatiently on her desk  out of sight of the com screen .  the tbi agent had been very polite  very receptive  and very uninformative .      i understand perfectly     ariel said .     you   ve decided that the assassination was directed at senator eliton exclusively and ambassador humadros simply got in the way .  .  .  not to mention all the other spacer nationals killed or injured .  they had nothing to do with the fact that only terran nationals were the target .      the agent  royan  almost frowned  appearing puzzled more than offended .  ariel tried to imagine mia like this after several more years in the service  professional and cynically unresponsive .      we don   t disregard the losses to your people  ambassador burgess  but we are conducting our investigation the way we think best .  again  i apologize if this has inconvenienced your people .         your people .     we   re human  aren   t we .   ariel made herself nod  matching agent royan point for point with politesse .     if you had come to us before you started rousting spacers  we might have been of assistance .  you could have gotten better results  saved us all time  and possibly moved on to a more productive avenue .         ambassador          let me put it to you this way     ariel said  hearing another obfuscation coming and losing patience .     if you don   t desist from harassing aurorans i   ll file an injunction through the senate and block you at every step .  i   ve been less than impressed with terran law enforcement over this .  five days and not one arrest .  how hard can it be  agent royan .  nine armed assassins charge into union station  in front of thousands of witnesses on site and millions more through subetheric  six of them are dead  and you can   t find the last three .  my government is patient  but with limits .      agent royan was openly frowning now .     we   re pursuing every likely avenue  ambassador burgess .  you will just have to be content with that .  i   m sorry          if this inconveniences me  yes  i know  you   ve said that a dozen times since this conversation began .  i am curious about one other thing  though .         yes .         it   s my understanding that special service has assumed jurisdiction over this matter .         technically  that   s correct .         then what exactly is it the tbi is investigating .         i   m not at            liberty to discuss that .  very well  agent royan  i   ll let you get back to your job .  you   ve been notified of our objections .  the next time you hear from us will be in the form of a court order .  thank you for your time .      ariel stabbed the disconnect .      the com chimed .     what .         excuse me  ambassador     the robot receptionist said     but there is a call        if it can wait  tell them i   ll get back to them .         she insists on speaking with you now  ambassador .      ariel wondered if she would ever grow used to being called    ambassador .     coming from the robot  it sounded so formal  from humans  it just sounded odd .      who is it .         a rana duvan .      rana .  derec   s specialist .  she touched accept .      ms .  duvan  this is ariel burgess .  how may i help you .         sorry to call you  ms .  burgess  but i have a problem i   m hoping you can help me with .  do you know where derec is .         i  he had an appointment this morning with alda mikels of imbitek .  hasn   t he checked in .         no  but  well  i don   t think he could help  but he should know .         know what .         we   ve been shut down .      it took ariel a few moments to understand what rana meant .     phylaxis .  what do you mean  shut down .         i mean i have an order here from a judge  cosigned by the chair of the committee on new technologies  revoking our license and ordering us to cease all operations .      ariel   s ears grew warm as she took the news in .     who   s the chair of the committee .         senator taprin .         hell .  .  .     she remembered then that the new technologies committee was a sister committee to eliton   s machine intelligence committee .  so had jonis done this on his own  or bowed to pressure .   does it matter .  she thought bitterly .      it   s worse than that  ms .  burgess     rana continued .     i   ve been ordered by the tbi to hand over all our material  including our ri .  in fact  there   s an agent standing in the lab now  who says he   s going to remain here until i comply .         how long do you have .         not long .         can you   .         that   s what i need to talk to derec about .  what does he want me to do .      ariel drummed her fingers  thinking frantically .  if the tbi got hold of the illegally downloaded ri matrix  they could charge derec and derail everything .      have you finished everything that needed finishing .     she asked .      except for a few minor details  yes .         i   ll see to it that they can   t take thales  that   s your ri   s name .   and get a team over there to remove it to the embassy .  in the meantime  i   d just clean some things up .  i   ll be back in touch .         thank you  ms .  burgess .      the screen went blank again  and ariel closed her eyes .   never wonder what could be worse  she thought wryly .  she touched the intercom .     let me know the instant hofton gets back          he has returned  ambassador     the robot replied .      get him in here .      a minute later  the door opened and hofton came in with mr .  udal in tow .  udal looked embarrassed and contrite .  a security guard followed them both .   ariel held up her hand .     have mr .  udal wait outside for a few minutes .      hofton raised his eyebrows  but turned to the embassy security guard and nodded .  udal left the office .      you have that look     hofton said .     more fires .         things may be falling apart faster than we can patch them together .  you know where the phylaxis group is .         yes .  .  .         tbi is there to impound all their equipment and data .  i   m having a claim drawn up declaring their ri   its name is thales  exclusive jurisdiction of aurora as a positronic entity .  i want you personally to get it signed by the appropriate bureaucrat  take it to phylaxis with a team of our roboticists  and get it out of there before they destroy it .  if possible  get a restraining order  and try to extract derec   s assistant  rana duvan .         shall i shift any planets from their orbits while i   m at it .     hofton asked dryly .      this is a bit more pressing than gravity  hofton .  i need phylaxis and its material secured .  thales definitely  everything else as a can do if possible .         how soon .         an hour ago .  now  send udal in here and get on it .         your wish  etcetera     he said with a slight flourish of his hand as he backed away from the desk .   the security guard brought udal in .      sit down  mr .  udal .     ariel entered commands into her terminal and the tri d image of his mangled robot came up .  she reached under the desk and brought up the crate containing the contraband positronic brain  gratified at the sudden amazed fear in his eyes .      i   ll talk     she said     you listen .  this isn   t just a humaniform drone .  this is a positronic robot and here is the brain .  you receive the drone bodies through normal trade routes and buy the brains from a black market source .  the result is an illegal positronic robot  contraband  forbidden by more laws here than i can remember .  the people who vandalized your establishment weren   t there to simply damage your business  they were there to give you and us a warning .  you   ve been trading in black market robots  mr .  udal  and some of the local fanatics have found out about it .  i admire the nerve to make a complaint to me        but          i   m talking now  mr .  udal .  this is causing us a lot of trouble and if you want to come out of this with a whole skin you will begin cooperating with me .  first  by telling me the truth .  i want to know who you   re buying them from and where you   re picking them up .  i want to know how long you   ve been doing this  and i want to know who else is doing it and what else is being marketed illegally .      udal   s face began to distort .     i can   t          you can  mr .  udal .  don   t tell me you   re afraid of reprisals .  i assure you there   s nothing they can do to you that i won   t  and i can do it legally .      it took udal several minutes to reach the point of decision .  ariel waited .  she could see it coming  see him wrestling with the options  and finally realizing that he had none .      kynig parapoyos     he said finally .     it   s all through him .      now  ariel listened while udal talked .      twenty six    tactical parameters  security enhanced facility  path map in place  sensor

    gambel commented quietly .  he looked around .     lock it till we get to the lab .      they continued down to the third sublevel and brought bogard into a room filled with familiar looking equipment .  mostly diagnostics  but a standby niche stood against one wall .  they brought the robot to it  turned it to face the room  and eased it back into the depression .      doesn   t quite fit right anymore     cupra said .      yes  well  if we melted part of you  i imagine your clothes would need altering .      cupra grunted  moving to a console to the left of the niche .     ready .

studying the console     but it   s a mess internally .  i   m amazed it could move .  look at this        i can   t decipher this stuff .         you should learn .         why .  are we going to get another one .      gambel gave his partner a critical look  then returned his attention to the readouts .      there   s no brain left here     he said finally .      you   re sure .         pretty sure .  i think we should get kedder in here to be sure  but .  .  .  bogard is not much anymore .  the radiation must have burned out most of his pathways .  sixty  sixty five percent degradation .         i love it when you sound like you know what you   re talking about .         if you   d paid attention during the briefings then you   d know what i   m talking about  too .  look .     gambel tapped the console .     see this .  it indicates volume of positron transmission through the matrix .  it should be higher .  that means bogard   s running on about one twentieth of what he should be .  that   s the equivalent of a major stroke in you or i .  well  in you  anyway .         ha ha .  i   m going to call kedder .         do that .  i won   t feel safe until this thing is shut down completely .         you don   t know how to do that .     cupra asked .      not now .  most of bogard   s failsafes look just as crippled as the rest of him .         i   d feel better if we hadn   t used a nuke .         why .  anything smaller and bogard might be more functional .         but we   d have had a body .         and more questions .  go call kedder .        tactical analysis  zero

but the word came from the top floor .  avery was at imbitek this morning .      gambel blinked at his partner .     oh .     he shrugged .     let me finish here .  is kedder coming .         i   ll bring him back .         you   re going .         i don   t know what you   re doing here .  i might as well do something useful .      gambel nodded .     check with one before you go .         yes  sir  boss .     cupra turned to leave .      cupra .         yes .         when this is over  i   m requesting a new partner .      cupra grinned .     i like you  too .      cupra left the lab and gambel shook his head .     idiot .     he checked the readouts again  then looked up at bogard .     the only question i have is  how come it took so long for someone to call you in .  you must   ve been wandering around down there ever since .  where were you .        interrogatory parameters referent primary instructions  negative violation  negative obligation  reply not required  refer

burned up in the blast  but .  .  .     he worked the console .     we   ll let kedder take a look at you .  he   s our positronic man  but i think i know enough to tell .  meantime  we don   t want you wandering off  so .  .  .      clamps extruded from the sides of the niche to secure bogard .      gambel .     a voice called .   the agent went to the comline .     yes  sir .         i want to see you in my office .  now .         yes  sir .  be right up .     he walked up to bogard and studied it for a moment .     you know  i could get to like working with robots .  i don   t really see the big problem .     he shrugged .     oh  well  not my decision .  one calls  have to see what   s going on .  i   ll be back .      gambel gave the monitors one more look  then left the lab .     niche locks bypassed  command override initiated  survey internal surveillance  continues zero  sealed lab  initiate second tier program    bogard   s body seemed to ooze out of the niche  leaving the

inserted a probe .     analyze security  decode primary and secondary restriction algorithms  set and establish access protocols  direct system interrogatory  scan complete  search and copy protocols initiated    mia waited with growing anxiety .  bogard had been    in the field    for nearly three hours and she could not help but doubt everything was fine .   the transport sat at the end of a long alley within sight of one of the maintenance accesses to the special service hq .  the building alongside which she had parked contained an extension of the government law library  and her vehicle id transponder offered  when requested  a permit for a pick up from the library .  mia was unsure what exactly she would be picking up  but ariel had assured her that the permit was routine  and so far no one had challenged mia   s presence .  it was sloppy of the service not to  though .  an auroran embassy vehicle  parked for nearly an hour just down the way from a high security complex  for no apparent reason .   she had spent that hour going through the disk from lanra .  in many respects they had duplicated each other   s efforts .  he had gone through the same lists  rejected the same names  kept many of the same possibilities .  at the top of his list of suspects was alda mikels of imbitek .   but he also considered gale chassik  the solarian ambassador  as a possible .  as evidence he cited several meetings between imbitek people and the solarians at the embassy .  but that meant little to mia  it had been a solarian company that had installed the ri at union station  and imbitek had installed a good part of the accessory systems .  cooperation at some level was to be expected .   there had been three meetings between chassik and mikels .      so what .     mia asked aloud .     ariel probably knows mikels  too .  .  .      another name on the list was bok golner .     so you came up with him  too .  .  .     lanra had a slightly more extensive file than she .  golner had been with almost all the larger anti robot  earth firster organizations  some for only a few weeks .  she had expected that .  but he worked as an environmental service tech for cyvan .  so through a long chain of corporate connections  he worked for alda mikels .  but the chain was long enough that it would not support the conclusion in court .  lanra had appended golner   s military service record  as well .   he had also included a section on an investigation of his own client  dynan manual industries .  lanra was thorough  he had no intention of working for anyone who he would otherwise find culpable .  the file contained the usual statistics on personnel  profits  distribution  customers .  then it opened into a file on the church of organic sapiens .  lanra found much of the dogma as unpalatable as mia  but he noted several policy statements advocating nonviolence and patience and the general principle that to reject something it was vital to reject it completely and not even copy parts of it .  to lanra  this meant that looms would never stoop low enough to do what he despised in others .   mia was not so sure .  she had seen the way people compartmentalized their ethics  things they would never do at home  they did effortlessly at work  politics they would never advocate in their personal relations  they applied ruthlessly in public affairs  so a    policy statement    from the head of a fundamentally revolutionary organization did not impress her .   but then lanra returned to business and mia saw what must have intrigued him .  the consortium lanra mentioned had approached looms a year and a half ago .  the committee had been headed by mikels .  till then  looms owned stock in imbitek .  after the meeting  looms divested  at a loss .  mikels and others in the consortium had evidently initiated a program to hurt dynan .  looms had been forced to buy back majority control in his own company very quickly to defend against a takeover .  it had cost looms a good portion of his personal wealth  but as of two months ago dynan was seventy two percent owned by looms .   it did seem that looms was unpopular with mikels and the others in the consortium .  nothing lanra had been able to find told anything about the meeting or what it was mikels had proposed that had so disturbed looms .   but he noted that a politician had been in attendance .  he had been unable to learn which one  only that it had been a high ranking person  maybe a senator or vice senator .   all right  coren  let   s take it as given that looms had nothing to do with this .  .  .  mia thought .   then the fact that none of dynan   s people had been injured looked very much like a set up .   it occurred to mia that someone would have to know who they were in order to make sure they would not be hurt .  a list had to have gotten to the assassins  but the final list had not been completed till the day before .  last minute changes were even expected that morning .  who got the lists .  who made them .  who would have been in a position to get that information to the assassins .   and on the spacer side .  had those been random or had there been a list for that  too .  she remembered that on the morning of the incident  mattu  gel  and she still had no idea how many spacers were coming down from kopernik .  they would not have known till the spacers walked out of the concourse .  .  .   ariel   s friend  aspil .  was the corpse the real aspil .  if there had been an informant in their midst to send down the list just before they descended .  .  .      just how many people are involved in this .     mia groaned .  she looked down the alleyway and wondered where bogard was .   take it logically .  it was beginning to appear that ten  twenty a hundred .   people were involved .  perhaps there were a lot of bodies concerned  nine assassins at the very least  someone in the civic morgue  newsnet people maybe  but did they know anything about the larger conspiracy .  not necessarily .  how many people need be involved .  there must be a coordinator  someone to find the right people  the right data  and monitor everything .  there must be a resource  for money  equipment  transportation .  there must be a killer .  three people .  the conspiracy looked manageable at that level .   who would fill all those requirements  though .   someone leaked the list of guests .  someone subverted the ri and otherwise circumvented security .  someone hired  prepared  and unleashed a team of assassins .  someone led those assassins .   and afterward .  someone was cleaning up loose ends .  could be the same someone who had leaked the list .  .  .   movement attracted her attention and she looked down the alley .   the service door opened and an oversized drone rolled out .  it was little more than a collection of boxes on tracks  moving in fits and starts .  it seemed confused  almost comical .  then it came trundling down the alley toward her .  mia   s pulse picked up .   ten meters from the transport  the drone began to change .  as mia watched  it liquidly unfolded  rising in stature  slimming  losing the treads  becoming recognizably bogard .  she opened the back door and the robot slipped into the transport .      car  resume to fourth destination     she said .   the transport started up and backed down the alley  to the main corridor  and pulled into the light midaftemoon traffic .      hi  bogard     mia said pleasantly .      hello  mia     bogard replied evenly .      how did you do .         i believe i have acquired everything requested .     bogard paused .     there is a problem  however .  derec has been abducted .         twenty seven    a faint smell of burning plastic brought him awake .  derec kept his eyes closed  remembering almost too late that he was a prisoner .   he concentrated on his other senses .  after the smell  he noticed that his hands were bound  by a thin cord  from the way it bit into his flesh  and he was lying on his stomach on a pad of some kind .  the air was cold .  he heard distant sounds  like water dripping or the delicate rattle of tools in use  distorted by the space and the consequent echo .  then he heard footsteps  drawing nearer .  the soles clicked on a hard surface  like concrete .  he wondered .  .  .      hey  bok     someone very near said  his voice tense with a forced joviality .  and it sounded familiar .      shut up     the other  bok  derec guessed  said flatly  as though he expected to be obeyed .   there was silence .      he   s awake     bok said then .     he didn   t get that much .  mr .  a very  i expect you can hear and understand me .  go ahead and pretend to still be unconscious if you want  it doesn   t matter .  soon you won   t be my problem anymore .  but until then  let me inform you that if you try to escape  i will kill you without a second thought .  the only reason you   re alive now is because someone wants it that way .  he could just as easily want it the other way .  if we   re clear on this  just continue to lie there as if you haven   t heard a word i   ve said .      bok walked away .      asshole     the other  familiar  voice said softly .  then     are you awake .      derec did not move .      this is unbelievable     the other said .     absolutely unbelievable .     he sounded strained  barely in control .     all this was supposed to be .  .  .  damn .  no one was supposed to get hurt and after the station they told me it was over  no one else would get hurt  and then .  .  .  this is unbelievable .      now derec opened his eyes .  he lay on a thick pad  several centimeters from the floor  in some kind of stall .  the light was dim and came from outside the small area  spilling over the contents unevenly .  across from him  sitting against a wall  was tathis kedder  his legs drawn up against his chest  one hand pressed flat against the floor  the other hovering by his mouth .  he was staring out of the stall .   derec recognized the space  then  the garage with the ambulances .   kedder looked around and saw him .     you are awake .     kedder stared at him for a time  then seemed about to crawl across the stall to his side .  he made the first move  then changed his mind and pressed his back firmly against the wall and shook his head .     this isn   t my fault .         what isn   t .     derec asked .      this .     he waved a hand at derec  then at the garage around them .     none of this .  i had nothing to do with this .         of course not .  you only set me up to be abducted .  now it looks like you   re in about the same position i   m in .  except you   re not bound .      kedder swallowed loudly and started shaking his head in desperate denial .     i am not like you .  i didn   t ask too many questions .  i didn   t scan where i wasn   t supposed to .  i did what i was told and nothing more .  i shouldn   t be here .      derec waited for kedder to calm down .     so  why are you here .         i don   t know .         yes  you do .         i don   t .     kedder glared  his eyes wide and moist .  he rubbed a hand over his mouth and looked away .     all i was asked to do was to modify a couple of reports .  it was research .  that was all .  basic research  they said  the installation of a few extra components  nothing vital  attached to a couple of maintenance nodes .  in the interest of  the money was very good .         who asked you .  imbitek .      kedder nodded .     i looked over the specifications  there didn   t seem to be any harm  and it takes forever to get clearance for some of the simplest changes .  did you know that three years ago  we needed an upgrade in the lavatories .  a new processing unit had to be installed specifically to handle the increase in spacer traffic .  a few new microbes had gotten into their systems and the standard purification filters just didn   t clean it all out anymore .  nothing serious  mind you  but it was a concern that should any of these flora get into the general sewage system  there could be a problem or two  so the request was made to upgrade .  it took three months for the clearances .  do you have any idea how many people use the station facilities in a day .  in three months  when you consider all the traffic  well  a major plague could have gotten started before the bureaucrats made up their minds .  so when i was asked to help with this  well  you understand  it was with that in mind          you were thinking of toilets and took the money .  i understand .  makes perfect sense .      kedder blinked at him  frowning .     the money was very good .  and frankly  i didn   t think i   d have a job for that much longer .         at union station .  why not .         things .  .  .  it   s a positronic unit  was  and i just couldn   t see it lasting .  when i   d tell people what i did  most of them thought i was weird .  a few called me a traitor .  if the idea was to get people used to the idea of positronics it wasn   t working .  and i was tainted .  it occurred to me  mr .  avery  that i might have trouble finding employment after the program shut down .         you were certain it was going to shut down .     derec asked .      be serious .  did you think it would last as long as it did .         senator eliton          would do what his constituency told him to do .  that   s his job  that   s what he   s paid to do .  his numbers were dropping .  if this conference succeeded as advertised  i imagine he   d be voted out of office .  people don   t want positronics .  they don   t want robots .  they don   t want          so why did you study it if that   s how you felt .         what .  oh .  i  well  i didn   t always feel that way .  but after working there and  i lost friends  mr .  avery .  i was a pariah among certain people .         find new friends .  not everyone on this planet is a bigot .      kedder grunted and lapsed into sullen silence .   derec licked his lips  his mouth felt dry and numb  leftovers from the an  sthetic .     so let me see if i guessed correctly .  imbitek paid you to allow them to install a few experimental components .  since they were already an authorized contractor on the project  you couldn   t see a legal problem  certainly not an ethical one .  they offered enough money to assuage any other doubts you might have and  besides  they convinced you that the ri was temporary and afterward  if everything went well  you could have a position with them .  so you agreed .  you also helped them with locating the nodes they wanted .  they even had a solarian consultant to convince you that nothing would go wrong .  you know your training in positronics isn   t on par with a specialist from solaria  so this makes perfect sense .  all you have to do over the course of the next several months is log any glitches that crop up and route the reports to the solarian consultant rather than to the authorized service contractor  me .      derec tried to shift onto his side to make breathing a little easier  but without success .        adjustment errors     they told you  happens from time to time  nothing to worry about .  then it all blew up in your face when the attack on the conference delegates happened .  you knew something to do with those systems had interfered with the ri and compromised security .  you didn   t know what  you probably didn   t even know that it was supposed to do that .  you only knew that something you had allowed to happen had caused a major disaster .  i show up and you decide  on the spot  to say nothing .  maybe i   d conclude it was imbitek   s fault  which i did .  it never occurred to me to question you or hammis  not till i found out that no directive had been issued by the calvin institute to route those    adjustment errors    to them instead of me .  even then  i didn   t really think it was you .  i thought you   d been lied to .  i wanted to find out who   d done that .  but now .  .  .  let me guess  it was pointed out to you that your continued cooperation was necessary or the facts of your violation of protocol would be made public .  you   d be lucky to escape imprisonment .      kedder sniffed .     it wasn   t supposed to happen this way .         what about hammis .  was he part of it .         no  he  i trained him .  sometimes i think he was better than me  but  he never knew .  i think he suspected .         so you had him fired .      kedder shrugged .     yes .         where is he .  his apartment   s been searched .      kedder gestured with his thumb toward the wall at his back .     in the next stall .  dead .      derec felt a chill grow down his back .     that means you   re next  tathis .         maybe .     he looked at derec .  in the half light his tears glistened .     you   re only half correct about the solarian .  there was one  but he wasn   t introduced to me as a solarian but an auroran  someone on staff at the calvin institute .  later i checked because i found his name on the roster of the auroran legation en route .         tro aspil .      kedder nodded .     the one i talked to was solarian .         how do you know .         accent .  during my training and during the installation of the ri i talked to both aurorans and solarians .  they sound different .  it   s hard to define  but .  .  .  i didn   t think anything of it at the time .  .  .  solarians work for aurorans  there are solarians at the calvin institute .  .  .         but none on earth .         not with the institute  no .         so who was this man .         i don   t know .  just not tro aspil .      how far does this go .  derec wondered .  imbitek  probably mikels himself no  certainly mikels himself  and at least two special service agents .  and a solarian .  it would make the installation of those growths easier  certainly .  then there were his present captors  managins .  maybe .      i   m sure they know i   m awake now     derec said .     so  could you help me sit up .  this is a very awkward position .      at first  it seemed kedder would not move .  then he unfolded from the wall and quickly turned derec onto his side and helped him up .      thanks .     derec saw then that he was on an ambulance gurney .   kedder resumed his position on the floor against the wall .      so     derec said     who   s bok .         bok golner .         am i supposed to know him .         he   s   dangerous .         so i gather .  managin .      kedder nodded .      all the gunmen at union station .      another nod .      all nine of them .      kedder shot him a startled look .     how   .         i wanted to ask the same question .  do you know .         part of the .  .  .  modification .  .  .  to the ri .  they carried holographic projectors  tied in to the ri communications network  just like all the robots and other security systems .         everything became part of the game the ri was playing .         it couldn   t discern game targets from reality .  the sensor feed was completely subsumed into the game  except for a couple of satellite systems .  the trick was getting it to play the game long enough .  it could go through a high order scenario in seconds .  they needed minutes .         the adjustment errors .         testing different games  different levels  different difficulties .         you figured this all out later .         in the last few days .     kedder looked at him .     you   ve got to believe me        you never intended it to turn out this way .  of course i believe you .  it doesn   t matter .  any way it turned out  it would have been your responsibility .  even if no one had been harmed  what you did was wrong .         damn it  mr .  avery          find absolution somewhere else .  i   m not interested .     kedder looked stunned .     you  but i thought          you thought what .  that confession brings instant forgiveness .  i understand what you did  kedder  but people died .         i didn   t know .  they told me no one would get hurt .         and the money was good  so you believed them .      derec was not sure what reaction he expected  but kedder suddenly launched himself off the floor .  he slammed into derec and both of them plus the gurney went over .  derec hit the floor solidly across the shoulders  his arms complaining sharply .  kedder tried to get to his knees but he could not stop himself from punching ineffectually at derec  hitting the floor more than his face .   running feet filled the stall  then grunting  and suddenly the weight was off him .  three men held kedder while a fourth shifted an impatient gaze between him and derec .      get him out of here     he said  and derec recognized bok   s voice .     put him next to his friend .      derec rolled slowly off his bruised wrists .  bok grabbed his shirt and hauled him to his feet with astonishing strength .  he held derec with one hand and righted the gurney with his other  then sat derec down on the edge .      welcome back to the world of the waking     bok golner said .     what did you do to piss him off .         told him he was a killer .      bok golner stared at him for a few seconds  then laughed .     no .  he   s just a scared fool .  i  on the other hand  am a killer  mr .  avery .  i   m very good at it .  now  you be good .  i won   t be far away .      as bok golner walked away  derec let out his breath  not realizing till then that he had been holding it .  he shuddered once  rolled his shoulders to ease the pain  then turned to examine the contents of the stall .  now that he was alone  he might be able to find a way out .     tactical parameters  multilevel facility  modifications from standard include unidentified internal security array  status standby

 besides a few odd bits of machinery  derec saw nothing that could be easily used to cut his bonds .  he curled his fingers palmward as much as he could and managed to brush against the cord around his wrists .  thin  probably a carbon fiber analog  likely as not a molecular seal .  even if he had a knife it would be useless .      why did you bring him here .     demanded a brusque voice outside the stall .   derec sat still and listened to the new voice .      we were told to obtain and hold him     golner answered .     where else would you suggest .         try manassas .         we weren   t told to move them that far .      derec recognized the newcomer  cupra .  the puzzle was assembling itself .  too bad he might not survive its completion .      all right  let me talk to          we were told to wait for instructions .  we didn   t hear anything about circumventing the chain of command .         be current  will you .  we   ll be lucky if this doesn   t          doesn   t what .  cause an incident .      the other managins laughed .      you could as easily     cupra went on  speaking a little louder     have kept him at kedder   s apartment .  why move him .         we brought kedder  too .         you brought  you ass .  we need kedder .         i don   t see why     golner said .      he   s our roboticist .         so .         so we have a robot .  we

and kedder .         over there .         captain     another voice cut in .     there   s a problem .  point isn   t responding to check .         perimeter .     golner demanded .      no breaks .  comlink is down .  we       derec heard a soft impact  like someone flopping to the floor for a nap .  then running .      hey          left .  left .      the clatter of boots diminished  one pair at a time .   derec tried to stand .      no  no     golner whispered from behind him  his arm suddenly around derec   s neck .  the barrel of a pistol pressed against his right temple .      i can   t run with my feet hobbled     derec said as calmly as he could .   the barrel shifted to the small of his back and the arm retracted .  a second later the bindings around his ankles fell away .  he put one foot forward and slammed the other back .  it impacted with concrete  though  and golner jerked him back and forth twice before wrapping his arm around derec   s neck again .      very good  you have nerve .  you   ll never be fast enough .     the barrel returned to derec   s temple .     what   s out there .  nothing human could get past our perimeter surveillance .  is that your toy .         i have no idea .  you heard what cupra said .         cupra   s an idiot .  you built that machine out of amalloy .  i watched what it did at union station .  imitating damage wouldn   t be much trouble for it  would it .         how   d you have time to notice .  you were so busy slaughtering people .         that wasn   t slaughter  mr .  avery .  that was surgery .  like any competent medic  i pay attention when i operate .         i don   t know where bogard is     derec insisted .   golner was silent for a time .  the garage was still now .  derec heard nothing but a distant ventilator .      it   s definitely not human     golner said .     we   re getting out now  mr .  avery .  you move when i move  stop when i stop .  you mean nothing to me but a shield .  clear .      derec nodded .      good .         but you won   t make it .  you aren   t fast enough .         you hope .          golner urged derec forward  out of the stall .  derec tried to turn his head left to see down the aisle  but golner jerked him to the light and frogmarched him toward the far wall .      i   ll kill him .     golner shouted .     you can   t stop me .         no .     a woman answered  off to the right .   golner reacted .  the barrel left derec   s head to aim toward the voice .  derec bent forward against golner   s arm and tried kicking him again .  he missed again  but suddenly golner released him  and derec sprawled face down on the cold concrete .   he rolled left  quickly  until he came up against a wall .   when he managed to sit up  he saw mia daventri across from him  leaning on the divider between two stalls .  between them lay golner  unconscious  limbs sprawled .  standing over him was bogard  almost invisible in the dim light  the trace of its optical array slicing across its head  brilliant and white .      twenty eight    bogard laid the unconscious managins in a row  moving in a blur .  when it finished  mia walked along them  slowly  still favoring her sore leg  and collected their weapons .  bogard paced her  a portion of its torso shaped to receive each one as she finished inspecting it .  derec sat on the opposite side of the aisle  massaging his wrists and shaking every so often  face pale .   mia hefted one of the rifles .     this is definitely a custom job     she said admiringly .  she dropped the clip and cleared the chamber  then raised it to her shoulder .     nice weight  balance .  .  .     she closed the slide with a loud snap .     the rest of these are a combination of old military and new  but standard issue all the same .     she picked up one of the blasters .     this is current issue .  inappropriate for anything short of open combat .  you could bum this whole place down with it .      derec watched her  eyes fixed  expressionless .  shock  she decided .  he had very nearly died .      is this all of them  bogard .     she asked  waving a hand at the row .      there is one decedent  mia     bogard said .   she shot it a look  startled .      not bogard     derec said quietly .     the body was already here .  dead .         where .      derec pointed and mia went to one of the stalls .  within she found a portable stasis tube with a man inside .      do you know him .     she called .      his name is hammis .  he was one of the positronic techs at union station .      mia came back to the managins .  she stopped at the feet of the one who had held derec .      bogard  identify this one .         bok vin golner  age forty one  born earth  atlanta sector  retired military  rank captain  space tactical  surviving family          that   s fine  bogard .     mia kicked golner   s limp foot .     i think he   s the leader .  i think he led the assault at union station .         he   s awfully strong     derec said .      he was space tactical .  they were involved in all kinds of special projects  body modifications  advanced biotech systems  experimental field trials .  super soldiers  literally .     she thought about that .     bogard  the trank you administered .  how long will it remain effective on him .      bogard knelt beside golner .  two thin tendrils snaked out from its arms and connected to golner   s neck and lower back .     his system is already purging .  we have twenty minutes .         he should be out for a couple of hours     derec said .      not to worry     mia said .     we   ll be long gone before he comes to .  bogard  secure them .      the robot moved almost too quickly to follow  pausing only to gently turn each man over and bind wrists  elbows  and ankles .  within seconds  the entire row lay face down  arms behind their backs .      can you administer another dose of trank to golner .     derec asked  his voice a little nervous .      i cannot be certain of the effect on his system     bogard said .     two doses within such a brief time period are contraindicated for a normal human .  i cannot guarantee a nondestructive reaction  therefore i cannot administer a second dose  derec .  i am sorry .      mia felt her patience yield .  she took out her own weapon and walked up to golner   s head .  she aimed it and thumbed off the safety .   suddenly  bogard was right in front of her  its hand encasing the barrel of her pistol .  she jerked back  but bogard did not let go .      what are you doing .     she demanded .      i must assume that your intention is to kill or permanently incapacitate bok vin golner .      mia tugged at her weapon .     i had something like that in mind .         he poses no threat .         he won   t be unconscious for long .  he will pose a threat then .         there are other actions to assure our safety .         this action would ensure the safety of many people .  golner will do damage if he survives .         turn him over to the authorities .  they will incarcerate him  and he will pose no threat .         bogard  release my weapon     mia demanded .      only if you will assure me you will not use it to cause harm or death to bok vin golner .      mia stopped struggling and looked over at derec .  he still looked shaken  but there was a thin smile on his face .      what is it doing .     she asked .      obeying the first law .         i thought          you thought wrong .  you thought bogard had some sense of good guys and bad guys and that the bad guys are always dangerous .         doesn   t it .         sort of .  but the bad guys are also still human .  bogard is assessing its responsibilities according to the three laws .  it won   t let you simply kill a human being if there are alternatives .      mia frowned .     that   s .  .  .  inconvenient .      derec shrugged .      all right     she said .     i give you my word  bogard  i won   t harm him .      bogard   s hand unfolded from around the pistol .  mia staggered back slightly .  for a moment  she considered her chances of taking the shot now  before bogard could react .  almost at once she felt a pang of shame .  she holstered her weapon .      if we have twenty minutes     derec said  pushing himself to his feet     we should use it .  how did you get here .         i   m still using the embassy transport .      derec came up alongside her .  he pointed to two of the sleeping figures .     cupra .  and that one is the other positronic specialist from union station  tathis kedder .  he set me up for this .         i think bogard is right     mia said .     we should turn them over to the authorities .  but not all of them .     she turned to the robot .     bogard  i want you to send in a report to the local police .  trespassers .  and we   ll leave several of the weapons .  and the corpse .  then i want you to rig to carry two bodies .      she walked over to agent cupra and kedder  then looked at derec .     i think we need to have a sincere conversation .        a small contingent of auroran security met them in the embassy garage .  mia stepped out of the transport warily  she did not know any of them .  one man stepped forward  dressed in a formal embassy jacket .      ms .  daventri .  i   m hofton  ariel   s aide .      mia relaxed .     good .  and these others .         embassy security .     he looked past her to derec .     sir .         derec avery  hofton .  we met once .  .  .      hofton nodded .     yes  sir  i remember you .  i   m pleased to see that you   re all right .  there have been further complications .  ariel wishes to see both of you as soon as possible .  what needs tending here .      from the rear of the transport  bogard emerged  carrying the still unconscious men .  mia watched the expressions on the faces of the security team .  they looked briefly startled and a little wary  but accepted bogard at once .      we need these two placed in isolation  under guard     mia said .   hofton frowned .     the embassy doesn   t have a jail as such           i don   t care if it   s a closet .         that we can provide .     hofton gestured to the aurorans .     take them to the secured briefing rooms .         keep them separate     mia added .     bogard  go with them and assist in observation .         is open movement advisable  mia .     bogard asked .      this is the auroran embassy  bogard .      bogard seemed to consider that for a moment  then moved to follow the security guards  cupra and kedder cradled on either side of him .   hofton watched the robot as it went on .     remarkable .     he looked at derec .     do you need medical attention  sir .         no  thank you  i   m just bruised up .         i could use some pain blockers     mia said .  she rubbed her right leg .      i   ll see to it .  please  come with me .      as they headed for the lift  hofton filled them in .      several things have occurred simultaneously that have changed our situation here .  the tbi have been interrogating spacers throughout the district .  no arrests have been made  but the confrontations have been such that many more spacers are leaving earth than before .  ariel   s been working all morning to stem the flow before it becomes a general rout .  one of her constituents is here after being threatened with arrest for dealing in contraband .  on a more personal note  sir  your firm has been shut down by the tbi .      hofton hesitated  and it seemed to mia that he was embarrassed .     i attempted to extricate your assistant  ms .  duvan  but i   m afraid she   s been arrested .  there are warrants for your other employees as well .  i don   t know if they   ve been found .  there is also a warrant for your arrest .      derec sighed wearily .     great .  and we   ve just kidnapped a special service agent .     he shrugged .     well  if you   re going to go to prison  go for something worthwhile .     he smiled weakly .      i did my best  mr .  avery     hofton said quietly .     it   s my impression  though  that the tbi have an agenda not stated in their warrants .         tbi .  .  .     mia said .     not special service .         significant .     derec asked .      i don   t know .  possibly .  there   s a strict code of territoriality between us .  we don   t encroach on each others    investigations .  if special service takes control of something  tbi stays out  and vice versa .         unless this is an unrelated investigation     derec said .      what are the chances of that .     hofton asked .   mia grunted .   they rode the rest of the way up to the embassy offices in silence .  the doors opened and they stepped into a scene of restrained chaos .  staff huddled by office doors down the corridor  while others flitted from room to room .  in the reception area  ariel was bent over the desk  going over something with a secretary while three other aides talked tersely among themselves .  two security guards stood at the main entrance .   ariel looked up at them and gestured for hofton to take derec and mia into her office .      can i get either of you anything while you wait .     hofton asked .  he pointed at mia .     pain blockers  yes  i   ll see to it .  anything else .         i could stand something to eat     derec said .     nothing for me     mia said .      i   ll return as soon as i can     hofton promised and left .   almost immediately  ariel came in  shutting the doors behind her .      are you all right .     she asked derec .  she stopped short of arm   s length from him .     i was       he raised his hands and nodded .     i   m fine  i just  it       ariel started to back away  then winced visibly and pulled derec into a hug .  he hesitated  his arms extended as if unsure what to do next .  then he closed them around her and they stood like that for a long time .   when she did break away  mia saw her eyes glint wetly .  ariel sniffed once  loudly  then seemed to seize control of herself .      your prisoners are in two of our debriefing rooms     she said .     they   re for high security conversations  completely shielded .  who are they .         one is a positronic tech     derec said .     tathis kedder  one of the two at union station .  the other .  .  .         otin cupra     mia said .   ariel stared at her .     you snatched a service agent .         chance encounter     mia said .     he showed up just when we were about to rescue derec .         the garage     derec said with emphasis .      i see     ariel said  folding her arms .     well  i doubt it could worsen the situation in the long run .         what   s happened .     derec asked .     hofton said my people are in custody .         phylaxis has been shut down and seized by the tbi .  i tried to get the personnel declared auroran nationals  but they weren   t backing down .  they want you  too .  now that you   re actually here  i can reinstate your auroran citizenship and grant asylum  but you can   t leave the embassy at this point .  at least  it wouldn   t be a good idea to go shopping .      derec almost laughed .  he looked around the office and moved to a couch .  he dropped into it  sprawling  and put a hand to his face  gently rubbing his eyes .      what happened .     ariel asked .     you were vague on the comlink .      mia described the events in the garage  watching derec as she spoke to see how he reacted .  he did not move .  as mia finished  hofton returned with a tray bearing food and a small plate with pills which he offered to mia .      i gathered you wanted something stronger than a med robot would permit .      mia gave him a smile and scooped the pills from the plate .  there were four .  she took two and pocketed the others .   derec sat up as hofton opened the legs under the tray and set it before him .     thanks     he murmured and examined the contents .  he took a piece of bread and started eating it .      why the local police .     ariel asked .      to complicate things .  however far this conspiracy goes  i doubt it includes the d .  c .  cops .  those men we snagged will go into the system and will be explaining themselves to a local judge  effectively out of reach of higher authority .  .  .  at least  for the time being .  it will be a matter of public record by morning  and maybe some questions will be asked that aren   t being asked now .      ariel scowled .     i wonder if this could be made to constitute    arrests    in the eyes of aurora .         what   s happening here .     mia asked .      solaria has officially pulled out of the conference .  they jumped the gun on us  we had no response .  i haven   t gotten word from setaris and as far as i know she hasn   t gotten word from aurora .         then it   s over .  they won .         that   s not clear yet .  aurora can pressure solaria to return to the table  but we have to have a reason .         all you   re going to do is push solaria further away     derec said .  his words came out muffled around a mouthful of food .  he was eating heartily now .     maybe that   s exactly what they want .         what do you mean .     ariel asked .      solaria   s involved .  your friend  tro aspil .  he was introduced to kedder as a representative from the calvin institute  an auroran  but kedder says the man he met was a solarian .         when was this .         over a year ago .         that   s not  he was introduced as tro aspil .      derec nodded .  he took a long drink  then started telling them about kedder   s confession .     cupra struggled against bogard   s grip on both his arms until they entered the lift .  michensol  the embassy security man  accompanied them .  mia noted that he looked distantly disapproving of bogard  but he said nothing .  cupra resigned himself once they were in the small car and kept shifting his gaze between mia and michensol  wary but helpless and resentful .      where are we going .     cupra asked finally .      a new experience     mia said .   the lift came to a halt and the doors opened onto a small chamber .  opposite the lift was another door .  the lift closed  leaving the four of them  three humans and a robot  in the quiet  almost intimate space .      have you ever seen a sunset .     mia asked conversationally .   cupra blinked .     of course          i mean a real one .     she touched a contact and the door opened .  a breeze swept into the chamber and cupra   s eyes widened slightly .     bring him  bogard .      mia stepped out onto the observation platform .      what are you doing .     cupra demanded  his voice tinged with anxiety .      giving you a treat     mia said .   she felt a few moments of apprehension herself  standing suddenly beneath an open sky  walking across a wide terrace to the railing  and gazing west toward a distant  uneven line of bluish mountains .  by the time she reached the rail  she had control and began to admire the view .   the roof of d .  c .  stretched before her  multileveled  aerials and dishes and towers forming a kind of forest  inabstract all the way to a point where it blended with the landscape .  the green of actual forest became  finally  the blue of the mountain range  and above them the sky was yellowing as evening approached .  the wind was cold and came in gusts  some of the roof   s protrusions waved slightly .      i remember the first time i came up like this     she said as bogard brought cupra to the railing beside her .     i was four and my parents were settler hopefuls .  they had to prove that they could tolerate the open  so they started making excursions outside the city .  naturally  they brought me .  we went to the smokey mountain preserve  you had to get a permit and there was a time limit .  they let you out in stages .  first  there was a shuttle ride to the visitor   s center  then there was the orientation lecture  then a covered area with wildlife that opened at one end and let onto the forest proper .  my parents wanted to stay back under the canopy  but i got loose and ran for the open .  all of a sudden i was outside .  i looked up at the trees reaching above me .  the tops broke into thousands of little shapes .  leaves .  and through the breaks in the leaves was all this blue .  somehow i realized that it was sky .  and i screamed .      she looked back at michensol  who was listening intently .     i think  i remember  that it was a scream of delight .  but my parents must have thought it was something less wonderful and came rushing out to save me .  my father swept me up  stopped  and looked up himself .  then he ran with me back under the canopy .  we never came outside again .  my parents didn   t emigrate .  but i   ve never gotten over that experience .  every time i come outside  it   s exciting .  the fear goes away pretty quickly and then it   s just .  .  .  intense .  i love it .  what do you think  otin .      cupra hung in bogard   s hands  head lowered and eyes squeezed shut .  he was pale now .      i take it you don   t share my enthusiasm     she said .      you   ve made your point     he said tersely .     do you mind if we go back .         no  not at all .  after you tell me who gives you instructions .         damn it   .         we can stay out here all night     mia said pleasantly .     if you think a sunset is something to see  wait till you experience dawn .      cupra drew a deep breath  then raised his head and opened his eyes .  mia was impressed .  he gazed at the distant horizon for several seconds before finally looking at her .      what do you want .         answers .         i can   t tell you .  you know how it works .         sure  i do .  but it only counts when it   s legal .  last time i checked  covering for a murderer and conspiring to conceal evidence were not things for which we were trained to indulge .      cupra   s eyes closed .  he trembled .      we are going to stay out here all night if necessary .  i want to know who   s running you .         you don   t know anything .  you haven   t got any evidence .         i don   t know about that  but if you want to play it that way  fine .  bogard .         yes  mia .         you accessed service files earlier today .         yes  i did  mia .         do you have those files relating to the service investigation of the union station assassinations .         yes  i do .         physical evidence .  forensics .         fifty five bullets  nine millimeter  were recovered from the bodies and surrounding area .  ballistics matches them to the type of weapon recovered from bok vin golner and his associates  which match the rifles recovered from union station in the aftermath of the assault .         provenance .         specially built rifles  no traceable provenance .  however  the basic frame closely matches weapons seized in a raid two years ago on mars .  the shipment was about to be sold to a buyer from one of the settler colonies .         the seller .         an agent was arrested and later confessed to being in the employ of kynig parapoyos .         where were the weapons stored .         standard policy is that all such contraband be destroyed after use as trial evidence .  in this instance  no record of such destruction exists .  according to the files  the weapons were stored at the special service impound facility .  a check of the internal log of the impound facility shows that they have not been present for at least six months .         interesting     mia mused .     so the rifles were removed from impound and modified and issued to managins  namely  bok golner .  who does bok golner work for  bogard .         his last recorded regular employment was as an environmental technician for cyvan industries  a subsidiary of imbitek .         i just got done doing a deep background on the bodies of those managins at union station .  every one of them has  at one time or another  been employed by either imbitek or a subsidiary .         very interesting     cupra said through clamped teeth .     so .         imbitek manufactures imbedded technologies  like the kind found permeating the maintenance nodes of the union station resident intelligence .  an interesting substance .  it relays positrons  according to derec a very .  i didn   t understand it very well  but it was fairly clear that whatever it is and however it works  it had something to do with disrupting the entire security net of union station .  that allowed golner and his people to get inside with their rifles  rifles that seem very similar to weapons once held in a special service impound .  now  all that may be circumstantial and may mean nothing .         that   s right .         but then you and your partner show up and stop derec a very from investigating what went wrong with the ri .  then you show up at the clinic where i was being treated and reassign the agents who had been there .  and later  you came in and bombed my room .         you can   t prove that .     cupra bellowed .   mia ignored him .     finally  you show up at a facility where contraband has been found  and the very same managins involved with the assassinations are holding not only the chief roboticist from union station and his dead partner  but derec avery .     she shook her head in mock sadness .      you seem to be in all the wrong places at all the right times  otin .  and you haven   t disputed the fact that it was golner who did the killing .  if you knew that  then why didn   t you arrest him .  unless you both take orders from the same source .  so  i ask again  who   s giving you instructions .      cupra shook his head .      bogard  suspend him .      in a swift movement  bogard let one of cupra   s arms go and grabbed his ankle  then stepped up against the railing and stretched that arm out over the drop .  he let the agent   s other arm go  and cupra swung free .   he screamed .      all the texts tell us that torture doesn   t work     mia said .     but i   m not so sure .         you bitch .      mia frowned .     oh  that   s not what i want to hear .         bogard won   t drop me .      mia raised an eyebrow .     you   re sure .  bogard is different from other robots .  it   s already left details out when you asked it questions  and  of course  a robot isn   t supposed to be able to do that .      cupra screamed again .  he stopped flailing and let himself go limp .  mia   s estimate of his courage went up again .      bogard  how many files are there pertaining to the union station assault .     mia asked .      forty seven  mia .         are they available through the general service data pool .         no .  fourteen are open flies .  the rest are security locked and coded to specific agents .         which agents .         cupra and gambel .      mia smiled .     gets better and better .  maybe we don   t need you to talk at all  otin .  seems like bogard got all the data we need .         please .     the word came out as a thin whine .  cupra started trembling again  then tried to curl himself up to grab bogard   s arm .  he could not quite make it and fell back .      who   s running you .     mia barked .     who set it up .         i don   t know .         wrong  otin .  you and gambel have been running around putting out fifes .  you have to know what you   re protecting in order to know what fifes to smother .         lemme up .  please .  mia  i  please .         i want a name  otin .  and it has to be the right one .  if it isn   t  we do this again until it is .      cupra waved his arms desperately .  suddenly  he said     mikels .  alda mikels .         old news  otin .  mikels couldn   t sabotage security .  who else .         please  for pity   s sake .         a name  otin .      the silence stretched .  cupra flapped his arms again .  if bogard had not been holding him  he might have worked himself loose and into a fatal fall .   then     one .  one signed off on the security .         bogard  retrieve .      bogard brought cupra back over the rail  snatched his arm  and righted him .  the robot stood the agent on his feet and kept a hand on the shaking man   s shoulder .  drool ran down cupra   s chin .  he glared at mia with open hatred and terror .      one     mia repeated .     and alda mikels .  how does that work .  make it sing  otin .         can we go inside .         after you convince me .      cupra swallowed  closed his eyes  and nodded .     there   s a consortium of patriots .  mikels heads it .  one is a member .  when eliton first proposed this conference  mikels approached one to discuss ways to stop it .  one came to us .         us .  you and gambel .         yes .         why you two .         history .  we were in the military with golner .         mikels gave golner a job .  how did mikels know golner .         his .  .  .  son .  .  .  was in golner   s unit .  he died in the ganymede action .         i   m going to check this  otin .         it   s true .  i swear .      mia watched the man for a few moments .     all right  otin .  we   ll continue this below .      he nodded gratefully .      bring him  bogard .      the robot moved cupra toward the lounge .  mia caught michensol   s eyes then  and saw the mix of respect and disgust .  she felt bad enough without his reproach  so she gave him nothing .      shall we .     she asked .      of course .      michensol went first .  mia gave the approaching sunset another look before following .      twenty nine    ariel stepped into the foyer of gale chassik   s offices and stopped  baffled by the scene of calm .  the receptionist looked up and smiled .      ambassador burgess     he said .     ambassador chassik will be with you in a few minutes .         yes  thank you .  .  .      besides the receptionist  two robots occupied niches .  no one else was in the room  and while she waited only two com messages came through .  it was very much business as usual  as orderly as her own offices were chaotic .   chassik   s door opened and a man came out .  he crossed in front of the reception desk and glanced at ariel .  he nodded politely  and left .      ariel     chassik called from his doorway .     good to see you .  come in  come in .  i   ve been meaning to send you a formal congratulations on your promotion .  i   ve been remiss .         it   s only temporary  gale  nothing to get ceremonious about .      he smiled .     who can say what   s temporary these days .  i   ve been a diplomat almost fifty years now  and i   ve seen far more    temporary    changes become permanent fixtures than i care to think about .         in that case     ariel said  walking past him into his chambers     i accept your apology and thank you for your sentiments .  i       jonis taprin stood by one of the two chairs facing chassik   s desk .     ariel .     he smiled hesitantly .      i believe you know each other     chassik said as he resumed his own chair .      yes  of course     ariel said .     senator taprin .      jonis   s smile faltered .     ambassador .      chassik seemed amused  but he said nothing .  ariel took the chair opposite taprin and sat down .      forgive me not telling you that we   d have another party to our discussion     chassik said .     senator taprin  being the successor to senator eliton  i think has a special interest in the events of the past week .         likely as not     ariel conceded .     but what i have to discuss with you is confidential .         even from   .         right at the moment     ariel cut in     i don   t see that senator taprin has our best interests in mind .         that   s unfair  ariel     jonis said .   she looked at him evenly .     no .  your state police are still harassing auroran nationals .  i asked for a word from you to put a halt to it until we can sort out what   s going on  and all i got was terran phobias .         senator taprin     chassik said     has come to me with a proposal for putting an end to the harassment .      jonis   s face was slightly red  but he held his temper .     i did talk to the head of tbi after our earlier talk .  the investigation is not gratuitous  ariel .  a few of your people have been trading in illicit goods .  the tbi is following up on an inquiry that began over a year ago .         let me guess .  just after the tiberius incident .         there are very specific laws concerning the possession of positronic robots on earth     jonis continued .     the tbi has found a number of violations .         are they looking into the same violations on the part of terrans .         ariel      chassik began .      why now .  if this has been an ongoing investigation  why push it now .  all they   re doing is fueling a panic that could drive most of the spacer population off earth .  with them goes any hope of improved trade relations  and with that  earth stands to lose a great deal of money  not to mention risking future conflicts .         is that a threat .     taprin asked .      no  just a statement of fact .  don   t pretend you don   t understand me  senator .  nobody wins from this .  the only reason for the tbi to do what it   s doing right now is to drive a wedge between terrans and spacers .  they could just as easily carry out their investigation quietly and later  after we have the people in custody who have committed murder .  murder  by the way  against spacers as well as terrans .         yes  well .  .  .     chassik pursed his lips .     there   s the complication  ariel .  it seems that arrests are imminent .         oh .         it seems     taprin said     that the assault  the conspiracy  was auroran in origin .      ariel stared at him .     you have got to be joking .         he   s not     chassik said .     what   s more  they apparently have some evidence connecting you to it .         evidence .  what evidence .         i   m not at liberty to       ariel stood and glared down at taprin .     don   t give me that  you son of a bitch .  any evidence they claim to have is manufactured and you damn well know it .         please  ariel     chassik said     calm down .  you   re certainly in no danger  at least not from them .  as long as you remain within embassy grounds they can   t even question you .         question me about what .  how dare you believe this  gale .  the assassins were managins .  order for the supremacy of man again .  what possible connection can you make between them and me .         it concerns the contraband     taprin said  marshalling himself .     now sit down and i   ll tell you what i can .      reluctantly  fighting rage  ariel made herself resume her chair .  taprin shifted in his own seat  as if physically trying to recover lost dignity .      the tbi were looking at a man named udal     he explained .     he operates one of the largest retail outlets for drones and automatons .  they   ve suspected him of dealing in illicit positronics for some time .  earlier today  a facility was seized in the convention center district that contained a large stock of undeclared imports  including a cache of positronic brains .  the shipment was linked to similar ones that have been traced to udal   s warehouse where he apparently has an operation to switch nonpositronic ai plants with these  converting an otherwise legal drone into a fully positronic robot .  in the same facility was found a number of people who have been connected to the same group that did the killings at union station .  before udal could be arrested  you had him picked up by your security people and brought under diplomatic cover to your embassy .  you   ve had dealings with udal in the past .  you knew about the facility in question .  you basically rescued udal from imminent arrest .  what else are we to conclude .         that possibly i was trying to shut down the same illicit trade .         if you were doing that     taprin said quietly     why didn   t you come to me .  i thought the whole point of this conference was to increase cooperation between us .         why .     ariel snorted .     quite obviously because i couldn   t trust you .         ariel     chassik said     we can help          help with what .         the repercussions .      ariel grew still .  not calm  no  but clear  understanding .     perfect .  this is perfect .  i   m implicated in covering for the black market and in one stroke you discredit me  aurora  and the humadros eliton treaty .  the political fallout reduces aurora   s influence on terra  and solaria steps forward to become the new broker of agreements  the defender of earth spacer relations .  and i walked right into it .  i thought i was doing everything i could to avoid this kind of incident and i walked right into it .  very elegant .  neat .         ariel     taprin said     what are you talking about .         i suppose derec avery is implicated  too .      the senator looked troubled .     phylaxis has been servicing the illegal robots .  collusion at best .  but          perfect .  you know  if you worked this hard and this well to solve problems and do the right thing  the universe would  oh  hell  what am i saying .  there   s no profit to be made from that  is there .     she got to her feet .      ariel      taprin began .      ambassador burgess to you  senator .      taprin snapped his mouth shut and paled .  he shook his head and looked away .      my offer to help remains open     chassik said .      i   m sure it does  gale .  i   ll let you know later what you can do with it .      ariel felt a slight trembling in her legs as she walked out of his office and left the solarian quarter .  she had badly wanted to tell them what she now knew  how elegantly they had not only compromised her entire position but given themselves away as well  but she did not know yet if that information could be used to her advantage .  the parts assembled themselves neatly now .  they could not have known that she would recognize the visitor who had left before chassik had ushered her in to hear the sentence they handed her on her career .  they could not know that she held his partner and that mia daventri  whom they also did not know was still alive  was interrogating him .   no  she was right to keep it to herself .  a name was still missing  the keystone  the node that connected taprin and chassik to the man she had recognized as special agent gambel .        very clever     mia agreed .     a perfect trap .      ariel nodded dreamily .  it did not seem real  not back in her own office  amid people who knew her  trusted her  and depended on her .  she was not letting them down  not ariel burgess  not ambassador ariel burgess .  that promotion was now a hideous weight .  had she remained only the institute liaison  the political consequences of all this would never  bad as they might have been  amounted to the catastrophe before her .      i spoke with setaris already     she said  subdued .     she wants me to confine myself to the compound .  the embassy offices or my apartments .  if i go out  she can   t guarantee my safety .         safety .     mia said .     you   re a diplomat .  you can   t be arrested .         i think she was more concerned for the image of the embassy .         it always bothered me a little     derec said abruptly     about the ambulance .  why hadn   t they changed the id markers .  it seemed a stupid oversight .         they wanted it followed     mia said .     somebody would have  eventually  probably a newsnet investigator  and it would have led to the same tbi discovery of contraband .  it was just a bonus that ariel found it .         it   s a good assumption that our little excursion there was recorded     ariel said .      traps within traps     derec mused .     but then  where   s eliton   s body .         it might never be found     mia said .     even if it is and the cadaver in the morgue is announced as a fake  it still points to spacers .         how does that follow .     ariel asked .      the biotech .  cloning .  we only do a little of it here  it   s mostly illegal .  exceptions are made for rare blood groups or certain organs with high rejection factors  exotic stuff .  but spacers .  .  .         ah .  it doesn   t explain the switch  though .         does it have to .  the more layers we peel back from this  the more solid the conclusions become that spacers were behind this .  all it took was one good connection to the black market  and udal handed that to them .  what i don   t get is the solarian   s connection .         oh  that   s simple     ariel said .     they can use this as a political fulcrum to lever themselves into the dominant position in the fifty worlds .  for them  this is a perfect opportunity to become the primary spacer world .         but the ri     mia insisted .     they allowed the corruption of a positronic brain .  i thought that was a sort of blasphemy to you .         anywhere else but earth     derec said .     prejudice cuts both ways .  when chassik offered to le t me have the ri  it would have been a perfect way to get rid of it before it was shipped back to solaria .  i   m sure they could lose it anyway  but if i   d accepted it  then it would be one more bit of incriminating evidence linking us to the murders .  and chassik could deny all knowledge  since i was supposed to be the legal service for that system anyway .  at best  phylaxis was negligent .  at worst  collusive .         and if they had managed to take out eliton   s personal security and implicate bogard .  .  .     mia shook her head .     no one would be able to give a credible alternative account .  the spacers set up the conference to kill eliton and damage earth   s position in all future trade negotiations .  it would look like they had tried to make it appear that it was a terran plot and they botched it .         what about cupra .     ariel asked .     has he told us anything worth while .         he hasn   t stopped talking     mia said .     but it   s all verification of what we already knew .     she frowned .     with one exception .  the head of special service is involved .  one signed off on everything they did  ran interference from other agents  and encrypted a lot of data under his personal seal .  it made sense once i heard it .  someone had to compromise the external security links at union station  and since we were overseeing it .  .  .         you sound dissatisfied with that     derec said .   mia held up her hand and counted off points on her fingers .     we have alda mikels  the funding  the personnel  and the tech to undermine the ri .  we have the head of special service equipment  communications  and security  plus the cover up afterward .  we have the solarian ambassador  collusion  diversion of legitimate spacer interests  and the source of the final list of targets .         that   s a guess     ariel said .      are you inclined to argue .         no .         all right .  we have all these people  plus a few fringe players  kynig parapoyos is an obvious choice for the contraband  and udal  and maybe even senator taprin .         i   m inclined to think that he   s going along with what he   s being handed by everyone else     ariel said .     i   ve known him a long time .  he   s not fundamentally a bad man .         whatever .     mia shrugged .     but which one is the prime mover .  they still all look like parts of the conspiracy to me .  which one came up with the plan and initiated the operation and organized it .         cupra says it   s mikels     derec said .      i don   t think cupra knows .  why should he .     mia shook her head .     mikels makes a good figurehead for something like this  but the primary .  i don   t think so .         sounds like your one could do it     derec said .      at first glance  but why would the solarians listen to him .  for that matter  why would he listen to the solarians .  and why would either of them listen to alda mikels .  money .  does gale chassik need money .  influence .  what could mikels offer the head of special service .     she shook her head .     something   s missing .         what about golner .     ariel asked .      no  he   s just muscle .      there was a knock on the door .  ariel turned in her chair .     yes .      bogard entered the room .      your pardon  ms .  burgess     it said .     i have a question .         yes  bogard .     derec said .      i would like to know if your investigation is concluded .         we   re determining that now  bogard     ariel said .      if i may offer my help .  i have concluded that the conspiracy is composed of a pyramidal arrangement of persons .  several were hired for specific tasks without knowledge of the whole plan .  tathis kedder  for instance  and shor udal .  i imagine that many of the actual assassins knew little of the overall strategy .  above them were agents cupra and gambel  who knew more but still not everything .  their counterparts would be people like bok vin golner .  at least three knew the entirety of it .         we   ve just reached the same conclusion  bogard     mia said .     our candidates are ambassador gale chassik  alda mikels of imbitek  and the head of special service  one .         i concur     bogard said .     with the arrest of those three  the entire conspiracy should be exposed .  that being the case  i must ask if i may be allowed to resume my primary obligation .         which is what .     derec asked .      i was assigned to protect senator eliton .          senator eliton is dead  bogard     ariel said .      your pardon  ambassador  but there is no evidence on which to confidently base that conclusion .  my assessment is that a high probability exists that senator eliton is still alive  and it is my duty to find and protect him .  if it is all the same to you  i would like to pursue that responsibility .         thirty    among the weapons we confiscated at the garage     bogard explained     we recovered two sets of personal documents .  i have run a check through civic records and determined that they are forged .  however  both also included passes for above ground access to the manassas preserves .         cupra said something about manassas before you rescued me     derec said .      there is a section of the preserve operated by a settler colonial recruiting organ and leased by osma .  they run a nature camp .  there was a report filed the day after the union station assault that the osma camp was investigated and searched .  nothing was found .         who filed the report .     mia asked .     agent gambel .         imagine that     ariel said .      so why do you believe eliton is there  bogard .     derec asked .      it is a matter of probabilities .  managins  apparently under control of bok vin golner  staged the assault at union station .  during the aftermath  senator eliton   s body was switched and the legitimate one was taken to the garage where you found the ambulance used  contraband positronics  and were then taken as prisoner by the very same bok vin golner .  the managins run a camp in the manassas preserve  which was investigated by one of the corrupt agents who have exerted an inhibitory influence on this entire matter .  obviously  there is something there they wish to keep undiscovered .  given all the possibilities  it is the most likely place to begin a search for senator eliton .         why hold him prisoner .     ariel asked .   derec shrugged .  mia pursed her lips .      i have no conclusion on that matter  ambassador burgess     bogard said .      call me ariel  bogard .     ambassador burgess    is clumsy and  right now  problematic .         yes  ariel .         so     mia said     we go look and see .  bogard  are you game for a little open air field work .         i am prepared to do this alone     bogard said .     this is my responsibility  the risk is high  and i am capable of          bogard     derec interrupted .     we   re going .         we .     mia said .     me and bogard          of course we   re going     ariel said .     there   s no question .  it would make me crazy now to sit and wait while you two thrashed around in the woods .         but       derec shook his head .     don   t bother  agent daventri .      mia looked at them  then shrugged .     i won   t argue too much .  let me brief you on the weapons .  ariel  we   ll need hofton to get us some things .  bogard  whether you approve or not  we   re going with you .        bogard bypassed the security lock on a solarian embassy transport .  they loaded a pair of packs in the back and piled aboard .  mia programmed the vehicle for their destination and sat up front during their exit from the garage .      i only see one tbi vehicle     she called back as they rolled onto the main avenue .     there are more  i   m sure .         if everybody keeps a level head     ariel said     we might get through this without starting a war .      the transport left the anacostia district unchallenged .  mia came back and started changing her clothes  pulling on the same nonreflective  graphite black suit they all wore  bogard   s surface was even less reflective  it made an ominous  cloudy presence by the rear doors .      anything else you need to go over about your weapons .     mia asked .     the suits are invisible to most sensor arrays and give back no heat or light .  if you   re standing in the open under bright illumination you will be visible  but if you keep to shadows  close to larger structures  and avoid direct line of  sight  we should be able to get in and out without being seen .  i   ve set all your sidearms on heavy stun .         what about yours .     derec asked .      never mind that .  if any killing has to occur  it   s on my head .         i thought with bogard      ariel began .      bogard can   t be everywhere at once     mia interrupted .     we learned that .  it also has limitations that we don   t have  we found that out  too .  i won   t risk any of us over an ethical qualm .  but it   s my decision .         how are you doing .     derec asked .     your leg          hofton got me some painblock that makes me feel like i could run a marathon .  i feel wonderful .         all right     ariel said     one more time .  what is it we   re looking for .         any place where someone might be hidden or confined that wouldn   t be obvious on a casual visit .  so i   m thinking a storage facility or an underground bunker of some kind .  we have the ground plan from the camp   s registration file  but obviously that   s not going to have anything new or illegal .  we   ll just have to do a thorough sweep .         bogard could do it a lot faster     derec said .      bogard will do it  but i want us in there looking as well .  bogard might miss something we wouldn   t .         unlikely .         what i really want bogard to do is sweep the perimeter  nullify as much security as possible  and plot us an escape route .  can you do that  bogard .         of course  mia .  that was my first intention .         excellent .  getting out might be a lot harder than getting in .         you sound like you expect this to be an armed camp     ariel said .      if golner had any say in setting it up  it will be .         overtly .         at night  what difference would it make .  we assume the worst and hope for the best .  now  until we reach the transition point  go over the maps  memorize them .        the manassas preserve occupied a vast area of land roughly fifty kilometers from the heart of d . c .  townships once dotted the countryside  all of them now gone or abandoned to wilderness .  densely forested  the preserve had been one of the surface areas set aside for the settler   s program .  over time  other groups interested in    open    experiences had come to use it  and a couple had requested and received special licenses for continual use .  to most terrans  those who chose to spend long stretches of time outside the warrens of the cities were weird .  they were watched occasionally  but largely left alone .   a main throughway  a major traffic artery that connected d .  c .  to cincinnati  ran just north of the preserve .  a trunk line split off for the few transports that went directly to manassas .   mia directed their vehicle off the trunk line and into the service tunnels alongside .  most of the traffic here was automated and sparse .  she found a garage for local technical vehicles and parked the transport among them .  unless an audit occurred in the next few hours  the system would log their vehicle and file the data  but would alert no one .   bogard unfolded from the back of the transport .  a jagged patch of night  he looked menacing and unpleasantly efficient .  the white line of the optical array dimmed to a smokey grey .   mia pulled her night veil over her face and the others did likewise .  the garage sprang into full detail from the combination of radar  infrared  and neutrino  shadow amplification the veils interpreted for them .  even with all that enhancement their suits showed almost no detail  bogard gave even less .      ready .     mia asked .   they nodded .   bogard led the way back into the trunk line and they headed south .     the road ended at a vast parking lot .  several transports clustered against one end  but it was mostly empty .  steps led up to the entrance to a wide pavilion in which booths and galleries provided a history of the area and related data .  during normal hours  it was easy to imagine tours coming this far  people winding their way through the displays  still safely under a roof  and going no farther  retreating to the safety of the warrens after a brief  dissociated brush with wildness and the outside .  a few  perhaps  might later come back to take the last few steps into the open air .   but now it was deserted  testament to the circadian of day and night from which the retreat underground had failed to free humans .      do we just go through the front door .     derec asked .      there is an employee entrance     bogard said and moved off to the right  skirting the wall of the garage .   they had no cover now  but had to rely on the suits mia had obtained for them to hide them from any surveillance .  they followed mia   s lead and scurried along quickly in bogard   s wake .   the door bogard opened for them led into dark corridors that connected a set of offices  a food service plant  a machine shop  and laboratories .  one of the labs offered access to a tunnel that ended at a door marked caution  beyond this point is uncanopied area .      nice of them to let us know     derec said .     bogard  is the door keyed to an alarm .      the robot pressed itself against the door for a few seconds .  suddenly  it slid open .     no  derec     bogard said .     thanks     ariel hissed .   beyond  a poured concrete apron ended at dense underbrush  through which a ground stone path led into a tangle of towering trees .  mia sucked her breath loudly .      what .     derec asked .      nothing     she said .     it   s just .  .  .  been a while .  it   s beautiful .         the osma enclave is this way     bogard said and headed for the trail .   after walking for nearly a kilometer  bogard stopped .      we should leave the path here     it said .     there are sensors further along .         how far from the camp .     mia asked .      three hundred meters .         find us a way in first  bogard .  let   s go .      they plunged into the woods  off the trail .  the foliage stood out sharply in the general wash of sensor impressions .  without the depth provided by the radar it would all have appeared to be a senseless array of meaningless detail  wrinkles and lines and textures cobbled together with only a kind of vertical tendency to suggest any order .  it was easy to imagine people who had spent all their lives in artificial environments  the tunnels  chambers  and warrens of earth   s cities  becoming instantly and horribly lost out here simply because nothing made visual sense .  it was not only the agoraphobia that came with vast  open spaces that hobbled terrans  there were large spaces within all earth   s inhabited areas  but the fear of disorder  the unpredictability of organic chaos  the alienness of the life of their own world which they had so carefully built to deny .   and yet there were parks within the cities  though they were tame places  manicured and confined .  this wilderness overwhelmed and obeyed no geometry .   bogard seemed to shift between obstacles  the shapes oozing around it as if they did not exist .  a mirage  like heat rising off a flat surface  looked like that  rippling and indistinct .  bogard made no sound  disturbed nothing  passed through like a breeze .  derec had not known such movement was possible .  then he realized that bogard   s amalloy body was twisting and distorting and reshaping constantly to accommodate its passage .  he glanced toward ariel  but he could not see her face through the night veil .  he imagined her staring at bogard  impressed and a little frightened .   bogard stopped a few meters from a break in the tree line .      wait     it said  and oozed slowly forward .  it returned in less than a minute .     the boundary is a perimeter sensor .  there is no physical barrier  but the sensor will trigger an alarm .  it is possible that it can also release a mild electrical shock  but it seems unlikely .  please wait one full minute  then follow me out .      bogard faded through the underbrush again .  around them  the forest hummed with rhythmic  organic sounds .  derec   s pulse pounded in his ears .      now     mia said quietly and he started .   they came out of the trees at the edge of a cleared strip of land .  across from them stood prefab barracks in neat rows .  walkways ran among them .  a larger structure dominated the center of the compound  a kind of community center  derec thought  and glowed more brightly than any other building  most of the windows illuminated from within .   bogard was wrapped around a post .  at five meter intervals stood identical posts  each with a knobby crown  the sensor array  and all of them giving false readings back to whoever monitored them .  bogard was using its body to deflect and reroute connecting signals .      make sure you pass below one point seven five meters     bogard said .     i am maintaining a carrier signal above that height .      mia crouched low and sprinted across the invisible boundary .  derec and ariel copied her and hurried after .  a few moments later  bogard was among them  a silent  lithic presence .      all right     mia said .     take your sectors of the camp  do your search  and rendezvous at the main building .  bogard  do the perimeter  secure what you can  guarantee us a way out .      bogard vanished .      i wish it wouldn   t do that     ariel said .      go     mia said and scurried away .      good luck     derec said .      be careful     ariel answered .     tactical parameters  standard field sensor perimeter  motion sensor capacity damped to ignore thirty kilograms and below  internal

eliton    aside from the barracks  the camp contained a communal shower  a communal mess with its own kitchens  and a supply shed .  ariel had checked the shower and mess .  the supply shed did not appear locked .   she had passed two guards not fifteen meters back who had been tranquilized  by bogard  she hoped  and she had removed their stunners and tossed them into the trees  over the range of the perimeter .  she did not know where bogard was and wished she did  but she did not risk calling for it .   she adjusted her grip on the stunner .  the blaster nestled against the small of her back  but she did not want to pull it yet .  if it came to that  then they would probably have to bum the entire camp down  and she did not know if she could do that .   she pushed open the door of the shed and a light winked on inside .  she pulled it shut immediately  pulse racing  and surveyed the camp  waiting for a rush of angry managins .  when they failed to materialize  she slipped quickly into the shed .   on one wall hung a variety of hand tools  most of them worn and dirty from use .  against the opposite wall stood boxes of pamphlets .  she opened one and pulled out the slim sheaf of paperlike plastic  amused at the novelty .   identifying and analyzing wilderness spoor the title read .  ariel leafed through it quickly .  a wildlife guide .  she checked through others  cleaning and dressing of injuries in the wild  campsite ergonomics and ecological awareness  personal hygiene in unmodified territory  impressed despite herself at the evident attention to the details of living outside an urban environment .   she followed the line down to the end .  on top of each crate one of the pamphlets had been placed in an attached sleeve .  except the last one .   ariel pried the lid up and found another stack of pamphlets .  these contained a picture of clar eliton below a banner that declared eliton for terra first .  she pulled one out and opened it .     mia reached the first floor veranda of the main building at the same time as derec .  they sat next to each other below one of the few unlit windows .      anything .     he asked .      no .  where   s ariel .         i don   t know .  i thought she was over there .     he pointed toward the west end of the enclave .     this is the last building .         that we know about .      he shrugged .   mia began crawling along the veranda  keeping below the windows .  derec followed .   the veranda encircled the building .  at each window  mia risked a quick look inside  then continued on .  derec trusted her that she saw nothing important in any of these rooms .   they climbed the stairs to the second floor balcony on all fours .   immediately  they heard voices .   mia moved carefully but faster than derec could match and still keep quiet .  he caught up to her beneath a broad window .  voices came from within and when derec looked up at the opening he  saw that  instead of a solid surface  it was only screened .  mia knelt before it  her head just above the sill so she could see in .        a mess .  should   ve stayed arrested            not my style          style be damned .      derec felt his scalp tingle  he recognized the voice .  he raised himself up to mia   s level .   the room was large and comfortable  with heavy divans and thick armchairs scattered about .  lamps cast conflicting though warm and pleasant shadows over the tables and walls and the three men facing each other in a loose triangle .   agent gambel held a glass .  across from him stood bok golner  still in his black fatigues  scowling at the man seated before them .  derec   s unease multiplied at the sight of senator eliton  sitting in a low chair  a drink at his elbow  dressed in an evening jacket .      it shouldn   t make any difference at this point     gambel said .     we have the robot  the tbi have seized four spacer warehouses containing contraband  and phylaxis has been shut down under a warrant based on illegal service to contraband robots .  the spacers are looking worse and worse .  all we need to do now is drop the last bit of evidence on taprin   s desk and there   ll be a general outcry to throw the aurorans off earth .      eliton sighed wearily .     i don   t know what you think this accomplishes .  anything could undo the whole thing  like finding him    he stabbed a finger at golner      here  when he ought to be in jail with the rest of his goons .         i don   t do that     golner said .      do what .     eliton demanded .      serve time in an institution .  i already did that once .         you should remember how to follow orders     gambel said .   golner   s face reddened .  he opened his mouth to speak .   but the door opened behind him  and suddenly bogard was in the room with them .      shit     derec hissed .     several things happened .   eliton stood abruptly  knocking his drink off the table .   golner drew a weapon and began to turn .  bogard touched golner   s hand  but the managin flinched away  letting the pistol fly .  he ducked under bogard grasp  so fast that derec almost could not follow his turn as he twisted around bogard   s left flank and bolted for the door .   gambel dropped his glass and reached for his sidearm .   mia threw herself through the screen  weapon drawn .     bogard .     she cried .   bogard  reaching for golner  hesitated .   eliton dropped to his knees and came up holding golner   s pistol .      thank god .     he shouted and shot gambel .   bogard   s entire body seemed to unfold and suddenly refold around eliton .   golner staggered from the room .   mia ran to the doorway  leaned out  and fired twice .   derec got to his feet .   it all too place in a few seconds .   derec stepped into the room and went to gambel .  his face was distorted  the eyeballs pulped and oozing  the effects of a heavy stun at nearly pointblank range .  derec looked away .      time to leave     mia said .     bogard  do you have the senator secured .         yes  mia .         don   t let him out unless absolutely necessary and not on his command .  clear .         i understand  mia .          escape route .      bogard swept out of the window and down the outside stairs .      platoon .     golner shouted from somewhere below .     compromise .  the perimeter has been compromised .         move     mia urged derec .   they followed bogard down to the ground and hurried across the enclave .  behind them  people were spilling from two of the barracks .      where   s ariel .     derec asked .   ahead  they saw a figure running to intercept them  barely a shadow against larger shadows .  she waved and derec knew it was ariel .   bogard stopped at the perimeter .     please step against me     it said .      what   .     mia began .      like this .     derec pressed himself to bogard   s side .  the amalloy skin warped around him .  a few moments later  he felt bogard begin to move .     bogard ran directly through the perimeter .  the voltage discharged against it  but coursed around the robot and grounded harmlessly .  just within the tree line  the shielding retracted and let derec  ariel  and mia out .      this way     bogard said  and plunged through the underbrush .   the distant  distinct pops of gunfire sounded behind them .  the whiz and snap of bullets tearing through leaves and branches overhead made them duck involuntarily .      the shots are random     mia said .     they can   t see us .      the rate of fire increased .      eventually one of them will get lucky     ariel complained .   they were running now  arms outstretched to fend off the whipping branches .   suddenly  bogard stopped and let them catch up and pass .      bogard  what   .     mia called .      i cannot accept the level of risk to you .  please take senator eliton in your care .      derec stopped .  bogard opened up and eliton stumbled out from within the enshielding .  he looked around frantically  eyes wide  still holding golner   s weapon .   mia stepped up to him .     senator     she said  and deftly took the pistol from him .     this way  please .         it   s a miracle you showed up     eliton said and looked around  puzzled that he could barely see his rescuers .     whoever you are .         talk later  move now     mia said and took his elbow .   they continued on .   derec looked back to see what bogard intended .  bogard followed  but its body seemed to grow even as derec watched .  bogard had dispensed with its stealth shielding .  it was a bright coppery target now  making itself wider and higher .  beyond  the gunfire resumed and derec heard the bullets impact on bogard .  then he heard the wash of a blaster .   bogard   s entire body seemed to shudder and glow .      run  derec     bogard ordered .   derec ran .   they reached the path and sprinted back toward the orientation center .  it sounded like a small army attacking bogard  and derec winced at the staccato sounds .   just as the door came into sight  a dozen men poured onto the path  blocking their way  all armed and converging on them .  derec skidded to a stop and backpedaled .      sir .     someone shouted  but derec did not stop .   he crashed into the woods and tried to find a place to hide .  before him now rose an eerie specter  a sheen of gold through the foliage  rippling and moving .  as he stared at the sight  he realized that it was bogard  stretched out like a blanket between him and the managins in pursuit .  derec understood the potential for bogard to manage this  but it still amazed him .   but it was too much .  holes were appearing in the skin .  they rehealed almost at once  except in a couple of spots where they were ragged  the edges flapping uselessly .  bogard was losing integrity and could no longer absorb the impacts .   as he watched  bogard seemed to shred into fragments .      no .     derec screamed .   then the second group caught up to him .   instead of seizing him  though  they passed him  driving into the woods  and firing at the managins .   derec backed away .   something closed on his neck painfully .  he tried to turn  but could not .  then he hit the gravel on his back .   when he looked up  someone knelt on his chest  aiming a pistol at his face .      let   s see who we have now     golner said and lifted derec   s veil .     spacer boy .  great .  are you worth my trouble .  will you get me out of here .  it   s a good question  isn   t it .      derec swung at golner  aiming to knock the weapon aside .  golner just held it out of harm   s way  then punched derec in the sternum  a short  hard blow that knocked the wind from him .      no chance     golner said .     you   ll be more trouble than you   re worth .      he aimed again .   a coppery tendril snaked around golner   s body  encircled his wrist  and jerked the gun up .  it went off  a loud crack of thunder that set derec   s ears ringing .   golner struggled briefly  then tried to turn the pistol in the direction of his assailant .  the barrel came around  the wrist still held by bogard   s tendril .  golner tried to twist so he could see  the barrel of the gun came close to his head .  bogard flexed to turn the weapon away  and it went off again .   golner   s head burst open in a spray of blood and bone .   derec screamed and pushed himself away .   people surrounded him  but their guns were aimed at golner   s corpse .   it lay now  half its head gone  a copper strand wrapped around its waist and wrist .  derec followed the line of the strand into the woods to a shapeless mass of material that glowed dimly in the first vague light of approaching dawn .      violation .  .  .  violation .  .  .     the voice was weak and tinny .     first law violation .  .  .  unacceptable .  .  .  vio  vi  violation        gradually the voice faded away  and the forest was still .     agent sathen knelt before derec and offered him a cup .      i don   t understand     derec said .      it   s coffee     sathen said .   derec shook his head .     i mean you .  what are you doing here .      sathen gave him a wry grin .     did you think none of us were doing anything .         does one know you   re here .     mia asked .  she pointed past him .     with tbi agents .      sathen looked at her .     good question for a corpse .  no  one doesn   t .  or maybe he does .  he   s gone .  we moved to arrest him when this phase began .      mia nodded as if the answer meant everything .        woke up out here  i had no idea what had happened     senator eliton   s voice drifted over to them .   sathen looked toward the group of agents surrounding the senator and shook his head .     i   m amazed .  i really expected          that he was really dead .     ariel asked .      no .  but that he   d be off the planet .      ariel cocked an eyebrow .     you believe spacers were behind this .         not all of you .  the fake bodies in the .  morgue are spacer biotech          which can be purchased easily enough     ariel said .   sathen shrugged .     but we have him back .         for better or worse     ariel said .   sathen frowned .     i thought you   d be pleased .  we found the assassins  shut down their operation  and recovered senator eliton .  he   s the best friend you people have .         is he really .      sathen stared at her for a time  then stood .     whatever .  you politicos can sort it out from here .      he walked off .  eliton continued to talk  describing his ordeal among the fanatic managins .   ariel pulled a pamphlet out of her jacket and passed it to mia .     you might find this instructive     she said .   mia opened it and silently began to read .   another agent came up to derec .     are you avery .         yes .         we gathered up what was left of bogard .  nothing seems to be working anymore .  what do you want us to do with him .         deliver it  him  to phylaxis .      the agent nodded and walked away .  derec sat quietly for a moment  staring off into space  bogard   s last words echoing in his head .  he felt numb .  then he suddenly started  his mind clearing .      phylaxis     he muttered  then groaned .     rana .         don   t worry     ariel said .  she placed a consoling hand on his shoulder .     we   ll work on getting your people out of confinement in the morning .      derec nodded and sat there then  listening to eliton drone on  and watched the company of agents try to sort out prisoners and bodies and logistics .  he drank his coffee and tried not to think .   after a while  mia stood and walked over to eliton .  derec heard her speaking  but could make out none of the words .  then she held out the pamphlet ariel had given her and tossed it in the senator   s lap .  she walked off .  eliton stared at the pamphlet .  the other agents watched mia .      epilogue    record module cf     attach log sequencing file    zealots inc .     running virtual conference maui overlook fill visual fill audio status on    this will be our last meeting under these circumstances     the thick man with amber tinged white hair announced .  only three others sat around the table .     i   m arranging for another medium  which i will let you all know about in due course .  circumstances have forced me to remove myself from easy access .  however  i think we can agree that  in spite of a wrinkle or two we didn   t foresee  things have worked out neatly .         a wrinkle or two .  we damn near started a war .         but we didn   t  did we .  we aren   t at war .  yet .  the conference ended without a treaty  the aurorans have been thoroughly compromised  and in six months we can resume traffic with even less interference than we had before now that risher is out of the way .  i already have commitments from two settler colonies for new bases .         what about eliton .  he   s fighting a losing battle .         in your opinion .  i think he   ll manage to win reelection .  taprin is just not as good a campaigner .         but he   s untainted .  we might do better to back him .  those files that agent spilled into the public database on his past associations with mikels and golner are doing a lot of damage .  even if he wins he may be a spent force .      the chairman considered that for a time  then nodded .     you have a point .  let   s see how the numbers fallout for a time .  if it turns out that people believe all that data  then maybe we should switch to taprin .  of course  there was that matter of his relationship with that auroran ambassador .         it   s over .  he stood on principle  she left him .  i have that on very good authority .         usable .         what do we do about the aurorans now .         that   s up to the fifty worlds .  our friend ambassador chassik is making tremendous political capital out of their apparent indiscretions .  the damage is done  we just have to wait and see how much .  once solaria displaces aurora as de facto head of the spacer worlds  then business will be even better .  agreed .      the three attendees nodded .      it has been an interesting campaign     the chairman said .     we won most of what we wanted .  no robotic inspections of earth transports  no lowering of tariffs here or among the spacer worlds  although the easement among the settler worlds might do some small damage to our prof its .  however  that should be offset by the tighter controls that solaria will propose once they assume the dominant role among the fifty worlds .  all in all  a good year   s work .  you should all congratulate yourselves .  you did very well .         it cost you quite a bit .         yes  well .  .  .  i always did consider emigrating .     he paused for a time to let them all think about that .     anything else .         what about alda .  are we going to leave him in prison .         alda won   t spent any time in prison  i assure you .  the charges are circumstantial  the evidence corrupted .  this will cost him a little out of pocket  that   s all .         and looms .         yes  well  we missed that one  didn   t we .  a pity he won   t even be charged .  but maybe next time .     again  a pause .     no further business .  good .  in that case  i   ll be in touch some time in the next ten months with the new arrangements for our meetings .  be careful to purge your files of any hint of this place .  thank you all .  i   ll look forward to our next talk .      one by one the attendees winked out .  the chairman went to the transparency and gazed out at the simulation .  the ocean  the waterfall  the trees  the beauty .  he wondered if where he was going would have anything to compare .   well  if it did not  then he would simply have to build it .  what else was money and power for .      flesh  not steel .      the chairman turned to find a ghostly form standing behind him .  he was only mildly surprised .      i didn   t expect you to chance coming back here     he said .      the meeting   s over .  i missed it .         it   s allover .         no  i don   t think so .  you   ll resume in some other medium .  i just wanted to say good bye .  i couldn   t have done this without your help .         no  you couldn   t .  but then we   ve been dependent on each other  haven   t we .         i wondered if you noticed .          i never get overconfident .          good .         will you be all right .  will you win .         i think so .  the fight will do me good  but .  .  .         well  then .  good luck to you .         and to you .  see you around .      the ghost faded .  the chairman scowled .  that should not have been possible .  it was just as well he was closing this place down .  holes must have developed .      recording complete .     he asked .      recording complete .  decoding routines in place  descrambler active .      the chairman sighed  gave the place a last look .      transfer all relevant data to hard copy and disassemble construct .      bit by bit  maui disappeared .  the chairman did not stay for the end of the destruction .
