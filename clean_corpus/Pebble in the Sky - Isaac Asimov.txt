schwartz strolled along the pleasant streets of suburban chicago quoting browning to himself .   in a sense this was strange  since schwartz would scarcely have impressed any casual passer by as the browning quoting type .  he looked exactly what he was  a retired tailor  thoroughly lacking in what the sophisticates of today call a    formal education .     yet he had expended much of an inquisitive nature upon random reading .  by the sheer force of indiscriminate voracity  he had gleaned a smattering of practically everything  and by means of a trick memory had managed to keep it all straight .   for instance  he had read robert browning   s rabbi ben ezra twice when he was younger  so  of course  knew it by heart .  most of it was obscure to him  but those first three lines had become one with the beating of his heart these last few years .  he intoned them to himself  deep within the silent fortress of his mind  that very sunny and very bright early summer day of             grow old along with me .   the best is yet to be   the last of life  for which the first was made .  .  .        schwartz felt that to its fullness .  after the struggles of youth in europe and those of his early manhood in the united states  the serenity of a comfortable old age was pleasant .  with a house of his own and money of his own  he could  and did  retire .  with a wife in good health  two daughters safely married  a grandson to soothe these last best years  what had he to worry about .   there was the atom bomb  of course  and this somewhat lascivious talk about world war iii  but schwartz was a believer in the goodness of human nature .  he didn   t think there would be another war .  he didn   t think earth would ever see again the sunlike hell of an atom exploded in anger .  so he smiled tolerantly at the children he passed and silently wished them a speedy and not too difficult ride through youth to the peace of the best that was yet to be .   he lifted his foot to step over a raggedy ann doll smiling through its neglect as it lay there in the middle of the walk  a foundling not yet missed .  he had not quite put his foot down again .  .  .     in another part of chicago stood the institute for nuclear research  in which men may have had theories upon the essential worth of human nature but were half ashamed of them  since no quantitative instrument had yet been designed to measure it .  when they thought about it  it was often enough to wish that some stroke from heaven would prevent human nature  and damned human ingenuity  from turning every innocent and interesting discovery into a deadly weapon .   yet  in a pinch  the same man who could not find it in his conscience to curb his curiosity into the nuclear studies that might someday kill half of earth would risk his life to save that of an unimportant fellow man .   it was the blue glow behind the chemist   s back that first attracted the attention of dr .  smith .   he peered at it as he passed the half open door .  the chemist  a cheerful youngster  was whistling as he tipped up a volumetric flask  in which the solution had already been made up to volume .  a white powder tumbled lazily through the liquid  dissolving in its own good time .  for a moment that was all  and then dr .  smith   s instinct  which had stopped him in the first place  stirred him to action .   he dashed inside  snatched up a yardstick  and swept the contents of the desk top to the floor .  there was the deadly hiss of molten metal .  dr .  smith felt a drop of perspiration slip to the end of his nose .   the youngster stared blankly at the concrete floor along which the silvery metal had already frozen in thin splash marks .  they still radiated heat strongly .   he said faintly     what happened .     dr .  smith shrugged .  he wasn   t quite himself either .     i don   t know .  you tell me .  .  .  . what   s been doing here .         nothing   s been doing here     the chemist yammered .     that was just a sample of crude uranium .  i   m making an electrolytic copper determination .  .  .  . i don   t know what could have happened .         whatever happened  young man  i can tell you what i saw .  that platinum crucible was showing a corona .  heavy radiation was taking place .  uranium  you say .         yes  but crude uranium  and that isn   t dangerous .  i mean  extreme purity is one of the most important qualifications for fission  isn   t it .     he touched his tongue to his lips quickly .     do you think it was fission  sir .  it   s not plutonium  and it wasn   t being bombarded .         and     said dr .  smith thoughtfully     it was below the critical mass .  or  at least  below the critical masses we think we know .     he stared at the soapstone desk  at the bummed and blistered paint of the cabinets and the silvery streaks along the concrete floor .     yet uranium melts at about      degrees centigrade  and nuclear phenomena are not so well known that we can afford to talk too glibly .  after all  this place must be fairly saturated with stray radiations .  when the metal cools  young man  it had better be chipped up  collected  and thoroughly analyzed .      he gazed thoughtfully about him  then stepped to the opposite wall and felt uneasily at a spot about shoulder height .      what   s this .     he said to the chemist .     has this always been here .         what  sir .     the young man stepped up nervously and glanced at the spot the older man indicated .  it was a tiny hole  one that might have been made by a thin nail driven into the wall and withdrawn  but driven through plaster and brick for the full thickness of the building   s wall  since daylight could be seen through it .   the chemist shook his head     i never saw that before .  but i never looked for it  either  sir .      dr .  smith said nothing .  he stepped back slowly and passed the thermostat  a parallelopiped of a box made out of thin sheet iron .  the water in it moved swirlingly as the stirrer turned in motor driven monomania  while the electric bulbs beneath the water  serving as heaters  flicked on and off distractingly  in time with the clicking of the mercury relay .      well  then  was this here .     and dr .  smith scraped gently with his fingernail at a spot near the top of the wide side of the thermostat .  it was a neat  tiny circle drilled through the metal .  the water did not quite reach it .   the chemist   s eyes widened .     no  sir  that wasn   t there ever before .  i   ll guarantee that .         hmm .  is there one on the other side .         well  i   ll be damned .  i mean  yes  sir .         all right  come round here and sight through the holes .  .  .  . shut the thermostat off  please .  now stay there .     he placed his finger on the hole in the wall .     what do you see .     he called out .      i see your finger  sir .  is that where the hole is .      dr .  smith did not answer .  he said  with a calmness he was far from feeling     sight through in the other direction .  .  .  .  now what do you see .         nothing now .         but that   s the place where the crucible with the uranium was standing .  you   re looking at the exact place  aren   t you .      reluctantly     i think so  sir .      dr .  smith said frostily  with a quick glance at the name plate on the still open door     mr .  jennings  this is absolutely top secret .  i don   t want you ever to speak about this to anyone .  do you understand .         absolutely  sir .         then let   s get out of here .  we   ll send in the radiation men to check the place  and you and i will spend a siege in the infirmary .         radiation burns  you mean .     the chemist paled .      we   ll find out .      but there were no serious signs of radiation burns in either .  blood counts were normal and a study of the hair roots revealed nothing .  the nausea that developed was eventually tabbed as psychosomatic and no other symptoms appeared .   nor  in all the institute  was anyone found  either then or in the future  to explain why a crucible of crude uranium  well below critical size  and under no direct neutronic bombardment  should suddenly melt and radiate that deadly and significant corona .   the only conclusion was that nuclear physics had queer and dangerous crannies left in it .   yet dr .  smith never brought himself to tell all the truth in the report he eventually prepared .  he made no mention of the holes in the laboratory  no mention of the fact that the one nearest the spot where the crucible had been was barely visible  the one on the other side of the thermostat was a trace larger  while the one in the wall  three times as far away from that fearful spot  could have had a nail thrust through it .   a beam expanding in a straight line could travel several miles before the earth   s curvature made the surface fall away from it sufficiently to prevent further damage  and then it would be ten feet across .  after that  flashing emptily into space  expanding and weakening  a queer strain in the fabric of the cosmos .   he never told anyone of that fancy .   he never told anyone that he called for the morning papers next day  while still in the infirmary  and searched the columns with a definite purpose in mind .   but so many people in a giant metropolis disappear every day .  and nobody had gone screaming to the police with vague tales of how  before his eyes  a man  or would it be half a man .   had disappeared .  at least no such case was reported .   dr .  smith forced forgetfulness  eventually .     to joseph schwartz it had happened between one step and the next .  he had lifted his right foot to clear the raggedy ann doll and for a moment he had felt dizzy  as though for the merest trifle of time a whirlwind had lifted him and turned him inside out .  when he placed his right foot down again  all the breath went out of him in a gasp and he felt himself slowly crumple and slide down to the grass .   he waited a long time with his eyes closed  and then he opened them .   it was true .  he was sitting on grass  where previously he had been walking on concrete .   the houses were gone  the white houses  each with its lawn  squatting there  row on row  all goner  and it was not a lawn he was sitting on  for the grass was growing rank  untended  and there were trees about  many of them  with more on the horizon .   that was when the worst shock of all came  because the leaves on those trees were ruddy  some of them  and in the curve of his hand he felt the dry brittleness of a dead leaf .  he was a city man  but he knew autumn when he saw it .   autumn .  yet when he had lifted his right foot it had been a june day  with everything a fresh and glistening green .   he looked toward his feet automatically as he thought that and  with a sharp cry  reached toward them .  .  .  . the little cloth doll that he had stepped over  a little breath of reality  a    well  no .  he turned it over in his trembling hands  and it was not whole .  yet it was not mangled  it was sliced .  now wasn   t that queer .  sliced lengthwise very neatly  so that the waste yarn stuffing wasn   t stirred a hair .  it lay there in interrupted threads  ending flatly .   the glitter on his left shoe caught schwartz   s eye .  still clutching the doll  he forced his foot over his raised knee .  the extreme tip of the sole  the part that extended forward past the uppers  was smoothly sliced off .  sliced off as no earthly knife in the hand of an earthly cobbler could have duplicated .  the fresh surface gleamed almost liquidly in its unbelievable smoothness .   schwartz   s confusion had reached up from his spinal cord and touched the cerebrum  where it finally froze him with horror .   at last  because even the sound of his own voice was a soothing element in a world otherwise completely mad  he spoke aloud .  the voice he heard was low and tense and panting .   he said     in the first place  i   m not crazy .  i feel inside just the way i   ve always felt .  .  .  . of course  if maybe i were crazy  i wouldn   t know it  or would i .  no      inside  he felt the hysteria rise and forced it down .     there must be something else possible .      he considered      a dream  maybe .  how can i tell if it   s a dream or not .     he pinched himself and felt the nip  but shook his head .     i can always dream i feel a pinch .  that   s no proof .      he looked about him despairingly .  could dreams be so clear  so detailed  so lasting .  he had read once that most dreams last not more than five seconds  that they are induced by trifling disturbances to the sleeper  that the apparent length of the dreams is an illusion .   cold comfort .  he shifted the cuff of his shirt upward and stared at his wrist watch .  the second hand turned and turned and turned .  if it were a dream  the five seconds was going to stretch madly .   he looked away and wiped futilely at the cold dampness of his forehead .     what about amnesia .      he did not answer himself  but slowly buried his head in both hands .   if he had lifted his foot and  as he did so  his mind had slipped the well worn and well oiled tracks it had followed so faithfully for so long .  .  . if three months later  in the autumn  or a year and three months later  or ten years and three months later  he had put his foot down in this strange place  just as his mind returned .  .  . why  it would seem a single step  and all this .  .  . then where had he been and what had he done in the interval .      no .     the word came out in a loud cry .  that couldn   t be .  schwartz looked at his shirt .  it was the one he had put on that morning  or what should have been that morning  and it was a fresh shirt .  he bethought himself  plunged a fist  into his jacket pocket  and brought out an apple .   he bit into it wildly .  it was fresh and still had a lingering coolness from the refrigerator which had held it two hours earlier  or what should have been two hours .   and the little rag doll  what about that .   he felt himself beginning to go wild .  it had to be a dream .  or he really was insane .   it struck him that the time of day had changed .  it was late afternoon  or at least the shadows were lengthening .  the quiet desolation of the place flooded down upon him suddenly and freezingly .   he lurched to his feet .  obviously he would have to find people  any people .  and  as obviously  he would have to find a house  and the best way to do that would be to find a road .   automatically he turned in the direction in which the trees seemed thinnest  and walked .   the slight chill of evening was creeping inside his jacket and the tops of the trees were becoming dim and forbidding when he came upon that straight and impersonal streak of macadam .  he lunged toward it with sobbing gratitude and loved the feel of the hardness beneath his feet .   but along either direction was absolute emptiness  and for a moment he felt the cold clutch again .  he had hoped for cars .  it would have been the easiest thing to wave them down and say  he said it aloud in his eagerness     going toward chicago  maybe .      what if he was nowhere near chicago .  well  any large city  anyplace he could reach a telephone line .  he had only four dollars and twenty seven cents in his pocket  but there was always the police .  .  .   he was walking along the highway  walking along the middle  watching in both directions .  the setting of the sun made no impression upon him  or the fact that the first stars were coming out .   no cars .  nothing    and it was getting to be really dark .   he thought that first dizziness might be coming back  because the horizon at his left glimmered .  through the gaps in the trees there was a cold blue shine .  it was not the leaping red he imagined a forest fire would be like  but a faint and creeping glow .  and the macadam beneath his feet seemed to sparkle ever so faintly .  he bent down to touch it  and it felt normal .  but there was that tiny glimmer that caught the edges of his eyes .   he found himself running wildly along the highway  his shoes thudding in blunt and uneven rhythm .  he was conscious of the damaged doll in his hand and he tossed it wildly over his head .   leering  mocking remnant of life .  .  .  and then he stopped in a panic .  whatever it was  it was a proof of his sanity .  and he needed it .  so he felt about in the darkness  crawling on his knees tin he found it  a dark patch on the ultra faint glow .  the stuffing was plumping out and  absently  he forced it back .   he was walking again  too miserable to run  he told himself .   he was getting hungry and really  really frightened when he saw that spark to the right .   it was a house  of course .   he shouted wildly and no one answered  but it was a house  a spark of reality blinking at him through the horrible  nameless wilderness of the last hours .  he turned off the road and went plunging cross country  across ditches  around trees  through the underbrush  and over a creek .   queer thing .  even the creek glowed faintly  phosphorescently .  but it was only the tiniest fragment of his mind that noted it .   then he was there  with his hands reaching out to touch the hard white structure .  it was neither brick nor stone nor wood  but he never paid that the least mind .  it looked like a dun  strong porcelain  but he didn   t give a hoot .  he was just looking for a door  and when he came to it and saw no bell  he kicked at it and yelled like a demon .   he heard the stirring inside and the blessed  lovely sound of a human voice other than his own .  he yelled again .      hey  in there .      there was a faint  oiled whir  and the door opened .  a woman emerged  a spark of alarm in her eyes .  she was tan and wiry  and behind her was the gaunt figure of a hard faced man in work clothes .  .  .  . no  not work clothes .  actually they were like nothing schwartz had ever seen  but  in some indefinable way  they looked like the kind of clothes men worked in .   but schwartz was not analytical .  to him they  and their clothes  were beautiful  beautiful only as the sight of friends to a man alone can be beautiful .   the woman spoke and her voice was liquid  but peremptory  and schwartz reached for the door to keep himself upright .  his lips moved  uselessly  and  in a rush  all the clammiest fears he had known returned to choke his windpipe and stifle his heart .   for the woman spoke in no language schwartz had ever heard .           the disposal of a stranger     loa maren and her stolid husband  arbin  played cards in the cool of the same evening  while the older man in the motor driven wheel chair in the corner rustled his newspaper angrily and caned      arbin .      arbin maren did not answer at once .  he fingered the thin  smooth rectangles carefully as he considered the next play .  then  as he slowly made his decision  he responded with an absent     what do you want  grew .      the grizzled grew regarded his son in law fiercely over the top of the paper and rustled it again .  he found noise of that sort a great relief to his feelings .  when a man teems with energy and finds himself spiked to a wheel chair with two dead sticks for legs  there must be something  by space  he can do to express himself .  grew used his newspaper .  he rustled it  he gestured with it  when necessary  he swatted at things with it .   elsewhere than on earth  grew knew  they had telenews machines that issued rolls of microfilm as servings of current news .  standard book viewers were used for them .  but grew sneered silently at that .  an effete and degenerate custom .   grew said     did you read about the archaeological expedition they   re sending to earth .         no  i haven   t     said arbin calmly .   grew knew that  since nobody but himself had seen the paper yet  and the family had given up their video last year .  but then his remark had simply been in the nature of an opening gambit  anyway .   he said     well  there   s one coming .  and on an imperial grant  too  and how do you like that .     he began reciting in the queer unevenness of tone that most people somehow assume automatically when reading aloud         bel arvardan  senior research associate at the imperial archaeological institute  in an interview granted the galactic press  spoke hopefully of the expected valuable results of archaeological studies which are being projected upon the planet earth  located on the outskirts of the sirius sector  see map  .     earth     he said     with its archaic civilization and its unique environment  offers a freak culture which has been too long neglected by our social scientists  except as a difficult exercise in local government .  i have every expectation that the next year or two will bring about revolutionary changes in some of our supposed fundamental concepts of social evolution and human history .     and so on and so on     he finished with a flourish .   arbin maren had been listening with only half an ear .  he mumbled     what does he mean     freak culture    .      loa maren hadn   t been listening at all .  she simply said .     it   s your play  arbin .      grew went on     well  aren   t you going to ask me why the tribune printed it .  you know they wouldn   t print a galactic press release for a million imperial credits without a good reason .      he waited uselessly for an answer  then said     because they have an editorial on it .  a full page editorial that blasts the living daylights out of this guy arvardan .  here   s a fellow wants to come here for scientific purposes and they   re choking themselves purple to keep him out .  look at this piece of rabble rousing .  look at it .     he shook the paper at them .     read it  why don   t you .      loa maren put down her cards and clamped her thin lips firmly together .     father     she said     we   ve had a hard day  so let   s not have politics just now .  later  maybe  eh .  please  father .      grew scowled and mimicked         please  father .  please  father .     it appears to me you must be getting pretty tired of your old father when you begrudge him a few quiet words on current events .  i   m in your way  i suppose  sitting here in the comer and letting you two work for three .  .  .  . whose fault is it .  i   m strong .  i   m willing to work .  and you know i could get my legs treated and be as well as ever .     he slapped them as he spoke  hard .  savage  ringing slaps  which he heard but did not feel .     the only reason i can   t is because i   m getting too old to make a cure worth their while .  don   t you can that a    freak culture    .  what else could you can a world where a man can work but they won   t let him .  by space  i think it   s about time we stopped this nonsense about our so called    peculiar institutions .     they   re not just peculiar  they   re cracked .  i think       he was waving his arms and angry blood was reddening his face .   but arbin had risen from his chair  and his grip was strong on the older man   s shoulder .  he said     now where   s the call to be upset  grew .  when you   re through with the paper  i   ll read the editorial .         sure  but you   ll agree with them  so what   s the use .  you young ones are a bunch of milksops  just sponge rubber in the hands of the ancients .      and loa said sharply     quiet  father .  don   t start that .     she sat there listening for a moment .  she could not have said exactly what for  but .  .  .   arbin felt that cold little prickle that always came when the society of ancients was mentioned .  it just wasn   t safe to talk as grew did  to mock earth   s ancient culture  to  to    why  it was rank assimilationism .  he swallowed earnestly  the word was an ugly one  even when confined to thought .   of course in grew   s youth there had been much of this foolish talk of abandoning the old ways  but these were different times .  grew should know that  and he probably did  except that it wasn   t easy to be reasonable and sensible when you were in a wheel chair prison  just waiting away your days for the next census .   grew was perhaps the least affected  but he said no more .  and as the moments passed he grew quieter and the print became progressively more difficult to place in focus .  he had not yet had time to give the sports pages a detailed and critical perusal when his nodding head lolled slowly down upon his chest .  he snored softly  and the paper fell from his fingers with a final  unintentional rustle .   then loa spoke  in a worried whisper .     maybe we   re not being kind to him  arbin .  it   s a hard life for a man like father .  it   s like being dead compared to the life he used to lead .         nothing   s like being dead  loa .  he has his papers and his books .  let him be .  a bit of excitement like this peps him up .  he   ll be happy and quiet for days now .      arbin was beginning to consider his cards again  and as he reached for one the pounding at the door sounded  with hoarse yells that didn   t quite coalesce into words .   arbin   s hand lurched and stopped .  loa   s eyes grew fearful  she stared at her husband with a trembling lower lip .   arbin said     get grew out of here .  quickly .      loa was at the wheel chair as he spoke .  she made soothing sounds with her tongue .   but the sleeping figure gasped  startled awake at the first motion of the chair .  he straightened and groped automatically for his paper .      what   s the matter .     he demanded irritably  and by no means in a whisper .      shh .  it   s all right     muttered loa vaguely  and wheeled the chair into the next room .  she closed the door and placed her back against it  thin chest heaving as her eyes sought those of her husband .  there was that pounding again .   they stood close to each other as the door opened  almost defensively so  and hostility peeped from them as they faced the short  plump man who smiled faintly at them .   loa said     is there anything we can do for you .     with a ceremonial courtesy  then jumped back as the man gasped and put out a hand to stop himself from falling .      is he sick .     asked arbin bewilderedly .     here  help me take him inside .      the hours after that passed  and in the quiet of their bedroom loa and arbin prepared slowly for bed .      arbin     said loa .      what is it .         is it safe .         safe .     he seemed to avoid her meaning deliberately .      i mean  taking this man into the house .  who is he .         how should i know .     was the irritated response .     but  after an  we can   t refuse shelter to a sick man .  tomorrow  if he lacks identification  we   ll inform the regional security board  and that will be the end of it .     he turned away in an obvious attempt at breaking off the conversation .   but his wife broke the returning silence  her thin voice more urgent .     you don   t think he might be an agent of the society of ancients  do you .  there   s grew  you know .         you mean because of what he said tonight .  that   s past the limit of reason .  i won   t argue about it .         i don   t mean that  and you know it .  i mean that we   ve been keeping grew illegally now for two years  and you know we   re breaking just about the most serious custom .      arbin muttered     we   re harming no one .  we   re fining our quota  aren   t we  even though it   s set for three people  three workers .  and if we are  why should they suspect anything .  we don   t even let him out of the house .         they might trace the wheel chair .  you had to buy the motor and fittings outside .         now don   t start that again  loa .  i   ve explained many times that i   ve bought nothing but standard kitchen equipment for that chair .  besides  it does not make any sense at all to consider him an agent of the brotherhood .  do you suppose that they would go through such an elaborate trickery for the sake of a poor old man in a wheel chair .  couldn   t they enter by daylight and with legal search warrants .  please  reason this thing out .         well  then  arbin     her eyes were suddenly bright and eager     if you really think so  and i   ve been so hoping you would  he must be an outsider .  he can   t be an earthman .         what do you mean  he can   t be .  that   s more ridiculous still .  why should a man of the empire come here to earth  of all places .         i don   t know why .  yes  i do  maybe he   s committed a crime out there .     she was caught up instantly in her own fancy .     why not .  it makes sense .  earth would be the natural place to come to .  who would ever think of looking for him here .         if he   s an outsider .  what evidence do you have for that .         he doesn   t speak the language  does he .  you   ll have to grant me that .  could you understand a single word .  so he must come from some far off corner of the galaxy where the dialect is strange .  they say the men of fomalhaut have to learn practically a new language to be understood at the emperor   s court on trantor .  .  .  . but don   t you see what all this can mean .  if he   s a stranger on earth  he will have no registration with the census board  and he will be only too glad to avoid reporting to them .  we can use him on the farm  in the place of father  and it will be three people again  not two  who will have to meet the quota for three this next season .  .  .  . he could even help with the harvest now .      she looked anxiously at the uncertain face of her husband  who considered long  then said     well  go to bed  loa .  we   ll speak further in the common sense of daylight .      the whispering ended  the light was put out  and eventually sleep filled the room and the house .   the next morning it was grew   s turn to consider the matter .  arbin put the question to him hopefully .  he felt a confidence in his father in law that he could not muster in himself .   grew said     your troubles  arbin  obviously arise from the fact that i am registered as a worker  so that the produce quota is set at three .  i   m tired of creating trouble .  this is the second year i have lived past my time .  it is enough .      arbin was embarrassed .  .  . now that wasn   t the point at an .  i   m not hinting that you   re a trouble to us .         well  after an  what   s the difference .  in two years there will be the census  and i will go anyway .         at least you will have two more years of your books and your rest .  why should you be deprived of that .         because others are .  and what of you and loa .  when they come to take me  they will take you two as well .  what kind of a man would i be to live a few stinking  years at the expense          stop it  grew .  i don   t want histrionics .  we   ve told you many times what we   re going to do .  we   ll report you a week before the census .          and fool the doctor  i suppose .         we   ll bribe the doctor .         hmp .  and this new man  he   ll double the offense .  you   ll be concealing him too .         we   ll turn him loose .  for space   s sake  why bother about this now .  we have two years .  what shall we do with him .         a stranger     mused grew .     he comes knocking at the door .  he   s from nowhere .  he speaks unintelligibly .  .  .  . i don   t know what to advise .      the farmer said     he is mild mannered  seems frightened to death .  he can   t do us any harm .         frightened  eh .  what if he   s feeble minded .  what if his babbling isn   t a foreign dialect at an  but just insane mouthing .         that doesn   t sound likely .     but arbin stirred uneasily .      you tell yourself that because you want to use him .  .  .  .  all right  i   ll tell you what to do .  take him into town .         to chica .     arbin was horrified .     that would be ruin .         not at all     said grew calmly .     the trouble with you is that you don   t read the newspapers .  fortunately for this family  i do .  it so happens that the institute for nuclear research has developed an instrument that is supposed to make it easier for people to learn .  there was a full page spread in the week end supplement .  and they want volunteers .  take this man .  let him be a volunteer .      arbin shook his head firmly .     you   re mad .  i couldn   t do anything like that  grew .  they   ll ask for his registration number first thing .  it   s only inviting investigation to have things in improper order  and then they   ll find out about you .         no  they won   t .  it so happens you   re all wrong  arbin .  the reason the institute wants volunteers is that the machine is still experimental .  it   s probably killed a few people  so i   m sure they won   t ask questions .  and if the stranger dies  he   ll probably be no worse off than he is now .  .  .  . here  arbin  hand me the book projector and set the mark at reel six .  and bring me the paper as soon as it comes  will you .        when schwartz opened his eyes  it was past noon .  he felt that dun  heart choking pain that feeds on itself  the pain of a wife no longer by his side at waking  of a familiar world lost .  .  .   once before he had felt such a pain  and that momentary flash of memory came  lighting up a forgotten scene into sharp brilliance .  there was himself  a youngster  in the snow of the wintry village .  .  . with the sleigh waiting .  .  . at the end of whose journey would be the train .  .  . and  after that  the great ship .  .  .   the longing  frustrating fear for the world of the familiar united him for the moment with that twenty year old who had emigrated to america .   the frustration was too real .  this could not be a dream .   he jumped up as the light above the door blinked on and off and the meaningless baritone of his host sounded .  then the door opened and there was breakfast  a mealy porridge that he did not recognize but which tasted faintly like corn mush  with a savory difference  and milk .   he said     thanks     and nodded his head vigorously .   the farmer said something in return and picked up schwartz   s shirt from where it hung on the back of the chair .  he inspected it carefully from an directions  paying particular attention to the buttons .  then  replacing it  he flung open the sliding door of a closet  and for the first time schwartz became visually aware of the warm milkiness of the walls .      plastic     he muttered to himself  using that all inclusive word with the finality laymen always do .  he noted further that there were no corners or angles in the room  all planes fading into each other at a gentle curve .   but the other was holding objects out toward him and was making gestures that could not be mistaken .  schwartz obviously was to wash and dress .   with help and directions  he obeyed .  except that he found nothing with which to shave  nor could gestures to his chin elicit anything but an incomprehensible sound accompanied by a look of distinct revulsion on the part of the other .  schwartz scratched at his gray stubble and sighed windily .   and then he was led to a small  elongated  biwheeled car  into which he was ordered by gestures .  the ground sped beneath them and the empty road moved backward on either side  until low  sparkling white buildings rose before him  and there  far ahead  was the blue of water .   he pointed eagerly .     chicago .      it was the last gasp of hope within him  for certainly nothing he ever saw looked less like that city .   the farmer made no answer at all .   and the last hope died .           one world  or many .      bel arvardan  fresh from his interview with the press  on the occasion of his forthcoming expedition to earth  felt at supreme peace with all the hundred million star systems that composed the all embracing galactic empire .  it was no longer a question of being known in this sector or that .  let his theories concerning earth be proven and his reputation would be assured on every inhabited planet of the milky way  on every planet that man had set foot through the hundreds of thousands of years of expansion through space .   these potential heights of renown  these pure and rarefied intellectual peaks of science were coming to him early  yet not easily .  he was scarcely thirty five  but already his career had been packed with controversy .  it had begun with an explosion that had rocked the halls of the university of arcturus when he first graduated as senior archaeologist from that institution at the unprecedented age of twenty three .  the explosion  no less effective for being immaterial   consisted of the rejection for publication  on the part of the journal of the galactic archaeological society  of his senior dissertation .  it was the first time in the history of the university that a senior dissertation had been rejected .  it was equally the first time in the history of that staid professional journal that a rejection had been couched in such blunt terms .   to a non archaeologist  the reason for such anger against an obscure and dry little pamphlet  entitled on the antiquity of artifacts in the sirius sector with considerations of the application thereof to the radiation hypothesis of human origin  might seem mysterious .  what was involved  however  was that from the first arvardan adopted as his own the hypothesis advanced earlier by certain groups of mystics who were more concerned with metaphysics than with archaeology  i . e .   that humanity had originated upon some single planet and had radiated by degrees throughout the galaxy .  this was a favorite theory of the fantasy writers of the day  and the b  te noire of every respectable archaeologist of the empire .   but arvardan became a force to be reckoned with by even the most respectable  for within the decade he had become the recognized authority on the relics of the pre empire cultures still left in the eddies and quiet backwaters of the galaxy .   for instance  he had written a monograph on the mechanistic civilization of the rigel sector  where the development of robots created a separate culture that persisted for centuries  till the very perfection of the metal slaves reduced the human initiative to the point where the vigorous fleets of the war lord .  moray  took easy control .  orthodox archaeology insisted on the evolution of human types independently on various planets and used such atypical cultures  as that on rigel  as examples of race differences that had not yet been ironed out through intermarriage .  arvardan destroyed such concepts effectively by showing that rigellian robot culture was but a natural outgrowth of the economic and social forces of the times and of the region .   then there were the barbarous worlds of ophiuchus  which the orthodox had long upheld as samples of primitive humanity not yet advanced to the stage of interstellar travel .  every textbook used those worlds as the best evidence of the merger theory  i . e .   that humanity was the natural climax of evolution on any world based upon a water oxygen chemistry with proper intensities of temperature and gravitation  that each independent strain of humanity could intermarry  that with the discovery of interstellar travel  such intermarriage took place .   arvardan  however  uncovered traces of the early civilization that had preceded the then thousand year old barbarism of ophiuchus and proved that the earliest records of the planet showed traces of interstellar trade .  the final touch came when he demonstrated beyond any doubt that man had emigrated to the region in an already civilized state .   it was after that that the   .  gal .  arch .  soc .   to give the journal its professional abbreviation  decided to print arvardan   s senior dissertation more than ten years after it had been presented .   and now the pursuit of his pet theory led arvardan to probably the least significant planet of the empire  the planet called earth .     arvardan landed at that one spot of empire on all earth  that patch among the desolate heights of the plateaus north of the himalayas .  there where radioactivity was not  and never had been  there gleamed a palace that was not of terrestrial architecture .  in essence it was a copy of the viceregal palaces that existed on more fortunate worlds .  the soft lushness of the grounds was built for comfort .  the forbidding rocks had been covered with topsoil  watered  immersed in an artificial atmosphere and climate  and converted into five square miles of lawns and flower gardens .   the cost in energy involved in this performance was terrific by earthly calculations  but it had behind it the completely incredible resources of tens of millions of planets  continually growing in number .   it has been estimated that in the year of the galactic era     an average of fifty new planets each day were achieving the dignity of provincial status  this condition requiring the attainment of a population of five hundred millions .    in this spot of non earth lived the procurator of earth  and sometimes  in this artificial luxury  he could forget that he was a procurator of a rathole world and remember that he was an aristocrat of great honor and ancient family .   his wife was perhaps less often deluded  particularly at such times as  topping a grassy knoll  she could see in the distance the sharp  decisive line separating the grounds from the fierce wilderness of earth .  it was then that not all the colored fountains  luminescent at night  with an effect of cold liquid fire   flowered walks  or idyllic groves could compensate for the knowledge of their exile .   so perhaps arvardan was welcomed even more than protocol might call for .  to the procurator  after all  arvardan was a breath of empire  of spaciousness  of boundlessness .   and arvardan for his part found much to admire .   he said     this is done well  and with taste .  it is amazing how a touch of the central culture permeates the most outlying districts of our empire  lord ennius .      ennius smiled .     i   m afraid the procurator   s court here on earth is more pleasant to visit than to live in .  it is but a shell that rings hollowly when touched .  when you have considered myself and family  the staff  the imperial garrison  both here and in the important planetary centers  together with an occasional visitor such as yourself  you have exhausted all the touch of the central culture that exists .  it seems scarcely enough .      they sat in the colonnade in the dying afternoon  with the sun glinting downward toward the mist purpled jags of the horizon and the air so heavy with the scent of growing things that its motions were merely sighs of exertion .   it was  of course  not quite suitable for even a procurator to show too great a curiosity about the doings of a guest  but that does not take into account the inhumanity of day to day isolation from all the empire .   ennius said     do you plan to stay for some time  dr .  arvardan .         as to that  lord ennius  i cannot surely say .  i have come ahead of the rest of my expedition in order to acquaint myself with earth   s culture and to fulfill the necessary legal requirements .  for instance  i must obtain the usual official permission from you to establish camps at the necessary sites  and soon .         oh granted  granted .  but when do you start digging .  and whatever can you possibly expect to find on this miserable heap of rubble .         i hope  if all goes well  to be able to set up camp in a few months .  and as to this world  why  it   s anything but a miserable heap .  it is absolutely unique in the galaxy .         unique .     said the procurator stiffly .     not at all .  it is a very ordinary world .  it is more or less of a pigpen of a world  or a horrible hole of a world  or a cesspool of a world  or almost any other particularly derogative adjective you care to use .  and yet  with all its refinement of nausea  it cannot even achieve uniqueness in villainy  but remains an ordinary  brutish peasant world .         but     said arvardan  somewhat taken aback by the energy of the inconsistent statements thus thrown at him     the world is radioactive .         well  what of that .  some thousands of planets in the galaxy are radioactive  and some are considerably more so than earth .      it was at this moment that the soft gliding motion of the mobile cabinet attracted their attention .  it came to a halt within easy hand reach .   ennius gestured toward it and said to the other     what would you prefer .         i   m not particular .  a lime twist  perhaps .         that can be handled .  the cabinet will have the ingredients .  .  .  . with or without chensey .         just about a tang of it     said arvardan  and held up his forefinger and thumb  nearly touching .      you   ll have it in a minute .      somewhere in the bowels of the cabinet  perhaps the most universally popular mechanical offspring of human ingenuity  a bartender went into action  a non human bartender whose electronic soul mixed things not by jiggers but by atom counts  whose ratios were perfect every time  and who could not be matched by all the inspired artistry of anyone merely human .   the tall glasses appeared from nowhere  it seemed  as they waited in the appropriate recesses .   arvardan took the green one and  for a moment  felt the chill of it against his cheek .  then he placed the rim to his lips and tasted .      just right     he said .  he placed the glass in the well fitted holder in the arm of his chair and said     thousands of radioactive planets  procurator  just as you say  but only one of them is inhabited .  this one  procurator .         well     ennius smacked his lips over his own drink and seemed to lose some of his sharpness after contact with its velvet     perhaps it is unique in that way .  it   s an unenviable distinction .         but it is not just a question of statistical uniqueness .     arvardan spoke deliberately between occasional sips .     it goes further  it has tremendous potentialities .  biologists have shown  or claim to have shown  that on planets in which the intensity of radioactivity in the atmosphere and in the seas is above a certain point life will not develop .  .  .  . earth   s radioactivity is above that point by a considerable margin .         interesting .  i didn   t know that .  i imagine that this would constitute definite proof that earth life is fundamentally different from that of the rest of the galaxy .  .  .  . that should suit you  since you   re from sirius .     he seemed sardonically amused at this point and said in a confidential aside     do you know that the biggest single difficulty involved in ruling this planet lies in coping with the intense anti terrestrialism that exists throughout the entire sirius sector .  and the feeling is returned with interest on the part of these earthmen .  i   m not saying  of course  that anti terrestrialism doesn   t exist in more or less diluted form in many places in the galaxy  but not like on sirius .      arvardan   s response was impatient and vehement .     lord ennius  i reject the implication .  i have as little intolerance in me as any man living .  i believe in the oneness of humanity to my very scientific core  and that includes even earth .  and all life is fundamentally one  in that it is all based upon protein complexes in colloidal dispersion  which we call protoplasm .  the effect of radioactivity that i just talked of does not apply simply to some forms of human life  or to some forms of any life .  it applies to all life  since it is based upon the quantum mechanics of the protein molecules .  it applies to you  to me  to earthmen  to spiders  and to germs .      you see  proteins  as i probably needn   t tell you  are immensely complicated groupings of amino acids and certain other specialized compounds  arranged in intricate three dimensional patterns that are as unstable as sunbeams on a cloudy day .  it is this instability that is life  since it is forever changing its position in an effort to maintain its identity  in the manner of a long rod balanced on an acrobat   s nose .      but this marvelous chemical  this protein  must be first built up out of inorganic matter before life can exist .  so  at the very beginning  by the influence of the sun   s radiant energy upon those huge solutions we call oceans  organic molecules gradually increase in complexity from methane to formaldehyde and finally to sugars and starches in one direction  and from urea to amino acids and proteins in another direction .  it   s a matter of chance  of course  these combinations and disintegrations of atoms  and the process on one world may take millions of years while on another it may take only hundreds .  of course it is much more probable that it will take millions of years .  in fact  it is most probable that it will end up never happening .      now physical organic chemists have worked out with great exactness all the reaction chain involved  particularly the energetics thereof  that is  the energy relationships involved in each atom shift .  it is now known beyond the shadow of a doubt that several of the crucial steps in the building of life require the absence of radiant energy .  if this strikes you as queer  procurator  i can only say that photochemistry  the chemistry of reactions induced by radiant energy  is a well developed branch of the science  and there are innumerable cases of very simple reactions which will go in one of two different directions depending upon whether it takes place in the presence or absence of quanta of light energy .      in ordinary worlds the sun is the only source of radiant energy  or  at least  by far the major source .  in the shelter of clouds  or at night  the carbon and nitrogen compounds combine and recombine  in the fashions made possible by the absence of those little bits of energy hurled into the midst of them by the sun like bowling bans into the midst of an infinite number of infinitesimal tenpins .      but on radioactive worlds  sun or no sun  every drop of water  even in the deepest night  even five miles undersparkles and bursts with darting gamma rays  kicking up the carbon atoms  activating them  the chemists say  and forcing certain key reactions to proceed only in certain ways  ways that never result in life .      arvardan   s drink was gone .  he placed the empty glass on the waiting cabinet .  it was withdrawn instantly into the special compartment where it was cleaned  sterilized  and made ready for the next drink     another one .     asked ennius .      ask me after dinner     said arvardan .     i   ve had quite enough for now .      ennius tapped a tapering fingernail upon the arm of his chair and said     you make the process sound quite fascinating  but if an is as you say  then what about the life on earth .  how did it develop .         ah  you see  even you are beginning to wonder .  but the answer  i think  is simple .  radioactivity  in excess of the minimum required to prevent life  is still not necessarily sufficient to destroy life already formed .  it might modify it  but  except in comparatively huge excess  it will not destroy it .  .  .  . you see  the chemistry involved is different .  in the first case  simple molecules must be prevented from building up  while in the second  already formed complex molecules must be broken down .  not at all the same thing .         i don   t get the application of that at all     said ennius .      isn   t it obvious .  life on earth originated before the planet became radioactive .  my dear procurator  it is the only possible explanation that does not involve denying either the fact of life on earth or enough chemical theory to upset half the science .      ennius gazed at the other in amazed disbelief .     but you can   t mean that .         why not .         because how can a world become radioactive .  the life of the radioactive elements in the planet   s crust are in the millions and billions of years .  i   ve learned that  at least  during my university career  even in a pre law course .  they must have existed indefinitely in the past .         but there is such a thing as artificial radioactivity  lord ennius  even on a huge scale .  there are thousands of nuclear reactions of sufficient energy to create all sorts of radioactive isotopes .  why  if we were to suppose that human beings might use some applied nuclear reaction in industry  without proper controls  or even in war  if you can imagine anything like a war proceeding on a single planet  most of the topsoil could  conceivably  be converted into artificially radioactive materials .  what do you say to that .      the sun had expired in blood on the mountains  and ennius   s thin face was ruddy in the reflection of that process .  the gentle evening wind stirred  and the drowsy murmur of the carefully selected varieties of insect life upon the palace grounds was more soothing than ever .   ennius said     it sounds very artificial to me .  for one thing  i can   t conceive using nuclear reactions in war or letting them get out of control to this extent in any manner          naturally  sir  you tend to underestimate nuclear reactions because you   re living in the present  when they   re so easily controlled .  but what if someone  or some army  used such weapons before the defense had been worked out .  for instance  it   s like using fire bombs before anyone knew that water or sand would put out fire .         hmm     said ennius     you sound like shekt .         who   s shekt .     arvardan looked up quickly .      an earthman .  one of the few decent ones  i mean  one that a gentleman can speak to .  he   s a physicist .  he told me once that earth might not always have been radioactive .         ah .  .  .  . well  that   s not unusual  since the theory is certainly not original with me .  it   s part of the book of the ancients  which contains the traditional  or mythical  history of prehistoric earth .  i   m saying what it says  in a way  except that i   m putting its rather elliptical phraseology into equivalent scientific statements .         the book of the ancients .     ennius seemed surprised  and a little upset .     where did you get that .         here and there .  it wasn   t easy  and i only obtained parts .  of course all this traditional information about non radioactivity  even where completely unscientific  is important to my project .  .  .  . why do you ask .         because the book is the revered text of a radical sect of earthmen .  it is forbidden for outsiders to read it .  i wouldn   t broadcast the fact that you did  either  while you   re here .  non earthmen  or outsiders  as they call them  have been lynched for less .         you make it sound as if the imperial police power here is defective .         it is in cases of sacrilege .  a word to the wise  dr .  arvardan .      a melodious chime sounded a vibrant note that seemed to harmonize with the rustling whisper of the trees .  it faded out slowly  lingering as though in love with its surroundings .   ennius rose .     i believe it is time for dinner .  will you join me  sir  and enjoy such hospitality as this husk of empire on earth can afford .      an occasion for an elaborate dinner came infrequently enough .  an excuse  even a slim one  was not to be missed .  so the courses were many  the surroundings lavish  the men polished  and the women bewitching .  and  it must be added  dr .  b .  arvardan of baronn  sirius  was lionized to quite an intoxicating extent .   arvardan took advantage of his dinner audience during the latter portion of the banquet to repeat much of what he had said to ennius  but here his exposition met with markedly less success .   a florid gentleman in colonel   s uniform leaned toward him with that marked condescension of the military man for the scholar and said     if i interpret your expressions rightly  dr .  arvardan  you are trying to tell us that these hounds of earth represent an ancient race that may once have been the ancestors of all humanity .         i hesitate  colonel  to make the flat assertion  but i think there is an interesting chance that it might be so .  a year from now i confidently hope to be able to make a definite judgment .         if you find that they are  doctor  which i strongly doubt     rejoined the colonel     you will astonish me beyond measure .  i have been stationed on earth now for four years  and my experience is not of the smallest .  i find these earthmen to be rogues and knaves  every one of them .  they are definitely our inferiors intellectually .  they lack that spark that has spread humanity throughout the galaxy .  they are lazy  superstitious  avaricious  and with no trace of nobility of soul .  i defy you  or anyone  to show me an earthman who can in any way be an equal of any true man  yourself or myself  for instance  and only then will i grant you that he may represent a race who once were our ancestors .  but  until then  please excuse me from making any such assumption .      a portly man at the foot of the table said suddenly     they say the only good earthman is a dead earthman  and that even then they generally stink     and laughed immoderately .   arvardan frowned at the dish before him and said  without looking up     i have no desire to argue racial differences  especially since it is irrelevant in this case .  it is the earthman of prehistory that i speak of .  his descendants of today have been long isolated  and have been subjected to a most unusual environment  yet i still would not dismiss them too casually .      he turned to ennius and said     my lord  i believe you mentioned an earthman before dinner .         i did .  i don   t recall .         a physicist .  shekt .         oh yes .  yes .         affret shekt  perhaps .         why  yes .  have you heard of him .         i think i have .  it   s been bothering me all through dinner  ever since you mentioned him  but i think i   ve placed him .  he wouldn   t be at the institute of nuclear research at  oh  what   s the name of that damned place .     he struck at his forehead with the heel of his palm once or twice .      at chica .         you have the right person .  what about him .         only this .  there was an article by him in the august issue of physical reviews .  i noticed it because i was looking for anything that had to do with earth  and articles by earthmen in journals of galactic circulation are very rare .  .  .  . in any case  the point i am trying to make is that the man claims to have developed something he calls a synapsifier  which is supposed to improve the learning capacity of the mammalian nervous system .         really .     said ennius a bit too sharply .     i haven   t heard about it .         i can find you the reference .  it   s quite an interesting article  though  of course  i can   t pretend to understand the mathematics involved .  what he has done  however  has been to treat some indigenous animal form on earth  rats  i believe they call them  with the synapsifier and then put them to solving a maze .  you know what i mean  learning the proper pathway through a tiny labyrinth to some food supply .  he used non treated rats as controls and found that in every case the synapsified rats solved the maze in less than one third the time .  .  .  . do you see the significance  colonel .      the military man who had initiated the discussion said indifferently     no  doctor  i do not .         i   ll explain  then  that i firmly believe that any scientist capable of doing such work .  even an earthman  is certainly my intellectual equal  at least  and  if you   ll pardon my presumption  yours as well .      ennius interrupted .     pardon me  dr .  arvardan .  i would like to return to the synapsifier .  has shekt experimented with human beings .      arvardan laughed .     i doubt it  lord ennius .  nine tenths of his synapsified rats died during treatment .  he would scarcely dare use human subjects until much more progress has been made .      so ennius sank back into his chair with a slight frown on his forehead and  thereafter  neither spoke nor ate for the remainder of the dinner .   before midnight the procurator had quietly left the gathering and  with a bare word to his wife only  departed in his private cruiser on the two hour trip to the city of chica  with the slight frown still on his forehead and a raging anxiety in his heart .   thus it was that on the same afternoon that arbin maren brought joseph schwartz into chica for treatment with shekt   s synapsifier .  shekt himself had been closeted with none less than the procurator of earth for over an hour .           the royal road     arbin was uneasy in chica .  he felt surrounded .  somewhere in chica  one of the largest cities on earth  they said it had fifty thousand human beings in it  somewhere there were officials of the great outer empire .   to be sure  he had never seen a man of the galaxy  yet here  in chica  his neck was continually twisting in fear that he might .  if pinned down  he could not have explained how he would identify an outsider from an earthman  even if he were to see one  but it was in his very marrow to feel that there was  somehow  a difference .   he looked back over his shoulder as he entered the institute .  his biwheel was parked in an open area  with a six hour coupon holding a spot open for it .  was the extravagance itself suspicious .  .  .  . everything frightened him now .  the air was full of eyes and ears .   if only the strange man would remember to remain hidden in the bottom of the rear compartment .  he had nodded violently  but had he understood .  he was suddenly impatient with himself .  why had he let grew talk him into this madness .   and then somehow the door was open in front of him and a voice had broken in on his thoughts .   it said     what do you want .      it sounded impatient  perhaps it had already asked him that same thing several times .   he answered hoarsely  words choking out of his throat like dry powder     is this where a man can apply for the synapsifier .      the receptionist looked up sharply and said     sign here .      arbin put his hands behind his back and repeated huskily     where do i see about the synapsifier .     grew had told him the name  but the word came out queerly  like so much gibberish .   but the receptionist said  with iron in her voice     i can   t do anything for you unless you sign the register as a visitor .  it   s in the rules .      without a word  arbin turned to go .  the young woman behind the desk pressed her lips together and kicked the signal bar at the side of her chair violently .   arbin was fighting desperately for a lack of notoriety and failing miserably in his own mind .  this girl was looking hard at him .  she   d remember him a thousand years later .  he had a wild desire to run  run back to the car  back to the farm .  .  .   someone in a white lab coat was coming rapidly out of another room  and the receptionist was pointing to him .     volunteer for the synapsifier  miss shekt     she was saying .     he won   t give his name .      arbin looked up .  it was still another girl  young .  he looked disturbed .      are you in charge of the machine  miss .         no  not at all .     she smiled in a very friendly fashion  and arbin felt anxiety ebb slightly .      i can take you to him  though     she went on .  then  eagerly     do you really want to volunteer for the synapsifier .         i just want to see the man in charge     arbin said woodenly .      all right .     she seemed not at all disturbed by the rebuff .  she slipped back through the door from which she had come .  there was a short wait .  then  finally  there was the beckon of a finger .  .  .   he followed her  heart pounding  into a small anteroom .  she said gently     if you will wait about half an hour or less .  dr .  shekt will be with you .  he is very busy just now .  .  .  . if you would like some book films and a viewer to pass the time .  i   ll bring them to you .      but arbin shook his head .  the four walls of the small room closed about him  and held him rigid  it seemed .  was he trapped .  were the ancients coming for him .   it was the longest wait in arbin   s life .     lord ennius  procurator of earth  had experienced no comparable difficulties in seeing dr .  shekt  though he had experienced an almost comparable excitement .  in his fourth year as procurator  a visit to chica was still an event .  as the direct representative of the remote emperor  his social standing was  legalistically  upon a par with viceroys of huge galactic sectors that sprawled their gleaming volumes across hundreds of cubic parsecs of space  but  actually  his post was little short of exile .   trapped as he was in the sterile emptiness of the himalayas  among the equally sterile quarrels of a population that hated him and the empire he represented  even a trip to chica was escape .   to be sure  his escapes were short ones .  they had to be short  since here at chica it was necessary to wear lead impregnated clothes at all times  even while sleeping  and  what was worse  to dose oneself continually with metaboline .   he spoke bitterly of that to shekt .      metaboline     he said  holding up the vermilion pill for inspection     is perhaps a true symbol of all that your planet means to me  my friend .  its function is to heighten all metabolic processes while i sit here immersed in the radioactive cloud that surrounds me and which you are not even aware of .      he swallowed it .     there    now my heart will beat more quickly  my breath will pump a race of its own accord  and my liver will boil away in those chemical syntheses that  medical men tell me  make it the most important factory in the body .  and for that i pay with a siege of headaches and lassitude afterward .      dr .  shekt listened with some amusement .  he gave a strong impression of being nearsighted  did shekt  not because he wore glasses or was in any way afflicted  but merely because long habit had given him the unconscious trick of peering closely at things  of weighing all facts anxiously before saying anything .  he was tall and in his late middle age  his thin figure slightly stooped .   but he was well read in much of galactic culture  and he was relatively free of the trick of universal hostility and suspicion that made the average earthman so repulsive even to so cosmopolitan a man of the empire as ennius .   shekt said     i   m sure you don   t need the pill .  metaboline is just one of your superstitions  and you know it .  if i were to substitute sugar pills without your knowledge  you   d be none the worse .  what   s more  you would even psychosomaticize yourself into similar headaches afterward .         you say that in the comfort of your own environment .  do you deny that your basal metabolism is higher than mine .         of course i don   t  but what of it .  i know that it is a superstition of the empire  ennius  that we men of earth are different from other human beings  but that   s not really so in the essentials .  or are you coming here as a missionary of the anti terrestrians .      ennius groaned .     by the life of the emperor  your comrades of earth are themselves the best such missionaries .  living here  as they do  cooped up on their deadly planet  festering in their own anger  they   re nothing but a standing ulcer in the galaxy .      i   m serious  shekt .  what planet bas so much ritual in its daily life and adheres to it with such masochistic fury .  not a day passes but i receive delegations from one or another of your ruling bodies for the death penalty for some poor devil whose only crime has been to invade a forbidden area  to evade the sixty  or perhaps merely to eat more than his share of food .         ah  but you always grant the death penalty .  your idealistic distaste seems to stop short at resisting .         the stars are my witness that i struggle to deny the death .  but what can one do .  the emperor will have it that all the subdivisions of the empire are to remain undisturbed in their local customs  and that is right and wise  since it removes popular support from the fools who would otherwise kick up rebellion on alternate tuesdays and thursdays .  besides  were i to remain obdurate when your councils and senates and chambers insist on the death  such a shrieking would arise and such a wild howling and such denunciation of the empire and all its works that i would sooner sleep in the midst of a legion of devils for twenty years than face such an earth for ten minutes .      shekt sighed and rubbed the thin hair back upon his skull .     to the rest of the galaxy  if they are aware of us at all  earth is but a pebble in the sky .  to us it is home  and all the home we know .  yet we are no different from you of the outer worlds  merely more unfortunate .  we are crowded here on a world all but dead  immersed within a wall of radiation that imprisons us  surrounded by a huge galaxy that rejects us .  what can we do against the feeling of frustration that bums us .  would you  procurator  be willing that we send our surplus population abroad .      ennius shrugged .     would i care .  it is the outside populations themselves that would .  they don   t care to fall victim to terrestrial diseases .         terrestrial diseases .     shekt scowled .     it is a nonsensical notion that should be eradicated .  we are not carriers of death .  are you dead for having been among us .         to be sure     smiled ennius     i do everything to prevent undue contact .         it is because you yourself fear the propaganda created  after all  only by the stupidity of your own bigots .         why  shekt  no scientific basis at all to the theory that earthmen are themselves radioactive .         yes  certainly they are .  how could they avoid it .  so are you .  so is everyone on every one of the hundred million planets of the empire .  we are more so  i grant you  but scarcely enough to harm anyone .         but the average man of the galaxy believes the opposite  i am afraid  and is not desirous of finding out by experiment .  besides          besides  you   re going to say  we   re different .  we   re not human beings  because we mutate more rapidly  due to atomic radiation  and have therefore changed in many ways .  .  .  .  also not proven .         but believed .         and as long as it is so believed  procurator  and as long as we of earth are treated as pariahs  you are going to find in us the characteristics to which you object .  if you push us intolerably  is it to be wondered at that we push back .  hatina us as you do  can you complain that we hate in our turn .  no  no  we are far more the offended than the offending .      ennius was chagrined at the anger he had raised .  even the best of these earthmen  he thought  have the same blind spot  the same feeling of earth versus all the universe .   he said tactfully     shekt  forgive my boorishness  will you .  take my youth and boredom as excuse .  you see before you a poor man  a young fellow of forty  and forty is the age of a babe in the professional civil service  who is grinding out his apprenticeship here on earth .  it may be years before the fools in the bureau of the outer provinces remember me long enough to promote me to something less deadly .  so we are both prisoners of earth and both citizens of the great world of the mind in which there is distinction of neither planet nor physical characteristics .  give me your hand  then  and let us be friends .      the lines on shekt   s face smoothed out  or  more exactly  were replaced by others more indicative of good humor .  he laughed outright .     the words are the words of a suppliant  but the tone is still that of the imperial career diplomat .  you are a poor actor  procurator .         then counter me by being a good teacher  and tell me of this synapsifier of yours .      shekt started visibly and frowned .     what  you have heard of the instrument .  you are then a physicist as well as an administrator .         all knowledge is my province .  but seriously  shekt  i would really like to know .      the physicist peered closely at the other and seemed doubtful .  he rose and his gnarled hand lifted to his lip  which it pinched thoughtfully .     i scarcely know where to begin .         well  stars above  if you are considering at which point in the mathematical theory you are to begin  i   ll simplify your problem .  abandon them all .  i know nothing of your functions and tensors and what not .      shekt   s eyes twinkled .     well  then  to stick to descriptive matter only  it is simply a device intended to increase the learning capacity of a human being .         of a human being .  really .  and does it work .         i wish we knew .  much more work is necessary .  i   ll give you the essentials  procurator  and you can judge for yourself .  the nervous system in man  and in animals  is composed of neuroprotein material .  such material consists of huge molecules in very precarious electrical balance .  the slightest stimulus will upset one  which will right itself by upsetting the next  which will repeat the process  until the brain is reached .  the brain itself is an immense grouping of similar molecules which are connected among themselves in all possible ways .  since there are something like ten to the twentieth power  that is  a one with twenty zeros after it  such neuroproteins in the brain  the number of possible combinations are of the order of factorial ten to the twentieth power .  this is a number so large that if all the electrons and protons in the universe were made universes themselves  and all the electrons and protons in all of these new universes again made universes  then all the electrons and protons in all the universes so created would still be nothing in comparison .  .  .  . do you follow me .         not a word  thank the stars .  if i even attempted to  i should bark like a dog for sheer pain of the intellect .         hmp .  well  in any case  what we call nerve impulses are merely the progressive electronic unbalance that proceeds along the nerves to the brain and then from the brain back along the nerves .  do you get that .         yes .         well  blessings on you for a genius  then .  as long as this impulse continues along a nerve cell  it proceeds at a rapid rate  since the neuroproteins are practically in contact .  however  nerve cells are limited in extent  and between each nerve cell and the next is a very thin partition of non nervous tissue .  in other words  two adjoining nerve cells do not actually connect with each other .         ah     said ennius     and the nervous impulse must jump the barrier .         exactly .  the partition drops the strength of the impulse and slows the speed of its transmission according to the square of the width thereof .  this holds for the brain as well .  but imagine  now  if some means could be found to lower the dialectric constant of this partition between the cells .         that what constant .         the insulating strength of the partition .  that   s all i mean .  if that were decreased  the impulse would jump the gap more easily .  you would think faster and learn faster .         well  then  i come back to my original question .  does it work .         i have tried the instrument on animals .         and with what result .         why  that most die very quickly of denaturation of brain protein coagulation  in other words  like hard boiling an egg .      ennius winced .     there is something ineffably cruel about the cold bloodedness of science .  what about those that didn   t die .         not conclusive  since they   re not human beings .  the burden of the evidence seems to be favorable  for them .  .  .  . but i need humans .  you see  it is a matter of the natural electronic properties of the individual brain .  each brain gives rise to microcurrents of a certain type .  none are exactly duplicates .  they   re like fingerprints  or the blood vessel patterns of the retina .  if anything  they   re even more individual .  the treatment  i believe  must take that into account  and  if i am right  there will be no more denaturation .  .  .  . but i have no human beings on whom to experiment .  i ask for volunteers  but      he spread his hands .      i certainly don   t blame them  old man     said ennius .     but seriously  should the instrument be perfected  what do you intend doing with it .      the physicist shrugged .     that   s not for me to say .  it would be up to the grand council  of course .         you would not consider making the invention available to the empire .         i .  i have no objections at all .  but only the grand council has jurisdiction over          oh     said ennius with impatience     the devil with your grand council .  i have had dealings with them before .  would you be willing to talk to them at the proper time .         why  what influence could i possible have .         you might tell them that if earth could produce a synapsifier that would be applicable to human beings in complete safety  and if the device were made available to the galaxy  then some of the restrictions on emigration to other planets might be broken down .         what     said shekt sarcastically     and risk epidemics and our differentness and our non humanity .         you might     said ennius quietly     even be removed en masse to another planet .  consider it .     the door opened at this point and a young lady brushed her way in past the book film cabinet .  she destroyed the musty atmosphere of the cloistered study with an automatic breath of spring .  at the sight of a stranger she reddened slightly and turned .      come in  pola     called shekt hastily .     my lord     he said to ennius     i believe you have never met my daughter .  pola this is lord ennius  procurator of earth .      the procurator was on his feet with an easy gallantry that negated her first wild attempt at a curtsy .      my dear miss shekt     he said     you are an ornament i did not believe earth capable of producing .  you would  indeed  be an ornament on any world i can think of .      he took pola   s hand  which was quickly and somewhat bashfully extended to meet his gesture .  for a moment ennius made as if to kiss it  in the courtly fashion of the past generation  but the intention  if such it was  never came to fruition .  half lifted  the hand was released  a trace too quickly  perhaps .   pola  with the slightest of frowns  said     i   m overwhelmed at your kindness  my lord  to a simple girl of earth .  you are brave and gallant to dare infection as you do .      shekt cleared his throat and interrupted .     my daughter  procurator  is completing her studies at the university of chica and is obtaining some needed field credits by spending two days a week in my laboratory as a technician .  a competent girl  and though i say it with the pride of a father  she may someday sit in my place .         father     said pola gently     i have some important information for you .     she hesitated .      shall i leave .     said ennius quietly .      no  no     said shekt .     what is it  pola .      the girl said     we have a volunteer  father .      shekt stared  almost stupidly .     for the synapsifier .         so he says .         well     said ennius     i bring you good fortune  i see .         so it would seem .      shekt turned to his daughter .     tell him to wait .  take him to room c  and i   ll be with him soon .      he turned to ennius after pola left .     will you excuse me  procurator .         certainly .  how long does the operation take .         it   s a matter of hours  i   m afraid .  do you wish to watch .         i can imagine nothing more gruesome  my dear shekt .  i   ll be in the state house till tomorrow .  will you tell me the result .      shekt seemed relieved .     yes  certainly .         good .  .  .  . and think over what i said about your synapsifier .  your new royal road to knowledge .      ennius left  less at ease than when he had arrived  his knowledge no greater  his fears much increased .           the involuntary volunteer     once alone  dr .  shekt  quietly and cautiously  touched the summoner  and a young technician entered hurriedly  white robe sparkling  long brown hair carefully bound back .   dr .  shekt said     has pola told you          yes  dr .  shekt .  i   ve observed him through the visiplate  and he must undoubtedly be a legitimate volunteer .  he   s certainly not a subject sent in the usual manner .         ought i refer to the council  do you suppose .         i don   t know what to advise .  the council wouldn   t approve of any ordinary communication .  any beam can be tapped  you know .     then  eagerly     suppose i get rid of him .  i can tell him we need men under thirty .  the subject is easily thirty five .         no  no .  i   d better see him .     shekt   s mind was a cold whirl .  so far things had been most judiciously handled .  just enough information to lend a spurious frankness  but no more .  and now an actual volunteer  and immediately after ennius   s visit .  was there a connection .  shekt himself had but the vaguest knowledge of the giant misty forces that were now beginning to wrestle back and forth across the blasted face of earth .  but  in a way  he knew enough .  enough to feel himself at the mercy of them  and certainly more than any of the ancients suspected he knew .   yet what could he do  since his life was doubly in danger .   ten minutes later dr .  shekt was peering helplessly at the gnarled farmer standing before him  cap in hand  head half averted  as though attempting to avoid a too close scrutiny .  his age  thought shekt  was certainly under forty  but the hard life of the soil was no flatterer of men .  the man   s cheeks were reddened beneath the leathery brown  and there were distinct traces of perspiration at the hairline and the temples  though the room was cool .  the man   s hands were fumbling at each other .      now  my dear sir     said shekt kindly     i understand you refuse to give your name .      arbin   s was a blind stubbornness .     i was told no questions would be asked if you had a volunteer .         hmm .  well  is there anything at all you would like to say .  or do you just want to be treated immediately .         me .  here  now .     in sudden panic .     it   s not myself that   s the volunteer .  i didn   t say anything to give that impression .         no .  you mean someone else is the volunteer .         certainly .  what would i want          i understand .  is the subject  this other man  with you .         in a way     said arbin cautiously .      all right .  now  look  just tell us whatever you wish .  everything you say will be held in strict confidence  and we   ll help you in whatever way we can .  agreed .      the farmer ducked his head  as a sort of rudimentary gesture of respect .     thank you .  it   s like this  sir .  we have a man about the farm  a distant  uh  relative .  he helps  you understand       arbin swallowed with difficulty  and shekt nodded gravely .   arbin continued .     he   s a very willing worker and a very good worker  we had a son  you see  but he died  and my good woman and myself  you see  need the help  she   s not well  we could not get along without him  scarcely .     he felt that somehow the story was a complete mess .   but the gaunt scientist nodded at him .      and this relative of yours is the one you wish treated .         why  yes  i thought i had said that  but you   ll pardon me if this takes me some time .  you see  the poor fellow is not exactly right in his head .     he hurried on  furiously .     he is not sick  you understand .  he is not wrong so that he has to be put away .  he   s just slow .  he doesn   t talk  you see .         he can   t talk .     shekt seemed startled .      oh  he can .  it   s just that he doesn   t like to .  he doesn   t talk well .      the physicist looked dubious .      and you want the synapsifier to improve his mentality  eh .      slowly  arbin nodded .     if he knew a bit more  sir  why  he could do some of the work my wife can   t  you see .         he might die .  do you understand that .      arbin looked at him helplessly  and his fingers writhed furiously .   shekt said     i   d need his consent .      the farmer shook his head slowly  stubbornly .     he won   t understand .     then  urgently  almost beneath his breath     why  look  sir  i   m sure you   ll understand me .  you don   t look like a man who doesn   t know what a hard life is .  this man is getting old .  it   s not a question of the sixty  you see  but what if  in the next census  they think he   s a half wit and   and take him away .  we don   t like to lose him  and that   s why we bring him here .      the reason i   m trying to be secret like is that maybe  maybe     and arbin   s eyes swiveled involuntarily at the walls  as if to penetrate them by sheer will and detect the listeners that might be behind     well  maybe the ancients won   t like what i   m doing .  maybe trying to save an afflicted man can be judged as against the customs  but life is hard  sir .  .  .  . and it would be useful to you .  you have asked for volunteers .         i know .  where is your relative .      arbin took the chance .     out in my biwheel  if no one   s found him .  he wouldn   t be able to take care of himself if anyone has          well  we   ll hope he   s safe .  you and i will go out right now and bring the car around to our basement garage .  i   ll see to it that no one knows of his presence but ourselves and my helpers .  and i assure you that you won   t be in trouble with the brotherhood .      his arm dropped in friendly fashion to arbin   s shoulder  who grinned spasmodically .  to the farmer it was like a rope loosening from about his neck .     shekt looked down at the plump  balding figure upon the couch .  the patient was unconscious  breathing deeply and regularly .  he had spoken unintelligibly  had understood nothing .  yet there had been none of the physical stigmata of feeblemindedness .  reflexes had been in order  for an old man .   old .  hmm .   he looked across at arbin  who watched everything with a glance like a vise .      would you like us to take a bone analysis .         no     cried arbin .  then  more softly     i don   t want anything that might be identification .         it might help us  be safer  you know  if we knew his age     said shekt .      he   s fifty     said arbin shortly .   the physicist shrugged .  it didn   t matter .  again he looked at the sleeper .  when brought in  the subject had been  or certainly seemed  dejected  withdrawn  uncaring .  even the hypno pills had apparently aroused no suspicion .  they had been offered him  there had been a quick  spasmodic smile in response  and he had swallowed them .   the technician was already rolling in the last of the rather clumsy units which together made up the synapsifier .  at the touch of a push button the polarized glass in the windows of the operating room underwent molecular rearrangement and became opaque .  the only light was the white one that blazed its cold brilliance upon the patient suspended  as he was  in the multihundred kilowatt diamagnetic field some two inches above the operating table to which he was transferred .   arbin still sat in the dark there  understanding nothing  but determined in deadly fashion to prevent  somehow  by his presence  the harmful tricks he knew he had not the knowledge to prevent .   the physicists paid no attention to him .  the electrodes were adjusted to the patient   s skull .  it was a long job .  first there was the careful study of the skull formation by the ullster technique that revealed the winding  tight knit fissures .  grimly  shekt smiled to himself .  skull fissures weren   t an unalterable quantitative measure of age  but they were good enough in this case .  the man was older than the claimed fifty .   and then  after a while  he did not smile .  he frowned .  there was something wrong with the fissures .  they seemed odd  not quite .  .  .   for a moment he was ready to swear that the skull formation was a primitive one  a throwback  but then .  .  . well  the man was subnormal in mentality .  why not .   and suddenly he exclaimed in shock     why  i hadn   t noticed .  this man has hair on his face .     he turned to arbin .     has he always been bearded .         bearded .         hair on his face .  come here .  don   t you see it .         yes  sir .     arbin thought rapidly .  he had noticed it that morning and then had forgotten .     he was born like that     he said  and then weakened it by adding     i think .         well  let   s remove it .  you don   t want him going around like a brute beast  do you .         no  sir .      the hair came off smoothly at the application of a depilatory salve by the carefully gloved technician .   the technician said     he has hair on his chest too  dr .  shekt .         great galaxy     said shekt     let me see .  why  the man is a rug .  well  let it be .  it won   t show with a shirt  and i want to get on with the electrodes .  let   s have wires here and here  and here .     tiny pricks and the insertion of the platinum hair lets .     here and here .      a dozen connections  probing through skin to the fissures  through the tightness of which could be felt the delicate shadow echoes of the microcurrents that surged from cell to cell in the brain .   carefully they watched the delicate ammeters stir and leap  as the connections were made and broken .  the tiny needlepoint recorders traced their delicate spider webs across the graphed paper in irregular peaks and troughs .   then the graphs were removed and placed on the illuminated opal glass .  they bent low over it  whispering .   arbin caught disjointed flashes  remarkably regular  .  .  . look at the height of the quinternary peak .  .  . think it ought to be analyzed .  .  . clear enough to the eye .  .  .      and then  for what seemed a long time  there was a tedious adjustment of the synapsifier .  knobs were turned  eyes on vernier adjustments  then clamped and their readings recorded .  over and over again the various electrometers were checked and new adjustments were made necessary .   then shekt smiled at arbin and said     it will all be over very soon .      the large machinery was advanced upon the sleeper like a slow moving and hungry monster .  four long wires were dangled to the extremities of his limbs  and a dull black pad of something that looked like hard rubber was carefully adjusted at the back of his neck and held firmly in place by clamps that fitted over the shoulders .  finally  like two giant mandibles  the opposing electrodes were parted and brought downward over the pale  pudgy head  so that each pointed at a temple .   shekt kept his eyes firmly on the chronometer  in his other hand was the switch .  his thumb moved  nothing visible happened  not even to the fear sharpened sense of the watching arbin .  after what might have been hours  but was actually less than three minutes  shekt   s thumb moved again .   his assistant bent over the still sleeping schwartz hurriedly  then looked up triumphantly .     he   s alive .      there remained yet several hours  during which a library of recordings were taken  to an undertone of almost wild excitement .  it was well past midnight when the hypodermic was pressed home and the sleeper   s eyes fluttered .   shekt stepped back  bloodless but happy .  he dabbed at his forehead with the back of a hand .     it   s all right .      he turned to arbin firmly .     he must stay with us a few days  sir .      the look of alarm grew madly in arbin   s eyes .     but  but           no  no  you must rely on me     urgently .     he will be safe  i will stake my life on it .  i am staking my life on it .  leave him to us  no one will see him but ourselves .  if you take him with you now  he may not survive .  what good will that do you .  .  .  . and if he does die  you may have to explain the corpse to the ancients .      it was the last that did the trick .  arbin swallowed and said     but look  how am i to know when to come and take him .  i won   t give you my name .      but it was submission .  shekt said     i   m not asking you for your name .  come a week from today at ten in the evening .  i   ll be waiting for you at the door of the garage  the one we took in your biwheel at .  you must believe me  man  you have nothing to fear .        it was evening when arbin arrowed out of chica .  twenty four hours had passed since the stranger had pounded at his door  and in that time he had doubled his crimes against the customs .  would he ever be safe again .   he could not help but glance over his shoulder as his biwheel sped along the empty road .  would there be someone to follow .  someone to trace him home .  or was his face already recorded .  were matchings being leisurely made somewhere in the distant files of the brotherhood at washenn  where all living earthmen  together with their vital statistics  were listed  for purposes of the sixty .   the sixty  which must come to all earthmen eventually .  he had yet a quarter of a century before it came to him  yet he lived daily with it on grew   s account  and now on the stranger   s account .   what if he never returned to chica .   no .  he and loa could not long continue producing for three  and once they failed  their first crime  that of concealing grew  would be discovered .  and so crimes against the customs  once begun  must be compounded .   arbin knew that he would be back  despite any risk .     it was past midnight before shekt thought of retiring  and then only because the troubled pola insisted .  even then he did not sleep .  his pillow was a subtle smothering device  his sheets a pair of maddening snarls .  he arose and took his seat by the window .  the city was dark now  but there on the horizon  on the side opposite the lake  was the faint trace of that blue glow of death that held sway over all but a few patches of earth .   the activities of the hectic day just past danced madly before his mind .  his first action after having persuaded the frightened farmer to leave had been to televise the state house .  ennius must have been waiting for him  for he himself had answered .  he was still encased in the heaviness of the lead impregnated clothing .      ah  shekt  good evening .  your experiment is over .         and nearly my volunteer as well  poor man .      ennius looked ill .  .  .   thought well when i thought it better not to stay .  you scientists are scarcely removed from murderers  it seems to me .         he is not yet dead  procurator  and it may be that we will save him  but      and he shrugged his shoulders .      i   d stick to rats exclusively henceforward  shekt .  .  .  .  but you don   t look at all your usual self  friend .  surely you  at least  must be hardened to this  even if i am not .         i am getting old  my lord     said shekt simply .      a dangerous pastime on earth     was the dry reply .     get you to bed  shekt .      and so shekt sat there  looking out at the dark city of a dying world .   for two years now the synapsifier had been under test  and for two years he had been the slave and sport of the society of ancients  or the brotherhood  as they called themselves .   he had seven or eight papers that might have been published in the sirian journal of neurophysiology  that might have given that galaxy wide fame to him that he so wanted .  these papers moldered in his desk .  instead there was that obscure and deliberately misleading paper in physical reviews .  that was the way of the brotherhood .  better a half truth than a lie .   and still ennius was inquiring .  why .   did it fit in with other things he had learned .  was the empire suspecting what he himself suspected .   three times in two hundred years earth had risen .  three times  under the banner of a claimed ancient greatness  earth had rebelled against the imperial garrisons .  three times they had failed  of course  and had not the empire been  essentially  enlightened  and the galactic councils  by and large  statesmanlike  earth would have been bloodily erased from the roll of inhabited planets .   but now things might be different  .  .  . or could they be different .  how far could he trust the words of a dying madman  three quarters incoherent .   what was the use .  in any case  he dared do nothing .  he could only wait .  he was getting old  and  as ennius had said  that was a dangerous pastime on earth .  the sixty was almost upon him  and there were few exceptions to its inevitable grasp .   and even on this miserable  burning mud ball of earth  he wanted to live .   he went to bed once more at that point  and just before falling asleep he wondered feebly if his call to ennius might have been tapped by the ancients .  he did not know at the time that the ancients had other sources of information .     it was morning before shekt   s young technician had completely made up his mind .   he admired shekt  but he knew well that the secret treatment of a non authorized volunteer was against the direct order of the brotherhood .  and that order had been given the status of a custom  which made disobedience a capital offense .   he reasoned it out .  after all  who was this man who had been treated .  the campaign for volunteers had been carefully worked out .  it was designed to give enough information about the synapsifier to remove suspicion on the part of possible imperial spies without giving any real encouragement to volunteers .  the society of ancients sent their own men for treatment .  and that was enough .   who had sent this man  then .  the society of ancients in secret .  in order to test shekt   s reliability .   or was shekt a traitor .  he had been closeted with someone earlier in the day  someone in bulky clothes  such as outsiders wore in fear of radioactive poisoning .   in either case shekt might go down in doom  and why should he himself be dragged down as well .  he was a young man with nearly four decades of life before him .  why should he anticipate the sixty .   besides  it would mean promotion for him .  .  .  . and shekt was so old  the next census would probably get him anyway  so it would involve very little harm for him .  practically none at all .   the technician had decided .  his hand reached for the communicator  and he punched the combination that would lead directly to the private room of the high minister of all earth  who  under the emperor and procurator  held the power of life and death over every man on earth .     it was evening again before the misty impressions within schwartz   s skull sharpened through the pink pain .  he remembered the trip to the low  huddling structures by the lakeside  the long crouching wait in the rear of the car .   and then  what .  what .  his mind yanked away at the sluggish thoughts .  .  .  . yes  they had come for him .  there was a room  with instruments and dials  and two pills .  .  .  .  that was it .  they had given him pills  and he had taken them cheerfully .  what had he to lose .  poisoning would have been a favor .   and then  nothing .   wait .  there had been flashes of consciousness .  .  . people bending over him .  .  . suddenly he remembered the cold motion of a stethoscope over his chest .  .  .  . a girl had been feeding him .   it flashed upon him that he had been operated upon and  in panic  he flung the bed sheets from him and sat up .   a girl was upon him  hands on his shoulders  forcing him back onto the pillows .  she spoke soothingly  but he did not understand her .  he tensed himself against the slim arms  but uselessly .  he had no strength .   he held his hands before his face .  they seemed normal .  he moved his legs and heard them brush against the sheets .  they couldn   t have been amputated .  .   he turned to the girl and said  without much hope     can you understand me .  do you know where i am .     he scarcely recognized his own voice .   the girl smiled and suddenly poured out a rapid patter of liquid sound .  schwartz groaned .  then an older man entered  the one who had given him the pills .  the man and the girl spoke together  the girl turning to him after a while  pointing to his lips and making little gestures of invitation to him .      what .     he said .   she nodded eagerly  her pretty face glowing with pleasure  until  despite himself  schwartz felt glad to look at it .      you want me to talk .     he asked .   the man sat down upon his bed and motioned him to open his mouth .  he said      ah h h     and schwartz repeated    ah h h    while the man   s fingers massaged schwartz   s adam   s apple .      what   s the matter .     said schwartz peevishly  when the pressure was removed .      are you surprised i can talk .  what do you think i am .        the days passed  and schwartz learned a few things .  the man was dr .  shekt  the first human being he knew by name since he had stepped over the rag doll .  the girl was his daughter  pola .  schwartz found that he no longer needed to shave .  the hair on his face never grew .  it frightened him .  did it ever grow .   his strength came back quickly .  they were letting him put on clothes and walk about now  and were feeding him something more than mush .   was his trouble amnesia  then .  were they treating him for that .  was all this world normal and natural  while the world he thought he remembered was only the fantasy of an amnesic brain .   and they never let him step out of the room  not even into the corridor .  was he a prisoner  then .  had he committed a crime .   there never can be a man so lost as one who is lost in the vast and intricate corridors of his own lonely mind  where none may reach and none may save .  there never was a man so helpless as one who cannot remember .   pola amused herself by teaching him words .  he was not at all amazed at the ease with which he picked them up and remembered .  he remembered that he had had a trick memory in the past  that memory  at least  seemed accurate .  in two days he could understand simple sentences .  in three he could make himself understood .   on the third day  however  he did become amazed .  shekt taught him numbers and set him problems .  schwartz would give answers  and shekt would look at a timing device and record with rapid strokes of his stylus .  but then shekt explained the term    logarithm    to him and asked for the logarithm of two .   schwartz picked his words carefully .  his vocabulary was still minute and he reinforced it with gestures .     i  not  say .  answer  not  number .      shekt nodded his head excitedly and said     not number .  not this  not that  part this  part that .      schwartz understood quite well that shekt had confirmed his statement that the answer was not an even number but a fraction and therefore said     point three zero one zero three   and  more  numbers .         enough .      then came the amazement .  how had he known the answer to that .  schwartz was certain that he had never heard of logarithms before  yet in his mind the answer had come as soon as the question was put .  he had no idea of the process by which it had been calculated .  it was as if his mind were an independent entity  using him only as its mouthpiece .   or had he once been a mathematician  in the days before his amnesia .   he found it exceedingly difficult to wait the days out .  increasingly he felt he must venture out into the world and force an answer from it somehow .  he could never learn in the prison of this room  where  the thought suddenly came to him  he was but a medical specimen .   the chance came on the sixth day .  they were beginning to trust him too much  and one time when shekt left he did not lock the door .  where usually the door so neatly closed itself that the very crack of its joining the wall became invisible  this time a quarter inch of space showed .   he waited to make sure shekt was not returning on the instant  and then slowly put his hand over the little gleaming light as he had seen them often do .  smoothly and silently the door slid open .  .  .  . the corridor was empty .   and so schwartz    escaped .      how was he to know that for the six days of his residence there the society of ancients had its agents watching the hospital  his room  himself .           apprehension in the night     the procurator   s palace was scarcely less a fairyland at night .  the evening flowers  none native to earth  opened their fat white blossoms in festoons that extended their delicate fragrance to the very walls of the palace .  under the polarized light of the moon  the artificial silicate strands woven cleverly into the stainless aluminum alloy of the palace structure sparked a faint violet against the metallic sheen of their surroundings .   ennius looked at the stars .  they were the real beauty to him  since they were the empire .   earth   s sky was of an intermediate type .  it had not the unbearable glory of the skies of the central worlds  where star elbowed star in such blinding competition that the black of night was nearly lost in a coruscant explosion of light .  nor did it possess the lonely grandeur of the skies of the periphery  where the unrelieved blackness was broken at great intervals by the dimness of an orphaned star  with the milky lens shape of the galaxy spreading across the sky  the individual stars thereof lost in diamond dust .   on earth two thousand stars were visible at one time .  ennius could see sirius  round which circled one of the ten most populous planets of the empire .  there was arcturus  capital of the sector of his birth .  the sun of trantor  the empire   s capital world  was lost somewhere in the milky way .  even under a telescope it was just part of a general blaze .   he felt a soft hand on his shoulder  and his own went up to meet it .      flora .     he whispered .      it had better be     came his wife   s half amused voice .     do you know that you haven   t slept since you returned from chica .  do you know further that it is almost dawn .  .  .  .  shall i have breakfast sent out here .         why not .     he smiled fondly up at her and felt in the darkness for the brown ringlet that hovered next her cheek .  he tugged at it .     and must you wait up with me and shadow the most beautiful eyes in the galaxy .      she freed her hair and replied gently     you are trying to shadow them yourself with your sugar syrup  but i   ve seen you this way before and am not in the tiniest hoodwinked .  what worries you tonight  dear .         why  that which always worries me .  that i have buried you here uselessly  when there   s not a viceregal society in the galaxy you could not grace .         besides that .  come  ennius  i will not be played with .      ennius shook his head in the shadows and said     i don   t know .  i think an accumulation of little puzzling things has finally sickened me .  there   s the matter of shekt and his synapsifier .  and there   s this archaeologist  arvardan  and his theories .  and other things  other things .  oh  what   s the use  flora  i   m doing no good here at all .         surely this time of the morning isn   t quite the moment for putting your morale to the test .      but ennius was speaking through clenched teeth .     these earthmen .  why should so few be such a burden to the empire .  do you remember  flora  when i was first appointed to the procuracy  the warnings i received from old faroul  the last procurator  as to the difficulties of the position .  .  .  .  he was right .  if anything  he did not go far enough in his warnings .  yet i laughed at him at the time and privately thought him the victim of his own senile incapacity .  i was young  active  daring .  i would do better .  .  .     he paused  lost in himself  then continued  apparently at a disconnected point .     yet so many independent pieces of evidence seem to show that these earthmen are once again being misled into dreams of rebellion .      he looked up at his wife .     do you know that it is the doctrine of the society of ancients that earth was at one time the sole home of humanity  that it is the appointed center of the race  the true representation of man .         why  so arvardan told us two evenings ago  didn   t he .     it was always best at these times to let him talk himself out .      yes  so he did     said ennius gloomily     but even so  he spoke only of the past .  the society of ancients speaks of the future as well .  earth  once more  they say  will be the center of the race .  they even claim that this mythical second kingdom of earth is at hand  they warn that the empire will be destroyed in a general catastrophe which will leave earth triumphant in all its pristine glory     and his voice shook     as a backward  barbarous  soil sick world .  three times before this same nonsense has raised rebellion  and the destruction brought down upon earth has never served in the least to shake their stupid faith .         they are but poor creatures     said flora     these men of earth .  what should they have  if not their faith .  they are certainly robbed of everything else  of a decent world  of a decent life .  they are even robbed of the dignity of acceptance on a basis of equality by the rest of the galaxy .  so they retire to their dreams .  can you blame them .         yes  i can blame them     cried ennius with energy .     let them turn from their dreams and fight for assimilation .  they don   t deny they are different .  they simply wish to replace    worse    by    better     and you can   t expect the rest of the galaxy to let them do that .  let them abandon their cliquishness  their outdated and offensive    customs .     let them be men  and they will be considered men .  let them be earthmen and they will be considered only as such .      but never mind that .  for instance  what   s going on with the synapsifier .  now there   s a little thing that is keeping me from sleep .     ennius frowned thoughtfully at the dullness which was overcoming the polished darkness of the eastern sky .      the synapsifier .  .  .  . why  isn   t that the instrument dr .  arvardan spoke of at dinner .  did you go to chica to see about that .      ennius nodded .      and what did you find out there .         why nothing at all     said ennius .     i know shekt .  i know him well .  i can tell when he   s at ease  i can tell when he isn   t .  i tell you  flora  that man was dying of apprehension all the time he was speaking to me .  and when i left he broke into a sweat of thankfulness .  it is an unhappy mystery  flora .         but will the machine work .         am i a neurophysicist .  shekt says it will not .  he called me up to tell me that a volunteer was nearly killed by it .  but i don   t believe that .  he was excited .  he was more than that .  he was triumphant .  his volunteer had lived and the experiment had been successful  or i   ve never seen a happy man in my life .  .  .  . now why do you suppose he lied to me  then .  do you suppose that the synapsifier is in operation .  do you suppose that it can be creating a race of geniuses .         but then why keep it secret .         ah .  why .  it isn   t obvious to you .  why has earth failed in its rebellions .  there are fairly tremendous odds against it  aren   t there .  increase the average intelligence of the earthman .  double it .  triple it .  and where may your odds be then .         oh  ennius .         we may be in the position of apes attacking human beings .  what price numerical odds .         you   re really jumping at shadows .  they couldn   t hide a thing like that .  you can always have the bureau of outer provinces send in a few psychologists and keep testing random samples of earthmen .  surely any abnormal rise in i . q .  could be detected instantly .         yes .  i suppose so .  .  .  . but that may not be it .  i   m not sure of anything  flora  except that a rebellion is in the cards .  something like the uprising of      except that it will probably be worse .         are we prepared for it .  i mean  if you   re so certain          prepared .     ennius   s laughter was a bark .     i    am .  the garrison is in readiness and fully supplied .  whatever can possibly be done with the material at hand .  i have done .  but  flora  i don   t want to have a rebellion .  i don   t want my procuracy to go down in history as the procuracy of the rebellion .  i don   t want my name linked with death and slaughter .  i   ll be decorated for it  but a century from now the history books will call me a bloody tyrant .  what about the viceroy of santanni in the sixth century .  could he have done other than he did  though millions died .  he was honored then  but who has a good word for him now .  i would rather be known as the man who prevented a rebellion and saved the worthless lives of twenty million fools .     he sounded quite hopeless about it .      are you so sure you can   t  ennius  even yet .     she sat down beside him and brushed her finger tips along the line of his jaw .   he caught them and held them tightly .     how can i .  everything works against me .  the bureau itself rushes into the struggle on the side of the fanatics of earth by sending this arvardan here .         but  dear  i don   t see that this archaeologist will do anything so awful .  i   ll admit he sounds like a faddist  but what harm can he do .         why  isn   t it plain .  he wants to be allowed to prove that earth is the original home of humanity .  he wants to bring scientific authority to the aid of subversion .         then stop him .     .      i can   t .  there you have it  frankly .  there   s a theory about that viceroys can do anything  but that just isn   t so .  that man  arvardan  has a writ of permission from the bureau of outer provinces .  it is approved by the emperor .  that supersedes me completely .  i could do nothing without appealing to the central council  and that would take months .  .  .  .  and what reasons could i give .  if i tried to stop him by force  on the other hand  it would be an act of rebellion  and you know how ready the central council is to remove any executive they think is overstepping the line  ever since the civil war of the eighties .  and then what .  i   d be replaced by someone who wouldn   t be aware of the situation at all  and arvardan would go ahead anyway .      and that still isn   t the worst  flora .  do you know how he intends to prove the antiquity of earth .  suppose you guess .      flora laughed gently .     you   re making fun of me  ennius .  how should i guess .  i   m no archaeologist .  i suppose he   ll try to dig up old statues or bones and date them by their radioactivity or something like that .         i wish it were like that .  what arvardan intends to do  he told me yesterday  is to enter the radioactive areas on earth .  he intends to find human artifacts there  show that they exist from a time previous to that at which earth   s soil became radioactive  since he insists the radioactivity is manmade  and date it in that fashion .         but that   s almost what i said .         do you know what it means to enter the radioactive areas .  they   re forbidden .  it   s one of the strongest customs these earthmen have .  no one can enter the forbidden areas  and all radioactive areas are forbidden .         but then that   s good .  arvardan will be stopped by the men of earth themselves .         oh  fine .  he   ll be stopped by the high minister .  and then how will we ever convince him that all this was not a government sponsored project  that the empire is not conniving at deliberate sacrilege .         the high minister can   t be that touchy .         can   t he .     ennius reared back and stared a his wife .  the night had lightened to a slatiness in which she was just visible .     you have the most touching na  vet   .  he certainly can be that touchy .  do you know what happened  oh  about fifty years ago .  i   ll tell you  and then you can judge for yourself .      earth  it so happens  will allow no outward sign of imperial domination on their world because of their insistence that earth is the rightful ruler of the galaxy .  but it so happened that young stannell ii  the boy emperor who was somewhat insane and who was removed by assassination after a reign of two years  you remember .   ordered that the emperor   s insignia be raised in their council chamber at washenn .  in itself the order was reasonable  since the insignia is present in every planetary council chamber in the galaxy as a symbol of the imperial unity .  but what happened in this case .  the day the insignia was raised  the town became a mass of riots .      the lunatics of washenn tore down the insignia and took up arms against the garrison .  stannell ii was sufficiently mad to demand that his order be complied with if it meant the slaughter of every earthman alive  but he was assassinated before that could be put into effect  and edard  his successor  canceled the original order .  all was peace again .         you mean     said flora incredulously     that the imperial insignia was not replaced .         i mean that exactly .  by the stars  earth is the only one of the millions and millions of planets in the empire that has no insignia in its council chamber .  this miserable planet we are on now .  and if even today we were to try again  they would fight to the last man to prevent us .  and you ask me if they   re touchy .  i tell you they   re mad .      there was silence in the slowly graying light of dawn  until flora   s voice sounded again  little and unsure of itself .      ennius .         yes .         you   re not just concerned about he rebellion that you   re expecting because of its effect on our reputation .  i wouldn   t be your wife if i couldn   t half read your thoughts  and it seems to me that you expect something actually dangerous to the empire .  .  .  . you shouldn   t hide anything from me  ennius .  you   re afraid these earthmen will win .         flora  i can   t talk about it .     there was something tortured in his eyes .     it isn   t even a hunch .  .  .  . maybe four years on this world is too long for any sane man .  but why are these earthmen so confident .         how do you know they are .         oh  they are .  i have my sources of information too .  after all  they   ve been crushed three times .  they can   t have illusions left .  yet they face two hundred million worlds  each one singly stronger than they  and they are confident .  can they really be so firm in their faith in some destiny or some supernatural force  something that has meaning only to them .  maybe  maybe  maybe          maybe what  ennius .         maybe they have their weapons .         weapons that will allow one world to defeat two hundred millions .  you are panicky .  no weapon could do that .         i have already mentioned the synapsifier .         and i have told you how to take care of that .  do you know of any other type of weapon they could use .      reluctantly     no .         exactly .  there isn   t any such weapon possible .  now i   ll tell you what to do  dear .  why don   t you get in touch with the high minister and  in earnest of your good faith  warn him of arvardan   s plans .  urge  unofficially  that he not be granted permission .  this will remove any suspicion  or should  that the imperial government has any hand in this silly violation of their customs .  at the same time you will have stopped arvardan without having appeared in the mess yourself .  then have the bureau send out two good psychologists  or  better  ask for four  so they   ll be sure to send at least two  and have them check on the synapsifier possibility .  .  .  . and anything else can be taken care of by our soldiers  while we allow posterity to take care of itself .      now why don   t you sleep right here .  we can put the chair back down  you can use my fur piece as a blanket  and i   ll have a breakfast tray wheeled out when you awake .  things will seem different in the sun .      and so it was that ennius  after waking the night through  fell asleep five minutes before sunrise .   thus it was eight hours later that the high minister first learned of bel arvardan and his mission from the procurator himself .           conversation with madmen .      as for arvardan  he was concerned only with making holiday .  his ship  the ophiuchus  was not to be expected for at least a month  therefore he had a month to spend as lavishly as he might wish .   so it was that on the sixth day after his arrival at everest  bel arvardan left his host and took passage on the terrestrial air transport company   s largest jet stratospheric  traveling between everest and the terrestrial capital  washenn .   if he took a commercial liner  rather than the speedy cruiser placed at his service by ennius  it was done deliberately  out of the reasonable curiosity of a stranger and an archaeologist toward the ordinary life of men inhabiting such a planet as earth .   and for another reason too .   arvardan was from the sirian sector  notoriously the sector above all others in the galaxy where anti terrestrian prejudice was strong .  yet he had always liked to think he had not succumbed to that prejudice himself .  as a scientist  as an archaeologist  he couldn   t afford to .  of course he had grown into the habit of thinking of earthmen in certain set caricature types  and even now the word    earthman     seemed an ugly one to him .  but he wasn   t really prejudiced .   at least he didn   t think so .  for instance  if an earthman had ever wished to join an expedition of his or work for him in any capacity  and had the training and the ability  he would be accepted .  if there were an opening for him  that was .  and if the other members of the expedition didn   t mind too much .  that was the rub .  usually the fellow workers objected  and then what could you do .   he pondered the matter .  now certainly he would have no objection to eating with an earthman  or even bunking with one in case of need  assuming the earthman were reasonably clean  and healthy .  in fact  he would in all ways treat him as he would treat anyone else  he thought .  yet there was no denying that he would always be conscious of the fact that an earthman was an earthman .  he couldn   t help that .  that was the result of a childhood immersed in an atmosphere of bigotry so complete that it was almost invisible  so entire that you accepted its axioms as second nature .  then you left it and saw it for what it was when you looked back .   but here was his chance to test himself .  he was in a plane with only earthmen about him  and he felt perfectly natural  almost .  well  just a little self conscious .   arvardan looked about at the undistinguished and normal faces of his fellow passengers .  they were supposed to be different  these earthmen  but could he have told these from ordinary men if he had met them casually in a crowd .  he didn   t think so .  the women weren   t bad looking .  .  . his brows knit .  of course even tolerance must draw the line somewhere .  intermarriage  for instance  was quite unthinkable .   the plane itself was  in his eyes  a small affair of imperfect construction .  it was  of course  atomic powered  but the application of the principle was far from efficient .  for one thing  the power unit was not well shielded .  then it occurred to arvardan that the presence of stray gamma rays and a high neutron density in the atmosphere might well strike earthmen as less important than it might strike others .   then the view caught his eyes .  from the dark wine purple of the extreme stratosphere  earth presented a fabulous appearance .  beneath him the vast and misted land areas in sight  obscured here and there by the patches of sun bright clouds  showed a desert orange .  behind them  slowly receding from the fleeing stratoliner  was the soft and fuzzy night line  within whose dark shadow there was the sparking of the radioactive areas .   his attention was drawn from the window by the laughter among the others .  it seemed to center about an elderly couple  comfortably stout and all smiles .   arvardan nudged his neighbor .     what   s going on .      his neighbor paused to say     they   ve been married forty years  and they   re making the grand tour .         the grand tour .         you know .  all around the earth .      the elderly man  flushed with pleasure  was recounting in voluble fashion his experiences and impressions .  his wife joined in periodically  with meticulous corrections involving completely unimportant points  these being given and taken in the best of humor .  to all this the audience listened with the greatest attention  so that to arvardan it seemed that earthmen were as warm and human as any people in the galaxy .   and then someone asked     and when is it that you   re scheduled for the sixty .         in about a month     came the ready  cheerful answer .     sixteenth november .         well     said the questioner     i hope you have a nice day for it .  my father reached his sixty in a damned pouring rain .  i   ve never seen one like it since .  i was going with him  you know  a fellow likes company on a day like that  and he complained about the rain every step of the way .  we had an open biwheel  you see  and we got soaked .     listen     i said     what are you complaining about  dad .  i   ve got to come back .          there was a general howl of laughter which the anniversary couple were not backward in joining .  arvardan  however  felt plunged in horror as a distinct and uncomfortable suspicion entered his mind .   he said to the man sharing his seat     this sixty  this subject of conversation here  i take it they   re referring to euthanasia .  i mean  you   re put out of the way when you reach your sixtieth birthday  aren   t you .      arvardan   s voice faded somewhat as his neighbor choked off the last of his chuckles to turn in his seat and favor the questioner with a long and suspicious stare .  finally he said     well  what do you think he meant .      arvardan made an indefinite gesture with his hand and smiled rather foolishly .  he had known of the custom  but only academically .  something in a book .  something discussed in a scientific paper .  but it was now borne in upon him that it actually applied to living beings  that the men and women surrounding him could  by custom  live only to sixty .   the man next to him was still staring .     hey  fella  where you from .  don   t they know about the sixty in your home town .         we call it the    time         said arvardan feebly .     i   m from back there .     he jerked his thumb hard over his shoulder  and after an additional quarter minute the other withdrew that hard  questioning stare .   arvardan   s lips quirked .  these people were suspicious .  that facet of the caricature  at least  was authentic .   the elderly man was talking again .     she   s coming with me     he said  nodding toward his genial wife .     she   s not due for about three months after that  but there   s no point in her waiting  she thinks  and we might as well go together .  isn   t that it  chubby .         oh yes     she said  and giggled rosily .     our children are all married and have homes of their own .  i   d just be a bother to them .  besides  i couldn   t enjoy the time anyway without the old fellow  so we   ll just leave off together .      whereupon the entire list of passengers seemed to engage themselves in a simultaneous arithmetical calculation of the time remaining to each  a process involving conversion factors from months to days that occasioned several disputes among the married couples involved .   one small fellow with tight clothes and a determined expression said fiercely     i   ve got exactly twelve years  three months  and four days left .  twelve years  three months  and four days .  not a day more  not a day less .      which someone qualified by saying  reasonably     unless you die first  of course .         nonsense     was the immediate reply .     i have no intention of dying first .  do i look like the sort of man who would die first .  i   m living twelve years  three months  and four days  and there   s not a man here with the hardihood to deny it .     and he looked very fierce indeed .   a slim young man took a long  dandyish cigarette from between his lips to say darkly     it   s well for them that can calculate it out to a day .  there   s many a man living past his time .         ah  surely     said another  and there was a general nod and a rather inchoate air of indignation arose .      not     continued the young man  interspersing his cigarette puffs with a complicated flourish intended to remove the ash     that i see any objection to a man  or woman  wishing  to continue on past their birthday to the next council day  particularly if they have some business to clean up .  it   s these sneaks and parasites that try to go past to the next census  eating the food of the next generation      he seemed to have a personal grievance there .   arvardan interposed gently     but aren   t the ages of everyone registered .  they can   t very well pass their birthday too far  can they .      a general silence followed  admixtured not a little with contempt at the foolish idealism expressed .  someone said at last  in diplomatic fashion  as though attempting to conclude the subject     well  there isn   t much point living past the sixty  i suppose .         not if you   re a farmer     shot back another vigorously .      after you   ve been working in the fields for half a century  you   d be crazy not to be glad to call it off .  how about the administrators  though  and the businessmen .      finally the elderly man  whose fortieth wedding anniversary had begun the conversation  ventured his own opinion  emboldened perhaps by the fact that  as a current victim of the sixty  he had nothing to lose .      as to that     he said     it depends on who you know .     and he winked with a sly innuendo .     i knew a man once who was sixty the year after the     census and lived till the     census caught him .  he was sixty nine before he left off .  sixty nine .  think of that .         how did he manage that .         he had a little money  and his brother was one of the society of ancients .  there   s nothing you can   t do if you   ve got that combination .      there was general approval of that sentiment .      listen     said the young man with the cigarette emphatically     i had an uncle who lived a year past  just a year .  he was just one of these selfish guys who don   t feel like going  you know .  a lot he cared for the rest of us .  .  .  . and i didn   t know about it  you see  or i would have reported him  believe me  because a guy should go when it   s his time .  it   s only fair to the next generation .  anyway  he got caught all right  and the first thing i knew  the brotherhood calls on me and my brother and wants to know how come we didn   t report him .  i said  hell  i didn   t know anything about it  nobody in my family knew anything about it .  i said we hadn   t seen him in ten years .  my old man backed us up .  but we got fined five hundred credits just the same .  that   s when you don   t have any pull .      the look of discomposure on arvardan   s face was growing .  were these people madmen to accept death so  to resent their friends and relatives who tried to escape death .  could he  by accident  be on a ship carrying a cargo of lunatics to asylum  or euthanasia .  or were these simply earthmen .   his neighbor was scowling at him again  and his voice broke in on arvardan   s thoughts .     hey fella  where   s    back there .            pardon me .         i said  where are you from .  you said    back there .     what   s    back there    .  hey .      arvardan found the eyes of all upon him now  each with its own sudden spark of suspicion in it .  did they think him a member of this society of ancients of theirs .  had his questioning seemed the cajolery of an agent provocateur .   so he met that by saying  in a burst of frankness     i   m not from anywhere on earth .  i   m bel arvardan from baronn  sirius sector .  what   s your name .     and he held out his hand .   he might as well have dropped an atomic explosive capsule into the middle of the plane .   the first silent horror on every face turned rapidly into angry  bitter hostility that flamed at him .  the man who had shared his seat rose stiffly and crowded into another  where the pair of occupants squeezed closely together to make room for him .   faces turned away .  shoulders surrounded him  hemmed him in .  for a moment arvardan burned with indignation .  earthmen to treat him so .  earthmen .  he had held out the hand of friendship to them .  he  a sirian  had condescended to treat with them and they had rebuffed him .   and then  with an effort  he relaxed .  it was obvious that bigotry was never a one way operation  that hatred bred hatred .   he was conscious of a presence beside him  and he turned toward it resentfully .     yes .      it was the young man with the cigarette .  he was lighting a new one as he spoke .     hello     he said .     my name   s creen .  .  .  .  don   t let those jerks get you .         no one   s getting me     said arvardan shortly .  he was not too pleased with the company  nor was he in the mood for patronizing advice from an earthman .   but creen was not trained to the detection of the more delicate nuances .  he puffed his cigarette to life in man sized drags and tapped its ashes over the arm of the seat into the middle aisle .      provincials .     he whispered with contempt .     just a bunch of farmers .  .  .  . they lack the galactic view .  don   t bother with them .  .  .  . now you take me .  i got a different philosophy .  live and let live  i say .  i got nothing against outsiders .  if they want to be friendly with me  i   ll be friendly with them .  what the hell  they can   t help being an outsider just like i can   t help being an earthman .  don   t you think i   m right .     and he tapped arvardan familiarly on the wrist .   arvardan nodded and felt a crawling sensation at the other   s touch .  social contact with a man who felt resentful over losing a chance to bring about his uncle   s death was not pleasant  quite regardless of planetary origin .   creen leaned back .     heading for chica .  what did you say your name was .  albadan .         arvardan .  yes  i   m going to chica .         that   s my home town .  best damned city on earth .  going to stay there long .         maybe .  i haven   t made any plans .         umm .  .  .  . say  i hope you don   t object to my saying that i   ve been noticing your shirt .  mind if i take a close look .  made in sirius  huh .         yes  it is .         it   s very good material .  can   t get anything like that on earth .  .  .  . say  bud  you wouldn   t have a spare shirt like that in your luggage  would you .  i   d pay for it if you wanted to sell it .  it   s a snappy number .      arvardan shook his head emphatically .     sorry  but i don   t have much of a wardrobe .  i am planning to buy clothes here on earth as i go along .         i   ll pay you fifty credits     said creen .  .  .  . silence .  he added  with a touch of resentment     that   s a good price .         a very good price     said arvardan     but  as i told you  i have no shirts to sell .         well .  .  .     creen shrugged .     expect to stay on earth quite a while  i suppose .         maybe .         what   s your line of business .      the archaeologist allowed irritation to rise to the surface .     look  mr .  creen  if you don   t mind  i   m a little tired and would like to take a nap .  is that all right with you .      creen frowned .     what   s the matter with you .  don   t your kind believe in being civil to people .  i   m just asking you a polite question  no need to bite my ear off .      the conversation  hitherto conducted in a low voice  had suddenly amplified itself into a near shout .  hostile expressions turned arvardan   s way  and the archaeologist   s lips compressed themselves into a thin line .   he had asked for it  he decided bitterly .  he would not have gotten into this mess if he had held aloof from the beginning  if he hadn   t felt the necessity of vaunting his damned tolerance and forcing it on people who didn   t want it .   he said levelly     mr .  creen  i didn   t ask you to join me  and i haven   t been uncivil .  i repeat  i am tired and would like to rest .  i think there   s nothing unusual in that .         listen     the young man rose from his seat  threw his cigarette away with a violent gesture  and pointed a finger     you don   t have to treat me like i   m a dog or something .  you stinking outsiders come here with your fine talk and standoffishness and think it gives you the right to stamp all over us .  we don   t have to stand for it  see .  if you don   t like it here  you can go back where you came from  and it won   t take much more of your lip to make me light into you  either .  you think i   m afraid of you .      arvardan turned his head away and stared stonily out the window .   creen said no more  but took his original seat once again .  there was an excited buzz of conversation round and about the plane which arvardan ignored .  he felt  rather than saw  the sharpened and envenomed glances being cast at him .  until  gradually  it passed  as all things did .   he completed the journey  silent and alone .     the landing at the chica airport was welcome .  arvardan smiled to himself at the first sight from the air of the    best damned city on earth     but found it  nevertheless  an immense improvement over the thick  unfriendly atmosphere of the plane .   he supervised the unloading of his luggage and had it transferred into a biwheel cab .  at least he would be the only passenger here  so that if he took care not to speak unnecessarily to the driver  he could scarcely get into trouble .      state house     he told the cabby  and they were off .   arvardan thus entered chica for the first time  and he did so on the day that joseph schwartz escaped from his room at the institute for nuclear research .     creen watched arvardan leave with a bitter half smile .  he took out his little book and studied it closely between puffs at his cigarette .  he hadn   t gotten much out of the passengers  despite his story about his uncle  which he had used often before to good effect  .  to be sure  the old guy had complained about a man living past his time and had blamed it on    pull    with the ancients .  that would come under the heading of slander against the brotherhood .  but then the geezer was heading for the sixty in a month  anyway .  no use putting his name down .   but this outsider  that was different .  he surveyed the item with a feeling of pleasure     bel arvardan  baronn  sirius sector  curious about the sixty  secretive about own affairs  entered chica by commercial plane    a . m .  chica time     october  anti terrestrian attitude very marked .      this time maybe he had a real haul .  picking up these little squealers who made incautious remarks was dull work  but things like this made it payoff .   the brotherhood would have his report before half an hour was up .  he made his way leisurely off the field .           convergence at chica     for the twentieth time dr .  shekt leafed through his latest volume of research notes  then looked up as pola entered his office .  she frowned as she slipped on her lab coat .      now  father  haven   t you eaten yet .         eh .  certainly i have .  .  .  . oh  what   s this .         this is lunch .  or it was  once .  what you ate must have been breakfast .  now there   s no sense in my buying meals and bringing them here if you   re not going to eat them .  i   m just going to make you go home for them .         don   t get excited .  i   ll eat it .  i can   t interrupt a vital experiment every time you think i ought to eat  you know .      he grew cheerful again over the dessert .     you have no idea     he said     the kind of man this schwartz is .  did i ever tell you about his skull sutures .         they   re primitive .  you told me .         but that   s not all .  he   s got thirty two teeth  three molars up and down  left and right  counting one false one that must be homemade .  at least i   ve never seen a bridge that has metal prongs hooking it onto adjacent teeth instead of being grafted to the jawbone .  .  .  . but have you ever seen anyone with thirty two teeth .         i don   t go about counting people   s teeth  father .  what   s the right number  twenty eight .         it sure as space is .  .  .  . i   m still not finished  though .  we took an internal analysis yesterday .  what do you suppose we found .  .  .  . guess .         intestines .         pola  you   re being deliberately annoying  but i don   t care .  you needn   t guess      tell you .  schwartz has a vermiform appendix  three and a half inches long  and it   s open .  great galaxy  it   s completely unprecedented .  i have checked with the medical school  cautiously  of course  and appendixes are practically never longer than half an inch  and they   re never open .         and just what does that mean .         why  he   s a complete throwback  a living fossil .     he had risen from his chair and paced the distance to the wall and back with hasty steps .     i tell you what  pola  i don   t think we ought to give schwartz up .  he   s too valuable a specimen .         no  no  father     said pola quickly     you can   t do that .  you promised that farmer to return schwartz  and you must for schwartz   s own sake .  he   s unhappy .         unhappy .  why  we   re treating him like a rich outsider .         what difference does that make .  the poor fellow is used to his farm and his people .  he   s lived there all his life .  and now he   s had a frightening experience  a painful one  for all i know  and his mind works differently now .  he can   t be expected to understand .  we   ve got to consider his human rights and return him to his family .         but  pola  the cause of science          oh  slush .  what is the cause of science worth to me .  what do you suppose the brotherhood will say when they hear of your unauthorized experiments .  do you think they care about the cause of science .  i mean  consider yourself if you don   t wish to consider schwartz .  the longer you keep him  the greater the chance of being caught .  you send him home tomorrow night  the way you originally planned to  do you hear .  .  .  . i   ll go down and see if schwartz wants anything before dinner .      but she was back in less than five minutes  face damp and chalky .     father  he   s gone .         who   s gone .     he asked  startled .      schwartz .     she cried  half in tears .     you must have forgotten to lock the door when you left him .      shekt was on his feet  throwing a hand out to steady himself .     how long .         i don   t know .  but it can   t be very long .  when were you last there .         not fifteen minutes .  i had just been here a minute or two when you came in .         well  then     with sudden decision     i   ll run out .  he may simply be wandering about the neighborhood .  you stay here .  if someone else picks him up  they mustn   t connect him with you .  understand .      shekt could only nod .     joseph schwartz felt no lifting of the heart when he exchanged the confines of his prison hospital for the expanses of the city outside .  he did not delude himself to the effect that he had a plan of action .  he knew  and knew well  that he was simply improvising .   if any rational impulse guided him  as distinct from mere blind desire to exchange inaction for action of any sort   it was the hope that by chance encounter some facet of life would bring back his wandering memory .  that he was an amnesiac he was now fully convinced .   the first glimpse of the city  however  was disheartening .  it was late afternoon and  in the sunlight  chica was a milky white .  the buildings might have been constructed of porcelain  like that farmhouse he had first stumbled upon .   stirrings deep within told him that cities should be brown and red .  and they should be much dirtier .  he was sure of that .   he walked slowly .  he felt  somehow  that there would be no organized search for him .  he knew that  without knowing how he knew .  to be sure  in the last few days he had found himself growing increasingly sensitive to    atmosphere     to the    feel    of things about him .  it was part of the strangeness in his mind  since  since .  .  .   his thought trailed away .   in any case  the    atmosphere    at the hospital prison was one of secrecy  a frightened secrecy  it seemed .  so they could not pursue him with loud outcry .  he knew that .  now why should he know that .  was this queer activity of his mind part of what went on in cases of amnesia .   he crossed another intersection .  wheeled vehicles were relatively few .  pedestrians were  well  pedestrians .  their clothes were rather laughable  seamless  buttonless  colorful .  but then so were his own .  he wondered where his old clothes were  then wondered if he had ever really owned such clothes as he remembered .  it is very difficult to be sure of anything  once you begin doubting your memory on principle .   but he remembered his wife so clearly  his children .  they couldn   t be fictions .  he stopped in the middle of the walk to regain a composure suddenly lost .  perhaps they were distorted versions of real people  in this so unreal seeming real life  whom he must find .   people were brushing past him and several muttered unamiably .  he moved on .  the thought occurred to him  suddenly and forcibly  that he was hungry  or would be soon  and that he had no money .   he looked about .  nothing like a restaurant in sight .  well  how did he know .  he couldn   t read the signs .   he gazed into each store front he passed .  .  .  . and then he found an interior which consisted in part of small alcoved tables  at one of which two men sat and another at which a single man sat .  and the men were eating .   at least that hadn   t changed .  men who ate still chewed and swallowed .   he stepped in and  for a moment  stopped in considerable bewilderment .  there was no counter  no cooking going on  no signs of any kitchen .  it had been his idea to offer to wash the dishes for a meal  but  to whom could he make the offer .   diffidently  he stepped up to the two diners .  he pointed  and said painstakingly     food .  where .  please .      they looked up at him  rather startled .  one spoke fluently  and quite incomprehensibly  patting a small structure at the wall end of the table .  the other joined in  impatiently .   schwartz   s eyes fell .  he turned to leave  and there was a hand upon his sleeve      granz had seen schwartz while the latter was still only a plump and wistful face at the window .   he said    what   s he want .      messter  sitting across the little table  with his back to the street  turned  looked  shrugged his shoulders  and said nothing .   granz said     he   s coming in     and messter replied     so what .         nothing .  just mentioning it .      but a few moments later the newcomer  after looking about helplessly  approached and pointed to their beef stew  saying in a queer accent     food .  where .  please .      granz looked up .     food right here  bud .  just pull up a chair at any table you want and use the foodomat .  .  .  .  foodomat .  don   t you know what a foodomat is .  .  .  . look at the poor jerk  messter .  he   s looking at me as if he doesn   t understand a word i say .  hey  fella  this thing  see .  just put a coin in and let me eat  will you .         leave him alone     grunted messter .     he   s just a bum  looking for a handout .         hey  hold on .     granz seized schwartz   s sleeve as the latter turned to go .  he added in an aside to messter     space  let the guy eat .  he   s probably getting the sixty soon .  it   s the least i can do to give him a break .  .  .  . hey  bud  you got any money .  .  .  . well  i   ll be damned  he still doesn   t understand me .  money  pal  money .  this      and he drew a shining half credit piece out of his pocket  flipping it so that it sparkled in the air .      got any .     he asked .   slowly schwartz shook his head .      well  then  have this on me .     he replaced the half credit piece in his pocket and tossed over a considerably smaller coin .   schwartz held it uncertainly .      all right .  don   t just stand there .  stick it in the foodomat .  this thing here .      schwartz suddenly found himself understanding .  the foodomat had a series of slits for coins of different sizes and a series of knobs opposite little milky rectangles  the writing upon which he could not read .  schwartz pointed to the food on the table and ran a forefinger up and down the knobs  raising his eyebrows in question .   messter said in annoyance      a sandwich isn   t good enough for him .  we   re getting classy bums in this burg nowadays .  it doesn   t pay to humor them  granz .         all right  so i lose point eight five credits .  tomorrow   s payday  anyway .  .  .  . here     he said to schwartz .  he placed coins of his own into the foodomat and withdrew the wide metal container from the recess in the wall .     now take it to another table .  .  .  . nab  keep that tenth piece .  buy yourself a cup of coffee with it .      schwartz carried the container gingerly to the next table .  it had a spoon attached to the side by means of a transparent  filmy material  which broke with a slight pop under the pressure of a fingernail .  as it did so  the top of the container parted at a seam and curled back upon itself .   the food  unlike that which he saw the others eating  was cold  but that was a detail .  it was only after a minute or so that he realized the food was getting warmer and that the container had grown hot to the touch .  he stopped  in alarm  and waited .   the gravy first steamed  then bubbled gently for a moment .  it cooled again and schwartz completed the meal .   granz and messter were still there when he left .  so was the third man  to whom  throughout  schwartz had paid no attention .   nor had schwartz noticed  at any time since he had left the institute  the thin  little man who  without seeming to  had managed to remain always within eyeshot .     bel arvardan  having showered and changed his clothes  promptly followed his original intention of observing the human animal  subspecies earth  in its native habitat .  the weather was mild  the light breeze refreshing  the village itself  pardon  the city  bright  quiet  and clean .   not so bad .   chica first stop  he thought .  largest collection of earth .  men on the planet .  washenn next  local capital .  senloo .  senfran .  bonair .  .  .  . he had plotted an itinerary all over the western continents  where most of the meager scattering of earth   s population lived  and  allowing two or three days at each  he would be back in chica just about the time his expeditionary ship was due .   it would be educational .   as afternoon began to decline he stepped into a foodomat and  as he ate  observed the small drama that played itself out between the two earthmen who had entered shortly after himself and the plump  elderly man who came in last of all .  but his observation was detached and casual  simply not .  ing it as an item to set against his unpleasant experience on the jet transport .  the two men at the table were obviously air cab drivers and not wealthy  yet they could be charitable .   the beggar left  and two minutes later arvardan left as well .   the streets were noticeably fuller  as the workday was approaching its end .   he stepped hastily aside to avoid colliding with a young girl .      pardon me     he said .   she was dressed in white  in clothing which bore the stereotyped lines of a uniform .  she seemed quite oblivious of the near collision .  the anxious look on her face  the sharp turning of her head from side to side  her utter preoccupation  made the situation quite obvious .   he laid a light finger on her shoulder .     may i help you  miss .  are you in trouble .      she stopped and turned startled eyes upon him .  arvardan found himself judging her age at nineteen to twenty one  observing carefully her brown hair and dark eyes  her high cheekbones and little chin  her slim waist and graceful carriage .  he discovered  suddenly  that the thought of this little female creature being an earthwoman lent a sort of perverse piquancy to her attractiveness .   but she was still staring  and almost at the moment of speaking she seemed to break down .     oh  it   s no use .  please don   t bother about me .  it   s silly to expect to find someone when you don   t have the slightest idea where he could have gone .      she was drooping in discouragement  her eyes wet .  then she straightened and breathed deeply .     have you seen a plump man about five four  dressed in green and white  no hat  rather bald .      arvardan looked at her in astonishment .     what .  green and white .  .  .  . oh  i don   t believe this .  .  .  . look  this man you   re referring to  does he speak with difficulty .         yes  yes .  oh yes .  you have seen him  then .         not five minutes ago he was in there eating with two men .  .  .  . here they are .  .  .  . say  you two .     he beckoned them over .   granz reached them first .     cab  sir .         no  but if you tell the young lady what happened to the man you were eating with  you   ll stand to make the fare  anyway .      granz paused and looked chagrined .     well  i   d like to help you  but i never saw him before in my life .      arvardan turned to the girl .     now look  miss  he can   t have gone in the direction you came from or you   d have seen him .  and he can   t be far away .  suppose we move north a bit .  i   ll recognize him if i see him .      his offer of help was an impulse  yet arvardan was not  ordinarily  an impulsive man .  he found himself smiling at her .   granz interrupted suddenly .     what   s he done  lady .  he hasn   t broken any of the customs  has he .         no  no     she replied hastily .     he   s only a little sick  that   s all .      messter looked after them as they left .      a little sick .     he shoved his visored cap back upon his head  then pinched balefully at his chin .     how d   ya like that  granz .  a little sick .      his eyes looked askance at the other for a moment .      what   s got into you .     asked granz uneasily .      something that   s making me a little sick .  that guy must   ve been straight out of the hospital .  that was a nurse looking for him  and a plenty worried nurse  too .  why should she be worried if he was just a little sick .  he couldn   t hardly talk  and he didn   t hardly understand .  you noticed that  didn   t you .      there was a sudden panicky light in granz   s eyes .     you don   t think it   s fever .         i sure do think it   s radiation fever  and he   s far gone .  he was within a foot of us  too .  it   s never any good       there was a little thin man next to them .  a little thin man with bright  sharp eyes and a twittering voice  who had stepped out of nowhere .     what   s that  gents .  who   s got radiation fever .      he was regarded with disfavor .     who are you .         ho     said the sharp little man     you want to know  do you .  it so happens that i   m a messenger of the brotherhood  to be sure .     he flashed a little glowing badge on the inner lapel of his jacket .     now  in the name of the society of ancients  what   s all this about radiation fever .      messter spoke in cowed and sullen tones .     i don   t know nothing .  there   s a nurse looking for somebody who   s sick  and i was wondering if it was radiation fever .  that   s not against the customs  is it .         ho .  you   re telling me about the customs  are you .  you better go about your business and let me worry about the customs .      the little man rubbed his hands together  gazed quickly about him  and hurried northward .        there he is .     and pola clutched feverishly at her companion   s elbow .  it had happened quickly  easily  and accidentally .  through the despairing blankness he had suddenly materialized just within the main entrance of the self service department store  not three blocks from the foodomat .      i see him     whispered arvardan .     now stay back and let me follow him .  if he sees you and dashes into the mob  we   ll never locate him .      casually they followed in a sort of nightmare chase .  the human contents of the store was a quicksand which could absorb its prey slowly  or quickly  keep it hidden impenetrably  spew it forth unexpectedly  set up barriers that somehow would not yield .  the mob might almost have had a malevolent conscious mind of its own .   and then arvardan circled a counter watchfully  playing schwartz as though he were at the end of a fishing line .  his huge hand reached out and closed on the other   s shoulder .   schwartz burst into incomprehensible prose and jerked away in panic .  arvardan   s grip  however  was unbreakable to men far stronger than schwartz  and he contented himself with smiling and saying  in normal tones  for the benefit of the curious spectator     hello  old chap  haven   t seen you in months .  how are you .      a palpable fraud  he supposed  in the face of the other   s gibberish  but pola had joined them .      schwartz     she whispered     come back with us .      for a moment schwartz stiffened in rebellion  then he drooped .   he said wearily     i  go  along  you     but the statement was drowned in the sudden blare of the store   s loud speaker system .      attention .  attention .  attention .  the management requests that all patrons of the store leave by the fifth street exit in orderly fashion .  you will present your registration cards to the guards at the door .  it is essential that this be done rapidly .  attention .  attention .  attention .      the message was repeated three times  the last time over the sound of scuffling feet as crowds were beginning to line up at the exits .  a many tongued cry was making itself heard  asking in various fashions the forever unanswerable question of    what   s happened .  what   s going on .      arvardan shrugged and said     let   s get on line  miss .  we   re leaving anyway .      but pola shook her head .     we can   t .  we can   t          why not .     the archaeologist frowned .   the girl merely shrank away from him .  how could she tell him that schwartz had no registration card .  who was he .  why had he been helping her .  she was in a whirl of suspicion and despair .   she said huskily     you   d better go  or you   ll get into trouble .      they were pouring out the elevators as the upper floors emptied .  arvardan  pola  and schwartz were a little island of solidity in the human river .   looking back on it later  arvardan realized that at this point he could have left the girl .  left her .  never seen her again .  have nothing to reproach himself with .  .  .  . and all would have been different .  the great galactic empire would have dissolved in chaos and destruction .   he did not leave the girl .  she was scarcely pretty in her fear and despair .  no one could be .  but arvardan felt disturbed at the sight of her helplessness .   he had taken a step away  and now he turned .     are you going to stay here .      she nodded .      but why .     he demanded .      because     and the tears now overflowed     i don   t know what else to do .      she was just a little  frightened girl  even if she was an earthie .  arvardan said  in a softer voice     if you   ll tell me what   s wrong  i   ll try to help .      there was no answer .   the three formed a tableau .  schwartz had sunk to the floor in a squatting posture  too sick at heart to try to follow the conversation  to be curious at the sudden emptiness of the store  to do anything but bury his head in his hands in the last unspoken and unuttered whimper of despair .  pola  weeping  knew only that she was more frightened than she had ever thought it possible for anyone to be .  arvardan  puzzled and waiting  tried clumsily and ineffectually to pat pola   s shoulder in encouraging fashion  and was conscious only of the fact that for the first time he had touched an earthgirl .   the little man came upon them thus .           conflict at chica     lieutenant marc claudy of the chica garrison yawned slowly and gazed into the middle distance with an ineffable boredom .  he was completing his second year of duty on earth and waited yearningly for replacement .   nowhere in the galaxy was the problem of maintaining a garrison quite so complicated as it was on this horrible world .  on other planets there existed a certain camaraderie between soldier and civilian  particularly female civilian .  there was a sense of freedom and openness .   but here the garrison was a prison .  there were the radiation proof barracks and the filtered atmosphere  free of radioactive dust .  there was the lead impregnated clothing  cold and heavy  which could not be removed without grave risk .  as a corollary to that  fraternization with the population  assuming that the desperation of loneliness could drive a soldier to the society of an    earthie    girl  was out of the question .   what was left  then  but short snorts  long naps  and slow madness .   lieutenant claudy shook his head in a futile attempt to clear it  yawned again  sat up and began dragging on his shoes .  he looked at his watch and decided it was not yet quite time for evening chow .   and then he jumped to his feet  only one shoe on  acutely conscious of his uncombed hair  and saluted .   the colonel looked about him disparagingly but said nothing directly on the subject .  instead he directed crisply     lieutenant  there are reports of rioting in the business district .  you will take a decontamination squad to the dunham department store and take charge .  you will see to it that all your men are thoroughly protected against infection by radiation fever .         radiation fever .     cried the lieutenant .     pardon me  sir  but          you will be ready to leave in fifteen minutes     said the colonel coldly .     arvardan saw the little man first  and stiffened as the other made a little gesture of greeting .     hi  guv   ner .  hi  big fella .  tell the little lady there ain   t no call for the waterworks .       pola   s head had snapped up  her breath sucked in .  automatically she leaned toward the protecting bulk of arvardan  who  as automatically  put a protective arm about her .  it did not occur to him that that was the second time he had touched an earthgirl .   he said sharply     what do you want .      the little man with the sharp eyes stepped diffidently out from behind a counter piled high with packages .  he spoke in a manner which managed to be both ingratiating and impudent simultaneously .      here   s a weird go outside     he said     but it don   t need to bother you  miss .  i   ll get your man back to the institute for you .         what institute .     demanded pola fearfully .      aw  come off it     said the little man .     i   m natter  fella with the fruit stand right across the street from the institute for nuclear research .  i seen you here lots of times .         see here     said arvardan abruptly     what   s all this about .      natter   s little frame shook with merriment .     they think this fella here has radiation fever          radiation fever .     it came from both arvardan and pola at once .   natter nodded .     that   s right .  two cabbies ate with him and that   s what they said .  news like that kinda spreads  you know .         the guards outside     demanded pola     are just looking for someone with fever .         that   s right .         and just why aren   t you afraid of the fever .     demanded arvardan abruptly .     i take it that it was fear of contagion that caused the authorities to empty the store .         sure .  the authorities are waiting outside  afraid to come in  too .  they   re waiting for the outsiders    decontamination squad to get here .         and you   re not afraid of the fever  is that it .         why should i be .  this guy don   t have no fever .  look at him .  where   s the sores on his mouth .  he isn   t flushed .  his eyes are all right .  i know what fever looks like .  come on  miss  we   ll march out of here  then .      but pola was frightened again .     no  no .  we can   t .  he   s  he   s      she couldn   t go on .   natter said insinuatingly     i could take him out .  no questions asked .  no registration card necessary       pola failed to suppress a little cry  and arvardan said  with considerable distaste     what makes you so important .      natter laughed hoarsely .  he flipped his lapel .     messenger for the society of ancients .  nobody   ll ask me questions .         and what   s in it for you .         money .  you   re anxious and i can help you .  there ain   t no fairer than that .  it   s worth  say  a hundred credits to you  and it   s worth a hundred credits to me .  fifty credits now  fifty on delivery .      but pola whispered in horror     you   ll take him to the ancients .         what for .  he   s no good to them  and he   s worth a hundred credits to me .  if you wait for the outsiders  they   re liable to kill the fella before they find out he   s fever free .  you know outsiders  they don   t care if they kill an earthman or not .  they   d rather  in fact .      arvardan said     take the young lady with you .      but natter   s little eyes were very sharp and very sly .     oh no .  not that guv   ner .  i take what you call calculated risks .  i can get by with one  maybe not with two .  and if i only take one  i take the one what   s worth more .  ain   t that reasonable to you .         what     said arvardan     if i pick you up and pull your legs off .  what   ll happen then .      natter flinched  but found his voice  nevertheless  and managed a laugh .     why  then  you   re a dope .  they   ll get you anyway  and there   ll be murder  too  on the list .  .  .  . all right  guv   ner .  keep your hands off .         please     pola was dragging at arvardan   s arm     we must take a chance .  let him do as he says .  .  .  . you   ll be honest with us  w won   t you  mr .  natter .      natter   s lips were curling .     your big friend wrenched my arm .  he had no call to do that  and i don   t like nobody to push me around .  i   ll just take an extra hundred credits for that .  two hundred in all .         my father   ll pay you          one hundred in advance     he replied obdurately .      but i don   t have a hundred credits     pola wailed .      that   s all right  miss     said arvardan stonily .     i can swing it .      he opened his wallet and plucked out several bills .  he threw them at natter .     get going .         go with him  schwartz     whispered pola .   schwartz did  without comment  without caring .  he would have gone to hell at that moment with as little emotion .   and they were alone  staring at each other blankly .  it was perhaps the first time that pola had actually looked at arvardan  and she was amazed to find him tall and craggily handsome  calm and self  confident .  she had accepted him till now as an inchoate  unmotivated helper  but now  she grew suddenly shy  and all the events of the last hour or two were enmeshed and lost in a scurry of heartbeating .   they didn   t even know each other   s name .   she smiled and said     i   m pola shekt .      arvardan had not seen her smile before  and found himself interested in the phenomenon .  it was a glow that entered her face  a radiance .  it made him feel  but he put that thought away roughly .  an earthgirl .   so he said  with perhaps less cordiality than he intended     my name is bel arvardan .     he held out a bronzed hand  into which her little one was swallowed up for a moment .   she said     i must thank you for all your help .      arvardan shrugged it away .     shall we leave .  i mean  now that your friend is gone  safely  i trust .         i think we would have heard quite a noise if they had caught him  don   t you think so .     her eyes were pleading for confirmation of her hope  and he refused the temptation toward softness .      shall we go .      she was somehow frozen .     yes  why not .     sharply .   but there was a whining in the air  a shrill moan on the horizon  and the girl   s eyes were wide and her outstretched hand suddenly withdrawn again      what   s the matter now .     asked arvardan .      it   s the imperials .         and are you frightened of them too .     it was the self consciously non earthman arvardan who spoke  the sirian archaeologist .  prejudice or not  however the logic might be chopped and minced  the approach of imperial soldiers meant a trace of sanity and humanity .  there was room for condescension here  and he grew kind .      don   t worry about the outsiders     he said  even stooping to use their term for non earthmen .     i   ll handle them  miss shekt .      she was suddenly concerned .     oh no  don   t try anything like that .  just don   t talk to them at all .  do as they say  and don   t even look at them .      arvardan   s smile broadened .     the guards saw them while they were still a distance from the main entrance and fell back .  they emerged into a little space of emptiness and a strange hush .  the whine of the army cars was almost upon them .   and then there were armored cars in the square and groups of glass globe headed soldiers springing out therefrom .  the crowds scattered before them in panic  aided in their scramblings by clipped shouts and thrusts with the butt ends of the neuronic whips .   lieutenant claudy  in the lead  approached an earthman guard at the main entrance .      all right  you  who   s got the fever .      his face was slightly distorted within the enclosing glass  with its content of pure air .  his voice was slightly metallic as a result of radio amplification .   the guard bent his head in deep respect .     if it please your honor  we have isolated the patient within the store .  the two who were with the patient are now standing in the doorway before you .         they are  are they .  good .  let them stand there .  now in the first place  i want this mob out of here .  sergeant .  clear the square .      there was a grim efficiency in the proceedings thereafter .  the deepening twilight gloomed over chica as the crowd melted into the darkening air .  the streets were beginning to gleam in soft  artificial lighting .   lieutenant claudy tapped his heavy boots with the butt of his neuronic whip .     you   re sure the sick earthie is inside .         he has not left  your honor .  he must be .         well  we   ll assume he is and waste no time about it .  sergeant .  decontaminate the building .      a contingent of soldiers  hermetically sealed away from all contact with terrestrial environment  charged into the building .  a slow quarter hour passed  while arvardan watched all in absorbed fashion .  it was a field experiment in intercultural relationships that he was professionally reluctant to disturb .   the last of the soldiers were out again  and the store was shrouded in deepening night .      seal the doors .      another few minutes and then the cans of disinfectant which had been placed in several spots on each floor were discharged at long distance .  in the recesses of the building those cans were flung open and the thick vapors rolled out and curled up the walls  clinging to every square inch of surface  reaching through the air and into the inmost crannies .  no protoplasm  from germ to man  could remain alive in its presence  and chemical flushing of the most painstaking type would be required eventually for decontamination .   but now the lieutenant was approaching arvardan and pola .      what was his name .     there was not even cruelty in his voice  merely utter indifference .  an earthman  he thought  had been killed .  well  he had killed a fly that day also .  that made two .   he received no answer  pola bending her head meekly and arvardan watching curiously .  the imperial officer did not take his eyes off them .  he beckoned curtly .     check them for infection .      an officer bearing the insignia of the imperial medical corps approached them  and was not gentle in his investigation  his gloved hands pushed hard under their armpits and yanked at the corners of their mouths so that he might investigate the inner surfaces of their cheeks .      no infection  lieutenant .  if they had been exposed this afternoon  the stigmata would be clearly visible by now if infection had occurred .         umm .     lieutenant claudy carefully removed his globe and enjoyed the touch of    live    air  even that of earth .  he tucked the ungainly glass object into the crook of his left elbow and said harshly     your name  earthie squaw .      the term itself was richly insulting  the tone in which it was uttered added disgrace to it  but pola showed no sign of resentment .      pola shekt  sir     she responded in a whisper .      your papers .      she reached into the small pocket of her white jacket and removed the pink folder .   he took it  flared it open in the light of his pocket flash  and studied it .  then he tossed it back .  it fell  fluttering  to the floor  and pola bent quickly for it .      stand up     the officer ordered impatiently  and kicked the booklet out of reach .  pola  white faced  snatched her fingers away .   arvardan frowned and decided it was time to interfere .  he said     say  look here  now .      the lieutenant turned on him in a flash  his lips drawn back .     what did you say  earthie .      pola was between them at once .     if you please  sir  this man has nothing to do with anything that has happened today .  i never saw him before       the lieutenant yanked her aside .     i said  what did you say  earthie .      arvardan returned his stare coolly .     i said  look here  now .  and i was going to say further that i don   t like the way you treat women and that i   d advise you to improve your manners .      he was far too irritated to correct the lieutenant   s impression of his planetary origin .   lieutenant claudy smiled without humor .  .  . and where have you been brought up  earthie .  don   t you believe in saying    sir    when you address a man .  you don   t know your place  do you .  well  it   s been a while since i   ve had the pleasure of teaching the way of life to a nice big earthie buck .  here  how   s this       and quickly  like the flick of a snake  his open palm was out and across arvardan   s face  back and forth  once  twice .  arvardan stepped back in surprise and then felt the roaring in his ears .  his hand shot out to catch the extended arm that pecked at him .  he saw the other   s face twist in surprise  the muscles in his shoulders writhed easily .   the lieutenant was on the pavement with a crashing thud that sent the glass globe rolling into shattered fragments .  he lay still  and arvardan   s half smile was ferocious .  he dusted his hands lightly .  .  . any other bastard here think he can play pattycake on my face .      but the sergeant had raised his neuronic whip    .  the contact closed and there was the dim violet flash that reached out and licked at the tall archaeologist .   every muscle in arvardan   s body stiffened in unbearable pain  and he sank slowly to his knees .  then  with total paralysis upon him  he blacked out .     when arvardan swam out of the haze he was conscious first of all of a wash of welcome coolness on his forehead .  he tried to open his eyes and found his lids reacting as if swinging on rusty hinges .  he let them remain closed and  with infinitely slow jerks  each fragmentary muscular movement shooting pins through him   lifted his arm to his face .   a soft  damp towel  held by a little hand .  .  .   he forced an eye open and battled with the mist .      pola     he said .   there was a little cry of sudden joy .     yes .  how do you feel .         as if i were dead     he croaked     without the advantage of losing pain .  .  .  . what happened .         we were carted off to the military base .  the colonel   s been in here .  they   ve searched you  and i don   t know what they   re going to do  but  oh  mr .  arvardan  you shouldn   t ever have struck the lieutenant .  i think you broke his arm .       a faint smile wrenched at arvardan   s face .     good .  i wish i   d broken his back .         but resisting an imperial officer  it   s a capital offense .     her voice was a horrified whisper .      indeed .  we   ll see about that .         ssh .  they   re coming back .      arvardan closed his eyes and relaxed .  pola   s cry was faint and far off in his ears  and when he felt the hypodermic   s thrust he could not gather his muscles into motion .   and then there was the wash of wonderful soothing nonpain along his veins and nerves .  his arms unknotted and his back released itself slowly from its rigid arch  settling down .  he fluttered his eyelids rapidly and  with a thrust of his el .  bow  sat up .       the colonel was regarding him thoughtfully  pola  apprehensively  yet  somehow  joyfully .   the colonel said     well  dr .  arvardan  we seem to have had an unpleasant contretemps in the city this evening .      dr .  arvardan .  pola realized the little she knew about him  not even his occupation .  .  .  . she had never felt quite like this .   arvardan laughed shortly .     unpleasant  you say .  i consider that a rather inadequate adjective .         you have broken the arm of an officer of the empire about the performance of his duty .         that officer struck me first .  his duty in no way included the necessity for grossly insulting me  both verbally and physically .  in doing so he forfeited any claim he might have to treatment as an officer and gentleman .  as a free citizen of the empire  i had every right to resent such cavalier  not to say illegal  treatment .      the colonel harumphed and seemed at a loss for words .  pola stared at both of them with wide  unbelieving eyes .   finally the colonel said softly     well  i need not say that i consider the whole incident to have been unfortunate .  apparently the pain and indignity involved have been equally spread on both sides .  it may be best to forget this matter .         forget .  i think not .  i have been a guest at the pro .  curator   s palace  and he may be interested in hearing exactly in what manner his garrison maintains order on earth .         now  dr .  arvardan  if i assure you that you will receive a public apology          to hell with that .  what do you intend doing with miss shekt .         what would you suggest .         that you free her instantly  return her papers  and tender your apologies  right now .      the colonel reddened  then said with an effort     of course .     he turned to pola .     if the young lady will accept my deepest regrets          they had left the dark garrison walls behind them .  it had been a short and silent ten minute air taxi ride to the city proper  and now they stood at the deserted blackness of the institute .  it was past midnight .   pola said     i don   t think i quite understand .  you must be very important .  it seems silly of me not to know your name .  i didn   t ever imagine that outsiders could treat an earthman so .      arvardan felt oddly reluctant and yet compelled to end the fiction .     i   m not an earthman  pola .  i   m an archaeologist from the sirian sector .      she turned on him quickly  her face white in the moonlight .  for the space of a slow count to ten she said nothing .     then you outfaced the soldiers because you were safe  after all  and knew it .  and i thought  i should have known .      there was an outraged bitterness about her .     i humbly beg your pardon  sir  if at any time today  in my ignorance  i affected any disrespectful familiarity with you          pola     he cried angrily     what   s the matter .  what if i   m not an earthman .  how does that make me different from what i seemed to you to be five minutes ago .         you might have told me  sir .         i   m not asking you to call me    sir .     don   t be like the rest of them  will you .         like the rest of whom  sir .  the rest of the disgusting animals that live on earth .  .  .  . i owe you a hundred credits .         forget it     said arvardan disgustedly .      i cannot follow that order .  if you   ll give me your address  i will send you a money order for the amount tomorrow .      arvardan was suddenly brutal .     you owe me much more than a hundred credits .      pola bit her lip and said in lowered tones     it is the only part of my great debt  sir  that i can repay .  your address .         state house      he flung at her across his shoulder .  he was lost in the night .   and pola found herself weeping     shekt met pola at the door of his office .      he   s back     he said .     a little thin man brought him .         good .     she was having difficulty speaking .      he asked for two hundred credits .  i gave it to him .         he was to ask for one hundred  but never mind .      she brushed past her father .  he said wistfully     i was terribly worried .  the commotions in the neighborhood  i dared not ask  i might have endangered you .         it   s all right .  nothing   s happened .  .  .  . let me sleep here tonight  father .      but not all her weariness could make her sleep  for something had happened .  she had met a man  and he was an outsider .   but she had his address .  she had his address .            interpretation of events     they presented a complete contrast  these two earthmen  one with the greatest semblance of power on earth  and one with the greatest reality .   thus the high minister was the most important earthman on earth  the recognized ruler of the planet by direct and definite decree of the emperor of all the galaxy  subject  of course  to the orders of the emperor   s procurator .  his secretary seemed no one at all  really  merely a member of the society of ancients  appointed  theoretically  by the high minister to take care of certain unspecified details  and dismissable  theoretically  at will .   the high minister was known to all the earth and was looked up to as the supreme arbiter on matters of custom .  it was he who announced the exemptions to the sixty and it was he who judged the breakers of ritual  the defiers of rationing and of production schedules  the invaders of restricted territory and so on .  the secretary  on the other hand  was known to nobody  not even by name  except to the society of ancients and  of course  to the high minister himself .   the high minister had a command of language and made frequent speeches to the people  speeches of high emotional content and copious flow of sentiment .  he had fair hair  worn long  and a delicate and patrician countenance .  the secretary  snub nosed and wry faced  preferred a short word to a long one  a grunt to a word  and silence to a grunt  at least in public .   it was the high minister  of course  who had the semblance of power  the secretary who had the reality .  and in the privacy of the high minister   s office that circumstance was quite plain .   for the high minister was pettishly puzzled and the secretary coolly indifferent .      what i don   t see     said the high minister     is the connection of all these reports you bring me .  reports  reports .     he lifted an arm above his head and struck viciously at an imaginary heap of paper .     i don   t have the time for them .         exactly     said the secretary coldly .     it is why you hire me .  i read them  digest them  transmit them .         well  good balkis  about your business  then .  and quickly  since these are minor matters .         minor .  your excellency may lose a great deal someday if your judgment is not sharpened .  .  .  . let us see what these reports mean  and i shall then ask you if you still consider them minor .  first we have the original report  now seven days old  from shekt   s underling  and it is that which first put me on the trail .         what trail .      balkis   s smile was faintly bitter .     may i recall to your excellency certain important projects which have been nurtured here on earth for several years .         ssh .     the high minister  in sudden loss of dignity  could not forbear looking about hastily .      your excellency  it is not nervousness but confidence that will win for us .  .  .  . you know further that the success of this project has depended upon the judicious use of shekt   s little toy  the synapsifier .  until now  at least as far as we know  it has been utilized under our direction only  and for definite purposes .  and now  without warning  shekt has synapsified an unknown man  in complete violation of our orders .         this     said the high minister     is a simple matter .  discipline shekt  take the treated man into custody  and end the matter .          no  no .  you are far too straightforward  your excellency .  you miss the point .  it is not what shekt has done  but why he has done so .  note that there exists a coincidence about the matter  one of a considerable series of subsequent coincidences .  the procurator of earth had visited shekt that same day  and shekt himself reported to us  in loyal and trustworthy fashion  all that had passed between them .  ennius had wanted the synapsifier for imperial use .  he made promise  it seems  of great help and gracious assistance from the emperor .         hmm     said the high minister .      you are intrigued .  a compromise such as that seems attractive as compared to the dangers attending our present course .  .  .  . do you remember the promises of food to us during the famine five years ago .  do you .  shipments were refused because we lacked imperial credits  and earth manufactured products would not be accepted  as being radioactively contaminated .  was there a free gift of food as promised .  was there even a loan .  a hundred thousand died of starvation .  don   t put your trust in outsider promises .      but that does not matter .  what does is that shekt made a great display of loyalty .  surely we could never doubt him again .  with compounded certainty  we could not suspect him of treason that very day    yet so it came to pass .         you mean in this unauthorized experiment  balkis .         i do  your excellency .  who was the man treated .  we have photographs of him and  with the help of shekt   s technician  retinal patterns .  a check with the planetary registry shows no record of him .  the conclusion must therefore be reached that he is no earthman  but an outsider .  furthermore  shekt must have been aware of it  since a registration card cannot be forged or transferred  if checked with retinal patterns .  so  in simple fashion  the unalterable facts lead us to the conclusion that shekt has synapsified  knowingly  an outsider .  and why .  .  .  .      the answer to that may be disturbingly simple .  shekt is not an ideal instrument for our purposes .  in his youth he was an assimilationist  he even once stood for election to the washenn council on a platform of conciliation with the empire .  he was defeated  by the way .      the high minister interrupted .     i didn   t know that .         that he was defeated .         no  that he ran .  why wasn   t i informed of this .  shekt is a very dangerous man in the position he now holds .      balkis smiled softly and tolerantly .     shekt invented the synapsifier and still represents the one man truly experienced in its operation .  he has always been watched  and will now be watched more closely than ever .  do not forget that a traitor within our ranks  known to us  can do more harm to the enemy than a loyal man can do good to us .      now  let us continue to deal with the facts .  shekt has synapsified an outsider .  why .  there is only one reason why a synapsifier can possibly be used  to improve a mind .  and why that .  because only so can the minds of our scientists  already improved by synapsification  be overtaken .  eh .  this means that the empire has at least a faint suspicion of what is going on upon earth .  is that minor  your excellency .      there was a scattered dew on the high minister   s forehead .     do you really think so .         the facts are a jigsaw puzzle that can fit only one way .  the outsider so treated was a man of undistinguished  even contemptible  appearance .  a good stroke  too  since a bald and fat old man can still be the empire   s most skilled espionage agent .  oh yes .  yes .  who else could be trusted on a mission such as this .  .  .  . but we have followed this stranger  whose alias  by the way  is schwartz  as far as we can .  let us take this second file of reports .      the high minister cast an eye upon them .     the ones concerning bel arvardan .         dr .  bel arvardan     assented balkis     eminent archaeologist of the gallant sirian sector  those worlds of brave and chivalrous bigots     he spat the last out .  then     well  never mind .  in any case  we have here a queer mirror image to schwartz  an almost poetic contrast .  he is not unknown  but  instead  a famous figure .  he is not a secret intruder  but one who comes floating on a tidal wave of publicity .  we are warned of him not by an obscure technician  but by the procurator of earth himself .         do you think there is a connection  balkis .         your excellency may suppose it possible that one may be designed to distract our attention from the other .  or else  since the ruling classes of the empire are skilled enough in intrigue  we have an example of two methods of camouflage .  in the case of schwartz  the lights are put out .  in the case of arvardan  the lights are flashed in our eyes .  in neither case are we intended to see anything .  .  .  . come  of what did ennius warn us concerning arvardan .      the high minister rubbed his nose thoughtfully .  .  . arvardan  he said  was on an archaeological expedition under imperial sponsorship and wished to enter the forbidden areas for scientific purposes .  no sacrilege  he said  was intended  and if we could stop him in gentle fashion  he would back our action to the imperial council .  something like that .          so then we will watch arvardan closely  but for what purpose .  why  to see that he makes no unauthorized entry into the forbidden areas .  here   s the head of an archaeological expedition without men  ships  or equipment .  here   s an outsider who does not remain at everest  where he belongs  but wanders about earth  for some reason  and goes to chica first .  and how is our attention distracted from all these most curious and suspicious circumstances .  why  by urging us to watch carefully something that is of no importance .      but notice  your excellency  that schwartz was kept hidden in the institute for nuclear research for six days .  and then he escaped .  isn   t that strange .  the door  suddenly  wasn   t locked .  the corridor  suddenly  wasn   t guarded .  what queer negligence .  and on what day was it that he escaped .  why  on the same day that arvardan arrived at chica .  a second peculiar coincidence .         you think  then .  .  .     said the high minister tensely .      i think that schwartz is the outsider agent on earth  that shekt is the contact man with the assimilationist traitors among us  and that arvardan is the contact man with the empire .  observe the skill with which the meeting between schwartz and arvardan was arranged .  schwartz is allowed to escape  and after an appropriate interval his nurse  shekt   s daughter  by a not too surprising additional coincidence  is out after him .  if anything were to go wrong with their split second timetable  it is obvious that she would have found him suddenly  that he would have become a poor  sick patient for the benefit of anyone   s curiosity  that he would have been brought back to safety for another attempt later .  in fact  two overcurious cabbies were told that he was a sick man  and that  ironically enough  backfired upon them .      follow it closely  now .  schwartz and arvardan meet first in a foodomat .  they are  apparently  unaware of each other   s existence .  it is a preliminary meeting  designed  simply  to indicate that all has gone well so far and that the next step may be taken .  .  .  . at least they don   t underestimate us  which is gratifying .      then schwartz leaves  a few minutes later arvardan leaves and the shekt girl meets him .  it is stop watch timing .  together  after playing a little part for the benefit of the afore mentioned cabbies  they head for the dunham department store  and now all three are together .  where else but a department store .  it is an ideal meeting place .  it has a secrecy no cave in the mountains could duplicate .  too open to be suspected .  too crowded to be stalked .  wonderful  wonderful  i give credit to my opponent .      the high minister writhed in his chair .     if our opponent deserves too much credit  he will win .         impossible .  he is already defeated .  and in that respect we must give credit to the excellent natter .         and who is natter .         an insignificant agent who must be used to the limit after this .  his actions yesterday could not have been improved upon .  his long range assignment has been to watch shekt .  for the purpose  he keeps a fruit stand across the street from the institute .  for the last week he has been specifically instructed to watch the development of the schwartz affair .      he was on hand when the man  known to him through photographs and through a glimpse at the time he was first brought to the institute  escaped  he observed every action  himself unobserved  and it is his report that details yesterday   s events .  with incredible intuition  he decided that the entire purpose of the    escape    was to arrange a meeting with arvardan .  he felt himself to be not in a position  single handed  to exploit that meeting  so he decided to prevent it .  the cabbies  to whom the shekt girl had described schwartz as being sick  speculated on radiation fever .  natter seized on that with the swiftness of genius .  as soon as he observed the meeting in the department store  he reported the case of fever and the local authorities at chica were  praised be earth  intelligent enough to co operate quickly .      the store was emptied  and the camouflage which they counted upon to hide their conversation was stripped from them .  they were alone and very conspicuous in the store .  natter went further .  he approached them and talked them into allowing him to escort schwartz back to the institute .  they agreed .  what could they do .  .  .  . so that the day ended without a single word passing between arvardan and schwartz .      nor did he commit the folly of arresting schwartz .  the two are still in ignorance of their detection and will yet lead us to bigger game     and natter went further still .  he notified the imperial garrison  and that is beyond praise .  it presented arvardan with a situation he could not possibly have counted upon .  he must either reveal himself to be an outsider and destroy his usefulness  which apparently depends upon conducting himself upon earth as though he were an earthman  or he must keep the fact secret and subject himself to whatever unpleasantness might result .  he took the more heroic alternative  and even broke the arm of an officer of the empire  in his passion for realism .  that  at least  must be remembered in his favor .      it is significant that his actions were as they were .  why should he  an outsider  expose himself to the neuronic whip for an earthgirl if the matter at stake was not supremely important .      both fists of the high minister were on the desk before him .  he glowered savagely  the long  smooth lines of his face crumpled in distress .     it is well for you  balkis  from such meager details  to construct the spider web you do .  it is skillfully done  and i feel that it is as you say .  logic leaves us no other alternative .  .  .  . but it means that they are too close  balkis .  they are too close .  .  .  . and they will have no mercy this time .      balkis shrugged .     they cannot be too close  or  in a case of such potential destructiveness for all the empire  they would have already struck .  .  .  . and their time is running short .  arvardan must still meet with schwartz if anything is to be accomplished  and so i can predict for you the future .         do so  do so .         schwartz must be sent away now and events allowed to quiet down from their current high pitch .         but where will he be sent .         we know that too .  schwartz was brought to the institute by a man  obviously a farmer .  descriptions reached us from both shekt   s technician and from natter .  we went through the registration data of every farmer within sixty miles of chica  and natter identified one arbin maren as the man .  the technician supported that decision independently .  we investigated the man quietly  and it seems that is is supporting a father in law  a helpless cripple .  in evasion of the sixty .      the high minister pounded the table .     such cases are entirely too frequent  balkis .  the laws must be tightened          it is not now the point  your excellency .  what is important is the fact that since the farmer is violating the customs  he can be blackmailed .         oh .  .  .         shekt  and his outsider allies  need a tool for just such a case  that is  where schwartz must remain in seclusion for a longer period than he can safely stay hidden in the institute .  this farmer  probably helpless and innocent  is perfect    for the purpose .  well  he will be watched .  schwartz will never be out of sight .  .  .  . now  eventually another meeting between him and arvardan will have to be arranged  and that time we will be prepared .  do you understand everything now .         i do .         well  praise earth .  then i will leave you now .     and  with a sardonic smile  he added     with your permission  of course .       and the high minister  completely oblivious to the sarcasm  waved a hand in dismissal .     the secretary  on his way to his own small office  was alone  and  when alone  his thoughts sometimes escaped from beneath his firm control and disported themselves in the secrecy of his mind .   they concerned themselves very little with dr .  shekt  schwartz  arvardan  least of all with the high minister .   instead there was the picture of a planet  trantor  from whose huge  planet wide metropolis all the galaxy was ruled .  and there was the picture of a palace whose spires and sweeping arches he had never seen in reality  that no other earthman had ever seen .  he thought of the invisible lines of power and glory that swept from sun to sun in gathering strings  ropes  and cables to that central palace and to that abstraction  the emperor  who was  after all  merely a man .   his mind held that thought fixedly  the thought of that power which could alone bestow a divinity during life  concentrated in one who was merely human .   merely human .  like himself .   he could be             the mind that changed     the coming of the change was dim in joseph schwartz   s mind .  many times  in the absolute quiet of the night  how much more quiet the nights were now  were they ever noisy and bright and clanging with the life of energetic millions .    in the new quiet  he traced it back .  he would have liked to say that here  here was the moment .   there was first that old  shattering day of fear when he was alone in a strange world  a day as misty in his mind now as the memory of chicago itself .  there was the trip to chica  and its strange  complicated ending .  he thought of that often .   something about a machine  pills he had taken .  days of recuperation and then the escape  the wandering  the inexplicable events that last hour in the department store .  he couldn   t possibly remember that part correctly .  yet  in the two months since  how clear everything was  how unfaulted his memory .   even then things had begun to seem strange .  he had been sensitive to atmosphere .  the old doctor and his daughter had been uneasy  even frightened .  had he known that then .  or had it just been a fugitive impression  strengthened by the hindsight of his thoughts since .   but then  in the department store  just before that big man had reached out and trapped him  just before that  he had become conscious of the coming snatch .  the warning had not been soon enough to save him  but it was a definite indication of the change .   and  since then  the headaches .  no  not quite headaches .  throbbings  rather  as though some hidden dynamo in his brain had started working and  with its unaccustomed action  was vibrating every bone of his skull .  there had been nothing like it in chicago  supposing his fantasy of chicago had meaning  or even during his first few days here in reality .   had they done something to him that day in chica .  the machine .  the pills  that had been anesthetic .  an operation .  and his thoughts  having reached that point for the hundredth time  stopped once more .   he had left chica the day after his abortive escape  and now the days passed easily .   there had been grew in his wheel chair  repeating words and pointing  or making motions  just as the girl  pola  had done before him .  until one day grew stopped speaking nonsense and began talking english .  or no  he himself  he  joseph schwartz  had stopped speaking english and had begun talking nonsense .  except that it wasn   t nonsense  any more .   it was so easy .  he learned to read in four days .  he surprised himself .  he had had a phenomenal memory once  in chicago  or it seemed to him that he had .  but he had not been capable of such feats .  yet grew did not seem surprised .   schwartz gave it up .   then  when the autumn had become really golden  things were clear again  and he was out in the fields working .  it was amazing  the way he picked it up .  there it was again  he never made a mistake .  there were complicated machines that he could run without trouble after a single explanation .   he waited for the cold weather and it never quite came .  the winter was spent in clearing ground  in fertilizing  in preparing for the spring planting in a dozen ways .   he questioned grew  tried to explain what snow was  but the latter only stared and said     frozen water falling like rain  eh .  oh .  the word for that is snow .  i understand it does that on other planets but not on earth .      schwartz watched the temperature thereafter and found that it scarcely varied from day to day  and yet the days shortened  as would be expected from a northerly location  say as northerly as chicago .  he wondered if he was on earth .   he tried reading some of grew   s book films but gave up .  people were people still  but the minutiae of daily life  the knowledge of which was taken for granted  the historical and sociological allusions that meant nothing to him  forced him back .   the puzzles continued .  the uniformly warm rains  the wild instructions he received to remain away from certain regions .  for instance  there had been the evening that he had finally become too intrigued by the shining horizon  the blue glow to the south .  .  .   he had slipped off after supper  and when not a mile had passed  the almost noiseless whir of the biwheel engine came up behind him and arbin   s angry shout rang out in the evening air .  he had stopped and had been taken back .   arbin had paced back and forth before him and had said     you must stay away from anywhere that it shines at night .      schwartz had asked mildly     why .      and the answer came with biting incision     because it is forbidden .     a long pause  then     you really don   t know what it   s like out there  schwartz .      schwartz spread his hands .   arbin said     where do you come from .  are you an  an outsider .         what   s an outsider .      arbin shrugged and left .   but that night had had a great importance for schwartz  for it was during that short mile toward the shiningness that the strangeness in his mind had coalesced into the mind touch .  it was what he called it  and the closest he had come  either then or thereafter  to describing it .   he had been alone in the darkling purple .  his own footsteps against the springy pavement were muted .  he hadn   t seen anybody .  he hadn   t heard anybody .  he hadn   t touched anything .   not exactly .  .  . it had been something like a touch  but not anywhere on his body .  it was in his mind .  .  .  . not exactly a touch  but a presence  a somethingness there like a velvety tickle .   then there had been two  two touches  distinct  apart .  and the second  how could he tell them apart .   had grown louder  no  that wasn   t the right word    it had grown distincter  more definite .   and then he knew it was arbin .  he knew it five minutes  at least  before he caught the sound of the biwheel  ten minutes before he laid eyes on arbin .   thereafter it occurred again and again with increasing frequency .   it began to dawn on him that he always knew when arbin  loa  or grew was within a hundred feet of himself  even when he had no reason for knowing  even when he had every reason to suppose the opposite .  it was a hard thing to take for granted  yet it began to seem so natural .   he experimented  and found that he knew exactly where any of them were  at any time .  he could distinguish between them  for the mind touch differed from person to person .  not once had he the nerve to mention it to the others .   and sometimes he would wonder what that first mind touch on the road to the shiningness had been .  it had been neither arbin  loa  nor grew .  well .  did it make a difference .   it did later .  he had come across the touch again  the same one  when he brought in the cattle one evening .  he came to arbin then and said       what about that patch of woods past the south hills  arbin .         nothing about it     was the gruff answer .     it   s ministerial ground .         what   s that .      arbin seemed annoyed .     it   s of no importance to you  is it .  they call it ministerial ground because it is the property of the high minister .         why isn   t it cultivated .         it   s not intended for that .     arbin   s voice was shocked .     it was a great center .  in ancient days .  it is very sacred and must not be disturbed .  look  schwartz  if you want to remain here safely  curb your curiosity and tend to your job .         but if it   s so sacred  then nobody can live there .         exactly .  you   re right .         are you sure .         i   m sure .  .  .  . and you   re not to trespass .  it will mean the end for you .         i won   t .      schwartz walked away  wondering and oddly uneasy .  it was from that wooded ground that the mind touch came  quite powerfully  and now something additional had been added to the sensation .  it was an unfriendly touch  a threatening touch .   why .  why .   and still he dared not speak .  they would not have believed him  and something unpleasant would happen to him as a consequence .  he knew that too .  he knew too much  in fact .   he was younger these days  also .  not so much in the physical sense  to be sure .  he was thinner in his stomach and broader in his shoulders .  his muscles were harder and springier and his digestion was better .  that was the result of work in the open .  but it was something else he was chiefly conscious of .  it was his way of thinking .   old men tend to forget what thought was like in their youth  they forget the quickness of the mental jump  the daring of the youthful intuition  the agility of the fresh insight .  they become accustomed to the more plodding varieties of reason  and because this is more than made up by the accumulation of experience  old men think themselves wiser than the young .   but to schwartz experience remained  and it was with a sharp delight that he found he could understand things at a bound  that he gradually progressed from following arbin   s explanations to anticipating them  to leaping on ahead .  as a result  he felt young in a far more subtle way than any amount of physical excellence could account for .   two months passed  and it all came out  over a game of chess with grew in the arbor .   chess  somehow  hadn   t changed  except for the names of the pieces .  it was as he remembered it  and therefore it was always a comfort to him .  at least  in this one respect  his poor memory did not play him false .   grew told him of variations of chess .  there was fourhanded chess  in which each player had a board  touching each other at the corners  with a fifth board filling the hollow in the center as a common no man   s land .  there were three dimensional chess games in which eight transparent boards were placed one over the other and in which each piece moved in three dimensions as they formerly moved in two  and in which the number of pieces and pawns were doubled  the win coming only when a simultaneous check of both enemy kings occurred .  there were even the popular varieties  in which the original position of the chessmen were decided by throws of the dice  or where certain squares conferred advantages or disadvantages to the pieces upon them  or where new pieces with strange properties were introduced .   but chess itself  the original and unchangeable  was the same  and the tournament between schwartz and grew had completed its first fifty games .   schwartz had a bare knowledge of the moves when he began  so that he lost constantly in the first games .  but that had changed and losing games were becoming rarer .  gradually grew had grown slow and cautious  had taken to smoking his pipe into glowing embers in the intervals between moves  and had finally subsided into rebellious and querulous losses .   grew was white and his pawn was already on king   .      let   s go     he urged sourly .  his teeth were clamped hard on his pipe and his eyes were already searching the board tensely .   schwartz took his seat in the gathering twilight and sighed .  the games were really becoming uninteresting as more and more he became aware of the nature of grew   s moves before they could be made .  it was as if grew had a misty window in his skull .  and the fact that he himself knew  almost instinctively  the proper course of chess play to take was simply of a piece with the rest of his problem .   they used a    night board     one that glowed in the darkness in a checkered blue and orange glimmer .  the pieces  ordinary lumpish figures of a reddish clay in the sunlight  were metamorphosed at night .  half were bathed in a creamy whiteness that lent them the look of cold and shining porcelain  and the others sparked in tiny glitters of red .   the first moves were rapid .  schwartz   s own king   s pawn met the enemy advance head on .  grew brought out his king   s knight to bishop    schwartz countered with queen   s knight to bishop   .  then the white bishop leaped to queen   s knight    and schwartz   s queen   s rook   s pawn slid ahead a square to drive it back to rook   .  he then advanced his other knight to bishop   .   the shining pieces slid across the board with an eery volition of their own as the grasping fingers lost themselves in the night .   schwartz was frightened .  he might be revealing insanity  but he had to know .  he said abruptly     where am i .      grew looked up in the midst of a deliberate move of his queen   s knight to bishop   and said     what .      schwartz didn   t know the word for    country     or    nation .     he said     what world is this .     and moved his bishop to king   .      earth     was the short reply  and grew castled with great emphasis  first the tall figurine that was the king  moving  and then the lumpish rook topping it and resting on the other side .   that was a thoroughly unsatisfactory answer .  the word grew had used schwartz translated in his mind as    earth .     but what was    earth    .  any planet is    earth    to those that live on it .  he advanced his queen   s knight   s pawn two spaces  and again grew   s bishop had to retreat  to knight   this time .  then schwartz and grew  each in turn  advanced the queen   s pawn one space  each freeing his bishop for the battle in the center that was soon to begin .   schwartz asked  as calmly and casually as he could     what year is this .     he castled .   grew paused .  he might have been startled .     what is it you   re harping on today .  don   t you want to play .  if it will make you happy  this is     .     he added sarcastically     g . e .     he stared frowningly at the board  then slammed his queen   s knight to queen    where it made its first assault .   schwartz dodged quickly  moving his own queen    s knight to rook   in counterattack .  the skirmish was on in earnest .  grew   s knight seized the bishop  which leaped upward in a bath of red fire to be dropped with a sharp click into the box where it might lie  a buried warrior  until the next game .  and then the conquering knight fell instantly to schwartz   s queen .  in a moment of overcaution  grew   s attack faltered and he moved his remaining knight back to the haven of king i  where it was relatively useless .  schwartz   s queen   s knight now repeated the first exchange  taking the bishop and falling prey in its turn to the rook   s pawn .   now another pause  and schwartz asked mildly     what   s g . e .  .         what .     demanded grew bad humoredly .     oh  you mean you   re still wondering what year this is .  of all the fool  well  i keep forgetting you just learned to talk a month or so ago .  but you   re intelligent .  don   t you really know .  well  it   s     of the galactic era .  galactic era  g . e .   see .  it   s     years since the foundation of the galactic empire      years since the coronation of frankenn the first .  now  please  it   s your move .      but the knight that schwartz held was swallowed up in the grip of his hand for the moment .  he was in a fury of frustration .  he said     just one minute     and put the knight down on queen   .     do you recognize any of these names .  america  asia  the united states  russia  europe      he groped for identification .   in the darkness grew   s pipe was a sullen red glow and the dim shadow of him hunched over the shining chessboard as if it had the less life of the two .  he might have shaken his head curtly  but schwartz could not see that .  he didn   t have to .  he sensed the other   s negation as clearly as though a speech had been delivered .   schwartz tried again .     do you know where i can get a map .         no maps     growled grew     unless you want to risk your neck in chica .  i   m no geographer .  i never heard of the names you mention  either .  what are they .  people .      risk his neck .  why that .  schwartz felt the coldness gather .  had he committed a crime .  did grew know about it .   he asked doubtfully     the sun has nine planets  hasn   t it .         ten     was the uncompromising answer .   schwartz hesitated .  well  they might have discovered another that he hadn   t heard about .  but then why should grew have heard about it .  he counted on his fingers  and then     how about the sixth planet .  has it got rings .      grew was slowly moving the king   s bishop   s pawn forward two squares  and schwartz instantly did the same .   grew said     saturn  you mean .  of course it has rings .     he was calculating now .  he had the choice of taking either the bishop   s pawn or the king   s pawn  and the consequences of the choice were not too clear .      and is there an asteroid belt  little planets  between mars and jupiter .  i mean between the fourth and fifth planets .         yes     mumbled grew .  he was relighting his pipe and thinking feverishy .  schwartz caught that agonized uncertainty and was annoyed at it .  to him  now that he was sure of earth   s identity  the chess game was less than a trifle .  questions quivered along the inner surface of his skull  and one slipped out .      your book films are real  then .  there are other worlds .  with people .      and now grew looked up from the board  eyes probing uselessly in the darkness .     are you serious .         are there .         by the galaxy .  i believe you really don   t know .      schwartz felt humiliated in his ignorance .     please          of course there are worlds .  millions of them .  every star you see has worlds  and most of those you don   t see .  it   s all part of the empire .      delicately  inside  schwartz felt the faint echo of each of grew   s intense words as they sparked directly from mind to mind .  schwartz felt the mental contacts growing stronger with the days .  maybe  soon  he could hear those tiny words in his mind even when the person thinking them wasn   t talking .   and now  for the first time  he finally thought of an alternative to insanity .  had he passed through time  somehow .  slept through  perhaps .   he said huskily     how long since it   s all happened  grew .  how long since the time when there was only one planet .         what do you mean .     he was suddenly cautious .     are you a member of the ancients .         of the what .  i   m not a member of anything  but wasn   t earth once the only planet .  .  .  . well  wasn   t it .         the ancients say so     said grew grimly     but who knows .  who really knows .  the worlds up there have been existing all history long as far as i know .         but how long is that .         thousands of years  i suppose .  fifty thousand  a hundred   i can   t say .      thousands of years .  schwartz felt a gurgle in his throat and pressed it down in panic .  all that between two steps .  a breath  a moment  a flicker of time  and he had jumped thousands of years .  he felt himself shrinking back to amnesia .  his identification of the solar system must have been the result of imperfect memories penetrating the mist .   but now grew was making his next move  he was taking the other   s bishop   s pawn  and it was almost mechanically that schwartz noted mentally the fact that it was the wrong choice .  move fitted to move now with no conscious effort .  his king   s rook swooped forward to take the foremost of the now doubled white pawns .  white   s knight advanced again to bishop   .  schwartz   s bishop moved to knight    freeing itself for action .  grew followed suit my moving his own bishop to queen   .   schwartz paused before launching the final attack .  he said     earth is boss  isn   t it .         boss of what .         of the emp       but grew looked up with a roar at which the chessmen quivered .     listen  you  i   m tired of your questions .  are you a complete fool .  does earth look as if it   s boss of anything .     there was a smooth whir as grew   s wheel chair circled the table .  schwartz felt grasping fingers on his arm .      look .  look there .     grew   s voice was a whispered rasp .     you see the horizon .  you see it shine .         yes .         that is earth  all earth .  except here and there  where a few patches like this one exist .         i don   t understand .         earth    s crust is radioactive .  the soil glows  always glowed  will glow forever .  nothing can grow .  no one can live  you really didn   t know that .  why do you suppose we have the sixty .      the paralytic subsided .  he circled his chair about the table again .     it   s your move .      the sixty .  again a mind touch with an indefinable aura of menace .  schwartz   s chess pieces played themselves  while he wondered about it with a tight pressed heart .  his king   s pawn took the opposing bishop   s pawn .  grew moved his knight to queen   and schwartz   s rook side stepped the attack to knight   .  again grew   s knight attacked  moving to bishop    and schwartz   s rook avoided the issue again to knight   .  but now grew   s king   s rook   s pawn advanced one timorous square and schwartz   s rook slashed forward .  it took the knight   s pawn  checking the enemy king .  grew   s king promptly took the rook  but schwartz   s queen plugged the hole instantly  moving to knight   and checking .  grew   s king scurried to rook    and schwartz brought up his knight  placing it on king   .  grew moved his queen to king   in a strong attempt to mobilize his defenses  and schwartz countered by marching his queen forward two squares to knight    so that the fight was now in close quarters .  grew had no choice  he moved his queen to knight    and the two female majesties were now face to face .  schwartz   s knight pressed home  taking the opposing knight on bishop    and when the now attacked white bishop moved quickly to bishop    the knight followed to queen   .  grew hesitated for slow minutes  then advanced his outflanked queen up the long diagonal to take schwartz   s bishop .   then he paused and drew a relieved breath .  his sly opponent had a rook in danger with a check in the offing and his own queen ready to wreak havoc .  and he was ahead a rook to a pawn .      your move     he said with satisfaction .   schwartz said finally     what  what is the sixty .      there was a sharp unfriendliness to grew   s voice .     why do you ask that .  what are you after .         please     humbly .  he had little spirit left in him .     i am a man with no harm in me .  i don   t know who i am or what happened to me .  maybe i   m an amnesia case .         very likely     was the contemptuous reply .     are you escaping from the sixty .  answer truthfully .         but i tell you i don   t know what the sixty is .      it carried conviction .  there was a long silence .  to schwartz  grew   s mind touch was ominous  but he could not  quite  make out words .   grew said slowly     the sixty is your sixtieth year .  earth supports twenty million people  no more .  to live  you must produce .  if you cannot produce  you cannot live .  past sixty  you cannot produce .         and so .  .  .     schwartz   s mouth remained open .      you   re put away .  it doesn   t hurt .         you   re killed .         it   s not murder     stiffly .     it must be that way .  other worlds won   t take us  and we must make room for the children some way .  the older generation must make room for the younger .         suppose you don   t tell them you   re sixty .         why shouldn   t you .  life after sixty is no joke .  .  .  . and there   s a census every ten years to catch anyone who is foolish enough to try to live .  besides  they have your age on record .         not mine .     the words slipped out  schwartz couldn   t stop them .     besides  i   m only fifty  next birthday .         it doesn   t matter .  they can check by your bone structure .  don   t you know that .  there   s no way of masking it .  they   ll get me next time .  .  .  . say  it   s your move .      schwartz disregarded the urging .     you mean they   ll          sure  i   m only fifty five  but look at my legs .  i can   t work  can i .  there are three of us registered in our family  and our quota is adjusted on a basis of three workers .  when i had the stroke i should have been reported  and then the quota would have been reduced .  but i would have gotten a premature sixty  and arbin and loa wouldn   t do it .  they   re fools  because it has meant hard work for them  till you came along .  and they   ll get me next year  anyway .  .  .  .  your move .         is next year the census .         that   s right    . your move .         wait .     urgently .     is everyone put away after sixty .  no exceptions at all .         not for you and me .  the high minister lives a full life  and members of the society of ancients  certain scientists or those performing some great service .  not many qualify .  maybe a dozen a year .  .  .  . it   s your move .         who decides who qualifies .         the high minister  of course .  are you moving .      but schwartz stood up .     never mind .  it   s checkmate in five moves .  my queen is going to take your pawn to check you  you   ve got to move to knight    i bring up the knight to check you at king    you must move to bishop    my queen checks you at king    you must move to knight    my queen goes to knight    and when you   re then forced to rook    my queen mates you at rook   .      good game     he added automatically .   grew stared long at the board  then  with a cry  dashed it from the table .  the gleaming pieces rolled dejectedly about on the lawn .      you and your damned distracting chatter     yelled grew .   but schwartz was conscious of nothing .  nothing except the overwhelming necessity of escaping the sixty .  for though browning said     grow old along with me .   the best is yet to be .  .  .     that was in an earth of teeming billions and of unlimited food .  the best that was now to be was the sixty  and death .   schwartz was sixty two .   sixty two .  .  .            the mind that killed     it worked out so neatly in schwartz   s methodical mind .  since he did not want to die  he would have to leave the farm .  if he stayed where he was  the census would come  and with it  death .   leave the farm  then .  but where would he go .   there was the  what was it  a hospital .   in chica .  they had taken care of him before .  and why .  because he had been a medical    case .     but wasn   t he still a case .  and he could talk now  he could give them the symptoms  which he couldn   t before .  he could even tell them about the mind touch .   or did everyone have the mind touch .  was there any way he could tell .  .  .  . none of the others had it .  not arbin or loa or grew .  he knew that .  they had no way of telling where he was unless they saw or heard him .  why  he couldn   t beat grew in chess if grew could    wait  now  chess was a popular game .  and it couldn   t be played if people had the mind touch .  not really .   so that made him a peculiarity  a psychological specimen .  it might not be a particularly gay life  being a specimen  but it would keep him alive   and suppose one considered the new possibility that had just arisen .  suppose he were not an amnesiac but a man who had stumbled through time .  why  then  in addition to the mind touch  he was a man from the past .  he was a historical specimen  an archaeological specimen  they couldn   t kill him .   if they believed him .   hmm  if they believed him .   that doctor would believe .  he had needed a shave that morning arbin took him to chica .  he remembered that very well .  after that his hair never grew  so they must have done something to him .  that meant that the doctor knew that he  he  schwartz  had had hair on his face .  wouldn   t that be significant .  grew and arbin never shaved .  grew had once told him that only animals had hair on their face .   so he had to get to the doctor .   what was his name .  shekt .  .  .  . shekt  that was right .     but he knew so little of this horrible world .  to leave by night or cross country would have entangled him in mysteries  would have plunged him into radioactive danger pockets of which he knew nothing .  so  with the boldness of one with no choice  he struck out upon the highway in the early afternoon .   they wouldn   t be expecting him back before suppertime  and by that time he would be well away .  they would have no mind touch to miss .   for the first half hour he experienced a feeling of elation  the first such sensation he had had since all this had started .  he was finally doing something  he was making an attempt to fight back at his environment .  something with a purpose  and not mere unreasoning flight as that time in chica .   ah  for an old man he wasn   t bad .  he   d show them .   and then he stopped  he stopped in the middle of the highway  because something obtruded itself upon his notice  something he had forgotten .   there was the strange mind touch  the unknown mind touch  the one he had detected first when he had tried to reach the shining horizon and had been stopped by arbin  the one that had been watching from the ministerial ground .   it was with him now  behind him and watching .   he listened closely  or  at least  he did that which was the equivalent of listening with regard to the mind touch .  it came no closer  but it was fastened upon himself .  it had within it watchfulness and enmity  but not desperation .   other things became clear .  the follower must not lose sight of him  and the follower was armed .   cautiously  almost automatically  schwartz turned  picking apart the horizon with eager eyes .   and the mind touch changed instantly .   it became doubtful and cautious  dubious as to its own safety  and the success of its own project  whatever that was .  the fact of the follower   s weapons became more prominent  as though he were speculating upon using it if trapped .   schwartz knew that he himself was unarmed and helpless .  he knew that the follower would kill him rather than allow him to get out of sight  kill him at the first false move .  .  .  . and he saw no one .   so schwartz walked on  knowing that his follower remained close enough to kill him .  his back was stiff in the anticipation of he knew not what .  how does death feel .   .  .  . how does death feel .  .  .  . the thought jostled him in time to his steps  jounced in his mind  jiggled in his subconscious  until it went nearly past endurance .   he held onto the follower   s mind touch as the one salvation .  he would detect that instant   s increase in tension that would mean that a weapon was being leveled  a trigger being pulled  a contact being closed .  at that instant he would drop  he would run  but why .  if it were the sixty  why not kill him out of hand .   the time slip theory was fading out in his mind  amnesia again .  he was a criminal  perhaps a dangerous man  who must be watched .  maybe he had once been a high official  who could not be simply killed but must be tried .  perhaps his amnesia was the method used by his unconscious to escape the realization of some tremendous guilt .   and so now he was walking down an empty highway toward a doubtful destination  with death walking at his back .     it was growing dark  and the wind had a dying chill to it .  as usual  it didn   t seem right .  schwartz judged it to be december  and certainly sunset at four thirty was right for it  but the wind   s chill was not the iciness of a midwestern winter .   schwartz had long decided that the reason for the prevalent mildness was that the planet  earth .   did not depend on the sun entirely for its heat .  the radioactive soil itself gave off heat  small by the square foot but huge by the million square miles .   and in the darkness the follower   s mind touch grew nearer .  still attentive  and keyed up to a gamble .  in the darkness  following was harder .  he had followed him that first night  toward the shiningness .  was he afraid to take the risk again .      hey .  hey  fella       it was a nasal  high pitched voice .  schwartz froze .   slowly  in one piece  he turned around .  the small figure coming up to him waved its hand  but in the sunless time of day he could not make it out clearly .  it approached  unhurrying .  he waited .      hey  there .  glad to see you .  it ain   t much fun beating it along the road without company .  mind if i go along with you .         hello     said schwartz dully .  it was the correct mind touch .  it was the follower .  and the face was familiar .  it belonged to that hazy time  in chica .   and then the follower gave every sign of recognition .     say  i know you .  sure .  .  .  . don   t you remember me .      it was impossible for schwartz to say whether under ordinary conditions  in another time  he might or might not have believed the other to be sincere .  but now how could he avoid seeing that thin  ragged layer of synthetic recognition that overlay the deep currents of a touch that told him  shouted at him  that the little man with the very sharp eyes had known him from the start .  knew him and had a death weapon ready for him  if necessary .   schwartz shook his head .      sure     insisted the little man .     it was in the department store .  i got you away from that mob .     he seemed to double up in artificial laughter .     they thought you had radiation fever .  you remember .      schwartz did  too  vaguely  dimly .  a man like this  for a few minutes  and a crowd  which had first stopped them and then parted for them .      yes     he said .     pleased to meet you .     it wasn   t very brilliant conversation  but schwartz could do no better  and the little man did not seem to mind .      my name   s natter     he said  shoving out a limp hand at the other .     i didn   t get a chance to talk much with you that first time  overlooked it in the crisis of things  you might say  but i   m sure glad to get a second chance .  .  .  . let   s have the mitt .         i   m schwartz .     and he touched palms with the other  briefly .      how come you   re walking .     asked natter .     going somewheres .      schwartz shrugged .     just walking .         a hiker  huh .  that   s for me too .  all year round i   m on the road  puts the old kibosh on the grummlies .         what .         you know .  makes you full of life .  you get to breathe that air and feel the blood pumping  hey .  .  .  . walked too far this time .  hate to get back after night by my lonesome .  always glad for the company .  where you going .      it was the second time natter had asked the question  and the mind touch made plain the importance attached to it .  schwartz wondered how long he could evade the issue .  there was a questing anxiety in the follower   s mind .  and no lie would do .  schwartz didn   t know enough about this new world to lie .   he said     i   m going to the hospital .         the hospital .  what hospital .         i was there when i was in chica .         you mean the institute .  ain   t that it .  that   s where i took you before  that time in the department store  i mean .     anxiety and increasing tension .      to dr .  shekt     said schwartz .     do you know him .         i   ve heard of him .  he   s a big shot .  are you sick .         no  but i   m supposed to report once in a while .     did that sound reasonable .      walking .     said natter .     doesn   t he send a car for you .     apparently it did not seem reasonable .   schwartz said nothing now  a clammy silence .   natter  however  was buoyant .     look here  chum  soon   s i pass a public communi wave  i   ll order a taxi from the city .  it   ll meet us on the road .         a communi wave .         sure .  they have    em all along the highway .  see  there   s one .      he took a step away from schwartz  and the latter found himself in a sudden shriek .     stop .  don   t move .      natter stopped .  there was a queer coldness in his expression as he turned .     what   s eating you  bud .      schwartz found the new language almost inadequate for the rapidity with which he hurled words at the other .     i   m tired of this acting .  i know you  and i know what you   re going to do .  you   re going to call somebody to tell them i   m going to dr .  shekt .  they   ll be ready for me in the city and they   ll send out a car to pick me up .  and you   ll kill me if i try to get away .      there was a frown on natter   s face .  he muttered     you   re sure right on the gizzbo with that last      it was not intended for schwartz   s ears  nor did it reach them  but the words rested lightly on the very surface of his mind touch .   aloud he said     mister  you   ve got me confused .  you   re shoving a fast one right past my nose .     but he was making room  and his hand was drifting toward his hip .   and schwartz lost control of himself .  he waved his arms in a wild fury .     leave me alone  why don   t you .  what have i done to you .  .  .  . go away .  go away      he ended in a voice cracked shriek  his forehead ridged with hate and fear of the creature who stalked him and whose mind was so alive with enmity .  his own emotions heaved and thrust at the mind touch  attempting to evade the clingingness of it  rid itself of the breath of it  and it was gone .  suddenly and completely gone .  there had been the momentary consciousness of overwhelming pain  not in himself  but in the other  then nothing .  no mind touch .  it had dropped away like the grip of a fist growing lax and dead .   natter was a crumpled smear on the darkening highway .  schwartz crept toward him .  natter was a little man  easy to turn over .  the look of agony on his face might have been stamped on  deeply  deeply .  the lines remained  did not relax .  schwartz felt for the heartbeat and did not find it .   he straightened in a deluge of self horror .   he had murdered a man .   and then a deluge of amazement    without touching him .  he had killed this man just by hating him  by striking somehow at the mind touch .   what other powers did he have .  he made a quick decision .  he searched the other   s pockets and found money .  good .  he could use that .  then he dragged the corpse into the fields and let the high grass cover it .   he walked on for two hours .  no other mind touch disturbed him .   he slept in an open field that night  and the next morning  after two hours more  reached the outskirts of chica .   chica was only a village to schwartz  and by comparison with the chicago he remembered  the motion of the populace was still thin and sporadic .  even so  the mind touches were for the first time numerous .  they amazed and confused him .   so many .  some drifting and diffuse  some pointed and intense .  there were men who passed with their minds popping in tiny explosions  others with nothing inside their skulls but  perhaps  a gentle rumination on the breakfast just completed .   at first schwartz turned and jumped with every touch that passed  taking each as a personal contact  but within the hour he learned to ignore them .   he was hearing words now  even when    they were not actually mouthed .  this was something new  and he found himself listening .  they were thin  eery phrases  disconnected and wind whipped  far off  far off .  .  . and with them  living  crawling emotion and other subtle things that cannot be described  so that all the world was a panorama of boiling life visible to himself only .   he found he could penetrate buildings as he walked  sending his mind in as though it were something he held on a leash  something that could suck its way into crannies invisible to the eye and bring out the bones of men   s inner thoughts .   it was before a huge stone fronted building that he halted  and considered .  they  whoever they were  were after him .  he had killed the follower  but there must be others  the others that the follower had wanted to call .  it might be best for him to make no move for a few days  and how to do that best .  .  .  . a job .  .  .  .      he probed the building before which he had stopped .  in there was a distant mind touch that to him might mean a job .  they were looking for textile workers in there  and he had once been a tailor .   he stepped inside  where he was promptly ignored by everyone .  he touched someone   s shoulder .      where do i see about a job  please .         through that door .     the mind touch that reached him was full of annoyance and suspicion .   through the door  and then a thin  point chin fellow fired questions at him and fingered the classifying machine onto which he punched the answers .   schwartz stammered his lies and truths with equal uncertainty .   but the personnel man began  at least  with a definite unconcern .  the questions were fired rapidly     age .  .  .  .  fifty two .  hmm .  state of health .  .  .  . married .  .  .  . experience .  .  .  . worked with textiles .  .  .  . well  what kind .  .  .  . thermoplastic .  elastomeric .  .  .  . what do you mean  you think all kinds .  .  .  . whom did you work with last .  .  .  .  spell his name .  .  .  . you   re not from chica  are you .  .  .  .  where are your papers .  .  .  . you   ll have to bring them here if you want action taken .  .  .  . what   s your registration number .  .  .  .      schwartz was backing away .  he hadn   t foreseen this end when he had begun .  and the mind touch of the man before him was changing .  it had become suspicious to the point of single trackedness  and cautious too .  there was a surface layer of sweetness and good fellowship that was so shallow .  and which overlay animosity so thinly  as to de the most dangerous feature of all .      i think     said schwartz nervously     that i   m not suited for this job .         no  no  come back .     and the man beckoned at him .     we have something for you .  just let me look through the files a bit .     he was smiling  but his mind touch was clearer now and even more unfriendly .   he had punched a buzzer on his desk    schwartz  in a sudden panic  rushed for the door .      hold him .     cried the other instantly .  dashing from behind his desk .   schwartz struck at the mind touch  lashing out violently with his own mind  and he heard a groan behind him .  he looked quickly over his shoulder .  the personnel man was seated on the floor  face contorted and temples buried in his palms .  another man bent over him  then  at an urgent gesture  headed for schwartz .  schwartz waited no more .   he was out on the street  fully aware now that there must be an alarm out for him with a complete description made public  and that the personnel man  at least  had recognized him .   he ran and doubled along the streets blindly .  he attracted attention  more of it now  for the streets were filling up  suspicion  suspicion everywhere  suspicion because he ran  suspicion because his clothes were wrinkled and ill fitting  in the multiplicity of mind touches and in the confusion of his own fear and despair .  he could not identify the true enemies  the ones in which there was not only suspicion but certainty  and so he hadn   t the slightest warning of the neuronic whip .   there was only that awful pain  which descended like the whistle of a lash and remained like the crush of a rock .  for seconds he coasted down the slope of that descent into agony before drifting into the black .            spider web at washenn     the grounds of the college of ancients in washenn are nothing if not sedate .  austerity is the key word  and there is something authentically grave about the clustered knots of novices taking their evening stroll among the trees of the quadrangle  where none but ancients might trespass .  occasionally the green robed figure of a senior ancient might make its way across the lawn  receiving reverences graciously .   and  once in a long while  the high minister himself might appear .   but not as now  at a half run  almost in a perspiration  disregarding the respectful raising of hands  oblivious to the cautious stares that followed him  the blank looks at one another  the slightly raised eyebrows .   he burst into the legislative hall by the private entrance and broke into an open run down the empty  step ringing ramp .  the door that he thundered at opened at the foot pressure of the one within  and the high minister entered .   his secretary scarcely looked up from behind his small  plain desk  where he hunched over a midget field shielded televisor  listening intently and allowing his eyes to rove over a quire or so of official looking communications that piled high before him .   the high minister rapped sharply on the desk .     what is this .  what is going on .      the secretary   s eyes flicked coldly at him  and the televisor was put to one side .     greetings  your excellency .         greet me no greetings .     retorted the high minister impatiently .     i want to know what is going on .         in a sentence  our man has escaped .         you mean the man who was treated by shekt with the synapsifier  the outsider  the spy  the one on the farm outside chica       it is uncertain how many qualifications the high minister  in his anxiety  might have rattled out had not the secretary interrupted with an indifferent    exactly .         why was i not informed .  why am i never informed .         immediate action was necessary and you were engaged .  i substituted  therefore  to the best of my ability .         yes  you are careful about my engagements when you wish to do without me .  now  i   ll not have it .  i will not permit myself to be by passed and sidetracked .  i will not          we delay     was the reply at ordinary speaking volume  and the high minister   s half shout faded .  he coughed  hovered uncertainly at further speech  then said mildly      what are the details  balkis .         scarcely any .  after two months of patient waiting  with nothing to show for it  this man schwartz left  was followed  and was lost .         how lost .         we are not sure  but there is a further fact .  our agent  natter  missed three reporting periods last night .  his alternates set out after him along the highway toward chica and found him at dawn .  he was in a ditch at the side of the highway  quite dead .      the high minister paled .     the outsider had killed him .         presumably  though we cannot say certainly .  there were no visible signs of violence other than a look of agony on the dead face .  there will be an autopsy  of course .  he might have died of a stroke just at that inconvenient moment .         that would be an incredible coincidence .         so i think      was the cool response     but if schwartz killed him  it makes subsequent events puzzling .  you see  your excellency  it seemed quite obvious from our previous analysis that schwartz would make for chica in order to see shekt  and natter was found dead on the highway between the maren farm and chica .  we therefore sent out an alarm to that city three hours ago and the man was caught .         schwartz .     incredulously .      certainly .         why didn   t you say that immediately .      balkis shrugged .     your excellency  there is more important work to be done .  i said that schwartz was in our hands .  well  he was caught quickly and easily  and that fact does not seem to me to jibe very well with the death of natter .  how could he be at once so clever as to detect and kill natter  a most capable man  and so stupid as to enter chica the very next morning and openly enter a factory  without disguise  to find a job .         is that what he did .         that   s what he did .  .  .  . there are two possible thoughts that this gives rise to  therefore .  either he has already transmitted such information as he has to shekt or arvardan  and has now let himself be caught in order to divert out attention  or else other agents are involved  whom we have not detected and whom he is now covering .  in either case  we must not be overconfident .         i don   t know     said the high minister helplessly  his handsome face twisted into anxious lines .     it gets too deep for me .      balkis smiled with more than a trace of contempt and volunteered a statement .     you have an appointment four hours from now with professor bel arvardan .         i have .  why .  what am i to say to him .  i don   t want to see him .         relax .  you must see him  your excellency .  it seems obvious to me that since the date of commencement of his fictitious expedition is approaching  he must play out the game by asking you for permission to investigate the forbidden areas .  ennius warned us he would  and ennius must know exactly the details of this comedy .  i suppose that you are able to return him froth for froth in this matter and to counter pretense with pretense .      the high minister bowed his head .     well  i shall try .        bel arvardan arrived in good time  and was able to look about him .  to a man well acquainted with the architectural triumphs of all the galaxy  the college of ancients could scarcely seem more than a brooding block of steel ribbed granite  fashioned in an archaic style .  to one who was an archaeologist as well  it might signify  in its gloomy  nearly savage austerity  the proper home of a gloomy  nearly savage way of life .  it   s very primitiveness marked the turning back of eyes to the far past .   and arvardan   s thoughts slipped away once again .  his two month tour about earth   s western continents had proven not quite  amusing .  that first day had ruined things .  he found himself thinking back to that day at chica .   he was instantly angry with himself for thinking about it again .  she had been rude  egregiously ungrateful  a common earthgirl .  why should he feel guilty .  and yet .  .  .   had he made allowances for her shock at discovering him to be an outsider  like that officer who had insulted her and whose arrogant brutality he had repaid with a broken arm .  after all  how could he know how much she had already suffered at the hands of outsiders .  and then to find out  like that  without any softening of the blow  that he was one .   if he had been more patient .  .  . why had he broken it off so brutally .  he didn   t even remember her name .  it was pola something .  strange .  his memory was ordinarily better than that .  was it an unconscious effort to forget .   well  that made sense .  forget .  what was there to remember  anyway .  an earthgirl .  a common earthgirl .   she was a nurse in a hospital .  suppose he tried to locate the hospital .  it had been just a vague blot in the night when he parted from her  but it must be in the neighborhood of that foodomat .   he snatched at the thought and broke into a thousand angry fragments .  was he mad .  what would he have gained .  she was an earthgirl .  pretty  sweet  somehow entic    an earthgirl .   the high minister was entering  and arvardan was glad .  it meant relief from that day in chica .  but  deep in his mind  he knew that they would return .  they  the thoughts  that is  always did .   as for the high minister  his robe was new and glistening in its freshness .  his forehead showed no trace of haste or doubt  perspiration might have been a stranger to it .   and the conversation was friendly  indeed .  arvardan was at pains to mention the well wishings of some of the great men of the empire to the people of earth .  the high minister was as careful to express the thorough gratification that must be felt by all earth at the generosity and enlightenment of the imperial government .   arvardan expounded on the importance of archaeology to imperial philosophy  on its contribution to the great conclusion that all humans of whatever world of the galaxy were brothers  and the high minister agreed blandly and pointed out that earth had long held such to be the case and could only hope that the time would shortly come when the rest of the galaxy might turn theory into practice .   arvardan smiled very shortly at that and said     it is for that very purpose  your excellency  that i have approached you .  the differences between earth and some of the imperial dominions neighboring it rest largely  perhaps  on differing ways of thinking .  still  a good deal of friction could be removed if it could be shown that earthmen were not different  racially  from other galactic citizens .         and how would you propose to do that  sir .         that is not easy to explain in a word .  as your excellency may know  the two main currents of archaeological thinking are commonly called the merger theory and the radiation theory .         i am acquainted with a layman   s view of both .         good .  now the merger theory  of course  involves the notion that the various types of humanity  evolving independently  have intermarried in the very early  scarcely documented days of primitive space travel .  a conception like that is necessary to account for the fact that humans are so alike one to the other now .         yes     commented the high minister dryly     and such a conception also involves the necessity of having several hundred  or thousand  separately evolved beings of a more or less human type so closely related chemically and biologically that intermarriage is possible .         true     replied arvardan with satisfaction .     you have put your finger on an impossibly weak point .  yet most archaeologists ignore it and adhere firmly to the merger theory  which would  of course  imply the possibility that in isolated portions of the galaxy there might be subspecies of humanity who remained different  didn   t intermarry          you mean earth     commented the high minister .      earth is considered an example .  the radiation theory  on the other hand          considers us all descendants of one planetary group of humans .         exactly .         my people     said the high minister     because of the evidence   our own history  and of certain writings which are sacred to us and cannot be exposed to the view of outsiders  are of the belief that earth itself is the original home of humanity .     .      and so i believe as well  and i ask your help to prove this point to all the galaxy .         you are optimistic .  just what is involved .         it is my conviction  your excellency  that many primitive artifacts and architectural remains may be located in those areas of your world which are now  unfortunately  masked by radioactivity .  the age of the remains could be accurately calculated from the radioactive decay present and compared       but the high minister was shaking his head .  .     that is out of the question .         why .     and arvardan frowned in thorough amazement .      for one thing     said the high minister  reasoning mildly     what do you expect to accomplish .  if you prove your point  even to the satisfaction of all the worlds  what does it matter that a million years ago all of you were earthmen .  after all  a billion years ago we were all apes  yet we do not admit present day apes into the relationship .         come  your excellency  the analogy is unreasonable .         not at all  sir .  isn   t it reasonable to assume that earthmen  in their long isolation  have so changed from their emigrating cousins  especially under the influence of radioactivity  as now to form a different race .      arvardan bit at his lower lip and answered reluctantly     you argue well on the side of your enemy .         because i ask myself what my enemy will say .  so you will accomplish nothing  sir  except perhaps to further exacerbate the hatred against us .         but     said arvardan     there is still the matter of the interests of pure science  the advance of knowledge       the high minister nodded gravely .     i am truly sorry to have to stand in the way of that .  i speak now  sir  as one gentleman of the empire to another .  i myself would cheerfully help you  but my people are an obstinate and stiff necked race  who over centuries have withdrawn into themselves because of the  uh  lamentable attitudes toward them in parts of the galaxy .  they have certain taboos  certain fixed customs  which even i could not afford to violate .         and the radioactive areas          are one of the most important taboos .  even if i were to grant you permission  and certainly my every impulse is to do so  it would merely provoke rioting and disturbances  which would not only endanger your life and those of the members of your expedition but would  in the long run  bring down upon earth the disciplinary action of the empire .  i would betray my position and the trust of my people if i were to allow that .         but i am willing to take all reasonable precautions .  if you wish to send observers with me  or  of course  i can offer to consult you before publishing any results obtained .      the high minister said     you tempt me  sir .  it is an interesting project .  but you overestimate my power  even if we leave the people themselves out of consideration .  i am not an absolute ruler .  in fact  my power is sharply limited  and all matters must be submitted to the consideration of the society of ancients before final decisions are possible .      arvardan shook his head .     this is most unfortunate .  the procurator warned me of the difficulties  yet i was hoping that  when can you consult your legislature  your excellency .         the presidium of the society of ancients will meet three days hence .  it is beyond my power to alter the agenda  so it may be a few days more before the matter can be discussed .  say a week .      arvardan nodded abstractedly .     well  it will have to do .  .  .  . by the way  your excellency          yes .         there is a scientist upon your planet whom i would like to meet .  a dr .  shekt at chica .  now  i   ve been in chica  but left before i could do much and would like to repair the omission .  since i am sure he is a busy man  i wonder if i could trouble you for a letter of introduction .      the high minister had stiffened visibly and for several moments said nothing .  then     may i ask what it is you want to see him about .         certainly .  i have read of an instrument he has developed  which he cans a synapsifier  i believe .  it concerns the neurochemistry of the brain and could have something very interesting to do with another project of mine .  i have been doing some work on the classification of humanity into encephalographic groups  brain current types  you understand .     .      umm .  .  . i have heard vaguely about the device .  i seem to recall that it was not a success .         well  maybe not  but he is an expert in the field and could probably be very helpful to me .         i see .  in that case a letter of introduction will be prepared immediately for you .  of course there must be no mention of your intentions with regard to the forbidden areas .         that is understood  your excellency .     he rose .     i thank you for your courtesy and your kind attitude and can only hope that the council of ancients will be liberal with respect to my project .        the secretary entered after arvardan left .  his lips were spread in his characteristic cold  savage smile .      very good     he said .     you handled yourself well  your excellency .       the high minister looked m him somberly and said     what was that last about shekt .         you are puzzled .  don   t be .  all things are working out well .  you noticed his lack of heat when you vetoed his project .  was that the response of a scientist whose heart is set upon something withdrawn from his grasp for no apparent reason .  or is it the response of one who is playing a part and is relieved to be well rid of it .         and again we have a queer coincidence .  schwartz escapes and makes his way to chica .  the very next day arvardan appears here and  after a lukewarm rigmarole about his expedition  mentions casually that he is going to chica to see shekt .         but why mention it  balkis .  it seems foolhardy .         because you are straightforward .  put yourself in his position .  he imagines we suspect nothing .  in such a case it is audacity that wins .  he   s going to see shekt .  good .  he mentions it frankly .  he even asks for a letter of introduction .  what better guarantee of honest and innocent intentions can he present .  and that brings up another point .  schwartz may have discovered that he was being watched .  he may have killed natter .  but he has had no time to warn the others  or this comedy could not have played itself out in just this fashion .      the secretary   s eyes were half lidded as he spun his spider web .     there is no way of telling how long it will be before schwartz   s absence becomes suspicious for them  but it is at least safe to allow sufficient time for arvardan to meet shekt .  we   ll catch them together  there will be that much less they can deny .         how much time do we have .     demanded the high minister .   balkis looked up thoughtfully .     the schedule is fluid  and ever since we uncovered shekt   s treason they   ve been on triple shift  and things are proceeding well .  we await only the mathematical computations for the necessary orbits .  what holds us up there is the inadequacy of our computers .  well .  .  . it may be only a matter of days now .         days .     it was said in a tone queerly compounded of triumph and horror .      days .     repeated the secretary .     but remember  one bomb even two seconds before zero time will be enough to stop us .  and even afterward there will be a period of from one to six months when reprisals can be taken .  so we are not yet entirely safe .      days .  and then the most incredibly one sided battle in the history of the galaxy would be joined and earth would attack all the galaxy .   the high minister   s hands were trembling gently .     arvardan was seated in a stratoplane again .  his thoughts were savage ones .  there seemed no reason to believe that the high minister and his psychopathic subject population would allow an official invasion of the radioactive areas .  he was prepared for that .  somehow he wasn   t even sorry about it .  he could have put up a better fight  if he had cared more .   as it was  by the galaxy  there would be illegal entry .  he would arm his ship and fight it out  if necessary .  he would rather .   the bloody fools .   who the devil did they think they were .   yes  yes  he knew .  they thought they were the original humans  the inhabitants of the planet  the worst of it was he knew that they were right .   well .  .  . the ship was taking off .  he felt himself sinking back into the soft cushion of his seat and knew that within the hour he   d be seeing chica .   not that he was eager to see chica  he told himself  but the synapsifier thing could be important  and there was no use being on earth if he didn   t take advantage of it .  he certainly never intended to return once he left .   rathole .   ennius was right .   this dr .  shekt  however .  .  . he fingered his letter of introduction  heavy with official formality  and then he sat bolt upright  or tried to  struggling bitterly against the forces of inertia that were compressing him down into his seat as the earth still sank away and the blue of the sky was deepened into a rich purple .   he remembered the girl   s name .  it was pola shekt .   now why had he forgotten .  he felt angry and cheated .  his mind was plotting against him  holding back the last name till it was too late .   but  deep underneath  something was rather glad of it .            second meeting     in the two months that had elapsed from the day that dr .  shekt   s synapsifier had been used on joseph schwartz  the physicist had changed completely .  physically not so much  though perhaps he was a thought more stooped  a shade thinner .  it was his manner  abstracted  fearful .  he lived in an inner communion  withdrawn from even his closest colleagues  and from which he emerged with a reluctance that was plain to the blindest .   only to pola could he unburden himself  perhaps because she  too  had been strangely withdrawn those two months .      they   re watching me     he would say .     i feel it somehow .  do you know what the feeling is like .  .  .  . there   s been a turnover in the institute in the last month or so  and it   s the ones i like and feel i can trust that go .  .  .  . i never get a minute to myself .  always someone about .  they won   t even let me write reports .      and pola would alternately sympathize with him and laugh at him  saying over and over again     but what can they possibly have against you to do all this .  even if you did experiment on schwartz  that   s not such a terrible crime .  they   d have just called you on the carpet for it .      but his face was yellow and thin as he muttered     they won   t let me live .  my sixty is coming and they won   t let me live .         after all you   ve done .  nonsense .         i know too much  pola  and they don   t trust me .         know too much about what .      he was tired that night  aching to remove the load .  he told her .  at first she wouldn   t believe him  and finally  when she did  she could only sit there  in cold horror .   pola called up the state house the next day from a public communi wave at the other end of town .  she spoke through a handkerchief and asked for dr .  bel arvardan .   he wasn   t there .  they thought he might be in bonair  six thousand miles away  but he hadn   t been following his scheduled itinerary very closely .  yes  they did expect him back in chica eventually  but they didn   t know exactly when .  would she leave her name .  they would try to find out .   she broke connections at that and leaned her soft cheek against the glass enclosure  grateful for the coolness thereof .  her eyes were deep with unshed tears and liquid with disappointment .   fool .  fool .   he had helped her and she had sent him away in bitterness .  he had risked the neuronic whip and worse to save the dignity of a little earthgirl against an outsider and she had turned on him anyway .   the hundred credits she had sent to the state house the morning after that incident had been returned without comment .  she had wanted then to reach him and apologize  but she had been afraid .  the state house was for outsiders only  and how could she invade it .  she had never even seen it  except from a distance .   and now  she   d have gone to the palace of the procurator himself to  to    only he could help them now .  he  an outsider who could talk with earthmen on a basis of equality .  she had never guessed him to be an outsider until he had told her .  he was so tall and self confident .  he would know what to do .   and someone had to know  or it would mean the ruin of all the galaxy .   of course so many outsiders deserved it  but did all of them .  the women and children and sick and old .  the kind and the good .  the arvardans .  the ones who had never heard of earth .  and they were humans  after all .  such a horrible revenge would for all time drown whatever justice might be  no  was  in earth   s cause in an endless sea of blood and rotting flesh .   and then  out of nowhere  came the call from arvardan .  dr .  shekt shook his head .     i can   t tell him .         you must     said pola savagely .      here .  it is impossible  it would mean ruin for both .         then turn him away .  i   ll take care of it .      her heart was singing wildly .  it was only because of this chance to save so many countless myriads of humans  of course .  she remembered his wide  white smile .  she remembered how he had calmly forced a colonel of the emperor   s own forces to turn and bow his head to her in apology  to her  an earthgirl  who could stand there and forgive him .   bel arvardan could do anything .     arvardan could  of course  know nothing of all this .  he merely took shekt   s attitude for what it seemed  an abrupt and odd rudeness  of a piece with everything else he had experienced on earth .   he felt annoyed  there in the anteroom of the carefully lifeless office  quite obviously an unwelcome intruder .   he picked his words .     i would never have dreamed of imposing upon you to the extent of visiting you  doctor  were it not that i was professionally interested in your synapsifier .  i have been informed that  unlike many earthmen  you are not unfriendly to men of the galaxy .      it was apparently an unfortunate phrase  for dr .  shekt jumped at it .     now  whoever your informant is  he does wrong to impute any especial friendliness to strangers as such .  i have no likes and dislikes .  i am an earthman       arvardan   s lips compressed and he half turned .      you understand  dr .  arvardan      the words were hurried and whispered     i am sorry if i seem rude  but i really cannot          i quite understand     the archaeologist said coldly  though he did not understand at all .     good day  sir .      dr .  shekt smiled feebly .     the pressure of my work          i am very busy too  dr .  shekt .      he turned to the door  raging inwardly at all the tribe of earthmen  feeling within him  involuntarily  some of the catchwords that were bandied so freely on his home world .  the proverbs  for instance     politeness on earth is like dryness in the ocean    or    an earthman will give you anything as long as it costs nothing and is worth less .      his arm had already broken the photoelectric beam that opened the front door when he heard the flurry of quick steps behind him and a hist of warning in his ear .  a piece of paper was thrust in his hand  and when he turned there was only a flash of red as a figure disappeared .   he was in his rented ground car before he unraveled the paper in his hand .  words were scrawled upon it      ask your way to the great playhouse at eight this evening .  make sure you are not followed .      he frowned ferociously at it and read it over five times  then stared all over it  as though expecting invisible ink to bound into visibility .  involuntarily  he looked behind him .  the street was empty .  he half raised his hand to throw the silly scrap out of the window  hesitated  then stuffed it into his vest pocket .   undoubtedly  if he had had one single thing to do that evening other than what the scrawl had suggested  that would have been the end of it  and  perhaps  of several trillions of people .  but  as it turned out  he had nothing to do .   and  as it turned out  he wondered if the sender of the note had been    at eight o   clock he was making his slow way as part of a long line of ground cars along the serpentine way that apparently led to the great playhouse .  he had asked only once  and the passerby questioned had stared suspiciously at him  apparently no earthman was ever free of that all pervasive suspicion  and had said curtly     you just follow all the rest of the cars .      it seemed that all the rest of the cars were indeed going to the playhouse  for when he got there he found all being swallowed  one by one  into the gaping maw of the underground parking lot .  he swung out of line and crawled past the playhouse  waiting for he knew not what .   a slim figure dashed down from the pedestrian ramp and hung outside his window .  he stared at it  startled  but it had the door open and was inside in a single gesture .      pardon me     he said     but          ssh .     the figure was hunched down low in the seat .     were you followed .         should i have been .         don   t be funny .  go straight ahead .  turn when i tell you .  .  .  . my goodness  what are you waiting for .      he knew the voice .  a hood had shifted down to the shoulders  and light brown hair was showing .  dark eyes were gazing at him .      you   d better move on     she said softly .   he did  and for fifteen minutes  except for an occasional muffled but curt direction  she said nothing .  he stole glances at her and thought  with a sudden pleasure  that she was even prettier than he had remembered her .  strange that now he felt no resentment .   they stopped  or arvardan did  at the girl   s direction  at the corner of an unpeopled residential district .  after a careful pause the girl motioned him ahead once more and they inched down a drive that ended in the gentle ramp of a private garage .   the door closed behind them and the light in the car was the only source of illumination .   and now pola looked at him gravely and said     dr .  arvardan  i   m sorry that i had to do this in order to speak to you privately .  i know that i have no standing in your good opinion to lose          don   t think that     he said awkwardly .      i must think that .  i want you to believe that i fully realize how small and vicious i was that night .  i don   t have the proper words to apologize          please don   t .     he glanced away from her .     i might have been a little more diplomatic .         well .  .  .     pola paused a few moments to regain a certain minimal composure .     it   s not what i   ve brought you here for .  you   re the only outsider i   ve ever met that could be kind and noble  and i need your help .      a cold pang shot through arvardan .  was this what it was all about .  he packed that thought into a cold    oh .      and she cried     no     in return .     it is not for me  dr .  arvardan .  it is for all the galaxy .  nothing for myself .  nothing .         what is it .         first  i don   t think anyone followed us  but if you hear any noise at all  would you  would you     her eyes dropped     put your arms about me  and  and  you know .      he nodded his head and said dryly     i believe i can improvise without any trouble .  is it necessary to wait for noise .      pola reddened .     please don   t joke about it  or mistake my intentions .  it would be the only way of avoiding suspicion of our real intentions .  it is the one thing that would be convincing .      arvardan said softly     are things that serious .      he looked at her curiously .  she seemed so young and so soft .  in a way he felt it to be unfair .  never in his life did he act unreasoningly .  he took pride in that .  he .  was a man of strong emotions  but he fought them and beat them .  and here  just because a girl seemed weak  he felt the unreasoning urge to protect her .   she said     things are that serious .  i   m going to tell you something  and i know you won   t believe it at first .  but i want you to try to believe it .  i want you to make up your mind that i   m sincere .  and most of all i want you to decide that you will stick with us after i tell you and see it through .  will you try .  i   ll give you fifteen minutes  and if you think at the end of that time that i   m not worth trusting or bothering with  i   ll leave  and that   s the end of it .         fifteen minutes .     his lips quirked in an involuntary smile  and he removed his wrist watch and put it before him .      all right .      she clasped her hands in her lap and looked firmly ahead through the windshield that afforded a view only of the blank wall of the garage ahead .   he watched her thoughtfully  the smooth  soft line of her chin  belying the firmness into which she was attempting to force it  the straight and thinly drawn nose  the peculiarly rich overtone to the complexion  so characteristic of earth .   he caught the corner of her eye upon him .  it was hastily withdrawn .      what   s the matter .     he said .   she turned to him and caught her underlip in two teeth .     i was watching you .         yes  i could see that .  smudge on my nose .         no .     she smiled tinily  the first since she had entered his car .  he was becoming absurdly conscious of little things about her  the way her hair seemed to hover and float gently each time she shook her head .     it   s just that i   ve been wondering ever since  that night  why you don   t wear that lead clothing  if you   re an outsider .  that   s what fooled me .  outsiders generally look like sacks of potatoes .         and i don   t .         oh no     and there was a sudden tinge of enthusiasm in her voice     you look  you look quite like an ancient marble statue  except that you   re alive and warm .  .  .  . i   m sorry .  i   m being impertinent .         you mean you think that it   s my opinion you   re an earthgirl who doesn   t know your place .  you   ll have to stop thinking that of me  or we can   t be friendly .  .  .  . i don   t believe in the radioactivity superstition .  i   ve measured the atmospheric radioactivity of earth and i   ve conducted laboratory experiments on animals .  i   m quite convinced that under ordinary circumstances the radiations won   t hurt me .  i   ve been here two months and i don   t feel sick yet .  my hair isn   t falling out     he pulled at it     my stomach isn   t in knots .  and i doubt that my fertility is being endangered  though i will admit to taking slight precautions in that respect .  but lead impregnated shorts  you see  don   t show .      he said that gravely  and she was smiling again .     you   re slightly mad  i think     she said .      really .  you   d be surprised how many very intelligent and famous archaeologists have said that  and in long speeches  too .      and she said suddenly     will you listen to me now .  the fifteen minutes are up .         what do you think .         why  that you might be .  if you weren   t  you wouldn   t still be sitting here .  not after what i   ve done .      he said softly     are you under the impression that i have to force myself very hard to sit here next to you .  if you do  you   re wrong .  .  .  . do you know  pola  i   ve never seen  i really believe i   ve never seen  a girl quite as beautiful as yourself .      she looked up quickly  with fright in her eyes .     please don   t .  i   m not trying for that .  don   t you believe me .         yes  i do  pola .  tell me whatever it is you want to .  i   ll believe it and i   ll help you .     he believed himself  implicitly .  at the moment arvardan would cheerfully have undertaken to unseat the emperor .  he had never been in love before  and at that point he ground his thoughts to a halt .  he had not used that word before .   love .  with an earthgirl .      you   ve seen my father  dr .  arvardan .         dr .  shekt is your father .  .  .  . please call me bel .  i   ll call you pola .         if you want me to  i   ll try .  i suppose you were pretty angry with him .         he wasn   t very polite .         he couldn   t be .  he   s being watched .  in fact  he and i arranged in advance that he was to get rid of you and i was to see you here .  this is our house  you know .  .  .  .  you see     her voice dropped to a tight whisper     earth is going to revolt .      arvardan couldn   t resist a moment of amusement .      no .     he said  opening his eyes wide .     all of it .      but pola flared into instant fury .     don   t laugh at me .  you said you would listen and believe me .  earth is going to revolt  and it is serious  because earth can destroy all the empire .         earth can do that .     arvardan struggled successfully against a burst of laughter .  he said gently     pola  how well do you know your galactography .         as well as anybody  teacher  and what has that to do with it  anyway .         it has this to do with it .  the galaxy has a volume of several million cubic light years .  it contains two hundred million inhabited planets and an approximate population of five hundred quadrillion people .  right .         i suppose so  if you say so .         it is  believe me .  now earth is one planet  with a population of twenty millions  and no resources besides .  in other words  there are twenty five billion galactic citizens for every single earthman .  now what harm can earth do against odds of twenty five billion to one .      for a moment the girl seemed to sink into doubt  then she emerged .     bel      she said firmly     i can   t answer that  but my father can .  he has not told me the crucial details .  because he claims that that would endanger my life .  but he will now  if you come with me .  he   s told me that earth knows a way by which it can wipe out all life outside earth  and he must be right .  he   s always been right before .      her cheeks were pink with earnestness  and arvardan longed to touch them .   had he ever before touched her and felt horrified at it .  what was happening to him .       is it after ten .     asked pola .      yes     he replied .      then he should be upstairs now  if they haven   t caught him .     she looked about with an involuntary shudder .     we can get into the house directly from the garage now .  and if you   ll come with me       she had her hand on the knob that controlled the car door  when she froze .  her voice was a husky whisper     there   s someone coming .  .  . oh  quick       the rest was smothered .  it was anything but difficult for arvardan to remember her original injunction .  his arms swept about her with an easy motion  and  in an instant  she was warm and soft against him .  her lips trembled upon his and were limitless seas of sweetness .  .  .   for about ten seconds he swiveled his eyes to their extremes in an effort to see that first crack of light or hear that first footstep  but then he was drowned and swept under by the excitement of it all .  blinded by stars  deafened by his own heartbeat .   her lips left his  but he sought them again  frankly  and found them .  his arms tightened  and she melted within them until her own heartbeat was shaking him in time to his own .   it was quite a while before they broke apart  and for a moment they rested  cheek against cheek .   arvardan had never been in love before  and this time he did not start at the word .   what of it .  earthgirl or not  the galaxy could not produce her equal .   he said  with a dreamy pleasure     it must have been only a traffic noise .         it wasn   t     she whispered .     i didn   t hear any noise .      he held her at arm   s distance  but her eyes did not falter .     you devil .  are you serious .      her eyes sparkled .     i wanted you to kiss me .  i   m not sorry .         do you think i am .  kiss me again  then  for no reason but that i want to this time .      another long  long moment and she was suddenly away from him  arranging her hair and adjusting the collar of her dress with prim and precise gestures .     i think we had better go into the house now .  put out the car light .  i   ve got a pencil flash .      he stepped out of the car after her  and in the new darkness she was the vaguest shadow in the little pockmark of light that came from her pencil flash .   she said     you   d better hold my hand .  there   s a flight of stairs we must go up .      his voice was a whisper behind her .     i love you  pola .     it came out so easily  and it sounded so right .  he said it again .     i love you  pola .      she said softly     you hardly know me .         no .  all my life .  i swear .  all my life .  pola  for two months i   ve been thinking and dreaming of you .  i swear it .         i am an earthgirl  sir .         then i will be an earthman .  try me .      he stopped her and bent her hand up gently until the pocket flash rested upon her flushed  tear marked face .     why are you crying .         because when my father tells you what he knows  you   ll know that you cannot love an earthgirl .         try me on that too .               the odds that vanished     arvardan and shekt met in a back room on the second story of the house  with the windows carefully polarized to complete opaqueness .  pola was downstairs  alert and sharp eyed in the armchair from which she watched the dark and empty street .   shekt   s stooped figure wore somehow an air different from that which arvardan had observed some ten hours previously .  the physicist   s face was still haggard  and infinitely weary  but where previously it had seemed uncertain and timorous  it now bore an almost desperate defiance .      dr .  arvardan     he said  and his voice was firm     i must apologize for my treatment of you in the morning .  i had hoped you would understand          i must admit i didn   t  sir  but i believe i do now .      shekt seated himself at the table and gestured toward the bottle of wine .  arvardan waved his hand in a deprecating motion .     if you don   t mind  i   ll have some of the fruit instead .  .  .  . what is this .  i don   t think i   ve ever seen anything like it .         it   s a kind of orange     said shekt .     i don   t believe it grows outside earth .  the rind comes off easily .     he demonstrated  and arvardan  after sniffing at it curiously  sank his teeth into the winy pulp .  he came up with an exclamation .      why  this is delightful  dr .  shekt .  has earth ever tried to export these objects .         the ancients     said the biophysicist grimly     are not fond of trading with the outside .  nor are our neighbors in space fond of trading with us .  it is but an aspect of our difficulties here .      arvardan felt a sudden spasm of annoyance seize him .     that is the most stupid thing yet .  i tell you that i could despair of human intelligence when i see what can exist in men   s minds .      shekt shrugged with the tolerance of lifelong use .     it is part of the nearly insoluble problem of anti terrestrianism  i fear .         but what makes it so nearly insoluble     exclaimed the archaeologist     is that no one seems to really want a solution .  how many earthmen respond to the situation by hating all galactic citizens indiscriminately .  it is an almost universal disease  hate for hate .  do your people really want equality  mutual tolerance .  no .  most of them want only their own turn as top dog .         perhaps there is much in what you say     said shekt sadly .     i cannot deny it .  but that is not the whole story .  give us but the chance  and a new generation of earthmen would grow to maturity  lacking insularity and believing wholeheartedly in the oneness of man .  the assimilationists  with their tolerance and belief in wholesome compromise  have more than once been a power on earth .  i am one .  or  at least  i was one once .  but the zealots rule all earth now .  they are the extreme nationalists  with their dreams of past rule and future rule .  it is against them that the empire must be protected .      arvardan frowned .     you refer to the revolt pola spoke of .         dr .  arvardan     shekt said grimly     it   s not too easy a job to convince anyone of such an apparently ridiculous possibility as earth conquering the galaxy  but it   s true .  i am not physically brave  and i am most anxious to live .  you can imagine  then  the immense crisis that must now exist to force me to run the risk of committing treason with the eye of the local administration already upon me .         well     said arvardan     if it is that serious  i had better tell you one thing immediately .  i will help you all i can  but only in my own capacity as a galactic citizen .  i have no official standing here  nor have i any particular influence at the court or even at the procurator   s palace .  i am exactly what i seem to be  an archaeologist on a scientific expedition which involves only my own interests .  since you are prepared to risk treason  hadn   t you better see the procurator about this .  he could really do something .         that is exactly what i cannot do  dr .  arvardan .  it is that very contingency against which the ancients guard me .  when you came to my house this morning i even thought you might be a go between .  i thought that ennius suspected .         he may suspect  i cannot answer for that .  but i am not a go between .  i   m sorry .  if you insist on making me your confidant  i can promise to see him for you .         thank you .  it is all i ask .  that  and to use your good offices to intercede for earth against too strong a reprisal .         of course .     arvardan was uneasy .  at the moment he was convinced that he was dealing with an elderly and eccentric paranoiac  perhaps harmless  but thoroughly cracked .  yet he had no choice but to remain  to listen  and to try to smooth over the gentle insanity  for pola   s sake .   shekt said     dr .  arvardan  you have heard of the synapsifier .  you said so this morning .         yes  i did .  i read your original article in physical reviews .  i discussed the instrument with the procurator and with the high minister .         with the high minister .         why  certainly .  when i obtained the letter of introduction that you  uh  refused to see  i   m afraid .         i   m sorry for that .  but i wish you had not  what is the extent of your knowledge concerning the synapsifier .         that it is an interesting failure .  it is designed to improve learning capacity .  it has succeeded to some extent on rats  but has failed on human beings .      shekt was chagrined .     yes  you could think nothing else from that article .  it was publicized as a failure  and the eminently successful results have been suppressed  deliberately .         hmp .  a rather unusual display of scientific ethics  dr .  shekt .         i admit it .  but i am fifty six  sir  and if you know anything of the customs of earth  you know that i haven   t long to live .         the sixty .  yes  i have heard of it  more than i would have liked  in fact .     and he thought wryly of that first trip on a terrestrian stratoliner .     exceptions are made for noted scientists  among others  i have heard .         certainly .  but it is the high minister and the council of ancients who decide on that  and there is no appeal from their decisions  even to the emperor .  i was told that the price of life was secrecy concerning the synapsifier and hard work for its improvement .     the older man spread his hands helplessly .     could i know then of the outcome  of the use to which the machine would be put .         and the use .     arvardan extracted a cigarette from his shirt pocket case and offered one to the other  which was refused .      if you   ll wait a moment  one by one  after my experiments had reached the point where i felt the instrument might be safely applied to human beings  certain of earth   s biologists were treated .  in each case they were men i knew to be in sympathy with the zealots  the extremists  that is .  they all survived  though secondary effects made themselves shown after a time .  one of them was brought back for treatment eventually .  i could not save him .  but  in his dying delirium  i found out .      it was close upon midnight .  the day had been long and much had happened .  but now something stirred within arvardan .  he said tightly     i wish you   d get to the point .      shekt said     i beg your patience .  i must explain thoroughly  if you   re to believe me .  you  of course  know of earth   s peculiar environment  its radioactivity          yes  i have a fair knowledge of the matter .         and of the effect of this radioactivity upon earth and its economy .         yes .         then i won   t belabor the point .  i need only say that the incidence of mutation on earth is greater than in the rest of the galaxy .  the idea of our enemies that earthmen are different thus has a certain basis of physical truth .  to be sure  the mutations are minor  and most possess no survival value .  if any permanent change has occurred in earthmen  it is only in some aspects of their internal chemistry which enables them to display greater resistance to their own particular environment .  thus they show greater resistance to radiation effects  more rapid healing of burned tissues          dr .  shekt  i am acquainted with all you say .         then has it ever occurred to you that these mutational processes occur in living species on earth other than human .      there was a short silence  and then arvardan said     why  no  it hasn   t  though  of course  it is quite inevitable  now that you mention it .         that is so .  it happens .  our domestic animals exist in greater variety than on any other inhabited world .  the orange you ate is a mutated variety  which exists nowhere else .  it is this  among other things  which makes the orange so unacceptable for export .  outsiders suspect it as they suspect us  and we ourselves guard it as a valuable property peculiar to ourselves .  and of course what applies to animals and plants applies also to microscopic life .      and now  indeed  arvardan felt the thin pang of fear enter .   he said     you mean  bacteria .         i mean the whole domain of primitive life .  protozoa  bacteria  and the self reproducing proteins that some people call viruses .          and what are you getting at .         i think you have a notion of that  dr .  arvardan .  you seem suddenly interested .  you see  there is a belief among your people that earthmen are bringers of death  that to associate with an earthman is to die  that earthmen are the bearers of misfortune  possess a sort of evil eye          i know all that .  it is merely superstition .         not entirely .  that is the dreadful part .  like all common beliefs  however superstitious  distorted  and perverted  it has a speck of truth at bottom .  sometimes  you see  an earthman carries within his body some mutated form of microscopic parasite which is not quite like any known elsewhere  and to which  sometimes  outsiders are not particularly resistant .  what follows is simple biology  dr .  arvardan .       arvardan was silent .   shekt went on     we are caught sometimes  too  of course .  a new species of germ will make its way out of the radioactive mists and an epidemic will sweep the planet  but  by and large  earthmen have kept pace .  for each variety of germ and virus  we build our defense over the generations  and we survive .  outsiders don   t have the opportunity .         do you mean     said arvardan with a strangely faint sensation     that contact with you now      he pushed his chair back .  he was thinking of the evening   s kisses .   shekt shook his head .     of course not .  we don   t create the disease  we merely carry it .  and even such carriage occurs very rarely .  if i lived on your world  i would no more carry the germ than you would  i have no special affinity for it .  even here it is only one out of every quadrillion germs  or one out of every quadrillion of quadrillions  that is dangerous .  the chances of your infection right now are less than that of a meteorite penetrating the roof of this house and hitting you .  unless the germs in question are deliberately searched for  isolated  and concentrated .      again a silence  longer this time .  arvardan said in a queer  strangled voice     have earthmen been doing that .      he had stopped thinking in terms of paranoia .  he was ready to believe .      yes .  but for innocent reasons  at first .  our biologists are  of course  particularly interested in the peculiarities of earth life  and  recently  isolated the virus of common fever .         what is common fever .         a mild endemic disease on earth .  that is  it is always with us .  most earthmen have it in their childhood  and its symptoms are not very severe .  a mild fever  a transitory rash  and inflammation of the joints and of the lips  combined with an annoying thirst .  it runs its course in four to six days  and the subject is thereafter immune .  i   ve had it .  pola has had it .  occasionally there is a more virulent form of this same disease  a slightly different strain of virus is concerned  presumably  and then it is called radiation fever .         radiation fever .  i   ve heard of it     said arvardan .      oh  really .  it is called radiation fever because of the mistaken notion that it is caught after exposure to radioactive areas .  actually  exposure to radioactive areas is often followed by radiation fever  because it is in those areas that the virus is most apt to mutate to dangerous forms .  but it is the virus and not the radiation which does it .  in the case of radiation fever  symptoms develop in a matter of two hours .  the lips are so badly affected that the subject can scarcely talk  and he may be dead in a matter of days .      now  dr .  arvardan  this is the crucial point .  the earthman has adapted himself to common fever and the outsider has not .  occasionally a member of the imperial garrison is exposed to it  and  in that case  he reacts to it as an earthman would to radiation fever .  usually he dies within twelve hours .  he is then burned  by earthmen  since any other soldier approaching also dies .      the virus  as i say  was isolated ten years ago .  it is a nucleoprotein  as are most filtrable viruses  which  however  possesses the remarkable property of containing an unusually high concentration of radioactive carbon  sulphur  and phosphorus .  when i say unusually high i mean that fifty per cent of its carbon  sulphur  and phosphorus is radioactive .  it is supposed that the effects of the organism on its host is largely that of its radiations  rather than of its toxins .  naturally it would seem logical that earthmen  who are adapted to gamma radiations  are only slightly affected .  original research in the virus centered at first about the method whereby it concentrated its radioactive isotopes .  as you know  no chemical means can separate isotopes except through very long and tedious procedures .  nor is any organism other than this virus known which can do so .  but then the direction of research changed .      i   ll be short  dr .  arvardan .  i think you see the rest .  experiments might be conducted on animals from outside earth  but not on outsiders themselves .  the numbers of outsiders on earth were too few to allow several to disappear without notice .  nor could premature discovery of their plans be allowed .  so it was a group of bacteriologists that was sent to the synapsifier .  .  to return with insights enormously developed .  it was they who developed a new mathematical attack on protein chemistry and on immunology  which enabled them finally to develop an artificial strain of virus that was designed to affect galactic human beings  outsiders  only .  tons of the crystallized virus now exist .      arvardan was haggard .  he felt the drops of perspiration glide sluggishly down his temple and cheek .      then you are telling me     he gasped     that earth intends to set loose this virus on the galaxy  that they will initiate a gigantic bacteriological warfare          which we cannot lose and you cannot win .  exactly .  once the epidemic starts  millions will die each day  and nothing will stop it .  frightened refugees fleeing across space will carry the virus with them  and if you attempt to blow up entire planets  the disease can be started again in new centers .  there will be no reason to connect the matter with earth .  by the time our own survival becomes suspicious  the ravages will have progessed so far  the despair of the outsiders will be so deep  that nothing will matter to them .         and all will die .     the appalling horror did not penetrate  could not .      perhaps not .  our new science of bacteriology works both ways .  we have the antitoxin as well  and the means of production thereof .  it might be used in case of early surrender .  then there may be some out of the way eddies of the galaxy that could escape  or even a few cases of natural immunity .      in the horrible blankness that followed  during which arvardan never thought of doubting the truth of what he had heard  the horrible truth which at a stroke wiped out the odds of twenty five billion to one  shekt   s voice was small and tired .      it is not earth that is doing this .  a handful of leaders  perverted by the gigantic pressure that excluded them from the galaxy  hating those who keep them outside  wanting to strike back at any cost  and with insane intensity    once they have begun  the rest of earth must follow .  what can it do .  in its tremendous guilt  it will have to finish what it started .  could it allow enough of the galaxy to survive and thus risk a later punishment .      yet before i am an earthman  i am a man .  must trillions die for the sake of millions .  must a civilization spreading over a galaxy crumble for the sake of the resentment  however justified  of a single planet .  and will we be better off for all that .  the power in the galaxy will reside still on those worlds with the necessary resources  and we have none .  earthmen may even rule at trantor for a generation  but their children will become trantorians  and in their turn will look down upon the remnant on earth .      and besides  is there an advantage to humanity to exchange the tyranny of a galaxy for the tyranny of earth .  no  no  there must be a way out for all men  a way to justice and freedom .      his hands stole to his face  and behind their gnarled fingers he rocked gently to and fro .   arvardan had heard all this in a numbed haze .  he mumbled     there is no treason in what you have done  dr .  shekt .  i will go to everest immediately .  the procurator will believe me .  he must believe me .      there was the sound of running footsteps  the flash of a frightened face into the room  the door left swinging open .      father  men are coming up the walk .      dr .  shekt went gray .     quickly  dr .  arvardan  through the garage .     he was pushing violently .     take pola  and don   t worry about me .  i   ll hold them back .      but a man in a green robe waited for them as they turned .  he wore a thin smile and carried  with a casual ease  a neuronic whip .  there was a thunder of fists at the main door  a crash  and the sound of pounding feet .      who are you .     demanded arvardan in a feeble defiance of the armed green robe .  he had stepped before pola .      i .     said green robe harshly .     i am merely the humble secretary of his excellency  the high minister .     he advanced .     i almost waited too long .  but not quite .  hmm  a girl  too .  injudicious       arvardan said evenly     i am a galactic citizen  and i dispute your right to detain me  or  for that matter  to enter this house  without legal authority .         i     and the secretary tapped his chest gently with his free hand     am all the right and authority on this planet .  within a short time i will be all the right and authority on the galaxy .  we have all of you  you know  even schwartz .         schwartz .     cried dr .  shekt and pola  nearly together .      you are surprised .  come  i will bring you to him .      the last thing arvardan was conscious of was that smile  expanding  and the flash of the whip .  he toppled through a crimson sear of pain into unconsciousness .            choose your side .      for the moment schwartz was resting uneasily on a hard bench in one of the small sub basement rooms of the chica    hall of correction .      the hall  as it was commonly termed  was the great token of the local power of the high minister and those surrounding him .  it lifted its gloominess in a rocky  angular height that overshadowed the imperial barracks beyond it  just as its shadow clutched at the terrestrial malefactor far more than did the unexerted authority of the empire .   within its walls many an earthman in past centuries had waited for the judgment that came to one who falsified or evaded the quotas of production  who lived past his time  or connived at another   s such crime  or who was guilty of attempting subversion of the local government .  occasionally  when the petty prejudices of terrestrial justice made particularly little sense to the sophisticated and usually blas   imperial government of the time  a conviction might be set aside by the procurator  but this meant insurrection  or  at the very least  wild riots .   ordinarily  where the council demanded death  the procurator yielded .  after all .  it was only earthmen who suffered    of all this  joseph schwartz  very naturally  knew nothing .  to him  immediate optical awareness consisted of a small room  its walls transfused with but a dim light  its furniture consisting of two hard benches and a table  plus a small recess in the wall that served as washroom and sanitary convenience combined .  there was no window for a glimpse of sky  and the drift of air into the room through the ventilating shaft was feeble .   he rubbed the hair that circled his bald spot and sat up ruefully .  his attempt to escape to nowhere  for where on earth was he safe .   had been short  not sweet  and had ended here .   at least there was the mind touch to play with .   but was that bad or good .   at the farm it had been a queer  disturbing gift  the nature of which he did not know  the possibilities of which he did not think of .  now it was a flexible gift to be investigated .   with nothing to do for twenty four hours but brood on imprisonment  he could have been courting madness .  as it was  he could touch the jailers as they passed  reach out for guardsmen in the adjacent corridors  extend the furthest fibrils of his mind even to the captain of the hall in his distant office .   he turned the minds over delicately and probed them .  they fell apart like so many walnuts  dry husks out of which emotions and notions fell in a sibilant rain .   he learned much in the process of earth and empire  more than he had  or could have  in all two months on the farm .   of course one of the items that he learned  over and over again  beyond any chance of mistaking  was just this   he was condemned to death .   there was no escape  no doubt  no reservation .   it might be today  it might be tomorrow .  but he would diet  somehow it sank in and he accepted it almost gratefully .     the door opened  and he was on his feet  in tense fear .  one might accept death reasoningly  with every aspect of the conscious mind  but the body was a brute beast that knew nothing of reason .  this was it .   no  it wasn   t .  the entering mind touch held nothing of death in it .  it was a guard with a metal rod held ready in his hand .  schwartz knew what it was .      come with me     he said sharply .   schwartz followed him  speculating on this odd power of his .  long before his guard could use his weapon  long before he could possibly know he should  he could be struck down without a sound  without a giveaway moment .  his mind was in schwartz   s mental hands .  a slight squeeze and it would be over .   but why .  there would be others .  how many could he handle at once .  how many pairs of hands were in his mind .   he followed  docilely .   it was a large  large room that he was brought into .  two men and a girl occupied it  stretched out corpsewise on high  high benches .  yet not corpses  since three active minds were much in evidence .   paralyzed .  familiar .  .  .  . were they familiar .   he was stopping to look  but the guard   s hard hand was on his shoulder .     get on .      there was a fourth slab  empty .  there was no death in the guard   s mind  so schwartz climbed on .  he knew what was coming .   the guard   s steely rod touched each of his limbs .  they tingled and left him  so that he was nothing but a head  floating on nothingness .   he turned it .      pola     he cried .     you   re pola  aren   t you .  the girl who       she was nodding .  he hadn   t recognized her touch as such .  he had never been aware of it that time two months ago .  at that time his mental progression had reached only the stage of sensitivity to    atmosphere .     in the brilliance of hindsight  he remembered that well .   but from the contents he could still learn much .  the one past the girl was dr .  shekt  the one furthest of all was dr .  bel arvardan .  he could filch their names  sense their despair  taste the last dregs of horror and fright in the young girl   s mind .   for a moment he pitied them  and then he remembered who they were and what they were .  and he hardened his heart .   let them die .     the other three had been there for the better part of an hour .  the room in which they were left was evidently one used for assemblies of several hundred .  the prisoners were lost and lonely in its size .  nor was there anything to say .  arvardan   s throat bummed dryly and he turned his head from side to side with a futile restlessness .  it was the only part of his body that he could move .   shekt   s eyes were closed and his lips were colorless and pinched .   arvardan whispered fiercely     shekt .  shekt  i say .         what .  .  .  . what .     a feeble whisper at best .      what are you doing .  going to sleep .  think  man  think .         why .  what is there to think of .         who is this joseph schwartz .      pola   s voice sounded  thin and weary .     don   t you remember  bel .  that time in the department store  when i first met you  so long ago .      arvardan wrenched wildly and found he could lift his head two aching inches .  a bit of pola   s face was just visible .      pola .  pola .     if he could have moved toward her  as for two months he might have and hadn   t .  she was looking at him  smiling so wanly that it might be a statue   s smile  and he said     we   ll win out yet .  you   ll see .      but she was shaking her head  and his neck gave way  its tendons in panging agony .      shekt     he said again .     listen to me .  how did you meet this schwartz .  why was he a patient of yours .         the synapsifier .  he came as a volunteer .         and was treated .         yes .      arvardan revolved that in his mind .     what made him come to you .         i don   t know .         but then  maybe he is an imperial agent .       schwartz followed his thought well and smiled to himself .  he said nothing  and he meant to keep on saying nothing .    shekt stirred his head .      an imperial agent .  you mean because the high priest   s secretary says he is .  oh  nonsense .  and what difference does it make .  he   s as helpless as we .  .  .  . listen  arvardan  maybe  if we tell some sort of concerted story  they might wait .  eventually we might       the archaeologist laughed hollowly  and his throat burned at the friction .     we might live  you mean .  with the galaxy dead and civilization in ruins .  live .  i might as well die .         i   m thinking of pola     muttered shekt .      i am too     said the other .     ask her .  .  .  . pola  shall we surrender .  shall we try to live .      pola   s voice was firm .     i have chosen my side .  i don   t want to die  but if my side dies  i   ll go with it .      arvardan felt somehow triumphant .  when he brought her to sirius  they might call her an earthgirl  but she was their equal  and he would  with a great and good pleasure  smash teeth into the throat of any    and he remembered that he wasn   t likely to bring her to sirius  to bring anyone to sirius .  there wasn   t likely to be a sirius .   then  as though to escape from the thought  to escape anywhere  he shouted     you .  whatchername .  schwartz .      schwartz raised his head for a moment and allowed a glance to ooze out toward the other .  he still said nothing .      who are you .     demanded arvardan .     how did you get mixed up in this .  what   s your part in it .      and at the question  all the injustice of everything descended on schwartz .  all the harmlessness of his past  all the infinite horror of the present burst in upon him  so that he said in a fury       .  how did i get mixed up in it .  listen .  i was once a nobody .  an honest man  a hard working tailor .  i hurt nobody  i bothered nobody  i took care  of my family .  and then  for no reason  for no reason  i came here .         to chica .     asked arvardan  who did not quite follow .      no  not to chica .     shouted schwartz in wild derision .     i came to this whole mad world .  .  .  . oh  what do i care if you believe me or not .  my world is in the past .  my world had land and food and two billion people  and it was the only world .      arvardan fell silent before the verbal assault .  he turned to shekt .     can you understand him .         do you realize     said shekt in feeble wonder     that he has a vermiform appendix  which is three and a half inches long .  do you remember  pola .  and wisdom teeth .  and hair on his face .         yes  yes     shouted schwartz defiantly .      . and i wish i had a tail i could show you .  i   m from the past .  i traveled through time .  only i don   t know how  and i don   t know why .  now leave me alone .     he added suddenly     they will soon be here for us .  this wait is just to break us .      arvardan said suddenly     do you know that .  who told you .      schwartz did not answer .      was it the secretary .  stocky man with a pug nose .     schwartz had no way of telling the physical appearance of those he touched only by mind  but  secretary .  there had been just a glimpse of a touch  a powerful one of a man of power  and it seemed he had been a secretary .      balkis .     he asked in curiosity .      what .     said arvardan  but shekt interrupted     that   s the name of the secretary .         oh  what did he say .         he didn   t say anything     said schwartz .     i know .  it   s death for an of us  and there   s no way out .      arvardan lowered his voice .     he   s mad  wouldn   t you say .         i wonder .  .  .  . his skull sutures  now .  they were primitive  very primitive .      arvardan was amazed .     you mean  oh  come  it   s impossible .         i   ve always supposed so .     for the moment shekt   s voice was a feeble imitation of normality  as though the presence of a scientific problem had switched his mind to that detached and objective groove in which personal matters disappeared .     they   ve calculated the energy required to displace matter along the time axis and a value greater than infinity was arrived at  so the project has always been looked upon as impossible .  but others have talked of the possibility of    time faults     analogous to geological faults  you know .  space ships have disappeared  for one thing  almost in fun view .  there   s the famous case of hor devallow in ancient times  who stepped into his house one day and never came out  and wasn   t inside  either .  .  .  . and then there   s the planet  which you   ll find in the galactography books of the last century  which was visited by three expeditions that brought back fun descriptions  and then was never seen again .      then there are certain developments in nuclear chemistry that seem to deny the law of conservation of mass energy .  they   ve tried to explain that by postulating the escape of some mass along the time axis .  uranium nuclei  for instance  when mixed with copper and barium in minute but definite proportions  under the influence of light gamma irradiation  set up a resonating system          father     said pola     don   t .  there   s no use       but arvardan   s interruption was peremptory .     wait  now .  let me think .  i   m the one who can settle this .  who better .  let me ask him a few questions .  .  .  . look  schwartz .      schwartz looked up again .      yours was the only world in the galaxy .      schwartz nodded  then said dully     yes .         but you only thought that .  i mean you didn   t have space travel  so you couldn   t check up .  there might have been many other inhabited worlds .         i have no way of telling that .         yes  of course .  a pity .  what about atomic power .         we had an atomic bomb .  uranium  and plutonium  i guess that   s what made this world radioactive .  there must have been another war after all  after i left .  .  .  . atomic bombs .     somehow schwartz was back in chicago  back in his old world  before the bombs .  and he wits sorry .  not for himself  but for that beautiful world .  .  .  .   but arvardan was muttering to himself .  then      all right .  you had a language  of course .         earth .  lots of them .         how about you .         english  after i was a grown man .         well  say something in it .      for two months or more schwartz had said nothing in english .  but now  with lovingness  he said slowly     i want to go home and be with my own people .      arvardan spoke to shekt .        that the language he used when he was synapsified  shekt .         i can   t tell     said shekt  in mystification .     queer sounds then and queer sounds now .  how can i relate them .         well  never mind .  .  .  . what   s your word for    mother    in your language  schwartz .      schwartz told him .      uh huh .  how about    father    .  .   .     brother    .  .  .    one     the numeral  that is      two         three         house         man         wife           this went on and on  and when arvardan paused for breath his expression was one of awed bewilderment .      shekt     he said     either this man is genuine or i   m the victim of as wild a nightmare as can be conceived .  he   s speaking a language practically equivalent to the inscriptions found in the fifty thousand year old strata on sirius  arcturus  alpha centauri  and twenty others .  he speaks it .  the language has only been deciphered in the last generation  and there aren   t a dozen men in the galaxy besides myself who can understand it .         are you sure of this .         am i sure .  of course i   m sure .  i   m an archaeologist .  it   s my business to know .      for an instant schwartz felt his armor of aloofness cracking .  for the first time he felt himself regaining the individuality he had lost .  the secret was out  he was a man from the past  and they accepted it .  it proved him sane  stilled forever that haunting doubt  and he was grateful .  and yet he held aloof .      i   ve got to have him .     it was arvardan again  burning in the holy flame of his profession .     shekt  you have no idea what this means to archaeology .  shekt  it   s a man from the past .  oh  great space .  .  .  . listen  we can make a deal .  this is the proof earth is looking for .  they can have him .  they can       schwartz interrupted sardonically .     i know what you   re thinking .  you think that earth will prove itself to be the source of civilization through me and that they will be grateful for it .  i tell you  no .  i   ve thought of it and i would have bartered for my own life .  but they won   t believe me  or you .         there   s absolute proof .         they won   t listen .  do you know why .  because they have certain fixed notions about the past .  any change would be blasphemy in their eyes  even if it were the truth .  they don   t want the truth  they want their traditions .         bel     said pola     i think he   s right .      arvardan ground his teeth .     we could try .         we would fail     insisted schwartz .      how can you know .         i know .     and the words fell with such oracular insistence that arvardan was silent before them .   it was shekt who was looking at him now with a strange light in his tired eyes .   he asked softly     have you felt any bad effects as a result of the synapsifier .      schwartz didn   t know the word but caught the meaning .  they had operated  and on his mind .  how much he was learning .   he said     no bad effects .         but i see you learned our language rapidly .  you speak it very well .  in fact  you might be a native .  doesn   t it surprise you .         i always had a very good memory     was the cold response .      and so you feel no different now than before you were treated .         that   s right .      dr .  shekt   s eyes were hard now  and he said     why do you bother .  you know that i   m certain you know what i   m thinking .      schwartz laughed shortly .     that i can read minds .  well .  what of it .      but shekt had dropped him .  he had turned his white  helpless face to arvardan .     he can sense minds  arvardan .  how much i could do with him .  and to be here  to be helpless .  .  .         what  what  what      arvardan popped wildly .   and even pola   s face somehow gained interest .     can you really .     she asked schwartz .   he nodded at her .  she had taken care of him .  and now they would kill her .  yet she was a traitor .   shekt was saying      arvardan  you remember the bacteriologist i told you about  the one who died as a result of the effects of the synapsifier .  one of the first symptoms of mental breakdown was his claim that he could read minds .  and he could .  i found that out before he died  and it   s been my secret .  i   ve told no one  but it   s possible  arvardan  it   s possible .  you see  with the lowering of brain cell resistance  the brain may be able to pick up the magnetic fields induced by the microcurrents of other   s thoughts and reconvert it into similar vibrations in itself .  it   s the same principle as that of any ordinary recorder .  it would be telepathy in every sense of the word       schwartz maintained a stubborn and hostile silence as arvardan turned slowly in his direction .     if this is so  shekt  we might be able to use him .     the archaeologist   s mind was spinning wildly  working out impossibilities .     there may be a way out now .  there must be a way out .  for us and the galaxy .      but schwartz was cold to the tumult in the mind touch he sensed so clearly .  he said     you mean by my reading their minds .  how would that help .  of course i can do more than read minds .  how   s that  for instance .      it was a light push  but arvardan yelped at the sudden pain of it .  .      i did that     said schwartz .     want more .      arvardan gasped     you can do that to the guards .  to the secretary .  why did you let them bring you here .  great galaxy  shekt  there   ll be no trouble .  now  listen  schwartz          no     said schwartz     you listen .  why do i want to get out .  where will i be .  still on this dead world .  i want to go home  and i can   t go home .  i want my people and my world  and i can   t have them .  and i want to die .         but it   s a question of all the galaxy  schwartz .  you can   t think of yourself .         can   t i .  why not .  must i worry about your galaxy now .  i hope your galaxy rots and dies .  i know what earth is planning to do  and i am glad .  the young lady said before she had chosen her side .  well  i   ve chosen my side  and my side is earth .         what .         why not .  i   m an earthman .               change your side .      an hour had passed since arvardan had first waded thickly out of unconsciousness to find himself slabbed like a side of beef awaiting the cleaver .  and nothing had happened .  nothing but this feverish  inconclusive talk that unbearably passed the unbearable time .   none of it lacked purpose .  he knew that much .  to lie prone  helpless  without even the dignity of a guard  without even that much concession to a conceivable danger  was to become conscious of overwhelming weakness .  a stubborn spirit could not survive it  and when the inquisitor did arrive there would be little defiance  or none  for him to be presented with .   arvardan needed a break in the silence .  he said     i suppose this place is spy waved .  we should have talked less .         it isn   t     came schwartz   s voice flatly .     there   s nobody listening .      the archaeologist was ready with an automatic    how do you know .     but never said it .   for a power like that to exist .  and not for him  but for a man of the past who called himself an earthman and wanted to die .   within optical sweep was only a patch of ceiling .  turning  he could see shekt   s angular profile  the other way  a blank wall .  if he lifted his head he could make out  for a moment  pola   s pale  worn expression .   occasionally there was the burning thought that he was a man of the empire  of the empire  by the stars  a galactic citizen  and that there was a particularly vile injustice in his imprisonment  a particularly deep impurity in the fact that he had allowed earthmen to do this to him .   and that faded too .   they might have put him next to pola .  .  . no  it was better this way .  he was not an inspiring sight .      bel .     the word trembled into sound and was strangely sweet to arvardan  coming as it did in this vortex of coming death .      yes  pola .         do you think they   ll be much longer .         maybe not  darling .  .  .  . it   s too bad .  we wasted two months  didn   t we .         my fault     she whispered .     my fault .  we might have had these last few minutes  though .  it   s so  unnecessary .      arvardan could not answer .  his mind whirred in circles of thought  lost on a greased wheel .  was it his imagination  or did he feel the hard plastic on which he was so stiffly laid .  how long would the paralysis last .   schwartz must be made to help .  he tried guarding his thoughts  knew it to be ineffective .   he said     schwartz         schwartz lay there as helpless  and with an added  uncalculated refinement to his suffering .  he was four minds in one .   by himself he might have maintained his own shrinking eagerness for the infinite peace and quiet of death  fought down the last remnants of that love of life which even as recently as two days previously  three .   had sent him reeling away from the farm .  but how could he .  with the poor  weak horror of death that hung like a pall over shekt  with the strong chagrin and rebellion of arvardan   s hard  vital mind  with the deep and pathetic disappointment of the young girl .   he should have closed his own mind .  what did he need to know of the sufferings of others .  he had his own life to live  his own death to die .   but they battered at him  softly  incessantly  probing and sifting through the crannies .   and arvardan said     schwartz     then  and schwartz knew that they wanted him to save them .  why should he .  why should he .      schwartz     repeated arvardan insinuatingly     you can live a hero .  you have nothing to die for here  not for those men out there .      but schwartz was gathering the memories of his own youth  clutching them desperately to his wavering mind .  it was a queer amalgamation of past and present that finally brought forth his indignation .   but he spoke calmly  restrainedly .     yes  i can live a hero  and a traitor .  they want to kill me  those men out there .  you call them men  but that was with your tongue  your mind called them something i didn   t get  but it was vile .  and not because they were vile  but because they were earthmen .         that   s a lie     hotly .      that is not a lie     as hotly     and everyone here knows that .  they want to kill me  yes  but that is because they think i   m one of your kind of people  who can condemn an entire planet at a stroke and drench it with your contempt  choke it slowly with your insufferable superiority .  well  protect yourself against these worms and vermin who are somehow managing to threaten their godlike overlords .  don   t ask for the help of one of them .         you talk like a zealot     said arvardan with amazement .     why .  have you suffered .  you were a member of a large and independent planet  you say .  you were an earthman when earth was the sole repository of life .  you   re one of us  man  one of the rulers .  why associate yourself with a desperate remnant .  this is not the planet you remember .  my planet is more like the old earth than is this diseased world .      schwartz laughed .     i   m one of the rulers  you say .  well  we won   t go into that .  it isn   t worth explaining .  let   s take you instead .  you   re a fine sample of the product sent us by the galaxy .  you are tolerant and wonderfully bighearted  and admire yourself because you treat dr .  shekt as an equal .  but underneath  yet not so far underneath that i can   t see it plainly in your mind  you are uncomfortable with him .  you don   t like the way he talks or the way he looks .  in fact  you don   t like him  even though he is offering to betray earth .  .  .  . yes  and you kissed a girl of earth recently and look back upon it as a weakness .  you   re ashamed of it          by the stars  i   m not .  .  .  . pola     desperately     don   t believe him .  don   t listen to him .      pola spoke quietly .     don   t deny it  or make yourself unhappy about it  bel .  he   s looking below the surface to the residue of your childhood .  he would see the same if he looked into mine .  he would see things similar if he could look into his own in as ungentlemanly a fashion as he probes ours .      schwartz felt himself reddening .   pola   s voice did not rise in pitch or intensity as she addressed him directly .     schwartz  if you can sense minds  investigate mine .  tell me if i intend treason .  look at my father .  see if it is not true that he could have avoided the sixty easily enough if he had co operated with the madmen who will ruin the galaxy .  what has he gained by his treason .  .  .  . and look again  see if any of us wish to harm earth or earthmen .      you say you have caught a glimpse of balkis   s mind .  i don   t know what chance you have had to poke through its dregs .  but when he   s back  when it   s too late  sift it  strain his thoughts .  find out that he   s a madman  then  die .      schwartz was silent .   arvardan broke in hurriedly     all right .  schwartz  tackle my mind now .  go as deep as you want .  i was born on baronn in the sirius sector .  i lived my life in an atmosphere of anti terrestrialism in the formative years  so i can   t help what flaws and follies lie at the roots of my subconscious .  but look on the surface and tell me if  in my adult years  i have not fought bigotry in myself .  not in others  that would be easy .  but in myself  and as hard as i could .      schwartz  you don   t know our history .  you don   t know of the thousands and tens of thousands of years in which man spread through the galaxy  of the wars and misery .  you don   t know of the first centuries of the empire  when still there was merely a confusion of alternating despotism and chaos .  it is only in the last two hundred    years  now  that our galactic government has become a representative one .  under it the various worlds are allowed their cultural autonomy  have been allowed to govern themselves  have been allowed voices in the common rule of all .      at no time in history has humanity been as free from war and poverty as now  at no time has galactic economy been so wisely adjusted  at no time have prospects for the future been as bright .  would you destroy it and begin all over .  and with what .  a despotic theocracy with only the unhealthy elements of suspicion and hatred in it .      earth   s grievance is legitimate and will be solved someday  if the galaxy lives .  but what they will do is no solution .  do you know what they intend doing .      if arvardan had had the ability that had come to schwartz  he would have detected the struggle in schwartz   s mind .  intuitively  however  he knew the time had come to halt for a moment .   schwartz was moved .  all those worlds to die  to fester and dissolve in horrible disease .  .  . was he an earthman after all .  simply an earthman .  in his youth he had left europe and gone to america  but was he not the same man despite that .  and if after him men had left a torn and wounded earth for the worlds beyond the sky  were they less earthmen .  was not all the galaxy his .  were not they all  all  descended from himself and his brothers .   he said heavily     all right  i   m with you .  how can i help .         how far out can you reach for minds .     asked arvardan eagerly  with a hastening quickness as though afraid still of a last change of mind .      i don   t know .  there are minds outside .  guards  i suppose .  i think i can reach out into the street even  but the further i go  the less sharp it becomes .         naturally     said arvardan .     but how about the secretary .  could you identify his mind .         i don   t know     mumbled schwartz .   a pause .  .  . the minutes stretched by unbearably .   schwartz said     your minds are in the way .  don   t watch me .  think of something else .      they tried to .  another pause .  then     no  i can   t  i can   t .      arvardan said with a sudden intensity     i can move a bit  great galaxy  i can wiggle my feet .  .  .  . ouch .     each motion was a savage twinge .   he said     how hard can you hurt someone  schwartz .  can you do it harder than the way you hurt me a while back i mean .         i   ve killed a man .         you have .  how did you do that .         i don   t know .  it just gets done .  it   s  it   s      schwartz looked almost comically helpless in his effort to put the wordless into words .      well  can you handle more than one at a time .         i   ve never tried  but i don   t think so .  i can   t read two minds at one time .      pola interrupted .     you can   t have him kill the secretary  bel .  it won   t work .         why not .         how will we get out .  even if we caught the secretary alone and killed him  there would be hundreds waiting for us outside .  don   t you see that .      but schwartz broke in  huskily     i   ve got him .         whom .     it came from all three .  even shekt was staring wildly at him .      the secretary .  i think it   s his mind touch .         don   t let him go .     arvardan almost rolled over in his attempts at exhortation  and tumbled off the slab  thumping to the floor with one half paralyzed leg working futilely to wedge underneath his body and lift .   pola cried     you   re hurt .     and suddenly found the hinges of her arm uncreaking as she tried to lift her elbow .      no  it   s all right .  suck him dry  schwartz .  get all the information you can .      schwartz reached out until his head ached .  he clutched and clawed with the tendrils of his own mind  blindly  clumsily  like an infant thrusting out fingers it can   t quite handle for an object it can   t quite reach .  until now he had taken whatever he could find  but now he was looking  looking    painfully  he caught wisps .     triumph .  he   s sure of the results .  .  .  . something about space bullets .  he   s started them .  .  .  . no  not started .  something else .  .  .  . he   s going to start them .      shekt groaned .     they   re automatically guided missiles to carry the virus  arvardan .  aimed at the various planets .         but where are they kept  schwartz .     insisted arvardan .     look  man  look          there   s a building i  can   t  quite  see .  .  .  . five points  a star  a name  sloo  maybe       shekt broke in again .     that   s it .  by all the stars in the galaxy  that   s it .  the temple of senloo .  it   s surrounded by radioactive pockets on all sides .  no one would ever go there but the ancients .  is it near the meeting of two large rivers  schwartz .         i can   t  yes  yes  yes .         when  schwartz  when .  when will they be set off .         i can   t see the day  but soon  soon .  his mind is bursting with that  it will be very soon .     his own head seemed bursting with the effort .   arvardan was dry and feverish as he raised himself finally to his hands and knees  though they wobbled and gave under him .     is he coming .         yes .  he   s at the door .      his voice sank and stopped as the door opened .   balkis   s voice was one of cold derision as he filled the room with success and triumph .     dr .  arvardan .  had you not better return to your seat .      arvardan looked up at him  conscious of the cruel indignity of his own position  but there was no answer to make  and he made none .  slowly he allowed his aching limbs to lower him to the ground .  he waited there  breathing heavily .  if his limbs could return a bit more  if he could make a last lunge  if he could somehow seize the other   s weapons  that was no neuronic whip that dangled so gently from the smoothly gleaming flexiplast belt that held the secretary   s robe in place .  it was a full size blaster that could shred a man to atoms in an instantaneous point of time .   the secretary watched the four before him with a savage sense of satisfaction .  the girl he tended to ignore  but otherwise it was a clean sweep .  there was the earthman traitor  there the imperial agent  and there the mysterious creature they had been watching for two months .  were there any others .   to be sure  there was still ennius  and the empire .  their arms  in the person of these spies and traitors  were pinioned  but there remained an active brain somewhere  perhaps to send out other arms .   the secretary stood easily  hands clasped in contemptuous disregard of any possible necessity of quickly reaching his weapon .  he spoke quietly and gently .     now it is necessary to make things absolutely clear .  there is war between earth and the galaxy  undeclared as yet  but  nevertheless  war .  you are our prisoners and will be treated as will be necessary under the circumstances .  naturally the recognized punishment for spies and traitors is death          only in the case of legal and declared war     broke in arvardan fiercely .      legal war .     questioned the secretary with more than a trace of a sneer .     what is legal war .  earth has always been at war with the galaxy  whether we made polite mention of the fact or not .         don   t bother with him     said pola to arvardan softly .     let him have his say and finish with it .      arvardan smiled in her direction .  a queer  spasmodic smile  for it was with a vast strain that he staggered to his feet and remained there  gasping .   balkis laughed softly .  with unhurried steps he shortened the distance between himself and the sirian archaeologist to nothing .  with an equally unhurried gesture he rested a soft hand upon the broad chest of the other and shoved .   with splintering arms that would not respond to arvardan   s demand for a warding motion  with stagnant trunk muscles that could not adjust the body   s balance at more than snail speed  arvardan toppled .   pola gasped .  lashing her own rebellious flesh and bone  she descended from her particular bench slowly  so slowly .   balkis let her crawl toward arvardan .      your lover     he said .     your strong outsider lover .  run to him  girl .  why do you wait .  clasp your hero tightly and forget in his arms that he steams in the sweat and blood of a billion martyred earthmen .  and there he lies  bold and valiant  brought to earth by the gentle push of an earthman   s hand .      pola was on her knees beside him now  her fingers probing beneath the hair for blood or the deadly softness of crushed bone .  arvardan   s eyes opened slowly and his lips formed a    never mind .         he   s a coward     said pola     who would fight a paralyzed man and boast his victory .  believe me  darling  few earthmen are like that .            i know it  or you would not be an earthwoman .      the secretary stiffened .      as i said  all lives here are forfeit  but  nevertheless  can be bought .  are you interested in the price .      pola said proudly     in our case  you would be .  that i know .         ssh  pola .     arvardan had not yet recovered his breath entirely .     what are you proposing .         oh     said balkis     you are willing to sell yourself .  as i would be  for instance .  i  a vile earthman .         you know best what you are     retorted arvardan .     as for the rest  i am not selling myself  i am buying her .         i refuse to be bought     said pola .      touching     grated the secretary .     he stoops to our females  our earthie squaws  and can still play act at sacrifice .         what are you proposing .     demanded arvardan .      this .  obviously  word of our plans has leaked out .  how it got to dr .  shekt is not difficult to see  but how it got to the empire is puzzling .  we would like to know  therefore  just what the empire does know .  not what you have learned  arvardan  but what the empire now knows .         i am an archaeologist and not a spy     bit out arvardan .     i don   t know anything at all about what the empire knows   but i hope they know a damned lot .         so i imagine .  well  you may change your mind .  think  all of you .      throughout  schwartz had contributed nothing  nor had he raised his eyes .   the secretary waited  then said  perhaps a trifle savagely     then i   ll outline the price to you of your non co operation .  it will not be simply death  since i am quite certain that all of you are prepared for that unpleasant and inevitable eventuality .  dr .  shekt and the girl  his daughter  who  unfortunately for herself  is implicated to a deadly extent  are citizens of earth .  under the circumstances  it will be most appropriate to have both subjected to the synapsifier .  you understand  dr .  shekt .      the physicist   s eyes were pools of pure horror .      yes  i see you do     said balkis .     it is  of course  possible to allow the synapsifier to damage brain tissue just sufficiently to allow the production of an acerebral imbecile .  it is a most disgusting state  one in which you will have to be fed  or starve  be cleaned  or live in dung  be shut up  or remain a study in horror to all who see .  it may be a lesson to others in the great day that is coming .      as for you     and the secretary turned to arvardan     and your friend schwartz  you are imperial citizens  and therefore suitable for an interesting experiment .  we have never tried our concentrated fever virus on you galactic dogs .  it would be interesting to show our calculations correct .   a small dose  you see  so that death is not quick .  the disease might work its way to the inevitable over a period of a week  if we dilute the injection sufficiently .  it will be very painful .      and now he paused and watched them through slitted eyes .  ii all that     he said     is the alternative to a few well chosen words at the present time .  how much does the empire know .  have they other agents active at the present moment .  what are their plans  if any  for counteraction .      dr .  shekt muttered     how do we know that you won   t have us killed anyway  once you have what you want of us .         you have my assurance that you will die horribly if you refuse .  you will have to gamble on the alternative .  what do you say .         can   t we have time .         isn   t that what i   m giving you now .  ten minutes have passed since i entered  and i am still listening .  .  .  . well .  have you anything to say .  what  nothing .  time will not endure forever  you must realize .  arvardan  you still knot your muscles .  you think perhaps you can reach me before i can draw my blaster .  well  what if you can .  there are hundreds outside  and my plans will continue without me .  even your separate modes of punishment will continue without me .      or perhaps you  schwartz .  you killed our agent .  it was you  was it not .  perhaps you think you can kill me .      for the first time schwartz looked at balkis .  he said coldly     i can  but i won   t .         that is kind of you .         not at all .  it is very cruel of me .  you say yourself that there are things worse than simple death .      arvardan found himself suddenly staring at schwartz in a vast hope .            duel .      schwartz   s mind was whirling .  in a queer  hectic way he felt at ease .  there was a piece of him that seemed in absolute control of the situation  and more of him that could not believe that .  paralysis had been applied later to him than to the others .  even dr .  shekt was sitting up  while he himself could just budge an arm and little more .   and  staring up at the leering mind of the secretary  infinitely foul and infinitely evil  he began his duel .   he said     i was on your side originally  for all that you were preparing to kill me .  i thought i understood your feelings and your intentions .  .  .  . but the minds of these others here are relatively innocent and pure  and yours is past description .  it is not even for the earthman you fight  but for your own personal power .  i see in you not a vision of a free earth  but of a re enslaved earth .  i see in you not the disruption of the imperial power  but its replacement by a personal dictatorship .         you see all that  do you .     said balkis .     well  see what you wish .  i don   t need your information after all  you know  not so badly that i must endure insolence .  we have advanced the hour of striking  it seems .  had you expected that .  amazing what pressure will do  even on those who swear that more speed is impossible .  did you see that  my dramatic mind reader .      schwartz said     i didn   t .  i wasn   t looking for it  and it passed my notice .  .  .  . but i can look for it now .  two days  less  let   s see  tuesday  six in the morning  chica time .      the blaster was in the secretary   s hand  finally .  he advanced in abrupt strides and towered over schwartz   s drooping figure .      how did you know that .      schwartz stiffened  somewhere mental tendrils bunched and grasped .  physically his jaw muscles clamped rigorously shut and his eyebrows curled low  but these were purely irrelevant  involuntary accompaniments to the real effort .  within his brain there was that which reached out and seized hard upon the mind touch of the other .   to arvardan  for precious  wasting seconds  the scene was meaningless  the secretary   s sudden motionless silence was not significant .   schwartz muttered gaspingly     i   ve got him .  .  .  . take away his gun .  i can   t hold on      it died away in a gurgle .   and then arvardan understood .  with a lurch he was on all fours .  then slowly  grindingly  he lifted himself once more  by main force  to an unsteady erectness .  pola tried to rise with him  could not quite make it .  shekt edged off his slab  sinking to his knees .  only schwartz lay there  his face working .   the secretary might have been struck by the medusa sight .  on his smooth and unfurrowed forehead perspiration gathered slowly  and his expressionless face hinted of no emotion .  only that right hand  holding the blaster  showed any signs of life .  watch closely  and you might see it jerk ever so gently  note the curious flexing pressure of it upon the contact button  a gentle pressure  not enough to do harm  but returning  and returning       hold him tight     gasped arvardan with a ferocious joy .  he steadied himself on the back of a chair and tried to gain his breath .     let me get to him .      his feet dragged .  he was in a nightmare  wading through molasses  swimming through tar  pulling with torn muscles  so slowly  so slowly .   he was not  could not be  conscious of the terrific duel that proceeded before him .   the secretary had only one aim  and that was to put just the tiniest force into his thumb  three ounces  to be exact  since that was the contact pressure required for the blaster   s operation .  to do so his mind had only to instruct a quiveringly balanced tendon  already half contracted  to  to    schwartz had only one aim  and that was to restrain that pressure  but in all the inchoate mass of sensation presented to him by the other   s mind touch  he could not know which particular area was alone concerned with that thumb .  so it was that he bent his efforts to produce a stasis  a complete stasis    the secretary   s mind touch heaved and billowed against restraint .  it was a quick and fearfully intelligent mind that confronted schwartz   s untried control .  for seconds it remained quiescent  waiting  then  in a terrific  tearing attempt  it would tug wildly at this muscle or that    to schwartz it was as if he had seized a wrestling hold which he must maintain at all costs  though his opponent threw him about in frenzies .   but none of this showed .  only the nervous clenching and unclenching of schwartz   s jaw  the quivering lips  bloodied by the biting teeth  and that occasional soft movement on the part of the secretary   s thumb  straining  straining .   arvardan paused to rest .  he did not want to .  he had to .  his outstretched finger just touched the fabric of the secretary   s tunic and he felt he could move no more .  his agonized lungs could not pump the breath his dead limbs required .  his eyes were blurred with the tears of effort  his mind with the haze of pain .   he gasped     just a few more minutes  schwartz .  hold him  hold him       slowly  slowly  schwartz shook his head .     i can   t  i can   t       and indeed  to schwartz all the world was slipping away into dull  unfocused chaos .  the tendrils of his mind were becoming stiff and nonresilient .   the secretary   s thumb pressed once again upon the contact .  it did not relax .  the pressure grew by tiny stages .   schwartz could feel the bulging of his own eyeballs  the writhing expansion of the veins in his forehead .  he could sense the awful triumph that gathered in the mind of the other  then arvardan lunged .  his stiff and rebellious body toppled forward  hands outstretched and clawing .   the yielding  mind held secretary toppled with him .  the blaster flew sideways  clanging along the hard floor .   the secretary   s mind wrenched free almost simultaneously  and schwartz fell back  his own skull a tangled jungle of confusion .   balkis struggled wildly beneath the clinging dead weight of arvardan   s body .  he jerked a knee into the other   s groin with a vicious strength while his clenched fist came down sideways on arvardan   s cheekbone .  he lifted and thrust  and arvardan rolled off in huddled agony .   the secretary staggered to his feet  panting and disheveled  and stopped again .   facing him was shekt  half reclining .  his right hand  shakingly supported by the left  was holding the blaster  and although it quivered  the business end pointed at the secretary .      you pack of fools     shrilled the secretary  passion choked     what do you expect to gain .  i have only to raise my voice          and you  at least     responded shekt weakly     will die .         you will accomplish nothing by killing me     said the  secretary bitterly     and you know it .  you will not save the empire you would betray us to  and you would not save even yourselves .  give me that gun and you will go free .      he extended a hand  but shekt laughed wistfully .     i am not mad enough to believe that .           perhaps not  but you are half paralyzed .     and the secretary broke sharply to the right .  far faster than the physicist   s feeble wrist could veer the blaster .   but now balkis   s mind  as he tensed for the final jump    was utterly and entirely on the blaster he was avoiding .  schwartz extended his mind once again in a final jab  and the secretary tripped and slammed downward as if he had been clubbed .   arvardan had risen painfully to his feet .  his cheek was red and swollen and he hobbled when he walked .  he said     can you move  schwartz .         a little     came the tired response .  schwartz slid out of his seat .      anyone else coming this way  maybe .            not that i can detect .      arvardan smiled grimly down at pola .  his hand was resting on her soft brown hair and she was looking up at him with brimming eyes .  several times in the last two hours he had been sure that never  never would he feel her hair or see her eyes again .      maybe there will be a later after an  pola .      and she could only shake her head and say     there   s not enough time .  we only have till six o   clock tuesday .         not enough time .  well  let   s see .     arvardan bent over the prone ancient and pulled his head back  none too gently .      is he alive .     he felt futilely for a pulse with his still numb finger tips and then placed a palm beneath the green robe .  he said     his heart   s beating  anyway .  .  .  . you   ve a dangerous power there  schwartz .  why didn   t you do this in the first place .         because i wanted to see him held static .        schwartz clearly showed the effects of his ordeal .     i thought that if i could hold him  we could lead him out before  use him as decoy  hide behind his skirts .      shekt said  in sudden animation     we might .  there   s the imperial garrison in fort dibburn not half a mile away .  once there  we   re safe and can get word to ennius .         once there .  there must be a hundred guards outside  with hundreds more between here and there  and what can we do with a stiff green robe .  carry him .  shove him along on little wheels .     arvardan laughed humorlessly .      besides     said schwartz gloomily     i couldn   t hold him very long .  you saw  i failed .      shekt said earnestly     because you   re not used to it .  now listen  schwartz  i   ve got a notion as to what it is you do with your mind .  it   s a receiving station for the electromagnetic fields of the brain .  i think you can transmit also .  do you understand .      schwartz seemed painfully uncertain .      you must understand      insisted shekt .     you   ll have to concentrate on what you want him to do  and first we   re going to give him his blaster back .         what .     the outraged exclamation was neatly triple .   shekt raised his voice .     he   s got to lead us out of here .  we can   t get out otherwise  can we .  and how can it look less suspicious than to allow him to be obviously armed .         but i couldn   t hold him .  i tell you i couldn   t .     schwartz was flexing his arms  slapping them  trying to get back into the feel of normality .     i don   t care what your theories are  dr .  shekt .  you don   t know what goes on .  it   s a slippery  painful thing  and it   s not easy .         i know  but it   s the chance we take .  try it now  schwartz .  have him move his arm when he comes to .     shekt   s voice was pleading .   the secretary moaned as he lay there  and schwartz felt the reviving mind touch .  silently  almost fearfully  he let it gather strength  then spoke to it .  it was a speech that included no words  it was the silent speech you send to your arm when you want it to move  a speech so silent you are not yourself aware of it .   and schwartz   s arm did not move  it was the secretary   s that did .  the earthman from the past looked up with a wild smile  but the others had eyes only for balkis  balkis  that recumbent figure  with a lifting head  with eyes from which the glaze of unconsciousness was vanishing  and an arm which peculiarly and incongruously jerked outward at a ninety degree angle .   schwartz bent to his task .   the secretary lifted himself up in angular fashion  nearly  but not quite  overbalancing himself .  and then  in a queer and involuntary way  he danced .   it lacked rhythm  it lacked beauty  but to the three who watched the body  and to schwartz  who watched body and mind  it was a thing of indescribable awe .  for in those moments the secretary   s body was under the control of a mind not materially connected with it .   slowly  cautiously  shekt approached the robotlike secretary and  not without a qualm  extended his hand .  in the open palm thereof lay the blaster  butt first .      let him take it  schwartz     said shekt .   balkis   s hand reached out and grasped the weapon clumsily .  for a moment there was a sharp  devouring glitter in his eyes  and then it all faded .  slowly  slowly  the blaster was put into its place in the belt  and the hand fell away .   schwartz   s laugh was high pitched .     he almost got away  there .     but his face was white as he spoke .      well .  can you hold him .         he   s fighting like the devil .  but it   s not as bad as before .         that   s because you know what you   re doing     said shekt  with an encouragement he did not entirely feel .     transmit  now .  don   t try to hold him  just pretend you   re doing it yourself .      arvardan broke in .     can you make him talk .      there was a pause  then a low  rasping growl from the secretary .  another pause  another rasp .      that   s all     panted schwartz .      but why won   t it work .     asked pola .  she looked worried .   shekt shrugged .     some pretty delicate and complicated muscles are involved .  it   s not like yanking at the long limb muscles .  never mind  schwartz .  we may get by without .        the memory of the next two hours was something no two of those that took part in the queer odyssey could duplicate .  dr .  shekt  for instance  had acquired a queer rigidity in which all his fears were drowned in one breathless and helpless sympathy with the inwardly struggling schwartz .  throughout he had eyes only for that round face as it slowly furrowed and twisted with effort .  for the others he had hardly time for more than a moment   s glance .   the guards immediately outside the door saluted sharply at the appearance of the secretary  his green robe redolent of officialdom and power .  the secretary returned the salute in a fumbling  flat manner .  they passed  unmolested .   it was only when they had left the great hall that arvardan became conscious of the madness of it all .  the great  unimaginable danger to the galaxy and the flimsy reed of safety that bridged  perhaps  the abyss .  yet even then  even then  arvardan felt himself drowning in pola   s eyes .  whether it was the life that was being snatched from him  the future that was being destroyed about him  the eternal unavailability of the sweetness he had tasted  whatever it was  no one had ever seemed to him to be so completely and devastatingly desirable .   in aftertime she was the sum of his memories .  only the girl    and upon pola the sunny brightness of the morning burned down so that arvardan   s downturned face blurred before her .  she smiled up at him and was conscious of that strong  hard arm on which her own rested so lightly .  that was the memory that lingered afterward .  flat  firm muscle lightly covered by glossy textured plastic cloth  smooth and cool under her wrist    schwartz was in a sweating agony .  the curving drive that led away from the side entrance from which they had emerged was largely empty .  for that he was hugely thankful .   schwartz alone knew the full cost of failure .  in the enemy mind that he controlled he could sense the unbearable humiliation  the surpassing hatred  the utterly horrible resolves .  he had to search that mind for the information that guided him  the position of the official ground car  the proper route to take  and  in searching  he also experienced the galling bitterness of the determined revenge that would lash out should his control waver for but the tenth part of the second .   the secret fastnesses of the mind in which he was forced to rummage remained his personal possession forever .  in aftertimes there came the pale gray hours of many an innocent dawn during which once again he had guided the steps of a madman down the dangerous walks of an enemy stronghold .   schwartz gasped at the words when they reached the ground car .  he no longer dared relax sufficiently to utter connected sentences .  he choked out quick phrases     can   t  drive car  can   t make  him  make drive  complicated  can   t       shekt soothed him with a soft  clucking sound .  he dared not touch him  dared not speak in an ordinary way  dared net distract schwartz   s mind for a second .   he whispered     just get him into the back seat  schwartz .  i   ll drive .  i know how .  from now on just keep him still .  and i   ll take the blaster away .        the secretary   s ground car was a special model .  because it was special  it was different .  it attracted attention .  its green headlight turned to the right and left in rhythmic swings as the light dimmed and brightened in emerald flashes .  men paused to watch .  ground cars advancing in the opposite direction moved to the side in a respectful hurry .   had the car been less noticed  had it been less obtrusive .  the occasional passer by might have had time to note the pale  unmoving ancient in the back seat  might have wondered  might have scented danger    but they noticed only the car  so that time passed .  .  .  .   a soldier blocked the way at the gleaming chromium gates that rose sheerly in the expansive  overwhelming way that marked all imperial structures in sharp contrast to the squatly massive and brooding architecture of earth .  his huge force gun shot out horizontally in a barring gesture  and the car halted .   arvardan leaned out .     i   m a citizen of the empire  soldier .  i   d like to see your commanding officer .         i   ll have to see your identification  sir .         that   s been taken from me .  i am bel arvardan of baronn  sirius .  i am on the procurator   s business and i   m in a hurry .      the soldier lifted a wrist to his mouth and spoke softly into the transmitter .  there was a pause while he waited for an answer  and then he lowered his rifle and stepped aside .  slowly the gate swung open .            the deadline that approached     the hours that followed saw turmoil within and without fort dibburn .  more so  perhaps  in chica itself .   it was at noon that the high minister at washenn inquired via communi wave after his secretary  and a search for the latter failed .  the high minister was displeased  the minor officials at the hall of correction were perturbed .   questioning followed  and the guards outside the assembly room were definite that the secretary had left with the prisoners at ten thirty in the morning .  .  .  . no  he had left no instructions .  they could not say where he was going  it was  of course  not their place to ask .   another set of guards was equally uninformed and uninformative .  a general air of anxiety mounted and swirled .   at   p . m .  the first report arrived that the secretary   s ground car had been seen that morning  no one had seen if the secretary was within  some thought he had been driving  but had only assumed it  it turned out    by two thirty it had been ascertained that the car had entered fort dibburn .   at not quite three  it was finally decided to put in a call to the commander of the fort .  a lieutenant had answered .   it was impossible at that time  they learned  for information on the subject to be given .  however  his imperial majesty   s officers requested that order be maintained for the present .  it was further requested that news of the absence of a member of the society of ancients be not generally distributed until further notice .   but that was enough to achieve the direct opposite of the imperial desires .   men engaged in treason cannot take chances when one of the prime members of a conspiracy is in the hands of the enemy forty eight hours before trigger time .  it can mean only discovery or betrayal  and these are but the reverse sides of a single coin .  either alternative would mean death .   so word went out    and the population of chica stirred    the professional demagogues were on the street corners .  the secret arsenals were broken open and the hands that reached withdrew with weapons .  there was a twisting drift toward the fort  and at   p . m .  a new message was sent to the commandant  this time by personal envoy .     meanwhile  this activity was matched in a smaller way by events within the fort .  it had begun dramatically when the young officer meeting the entering ground car reached out a hand for the secretary   s blaster .      i   ll take that     he said curtly .   shekt said     let him take it  schwartz .      the secretary   s hand lifted the blaster and stretched out  the blaster left it  was carried away  and schwartz  with a heaving sob of breaking tension  let go .   arvardan was ready .  when the secretary lashed out like an insane steel coil released from compression  the archaeologist pounced upon him  fists pumping down hard .   the officer snapped out orders .  soldiers were running up .  when rough hands laid hold of arvardan   s shirt collar and dragged him up  the secretary was limp upon the seat .  dark blood was flowing feebly from the corner of his mouth .  arvardan   s own already bruised cheek was open and bleeding .   he straightened his hair shakily .  then  pointing a rigid finger  said firmly     i accuse that man of conspiring to overthrow the imperial government .  i must have an immediate interview with the commanding officer .         we   ll have to see about that  sir     said the officer civilly .     if you don   t mind  you will have to follow me  all of you .      and there  for hours  it rested .  their quarters were private  and reasonably clean .  for the first time in twelve hours they had a chance to eat  which they did  despite considerations  with dispatch and efficiency .  they even had the opportunity of that further necessity of civilization  a bath .   yet the room was guarded  and as the hours passed  arvardan finally lost his temper and cried     but we   ve simply exchanged prisons .      the dull  meaningless routine of an army camp drifted about them  ignoring them .  schwartz was sleeping and arvardan   s eyes went to him .  shekt shook his head .      we can   t     he said .     it   s humanly impossible .  the man is exhausted .  let him sleep .         but there are only thirty nine hours left .         i know  but wait .      a cool and faintly sardonic voice sounded .     which of you claims to be a citizen of the empire .      arvardan sprang forward .     i am .  i       and his voice failed as he recognized the speaker .  the latter smiled rigidly .  his left arm he held a bit stiffly as a remaining memento of their last meeting .   pola   s voice was faint behind him .     bel  it   s the officer  the one of the department store .         the one whose arm he broke     came the sharp addition .     my name is lieutenant claudy and yes  you are the same man .  so you are a member of the sirian worlds  are you .  and yet you consort with these .  galaxy  the depths a man can sink to .  and you   ve still got the girl with you .     he waited and then said slowly and deliberately     the earthie squaw .      arvardan bristled  then subsided .  he couldn   t  not yet  he forced humbleness into his voice .     may i see the colonel  lieutenant .         the colonel  i am afraid  is not on duty now .         you mean he   s not in the city .         i didn   t say that .  he can be reached  if the matter is sufficiently urgent .         it is .  .  .  . may i see the officer of the day .         at the moment i am the officer of the day .         then call the colonel .      and slowly the lieutenant shook his head .     i could scarcely do so without being convinced of the gravity of the situation .     .   arvardan was shaking with impatience .     by the galaxy  stop fencing with me .  it   s life and death .         really .     lieutenant claudy swung a little swagger stick with an air of affected dandyism .     you might crave an audience with me .         all right .  .  .  . well  i   m waiting .  .  .      i said  you might crave one .         may i have an audience  lieutenant .      but there was no smile on the lieutenant   s face .     i said  crave one  before the girl .  humbly .      arvardan swallowed and drew back .  pola   s hand was on his sleeve .     please  bel .  you mustn   t get him angry .      the archaeologist growled huskily     bel arvardan of sirius humbly craves audience with the officer of the day .      lieutenant claudy said     that depends .       he took a step toward arvardan and quickly and viciously brought the flat of his palm down hard upon the bandage that dressed arvardan   s open cheek .   arvardan gasped and stifled a shriek .   the lieutenant said     you resented that once .  don   t you this time .      arvardan said nothing .   the lieutenant said     audience granted .      four soldiers fell in before and behind arvardan .  lieutenant claudy led the way .     shekt and pola were alone with the sleeping schwartz  and shekt said     i don   t hear him any more  do you .      pola shook her head .     i haven   t either  for quite a while .  but  father  do you suppose he   ll do anything to bel .         how can he .     said the old man gently .     you forget that he   s not really one of us .  he   s a citizen of the empire and cannot be easily molested .  .  .  . you are in love with him  i suppose .         oh  terribly  father .  it   s silly  i know .  .  .      of course it is .     shekt smiled bitterly .     he is honest .  i do not say he isn   t .  but what can he do .  can he live here with us on this world .  can he take you home .  introduce an earthgirl to his friends .  his family .      she was crying .     i know .  but maybe there won   t be any afterwards .      and shekt was on his feet again  as though the last phrase had reminded him .  he said again     i don   t hear him .      it was the secretary he did not hear .  balkis had been placed in an adjoining room  where his caged lion steps had been clearly and ominously audible .  except that now they weren   t .   it was a little point  but in the single mind and body of the secretary there had somehow become centered and symboled all the sinister force of disease and destruction that were being loosed on the giant network of living stars .  shekt jarred schwartz gently .     wake up     he said .   schwartz stirred .     what is it .     he felt scarcely rested .  his tiredness went in and in  so deep as to come out at the other side  projecting in jagged streaks .      where   s balkis .     urged shekt .      oh  oh yes .     schwartz looked about wildly  then remembered that it was not with his eyes that he looked and saw most clearly .  he sent out the tendrils of his mind and they circled  sensing tensely for the mind they knew so well .   he found it  and avoided touching it .  his long immersion in it had not increased his fondness for the clinging of its diseased wretchedness .   schwartz muttered     he   s on another floor .  he   s talking to someone .         to whom .         no one whose mind i   ve even touched before .  wait  let me listen .  maybe the secretary will  yes  he calls him colonel .      shekt and pola looked quickly at one another .      it can   t be treason  can it .     whispered pola .     i mean  surely an officer of the empire wouldn   t deal with an earthman against the emperor  would he .         i don   t know     said shekt miserably .     i am ready to believe anything .        lieutenant claudy was smiling .  he was behind a desk  with a blaster at his finger tips and the four soldiers behind him .  he spoke with the authority that such a situation would lend one .      i don   t like earthies     he said .     i never liked them .  they   re the scum of the galaxy .  they   re diseased  superstitious  and lazy .  they   re degenerate and stupid .  but  by the stars  most of them know their place .      in a way  i can understand them .  that   s the way they were born  and they can   t help it .  of course i wouldn   t endure what the emperor endures from them  i mean their blasted customs and traditions  if   were the emperor .  but that   s all right .  someday we   ll learn       arvardan exploded .     now look here .  i didn   t come to listen          you   ll listen  because i   m not finished .  i was about to say that what i can   t understand is the workings of the mind of an earthie lover .  when a man  a real man  supposedly  can get so low in filth as to crawl in among them and go nosing after their womenfolk  i have no respect for him .  he   s worse than they are          then to space with you and your poor filthy excuse of a mind .     fiercely .     do you know that there   s treason against the empire afoot .  do you know just how dangerous the situation is .  every minute you delay endangers everyone of the quadrillions in the galaxy          oh  i don   t know  dr .  arvardan .  it is dr .   isn   t it .  i mustn   t forget your honors .  you see  i   ve got a theory of my own .  you   re one of them .  maybe you were born in sirius  but you   ve got a black earthman   s heart  and you   re using your galactic citizenship to advance their cause .  you   ve kidnaped this official of theirs  this ancient .   a good thing  by the way  in itself  and i wouldn   t mind rattling his throat for him .   but the earthmen are looking for him already .  they   ve sent a message to the fort .         they have .  already .  then why are we talking here .  i must see the colonel if i have to          you expect a riot  trouble of any sort .  perhaps you even planned one as the first step in an arranged revolt  eh .         are you mad .  why would i want to do that .         well  then  you wouldn   t mind if we released the ancient .         you cannot .     arvardan rose to his feet  and for a moment it looked as though he might hurl himself across the desk at the other .   but the blaster was in lieutenant claudy   s hand .     oh  can   t we .  look here  now .  i   ve gotten a little of my own back .  i   ve slapped you and made you crawl before your earthie pals .  i   ve made you sit here while i told you to your face what a low worm you are .  and now i would love an excuse to blast your arm off in exchange for what you did to mine .  now make another move .      arvardan froze .   lieutenant claudy laughed and put his blaster away .     it   s too bad i have to save you for the colonel he   s to see you at five fifteen .         you knew that  you knew that all the time .     frustration tore his throat into hoarse sandpaper .      certainly .         if the time we have lost  lieutenant claudy  means that the issue is lost  then neither of us will have much time to live .     he spoke with an iciness that distorted his voice into something horrible .     but you will die first  because i shall spend my last minutes smashing your face into splintered bone and mashed brain .         i   ll be waiting for you  earthie lover .  any time .        the commanding officer of fort dibburn had grown stiff in the service of the empire .  in the profound peace of the last generations there was little in the way of    glory    that any army officer could earn  and the colonel  in common with others  earned none .  but in the long  slow rise from military cadet he had seen service in every part of the galaxy  so that even a garrison on the neurotic world of earth was to him but an additional chore .  he wanted only the peaceful routine of normal occupation .  he asked nothing beyond this  and for it was willing to humble himself  even  when it was necessary  to apologize to an earthgirl .   he seemed tired when arvardan entered .  his shirt collar was open and his tunic  with its blazing yellow    spaceship and sun    of empire  hung loosely over the back of his chair .  he cracked the knuckles of his right hand with an abstracted air as he stared solemnly at arvardan .      a very confusing story  all this     he said     very .  i recall you well  young man .  you are bel arvardan of baronn  and the principal of a previous moment of considerable embarrassment .  can   t you keep out of trouble .         it is not only myself that is in trouble  colonel  but all the rest of the galaxy as well .         yes  i know     somewhat impatiently .     or at least i know that that is what you claim .  i am told that you no longer have papers of identification .         they were taken from me  but i am known at everest .  the procurator himself can identify me  and will  i hope  before evening falls .         we   ll see about that .     the colonel crossed his arms and teetered backward on his chair .     suppose you give me your side of the story .         i have been made aware of a dangerous conspiracy on the part of a small group of earthmen to overthrow the imperial government by force  which  if not made known at once to the proper authorities  may well succeed in destroying both the government and much of the empire itself .         you go too far  young man  in this very rash and farfetched statement .  that the men of earth could stage annoying riots  lay siege to this fort  do considerable damage  i am quite prepared to admit  but i do not for a moment conceive them capable of as much as driving the imperial forces from this planet  let alone destroying the imperial government .  yet i will listen to the details of this  uh  plot .         unfortunately  the seriousness of the matter is such that i feel it vital that the details be told to the procurator himself in person .  i request  therefore  to be put into communication with him now  if you don   t mind .         umm .  .  .  . let us not act too hurriedly .  are you aware that the man you have brought in is secretary to the high minister of earth  one of their ancients and a very important man to them .         perfectly .         and yet you say that he is a prime mover in this conspiracy you mention .         he is .         your evidence .         you will understand me  i am sure  when i say that i cannot discuss that with anyone but the procurator .      the colonel frowned and regarded his fingernails .     do you doubt my competency in the case .         not at all  sir .  it is simply that only the procurator has the authority to take the decisive action required in this case .         what decisive action do you refer to .         a certain building on earth must be bombed and totally destroyed within thirty hours  or the lives of most  or all  of the inhabitants of the empire will be lost .         what building .     asked the colonel wearily .  arvardan snapped back .     may i be connected with the procurator  please .      there was a pause of deadlock .  the colonel said stiffly     you realize that in forcibly kidnaping an earthman you have rendered yourself liable to trial and punishment by the terrestrial authorities .  ordinarily the government will protect its citizens as a matter of principle and insist upon a galactic trial .  however  affairs on earth are delicate and i have strict instructions to risk no avoidable clash .  therefore .  unless you answer my questions fully  i will be forced to turn you and your companions over to the local police .         but that would be a death sentence .  for yourself tool .  .  .  colonel  i am a citizen of the empire  and i demand an audience with the pro       a buzzer on the colonel   s desk interrupted him .  the colonel turned to it  closing a contact .     yes .         sir     came the clear voice     a body of natives have encircled the fort .  it is believed they are armed .         has there been any violence .         no  sir .      there was no sign of emotion on the colonel   s face .  this  at least  was what he was trained for .     artillery and aircraft are to be made ready  all men to battle stations .  withhold all fire except in self defense .  understood .         yes  sir .  an earthman under flag of truce wishes audience .         send him in .  also send the high minister   s secretary here again .      and now the colonel glared coldly at the archaeologist .     i trust you are aware of the appalling nature of what you have caused .         i demand to be present at the interview     cried arvardan  nearly incoherent with fury     and i further demand the reason for your allowing me to rot under guard here for hours while you closet yourself with a native traitor .  i tell you that i am not ignorant that you interviewed him before speaking with me .         are you making any accusations  sir .     demanded the colonel  his own voice ascending the scale .     if so  make them plainly .         i make no accusations .  but i will remind you that you will be accountable for your actions hereafter  and that you may well be known in the future  if you have a future  as the destroyer  by your stubbornness  of your people .         silence .  i am not accountable to you  at any rate .  we will conduct affairs  henceforward  as i choose .  do you understand .               the deadline that was reached     the secretary passed through the door held open by a soldier .  on his purpling  swollen lips there was a brief  cold smile .  he bowed to the colonel and remained completely unaware  to all appearances  of the presence of arvardan .      sir     said the colonel to the earthman     i have communicated to the high minister the details of your presence here and the manner in which it came about .  your detention here is  of course  entirely  uh  unorthodox  and it is my purpose to set you free as soon as i can .  however  i have here a gentleman who  as you probably know  has lodged against you a very serious accusation  one which  under the circumstances  we must investigate          i understand  colonel     said the secretary calmly .     however  as i have already explained to you  this man has been on earth  i believe  only a matter of two months or so  so that his knowledge of our internal politics is nonexistent .  this is a flimsy basis  indeed  for any accusation .      arvardan retorted in anger     i am an archaeologist by profession  and one who has specialized of late on earth and its customs .  my knowledge of its politics is far from nonexistent .  and in any case  i am not the only one who makes the accusation .      the secretary did not look at the archaeologist either now or later .  he spoke exclusively to the colonel .  he said     one of our local scientists is involved in this  one who  approaching the end of his normal sixty years  is suffering from delusions of persecution .  then  in addition  there is another man  one of unknown antecedents and a history of idiocy .  all three could not raise a respectable accusation among them .      arvardan jumped to his feet .     i demand to be heard          sit down     said the colonel coldly and unsympathetically .     you have refused to discuss the matter with me .  let the refusal stand .  bring in the man with the flag of truce .      it was another member of the society of ancients .  scarcely a flicker of the eyelid betrayed any emotion on his part at the sight of the secretary .  the colonel rose from his chair and said     do you speak for the men outside .         i do  sir .         i assume  then  that this riotous and illegal assembly is based upon a demand for the return of your fellow countryman here .         yes  sir .  he must be immediately freed .         indeed .  nevertheless  the interest of law and order and the respect due his imperial majesty   s representatives on this world require that the matter cannot possibly be discussed while men are gathered in armed rebellion against us .  you must have your men disperse .      the secretary spoke up pleasantly .     the colonel is perfectly correct  brother cori .  please calm the situation .  i am perfectly safe here  and there is no danger  for anybody .  do you understand .  for anybody .  it is my word as an ancient .         very well  brother .  i am thankful you are safe .      he was ushered out .   the colonel said curtly     we will see that you leave here safely as soon as matters in the city have returned to normal .  thank you for your co operation in this matter just concluded .      arvardan was again on his feet .     i forbid it .  you will let loose this would be murderer of the human race while forbidding me an interview with the procurator when that would be simply in accord with my rights as a galactic citizen .     then  in a paroxysm of frustration     will you show more consideration to an barthman dog than you will to me .      the secretary   s voice sounded over that last near incoherent rage .     colonel  i will gladly remain until such time as my case is heard by the procurator  if that is what this man wants .  an accusation of treason is serious  and the suspicion of it  however farfetched  may be sufficient to ruin my usefulness to my people .  i would really appreciate the opportunity to prove to the procurator that none is more loyal to the empire than myself .      the colonel said stiffly     i admire your feelings  sir  and freely admit that were i in your place my attitude would be quite different .  you are a credit to your race  sir .  i will attempt contact with the procurator .      arvardan said nothing more until led back to his cell .     he avoided the glance of the others .  for a long time he sat motionless  with a knuckle pinched between gnawing teeth .   until shekt said     well .      arvardan shook his head .     i just about ruined everything .         what did you do .         lost my temper  offended the colonel  got nowhere  i   m no diplomat  shekt .      he felt riven with the sudden urge for self defense .     what could i do .     he cried .     balkis had already been to the colonel  so that i couldn   t trust him .  what if he   d been offered his life .  what if he   s been in on the plot all along .  i know it   s a wild thought  but i couldn   t take the chance .  it was too suspicious .  i wanted to see ennius himself .      the physicist was on his feet  withered hands clasped behind his back .     well  then  is ennius coming .         i suppose so .  but it is only at balkis   s own request  and that i don   t understand .         balkis   s own request .  then schwartz must be right .         yes .  what has schwartz been saying .      the plump earthman was sitting on his cot .  he shrugged his shoulders when the eyes turned to him and spread out his hands in a helpless gesture .     i caught the secretary   s mind touch when they took him past our room just now .  he   s definitely had a long talk with this officer you talked to .         i know .         but there   s no treason in that officer   s mind .         well     miserably     then i guessed wrong .  i   ll eat worms when ennius comes .  what about balkis .         there   s no worry or fear in his mind  only hate .  and now it   s mostly hate for us  for capturing him  for dragging him here .  we   ve wounded his vanity horribly  and he intends to square it with us .  i saw little daydream pictures in his mind .  of himself  singlehanded  preventing the entire galaxy from doing anything to stop him even while we  with our knowledge  work against him .  he   s giving us the odds  the trumps  and then he   ll smash us anyway and triumph over us .         you mean that he will risk his plans  his dreams of empire  just to vent a little spite at us .  that   s mad .         i know     said schwartz with finality .     he is mad .         and he thinks he   ll succeed .         that   s right .         then we must have you  schwartz .  we   ll need your mind .  listen to me       but shekt was shaking his head .     no  arvardan  we couldn   t work that .    woke schwartz when you left and we discussed the matter .  his mental powers  which he can describe only dimly  are obviously not under perfect control .  he can stun a man  or paralyze him  or even kill him .  better than that  he can control the larger voluntary muscles even against the subject   s will  but no more than that .  in the case of the secretary  he couldn   t make the man talk .  the small muscles about the vocal cords being beyond him .  he couldn   t co ordinate motion well enough to have the secretary drive a car  he even balanced him while walking only with difficulty .  obviously  then  we couldn   t control ennius  for instance  to the point of having him issue an order  or write one .  i   ve thought of that  you see .  .  .     shekt shook his head as his voice trailed away .   arvardan felt the desolation of futility descend upon him .  then  with a sudden pang of anxiety     where   s pola .         she   s sleeping in the alcove .      he would have longed to wake her  longed  oh  longed a lot of things .   arvardan looked at his watch .  it was almost midnight  and there were only thirty hours left .   he slept for a while after that  then woke for a while  as it grew light again .  no one approached  and a man   s very soul grew haggard and pale .   arvardan looked at his watch .  it was almost midnight  and there were only six hours left .   he looked about him now in a dazed and hopeless way .  they were all here now  even the procurator  at last .  pola was next to him  her warm little fingers on his wrist and that look of fear and exhaustion on her face that more than anything else infuriated him against all the galaxy .   maybe they all deserved to die  the stupid  stupid  stupid    he scarcely saw shekt and schwartz .  they sat on his left .  and there was balkis  the damnable balkis  with his lips still swollen  one cheek green  so that it must hurt like the devil to talk  and arvardan   s own lips stretched into a furious  aching smile at the thought and his fists clenched and writhed .  his own bandaged cheek ached less at the thought .   facing all of them was ennius  frowning  uncertain  almost ridiculous  dressed as he was in those heavy  shapeless  leadimpregnated clothes .   and he was stupid  too .  arvardan felt a thrill of hatred shoot through him at the thought of these galactic trimmers who wanted only peace and ease .  where were the conquerors of three centuries back .  where .  .  .  .   six hours left    ennius had received the call from the chica garrison some eighteen hours before and he had streaked half around the planet at the summons .  the motives that led him to that were obscure but nonetheless forceful .  essentially  he told himself  there was nothing to the matter but a regrettable kidnaping of one of those green robed curiosities of superstitious  hagridden earth .  that  and these wild and undocumented accusations .  nothing  certainly  that the colonel on the spot could not have handled .   and yet there was shekt  shekt was in this  and not as the accused  but as an accuser .  it was confusing .   he sat now facing them  thinking  quite conscious that his decision in this case might hasten a rebellion  perhaps weaken his own position at court  ruin his chances at advancement  as for arvardan   s long speech just now about virus strains and unbridled epidemics  how seriously could he take it .  after all .  if he took action on the basis of it  how credible would the matter sound to his superiors .   and yet arvardan was an archaeologist of note .   so he postponed the matter in his mind by saying to the secretary     surely you have something to say in this matter .         surprisingly little     said the secretary with easy confidence .     i would like to ask what evidence exists for supporting the accusation .         your excellency     said arvardan with snapping patience     i have already told you that the man admitted it in every detail at the time of our imprisonment day before yesterday .         perhaps     said the secretary     you choose to credit that  your excellency  but it is simply an additional unsupported statement .  actually the only facts to which outsiders can bear witness to are that i was the one violently taken prisoner  not they  that it was my life that was in peril  not theirs .  now i would like my accuser to explain how he could find all this out in the nine weeks that he has been on the planet  when you  the procurator  in years of service here  have found nothing to my disadvantage .         there is reason in what the brother says     admitted ennius heavily .     how do you know .      arvardan replied stiffly     prior to the accused   s confession i was informed of the conspiracy by dr .  shekt .         is that so  dr .  shekt .     the procurator   s glance shifted to the physicist .      that is so  your excellency .         and how did you find out .      shekt said     dr .  arvardan was admirably thorough and accurate in his description of the use to which the synapsifier was put and in his remarks concerning the dying statements of the bacteriologist  f .  smitko .  this smitko was a member of the conspiracy .  his remarks were recorded and the recording is available .         but  dr .  shekt  the dying statements of a man known to be in delirium  if what dr .  arvardan said is true  cannot be of very great weight .  you have nothing else .      arvardan interrupted by striking his fist on the arm of his chair and roaring     is this a law court .  has someone been guilty of violating a traffic ordinance .  we have no time to weigh evidence on an analytical balance or measure it with micrometers .  i tell you we have till six in the morning  five and a half hours  in other words  to wipe out this enormous threat .  .  .  . you knew dr .  shekt previous to this time  your excellency .  have you known him to be a liar .      the secretary interposed instantly     no one accused dr .  shekt of deliberately lying  your excellency .  it is only that the good doctor is aging and has  of late  been greatly concerned over his approaching sixtieth birthday .  i am afraid that a combination of age and fear have induced slight paranoiac tendencies  common enough here on earth .  .  .  .  look at him .  does he seem to you quite normal .      he did not  of course .  he was drawn and tense  shattered by what had passed and what was to come .   yet shekt forced his voice into normal tones  even into calmness .  he said     i might say that for the last two months i have been under the continual watch of the ancients  that my letters have been opened and my answers censored .  but it is obvious that all such complaints would be attributed to the paranoia spoken of .  however  i have here joseph schwartz  the man who volunteered as a subject for the synapsifier one day when you were visiting me at the institute .         i remember .     there was a feeble gratitude in ennius   s mind that the subject had  for the moment  veered .     is that the man .         yes .         he looks none the worse for the experience .         he is far the better .  the exposure to the synapsifier was uncommonly successful  since he had a photographic memory to begin with  a fact i did not know at the time .  at any rate  he now has a mind which is sensitive to the thoughts of others .      ennius leaned far forward in his chair and cried in a shocked amazement     what .  are you telling me he reads minds .         that can be demonstrated  your excellency .  but i think the brother will confirm the statement .     the secretary darted a quick look of hatred at schwartz  boiling in its intensity and lightninglike in its passage across his face .  he said  with but the most imperceptible quiver in his voice     it is quite true  your excellency .  this man they have here has certain hypnotic faculties  though whether that is due to the synapsifier or not i don   t know .  i might add that this man   s subjection to the synapsifier was not recorded  a matter which you   ll agree is highly suspicious .         it was not recorded     said shekt quietly     in accordance with my standing orders from the high minister .     but the secretary merely shrugged his shoulders at that .   ennius said peremptorily     let us get on with the matter and avoid this petty bickering .  .  .  . what about this schwartz .  what have his mind reading powers  or hypnotic talents  or whatever they are  to do with the case .         shekt intends to say     put in the secretary     that schwartz can read my mind .         is that it .  well  and what is he thinking .     asked the procurator  speaking to schwartz for the first time .      he   s thinking     said schwartz     that we have no way of convincing you of the truth of our side of what you call the case .         quite true     scoffed the secretary     though that deduction scarcely calls for much mental power .         and also     schwartz went on     that you are a poor fool  afraid to act  desiring only peace  hoping by your justice and impartiality to win over the men of earth  and all the more a fool for so hoping .      the secretary reddened .      .   deny all that .  it is an obvious attempt to prejudice you  your excellency .      but ennius said     i am not so easily prejudiced .     and then  to schwartz      and what am   thinking .      schwartz replied     that even if i could see clearly within a man   s skull  i need not necessarily tell the truth about what i see .      the procurator   s eyebrows lifted in surprise .     you are correct  quite correct .  do you maintain the truth of the claims put forward by drs .  arvardan and shekt .         every word of it .         so .  yet unless a second such as you can be found  one who is not involved in the matter  your evidence would not be valid in law even if we could obtain general belief in you as a telepath .         but it is not a question of the law     cried arvardan     but of the safety of the galaxy .          your excellency     the secretary rose in his seat     i have a request to make .  i would like to have this joseph schwartz removed from the room .         why so .         this man  in addition to reading minds  has certain powers of mental force .  i was captured by means of a paralysis induced by this schwartz .  it is my fear that he may attempt something of the sort now against me  or even against you  your excellency  that forces me to the request .      arvardan rose to his feet  but the secretary overshouted him to say     no hearing can be fair if a man is present who might subtly influence the mind of the judge by means of admitted mental gifts .      ennius made his decision quickly .  an orderly entered  and joseph schwartz  offering no resistance  nor showing the slightest sign of perturbation on his moonlike face  was led away .   to arvardan it was the final blow .   as for the secretary  he rose now and for the moment stood there  a squat  grim figure in green  strong in his self confidence .   he began  in serious  formal style     your excellency  all of dr .  arvardan   s beliefs and statements rest upon the testimony of dr .  shekt .  in turn  dr .  shekt   s beliefs rest upon the dying delirium of one man .  and all this  your excellency  all this  somehow never reached the surface until after joseph schwartz was submitted to the synapsifier .      who  then  is joseph schwartz .  until joseph schwartz appeared on the scene  dr .  shekt was a normal  untroubled man .  you yourself  your excellency  spent an afternoon with him the day schwartz was brought in for treatment .  was he abnormal then .  did he inform you of treason against the empire .  of certain babblings on the part of a dying biochemist .  did he seem even troubled .  or suspicious .  he says now that he was instructed by the high minister to falsify the results of the synapsifier tests  not to record the names of those treated .  did he tell you that then .  or only now  after that day on which schwartz appeared .      again  who is joseph schwartz .  he spoke no known language at the time he was brought in .  so much we found out for ourselves later  when we first began to suspect the stability of dr .  shekt   s reason .  he was brought in by a farmer who knew nothing of his identity  or  indeed  any facts about him at all .  nor have any since been discovered .      yet this man has strange mental powers .  he can stun at a hundred yards by thought alone  kill at closer range .  i myself have been paralyzed by him  my arms and legs were manipulated by him  my mind might have been manipulated by him if he had wished .      i believe  certainly  that schwartz did manipulate the minds of these others .  they say i captured them  that i threatened them with death  that i confessed to treason and to aspiring to empire  yet ask of them one question  your excellency .  have they not been thoroughly exposed to the influence of schwartz  that is  of a man capable of controlling their minds .      is not perhaps schwartz a traitor .  if not  who is schwartz .      the secretary seated himself  calm  almost genial .   arvardan felt as though his brain had mounted a cyclotron and was spinning outward now in faster and faster revolutions .   what answer could one make .  that schwartz was from the past .  what evidence was there for that .  that the man spoke a genuinely primitive speech .  but only he himself  arvardan  could testify to that .  and he  arvardan  might well have a manipulated mind .  after all  how could he tell his mind had not been manipulated .  who was schwartz .  what had so convinced him of this great plan of galactic conquest .   he thought again .  from where came his conviction of the truth of the conspiracy .  he was an archaeologist  given to doubting  but now  had it been one man   s word .  one girl   s kiss .  or joseph schwartz .   he couldn   t think .  he couldn   t think .      well .     ennius sounded impatient .     have you anything to say  dr .  shekt .  or you  dr .  arvardan .      but pola   s voice suddenly pierced the silence .     why do you ask them .  can   t you see that it   s all a lie .  don   t you see that he   s tying us all up with his false tongue .  oh  we   re all going to die  and i don   t care any more  but we could stop it  we could stop it  and instead we just sit here and  and  talk      she burst into wild sobs .   the secretary said     so we are reduced to the screams of a hysterical girl .  .  .  . your excellency  i have this proposition .  my accusers say that all this  the alleged virus and whatever else they have in mind  is scheduled for a definite time  six in the morning  i believe .  i offer to remain in your custody for a week .  if what they say is true  word of an epidemic in the galaxy ought to reach earth within a few days .  if such occurs  imperial forces will still control earth          earth is a fine exchange  indeed  for a galaxy of humans     mumbled the white faced shekt .      i value my own life  and that of my people .  we are hostages for our innocence  and i am prepared at this instant to inform the society of ancients that i will remain here for a week of my own free will and prevent any disturbances that might otherwise occur .      he folded his arms .   ennius looked up  his face troubled .     i find no fault in this man       arvardan could stand it no more .  with a quiet and deadly ferocity  he arose and strode quickly toward the procurator .  what he meditated was never known .  afterward he himself could not remember .  at any rate  it made no difference .  ennius had a neuronic whip and used it .   for the third time since landing on earth everything about arvardan flamed up into pain  spun about  and vanished .   in the hours during which arvardan was unconscious the six o   clock deadline was reached             the deadline that passed     and passed .     light    blurring light and misty shadows  melting and twisting  and then coming into focus .   a face  eyes upon his       pola .     things were sharp and clear to arvardan in a single  leaping bound .     what time is it .      his fingers were hard upon her wrist  so that she winced involuntarily .      it   s past seven     she whispered .     past the deadline .      he looked about wildly  starting from the cot on which he lay  disregarding the burning in his joints .  shekt  his lean figure huddled in a chair  raised his head to nod in brief mournfulness .      it   s all over  arvardan .         then ennius          ennius     said shekt     would not take the chance .  isn   t that strange .     he laughed a queer  cracked  rasping laugh .     the three of us singlehandedly discover a vast plot against humanity  singlehandedly we capture the ringleader and bring him to justice .  it   s like a visicast  isn   t it  with the great all conquering heroes zooming to victory in the nick of time .  that   s where they usually end it .  only in our case the visicast went on and we found that nobody believed us .  that doesn   t happen in visicasts  does it .  things end happily there  don   t they .  it   s funny      the words turned into rough  dry sobs .   arvardan looked away  sick .  pola   s eyes were dark universes  moist and tear filled .  somehow  for an instant  he was lost in them  they were universes  star filled .  and toward those stars little gleaming metallic cases were streaking  dee vouring the light years as they penetrated hyperspace in calculated  deadly paths .  soon  perhaps already  they would approach  pierce atmospheres  fall apart into unseen deadly rains of virus    well  it was over .  it could no longer be stopped .     where is schwartz .     he asked weakly .  but pola only shook her head .     they never brought him back .        the door opened  and arvardan was not so far gone in the acceptance of death as to fail to look up with a momentary wash of hope upon his face .   but it was ennius  and arvardan   s face hardened and turned away .   ennius approached and looked momentarily at the father and daughter .  but even now shekt and pola were primarily earth creatures and could say nothing to the procurator  even though they knew that short and violent as their future lives were to be  that of the procurator would be even shorter and more violent .   ennius tapped arvardan on the shoulder .     dr .  arvardan .         your excellency .     said arvardan in a raw and bitter imitation of the other   s intonation .      it is after six o   clock .     ennius had not slept that night .  with his official absolution of balkis had come no absolute assurance that the accusers were completely mad  or under mental control .  he had watched the soulless chronometer tick away the life of the galaxy .      yes     said arvardan .     it is after six and the stars still shine .         but you still think you were right .         your excellency     said arvardan     in a matter of hours the first victims will die .  they won   t be noticed .  human beings die every day .  in a week hundreds of thousands will have died .  the percentage of recovery will be close to zero .  no known remedies will be available .  several planets will send out emergency calls for epidemic relief .  in two weeks scores of planets will have joined the call and states of emergency will be declared in the nearer sectors .  in a month the galaxy will be a writhing mass of disease .  in two months not twenty planets will remain untouched .  in six months the galaxy will be dead .  .  .  . and what will you do when those first reports come in .      let me predict that as well .  you will send out reports that the epidemics may have started on earth .  this will save no lives .  you will declare war on the ancients of earth .  this will save no lives .  you will wipe the earthman from the face of his planet .  this will save no lives .  .  .  . or else you will act as go between for your friend balkis and the galactic council  or the survivors thereof .  you may then have the honor of handing the wretched remnants of the crumbs of the empire to balkis in return for antitoxin  which mayor may not reach sufficient worlds in sufficient quantities in sufficient time to save a single human being .      ennius smiled without conviction .     don   t you think you   re being ridiculously overdramatic .         oh yes .  i   m a dead man and you   re a corpse .  but let   s be devilishly cool and imperial about it  don   t y   know .         if you resent the use of the neuronic whip          not at all     ironically .     i   m used to it .  i hardly feel it any more .         then i am putting it to you as logically as i can .  this has been a nasty mess .  it would be difficult to report sensibly  yet as difficult to suppress without reason .  now the other accusers involved are earthmen  your voice is the only one which would carry weight .  suppose you sign a statement to the effect that the accusation was made at a time when you were not in your  well  we   ll think of some phrase that will cover it without bringing in the notion of mental control .         that would be simple .  say i was crazy  drunk  hypnotized  or drugged .  anything goes .         will you be reasonable .  now look  i tell you that you have been tampered with .     he was whispering tensely .     you   re a man of sirius .  why have you fallen in love with an earthgirl .         what .         don   t shout .  i say  in your normal state  could you ever have gone native .  could you have considered that sort of thing .     he nodded his head just perceptibly in the direction of pola .   for an instant arvardan stared at him in surprise .  then  quickly  his hand shot out and seized the highest imperial authority on earth by the throat .  ennius   s hands wrenched wildly and futilely at the other   s grip .   arvardan said     that sort of thing  eh .  do you mean miss shekt .  if you do  i want to hear the proper respect  eh .  ah  go away .  you   re dead anyway .      ennius said gaspingly     dr .  arvardan  you will consider yourself under ar       the door opened again  and the colonel was upon them .      your excellency  the earth rabble has returned .         what .  hasn   t this balkis spoken to his officials .  he was going to arrange for a week   s stay .         he has spoken and he   s still here .  but so is the mob .  we are ready to fire upon them  and it is my advice as military commander that we proceed to do that .  have you any suggestions  your excellency .         hold your fire until i see balkis .  have him sent in here .     he turned .     dr .  arvardan  i will deal with you later .        balkis was brought in  smiling .  he bowed formally to ennius  who yielded him the barest nod in return .      see here     said the procurator brusquely     i am informed your men are packing the approaches to fort dibburn .  this was not part of our agreement .  .  .  . now  we do not wish to cause bloodshed  but our patience is not inexhaustible .  can you disperse them peaceably .         if i choose  your excellency .         if you choose .  you had better choose .  and at once .         not at all  your excellency .     and now the secretary smiled and flung out an arm .  his voice was a wild taunt  too long withheld  now gladly released .     fool .  you waited too long and can die for that .  or live a slave  if you prefer  but remember that it will not be an easy life .      the wildness and fervor of the statement produced no shattering effect upon ennius .  even here  at what was undoubtedly the profoundest blow of ennius   s career  the stolidity of the imperial career diplomat did not desert him .  it was only that the grayness and deep eyed weariness about him deepened .      then i lost so much in my caution .  the story of the virus  was true .     there was almost an abstract  indifferent wonder in his voice .     but earth  yourself  you are all my hostages .         not at all     came the instant  victorious cry .     it is you and yours that are my hostages .  the virus that now is spreading through the universe has not left earth immune .  enough already saturates the atmosphere of every garrison on the planet  including everest itself .  we of earth are immune  but how do you feel .  procurator .  weak .  is your throat dry .  your head feverish .  it win not be long  you know .  and it is only from us that you can obtain the antidote .      for a long moment ennius said nothing  his face thin and suddenly incredibly haughty .   then he turned to arvardan and in cool  cultured tones said     dr .  arvardan  i find i must beg your pardon for having doubted your word .  dr .  shekt  miss shekt  my apologies .      arvardan bared his teeth .     thank you for your apologies .  they will be of great help to everybody .         your sarcasm is deserved     said the procurator .     if you will excuse me  i will return to everest to die with my family .  any question of compromise with this  man is  of course  out of the question .  my soldiers of the imperial procuracy of earth will  i am sure  acquit themselves properly before their death  and not a few earthmen will undoubtedly have time to light the way for us through the passages of death .  .  .  . good by .           hold on .  hold on .  don   t go .     slowly  slowly  ennius looked up to the new voice .   slowly  slowly  joseph schwartz  frowning a bit  swaying a bit with weariness  stepped across the threshold .   the secretary tensed and sprang backward .  with a sudden  wary suspicion  he faced the man from the past .      no     he gritted     you can   t get the secret of the antidote out of me .  only certain men have it  and only certain others are trained to use it properly .  all these are safely out of your reach for the time it takes the toxin to do its work .         they are out of reach now     admitted schwartz     but not for the time it would take the toxin to do its work .  you see  there is no toxin  and no virus to stamp out .      the statement did not quite penetrate .  arvardan felt a sudden choking thought enter his mind .  had he been tampered with .  had all this been a gigantic hoax  one that had taken in the secretary as well as himself .  if so  why .   but ennius spoke .     quickly  man .  your meaning .         it   s not complicated     said schwartz .     when we were here last night i knew i could do nothing by simply sitting and listening .  so i worked carefully on the secretary   s mind for a long time .  .  .  . i dared not be detected .  and then  finally  he asked that i be ordered out of the room .  this was what i wanted  of course  and the rest was easy .      i stunned my guard and left for the airstrip .  the fort was on a twenty four hour alert .  the aircraft were fueled  armed  and ready for flight .  the pilots were waiting .  i picked one out  and we flew to senloo .      the secretary might have wished to say something .  his jaws writhed soundlessly .   it was shekt who spoke .     but you could force no one to fly a plane  schwartz .  it was all you could do to make a man walk .         yes  when it   s against his will .  but from dr .  arvardan   s mind i knew how sirians hated earthmen  so i looked for a pilot who was born in the sirius sector and found lieutenant claudy .         lieutenant claudy .     cried arvardan .      yes  oh  you know him .  yes  i see .  it   s quite clear in your mind .         i   ll bet .  .  .  . go ahead  schwartz .         this officer hated earthmen with a hate that   s difficult to understand  even for me  and i was inside his mind .  he wanted to bomb them .  he wanted to destroy them .  it was only discipline that tied him fast and kept him from taking out his plane then and there .      that kind of a mind is different .  just a little suggestion  a little push  and discipline was not enough to hold him .  i don   t even think he realized that i climbed into the plane with him .         how did you find senloo .     whispered shekt .      in my time     said schwartz     there was a city called st .  louis .  it was at the junction of two great rivers .  .  .  . we found senloo .  it was night  but there was a dark patch in a sea of radioactivity  and dr .  shekt had said the temple was an isolated oasis of normal soil .  we dropped a flare  at least it was my mental suggestion  and there was a five pointed building below us .  it jibed with the picture i had received in the secretary   s mind .  .  .  . now there   s only a hole  a hundred feet deep  where that building was .  that happened at three in the morning .  no virus was sent out and the universe is free .      it was an animal  like howl that emerged from the secretary   s lips  the unearthly screech of a demon .  he seemed to gather for a leap  and then  collapsed .   a thin froth of saliva trickled slowly down his lower lip .      i never touched him     said schwartz softly .  then  staring thoughtfully at the fallen figure     i was back before six  but i knew i would have to wait for the deadline to pass .  balkis would have to crow .  i knew that from his mind  and it was from his own mouth  only  that i could convict him .  .  .  . now there he lies .               the best is yet to be     thirty days had passed since joseph schwartz had lifted off an airport runway on a night dedicated to galactic destruction .  with alarm bells shrilling madly behind him and orders to re .  turn burning the ether toward him .   he had not returned  not  at least  until he had destroyed the temple of senloo .   the heroism was finally made official now .  in his pocket he had the ribbon of the order of the spaceship and sun  first class .  only two others in all the galaxy had ever gotten it nonposthumously .   that was something for a retired tailor .   no one  of course  outside the most official of officialdom  knew exactly what he had done  but that didn   t matter .  some .  day  in the history books  it would all become part of a bright and indelible record .   he was walking through the quiet night now toward dr .  shekt   s house .  the city was peaceful  as peaceful as the starry glitter above .  in isolated places on earth bands of zealots still made trouble  but their leaders were dead or captive and the moderate earthmen  themselves  could take care of the rest .   the first huge convoys of normal soil were already on their way .  ennius had again made his original proposal that earth   s population be moved to another planet  but that was out .  charity was not wanted .  let earthmen have a chance to remake their own planet .  let them build once again the home of their fathers  the native world of man .  let them labor with their hands  removing the diseased soil and replacing it with healthy  seeing the green grow where all had been dead and making the desert blossom in beauty once again .   it was an enormous job  it could take a century  but what of that .  let the galaxy lend machinery  let the galaxy ship food  let the galaxy supply soil .  of their incalculable resources  it would be a trifle  and it would be repaid .   and someday  once again  the earthman would be a people among peoples  inhabiting a planet among planets  looking all humanity in the eye in dignity and equality .   schwartz   s heart pounded at the wonder of it an as he walked up the steps to the front door .  next week he left with arvardan for the great central worlds of the galaxy .  who else of his generation had ever left earth .   and momentarily he thought of the old earth  his earth .  so long dead .  so long dead .   and yet but three and a half months had passed .  .  .   he paused  his hand on the point of signaling at the door  as the words from within sounded in his mind .  how clearly he heard thoughts now  like tiny bells .   it was arvardan  of course  with more in his mind than words alone could ever handle .     pola  i   ve waited and thought  and thought and waited .  i won   t any more .  you   re coming with me .      and pola  with a mind as eager as his  yet with words of the purest reluctance  said     i couldn   t  bel .  it   s quite impossible .  my backwoods manners and bearing .  .  . i   d feel silly in those big worlds out there .  and  besides  i   m only an ear          don   t say it .  you   re my wife  that   s an .  if anyone asks what and who you are  you   re a native of earth and a citizen of the empire .  if they want further details  you   re my wife .         well  and after you make this address at trantor to your archaeological society  what next .         what next .  well  first we take a year off and see every major world in the galaxy .  we won   t skip one  even if we have to get on and off it by mail ship .  you   ll get yourself an eyeful of the galaxy and the best honeymoon that government money can buy .         and then .  .  .         and then it   s back to earth  and we   ll volunteer for the labor battalions and spend the next forty years of our lives lugging dirt to replace the radioactive areas .         now why are you going to do that .         because     there was the suspicion of a deep breath at this point in arvardan   s mind touch     i love you and it   s what you want  and because i   m a patriotic earthman and have the honorary naturalization papers to prove it .          all right .  .  .      and at this point the conversation stopped .  but  of course  the mind touches did not  and schwartz  in full satisfaction  and a little embarrassment  backed away .     he could wait .  time enough to disturb them when things had settled down further .     he waited in the street  with the cold stars burning down  a whole galaxy of them  seen and unseen .   and for himself  and the new earth  and all those millions of planets far beyond  he repeated softly once more that ancient poem that he alone now  of so many quadrillions  knew        grow old along with me .   the best is yet to be   the last of life  for which the first was made .  .  .
